YouTube but a long time it's been two
weeks I guess last week I was not there
so I'll get me a wife I'm live and yes I
think I'm live okay so this is my third
attempt to go live in last five minutes
the first time there was some problem
with the orientation the second time it
was I was not set for the live and then
this is my third attempt so that's great
to be God how many people watching this
okay hold on let me just verify if life
control room yeah
okay so we got 35 people watching this
and two likes that's great
okay so and we got lots of questions so
before starting with the QA session and
now technically this is not a QA session
this is my interaction with you after a
long time and will also deal with some
questions or answers I and again it is
not practically possible to answer all
your questions right so we get into the
chat window itself I got so many
questions now it is not possible for me
to answer all the questions but I will
try it once as soon as much as possible
okay so we got 64 people watching this
that's great that's a good number and so
yeah I'm going live after two weeks now
and in this last two weeks I got lots of
subscribers so if you are new
subscribers so welcome with ice colonics
everyone and I hope you are enjoying
this enjoying my videos ok so here we go
ok so let me remove some of the some
some ok some people are getting blocked
as soon as possible ok great so let me
start with my beak so last two weeks I
was I was bit busy with one of the
training and and one of the projects so
while doing those two things it was not
possible for me to upload videos or to
go live
especially upload videos because I used
to come late at night
and I was having some other project to
work on so I was a bit busy so I was not
able to make videos but soon after 10th
September I'm getting available so I'll
making lots of videos so lots of videos
are on the way and with lot of new
content so yeah that's my update and let
me see questions and okay so big boss
says hello and Perez says hi everyone
says hi yeah Pankaj thought attempt okay
what else so question from Yosh
ivy life is it everything is working
properly I can't see because I've got
only 70 to 71 people watching this and
26 likes only that like number is not
going up what's wrong okay maybe
something wrong with the YouTube
algorithm and now okay so yeah so okay
first question can I learn C++ along
Java okay now normally the question
would be can I learn Java along with C++
we would normally what that's what
people do right we learn C programming
first then we go for C++ and then then
then we learn Java right but can we
learn together yes you can if you have a
foundation of C language that means if
you know how programming works then you
can of course you can learn Java sample
that you can learn Java and C++
simultaneously that's possible right
in fact we without you want C++ you can
learn Java the only problem is when you
learn two technologies together when you
learn two different languages that's
where the confusion starts you know Java
is saying something else C++ say
something as example in C++ we can have
multiple inheritance write in Java we
cannot have that in C++ we create object
using class name and the reference name
right to do do so that is your thing but
in Java we use new keywords so if you
are doing two things simultaneously it
may you may get confused right that's
one thing okay so now we'll say is happy
evening sir
good evening Rahul okay so
good to see you same here after a long
time I can't see you and unfortunately
but I can see your comments there okay
so question from Josh we said is it
possible to learn coding after 25 of
course you can i in fact when I when I
was taking online training in my batches
online training batches there was some
people they were around I think I'm
having an age of approximately 35 40 and
they were learning programming so of
course you can write coding is one of
the thing you can learn any time so it's
like a hobby you know you can you can
have a it's like a new skill learning
like a learning guitar learn to dance
the same thing you have learnt to code
right you can do it you can learn it at
any time doesn't matter okay so next
question how do you prepare for je e
main and advance I'm not sure I'm not
sure about that okay so okay so question
from mo cage or Marx Marx Mahajan hello
so what should be approached what should
be the approach of becoming a successful
Android developer I would say to be a
successful Android developer you have to
make apps you have to prove yourself
right so first learn basics of Android
how Android works learn learn to make
small apps now once you are done with
that make big applications so convert
your ideas into implementations right so
the more implementation projects you
have with you you can become more
successful right so yeah ideas are
important right then you should have
good ideas but then what is the
advantage of having an idea if you
cannot implement that so I would say if
you have an idea in your mind also
implement that that's important and
that's how you can become successful
developer okay so Babu Cabasa is finally
all set yes finally it's all set
bunkered says I want to thank you hats
off to you oh thank you so much fun
catch and oh that's great so I use
Shea's where were you oh I say I was
busy with one of the training so I'm
currently I'm doing a training in one of
the big company I cannot name that
company here but then so the thing is
they have there
Coulomb their own set of things which
are very different from normal cleanings
so I have to be been busy there I have
to know work around some stuff I'm also
busy with one of the projects so you
know that's where I was not able to
upload videos but then 10 September guys
after 10 September are we making lots of
videos 15 years more right so in fact I
started with key tutorials I started
with one of the places which one which
one was that to get and okay so what
about the training whatever the latest
was I am I will be containing those with
this playlist after 10 September ok so
Bobby says I want to learn spring and
hibernate ok spring in hibernate
I do have videos on spring and hibernate
on Jeju but then those are not
completely complete what you save
playlists more videos will be coming
especially on high especially on spring
because hibernate I feel it's enough but
spring yes I'll be uploading more videos
ok so in fact much one more thing if you
want to really want to learn spring I do
live session as well so you can join the
live batch the next batch is going to
start from 12 September you can check it
out so you can just go to my website
that is correct common fact I forgot to
mention my website was down for 1 V can
you imagine the entire website the
application the Android application was
down for 1 week and today I got a chance
to you know debug those things and now
it is up so that is calm is up as of now
I don't know some what is going wrong
with the website so yeah it is up now so
the updates will be coming on those
calms I can just search for online
courses and you will find it ok next one
next one oh I lost all the questions
very well was where was I ok next
question
okay one year for interview suggest me
okay hold on okay we got oh we got a
super chart here okay if you don't know
what is supercharge everyone it is if
you want to be on first as your comment
you can go for a super chat and I got a
super chat from crispy creamy and say
thank you for everything you do so thank
you so much that's one way of
contributing this this channel right it
shows me so this chat window shows me
100 rupees that's great
this is the first time I got a super
chat that's great I heard about it thank
you so much for what a name it's crispy
crispy creamy great okay so so can you
tell me about Python oh one other thing
is almost awesome language if you really
want to learn programming Python is a
way you can go for in fact I get this
question a lot of time you know which is
the first language to start because the
lots of people they want to learn
programming but then can they start with
Java of course they can but then you
know Java is bit difficult to understand
for beginners right so one of the
language you can say you can go for is C
Python or JavaScript right so if you
learn Python it's scripting language we
you will love it see because you know C
is the mother of all the languages in
future if you want to learn Java C++ C
will of course will help you JavaScript
because you know you can actually build
something is in JavaScript at the start
itself so yeah whether it's a good
language to start with but then can you
expect videos of Python from me of
course not as of now okay so what just
says you're brilliant sir or thank you
so much once you say so will you start
internship as of now no even if I start
internship it will be in one December as
of now I'm not looking for any interns
for okay so difference between j2ee and
advanced Java so yeah this is a terrific
this is what you say interesting
question you know because Java has to so
especially in a new syllabus he will be
having koja white one Java right
and the moment you get into industry
they say j2se and j2e so that was our
main difference so kochava means the
language fundamentals you know the
language for loop while loop if
condition how to create a statement all
those things comes under code Java right
even your collection API thread so those
are for your core Java but the moment to
talk about advanced part let's say you
have solid JSP you can make enterprise
interface application using EJB spring
hibernate these are part of Java EE
which is Enterprise Edition so at some
level at once Java is is j2ee serbia
that's that's what it is okay how Co
Java is important in future very
important doesn't matter what you do in
future guys you need to be good with Co
Java right it doesn't matter you know
even if you want to be a tester you
should be good with Co Java okay so okay
next one so please tell me sidak is the
best option for future career you can
try it out I heard about see like a lot
so you can try it out of course I can
try it out what should be the approach
okay with this is done what did you mean
oh so question from Jabbar Stein what is
the difference between hibernate and
spring hmm so hibernate is basically
used to work with database you know so
let's say if you have if you have a Java
object here and if you have a database
how you will save this object into
database so normally what we do is we
use JDBC right so using JDBC you can
fetch one one value from the it object
and you can store that you know in the
database so it so using SQL query but
what if you have an object and you can
simply save that object into database
directly that could be done using
hibernate but how exactly it works so
search form I have introduced and do
watch those videos next question spring
so spring is basically it's a framework
for web for Java development so it
provides you feature like dependency
injection if the Vice of each other
expelling MVC you can build an
application using Spring Framework
so those are two different things
cuz I cannot explain you everything now
but those are two different things in
fact you can work split spring and
hibernate together right something I was
putting bottom is there so I do have
videos on all these things on YouTube so
do search for that and you will get the
idea
okay so budget says I want to use Linux
or Windows what is your suggestions
start using it okay so if you are new to
linen so I would suggest you to install
Ubuntu and that's how you can go so
install Ubuntu and start using it
because see no one can teach you how to
use Linux you know it's it's all depend
upon you how how well you use it so the
more you use it the more you will love
it okay so I can see one one five people
are watching this and only 60 likes come
on you guys if you are enjoying this
type of session do click on the like
button there you know it motivates me so
next question I know just do you mad
okay so this is for someone else okay
okay so Pankaj say is you're currently
working with any companies yes actually
I am
I cannot name those companies but then
yes I am working with another company on
contact basis now so yeah so busy with
some stuff okay so next question from
Scheck Abraham what about the disco Pro
is it that is cunning enough yeah so I
was supposed to start with telescope Pro
because see what happens you know
okay I'm explaining this a lot of time
let me try this once again when I was
making videos with ideas for learnings
you know ah the set of subscribers which
I have on the on this channel is they
are very specific they are here to learn
something specific right they want to
learn about Java they want to learn
about C programming they want to learn
about masculine
so people who are here to learn Java
they don't want to learn anything else
right because or they don't want to
learn anything very specific example if
I talk about maybe maybe JIRA or maybe
Atlassian products the problem is they
might not like it right so these are
very specialized tools and you feel a
big now and if I talk about JIRA here
you will get confused right you are
starting with Java now I certainly I'm
talking about something big so just to
simplify that what I thought okay I will
upload all the text say or
Denisha technologies on telescope row
and all genetic knowledge and that is
the learnings but then there's something
went wrong with the iscope row and the
channel is terminated so I'm considering
with a disco learning as of now I might
create another channel size couple of in
future again because I'm busy now as of
now so I can ought to work with those
things but your third is called Pro
we'll be back soon okay so best
programming language for web development
a good question yes so yes us which is
the best volume language of web
development I would say you can go with
so if you want to make if you want to
start working on it go for PHP damn easy
to learn Daniel easy to implement and
that damn is it to deploy but then if
you're talking about enterprise boil
they will prefer Java if you are Java
all ASP so I would suggest to start with
PHP as of now if you are a freelancer if
you want to learn web development start
with PHP because you can jump to Java
world anytime right so once you join a
company or you feel if you choose to
learn Java you can do that but if you
are sure that if you want to go for Java
development in future or if you want to
get into enterprise boy of course go for
Java so learn JSP servlet and you're
good to go ok so my name is thing is I
want to start at assigns where should I
start from I'm not sure about data
science and all the stuff what about
such it should go to Coursera it's one
of the awesome website you can learn we
have Coursera we have udemy
all of those things we have Udacity
right you can go there and even search
for tutorials and you will find it good
on YouTube we have one of the person
college cheetah are not sightsee Raj
sadhana search for Suraj AI
heap heap he do lots of videos on data
science and those stuff so you can try
it out ok so next one next one next one
so how much time we have been here half
an hour let me check
ok oh it's been only 20 10 minutes we've
been out here often a half an hour I'm
doing this up a long time right so I'm
feeling tired as I mean
self okay so okay my son says happy to
see you again I was same here happy to
be back on YouTube
ants in front of camera you know last
two weeks I was facing a classroom
training so I was missing my camera
there I was missing this screen there
but now I'm I'm feeling happy back on
YouTube so okay so Rika says I have been
trained in Java by company but have
worked only a few months in Java I'm
going to Big Data training or - great I
want to switch which when you switch
which technology should I focus more why
not you why are not continuing with big
data I mean of course you have
experience in Java right it's the best
time you can learn Big Data because it
is booming right
so learn big data in a tube and you are
good to go why you want to switch
technologies if I were you I would never
never switch to other technologies other
than Big Data
okay so such an says hi sir have joined
a new company and I'm working in Java
please tell me what are the areas I can
explore oh you are walking on Java the
natural spring framework explore a REST
API in spring itself we have lots of
modules like spring security I would try
I would I would like you to learn that
as well so spring is something you need
to learn now all REST API both okay so
I'm gonna say so will you please make a
video on Hadoop Hadoop is not in my list
as of as of now because are there lots
of videos I have to make and Hadoop is
way down or no way down because I have
to learn how to properly and then I can
make a video okay next okay so my son
says your accent is great okay I would
play I hope that is not a sarcasm but
thanks so much
okay so we know it says your videos are
excellent or thank you so much we note
okay sighs Shweta
but now XA is so we can do coding but
first we have to get the logic so how do
we get this logic okay I mean there are
multiple ways of building logic okay is
the
one is trying to learn lots of
algorithms and try to implement this
algorithm by yourself so take an
algorithm and implement the algorithm by
yourself that's the first way the second
way is make some projects you know have
some client requirement and make the
project because the more you work on the
project it will improve your logical
power it will change the way you think
and I also feel you know it's not just
logic and programming it's also about
the way you think how can we solve a
given problem because see to solve one
particular problem we have multiple ways
right there may have multiple algorithms
you have to select the best one okay
okay the Bartek no idea so I'm skipping
that question okay how do I do okay
people want to do videos for me I don't
know why okay next question okay so so
they say sir is it enough to learn one
language for getting a job in google
amazon okay to get into big companies
like this you have to be good with
algorithms you have to be you have to be
very good with data structures in fact
if you go for the interviews there they
will not ask you for which programming
language you know they will ask you for
data structures they will ask you for
the data response that they will ask you
for networking concepts Oh
knowing the programming language is
important but then with that you have to
also learn about it uh structures SQL
queries networking concepts I would X I
would yeah letting one language is
enough right you can learn any language
in I mean from start to end but also
learn about data structure than all
those stuff that's I will get a job okay
next question
Pawan Kumar says you know science okay
everyone is talking about it a science
what's wrong with you people
that's good you're entering interest but
then I'm not good in that I'm not going
to data science okay
okay so now say is one year left for
interview subject me what topic or so a
time table please time table even I
don't follow any time table I learn
whenever I get time so you have to make
sure that you spend most of your time in
learning this also enjoy life
cause if you sit from from I mean
morning till evening on working on
something on reading you you will be
getting very bored with your life okay
so to make your learning effective also
take some breaks so when I say when you
make a timetable make sure that you take
you make a tank you you learn for two
hours and take a fifteen half an hour
break do something that you love play
games watch movies cook if you'll if you
love cooking cook so do something and
that's how you make a timetable but then
what topic to concentrate on I would say
improve your aptitude skills
communication skills right that's
important because when you go for the
interviews they will they will check
your communication skills right
when I say communication skills it's not
just English it's about how can you
transmit or how can you send that
knowledge from yardie from your brain to
someone else brain that's what is
communication is so yeah input of that
okay next I can see we got 164 people
watching that's great that's one of the
benchmark we have but only one one three
likes come on guys if you have just
joined the session do click on the like
button
oh okay so next question okay we got
dish aunt and dish aunt is sending
something is it Piper you talking about
this Shawn or cause not sure okay so I
also Adam says I think react is grab our
Java from Android and Supra - not
exactly see other thing is I don't
believe in Facebook technologies you
know the moment Facebook comes with new
technology I never believed on Facebook
technologies I'm a big fan of Google
so yes Facebook is doing Facebook is
been in lots of stuff one of the one of
the thing is like react I'm not wrong if
Facebook is I mean react is from
Facebook it's good of as of now but then
with a new version see you know every
time you get new updates on iOS and you
updates on Android you may not expect to
have new libraries for the act as well
if it is there it's good but yes people
are moving to react as well so you can
try it out so the last five minutes I
can all be all the
like next week as well so from this week
I am going live on every Sunday only the
last week I am missed but then I'll be
going live every Sunday now because I
can see there are lots of questions I
cannot answer all the questions now
right so it's been more than 15 minutes
now so that's it I just wanted to say
everyone hi and I can see there are lots
of questions sorry I cannot answer you
all your questions now so what you can
do is so once this session gets over in
the coming such coming section right
then your question in the next live
session I will try to answer those
questions first because you will get the
priority right so if you have any
questions once this session gets over
