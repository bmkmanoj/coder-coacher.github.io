30 school earnings and in this video
we'll talk about pointers in C so we
have already talked about different
features of C right we talked about
functions ad is now in this video we
have something else pointers now
pointers are there in C and C++ and the
concept remains same doesn't matter
which language you prefer maybe C or C++
why pointers are pointers so what we'll
do here is we'll try to understand why
we require pointers at the first place
you know if we talk about C language it
is there from 1969 right so just imagine
it's been around 40 years we have
pointers right so if you talk about this
language C it's there for a long time
right so at that time creating a
software or creating a creating of code
was more towards hardware so ways to you
we used to work with the hardware chips
and then now also we work with hardware
chips but we write a code for that
specific hardware that time and now B we
have language like Java and c-sharp
which works on software level right
example a Java is platform independent
because it works on software in fact
c-sharp works on framework but if you
talk about c and c plus because they
still work on the typical hardware boy
so we are more towards the hardware so
if when you put it a variable so let's
say you want to store some data so let's
say normally how we create variable we
simply say it is int i and then we save
a value which is 5 right so what it does
it will create a block it will create a
block inside your memory ok and which
will have a typical address let's say
the address is 1 0 1 it's not exactly 1
0 1 must imagine which is 1 0 1 and then
the name of this variable is I and the
value of this is 5 right so we have this
variable here which is the value of I is
5 here now what if instead of using a
variable name can be used a memory
address directly so what I mean by that
we have a memory address here which is 1
2 0 1 can be accessed this directly
without using the variable name and the
answer is yes then at that time we have
to use pointers so what pointer will do
is it will directly is related to this
address so the name is not
the daily doesn't matter what matters is
this address right so that is possibly
the help of pointers now how to get the
address so let's say we have a variable
which is I we have to first fetch the
address of I and how to fetch the
address so we can use ampersand sign
there so we can use ampersand to face
the address and we can create a variable
which is pointer variable and then we
can say P equal to ampersand I so the
address of I will be will be inside P
now now you will say what's the
advantage of this various pointer to
access your memory it may increase the
speed of your software it may make your
code more efficient right it is not
recommended that you should use pointers
everywhere because it will make your
code more complex because whenever you
write a code right so when you write a
code you have to make sure that your
colleagues your your your young your
colleagues which will be working on your
software will know what you have done so
you have to make sure that your software
is understandable your code is
understandable right so try to avoid
pointers whenever you possible but if
you want to optimize your software when
you want to make your code move faster
if you want to manage your memory better
you should use pointers right so we have
a pointer here nothing question is how
to create a pointer so to be the pointer
it's again we have to use a neater type
which is let's say int and then we can
provide a star here so star is used to
refer to the pointers right so we can
say star P and then we can give a
semicolon here okay so we can provide a
semicolon
so if I say star P star P and if I say P
equal to ampersand I what I will get
here is the address of I which is 1 0 1
so the value of P now is 1 0 1 so what
if if I write print F and if I give
person D and if I say this is let's say
what if I print I so if I print the
value of I the output I will be getting
is 5 right so that's the output I am
getting here but if I say printf person
D and if I print P now the output of P
so what will happen as soon as you
create a variable which is pointer it
will create a new box okay
and that box will also have a nitrous
let's say the address of this is to not
5 that's the address of that box right
so this is the address this is the
address the value of this P so the
variable name is P here the value of P
will be the address of I so this value
will be inside this so it will be 1 0 1
ok so if I try to print the value of P
it will print 1 0 1 which is the address
of I okay sounds good so that's the
address of I here
and now if it's not visible there let me
just write write address of I okay now
next so let's say if I say one more
printf here its printf and if I say
person D now if I print star P now if I
write star P which is point of P it will
fetch it will print the value which is 5
okay so it will print the value of I and
which is the value of address of value
of P what it means
so as soon as we write start page we'll
go to the start P it will check okay the
value of start page 1 0 1 it will fetch
that value it will search for the
address with 1 not 1 which is this and
then it will face the value of the
address which is 5 okay so if I write
stop it will print the output as 5 so we
have this 3 statement if I print I if I
will get 5 if I print P I will get 1 not
1 which is the address of I and if I put
install it will print the value of I
sounds good so that's how you have to
use pointers okay now the main intention
of this of using this pointers is you
can you can create an array okay because
if you talk about array in C programming
the size of your arrays fixed right but
using pointers you can create a dynamic
array which can where you can expand the
size of an array right we can also
create a string using pointers we can we
can read a file which is stored on your
hard drive using pointers I can will see
that how to do those things in the
of other tutorials okay something what
about this oh okay let me ask you a
question what will happen if I say print
F and if I say person D 25.9% I so am
person I will give you output which is 1
0 1 so the value of ampersand is same as
P right because ampersand I will give
you the the address and even P will give
you the address right so that's the
pointers with int variables now let's
let's walk which or character variable
so that's incredible let's work with
character let's see what what happens
with character so if I say we have a
character variable which is cash say let
me change my mark oh it's not walking OH
is it working okay so let me okay so I
have a character variable you and the
variable name is let's say Katzie okay
and the value of Cassie here is let's
say a so have this value which is a now
I want to create a pointer for this now
the question is the type of the pointer
because anyway if you creating a pointer
let's say the pointer name is P okay and
let me just use this space here so if a
pointer name is P and if I create a box
it will have its own address which is 2
not 1 maybe and I have one more variable
which is C here so which is C and the
value of C is a and the address of your
a is 1 not 1 right of course your
address will be in integer then kasha
rice what should the type of P here
because the the value of P will be 1 0 1
right so you are storing the address of
C so if I create P ampersand or P equal
to ampersand C so we are storing the
address of scenes pin P right so watch
the type of P and the answer is the the
type of your pointer should be same as
the type of your character or the type
of your value so if your value type is a
character your pointer type should also
be a character does not matter what
value you have inside P what matters is
the value of the type of the value which
is inside
address what not one okay so if you have
a variable int so the pointer will be
ain't if you have a variable CAD so the
pointer will be care so that's how we
can work with pointers okay in the next
video we'll talk about how to use
pointers of us we will try to cover this
with the help of practical and then
after that we'll talk about pointers
with arrays and after that we'll talk
about pointers with two-dimensional
areas okay so that's it that's it from
this video thank you so much for
