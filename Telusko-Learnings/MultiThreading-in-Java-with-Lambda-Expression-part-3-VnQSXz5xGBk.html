part of the tutorial for multi-threading
so in last rail we have seen how to
create two threads one using a thread
class by showing a third class and one
using our unable interface so in general
we have 2/3 again you can see we have 2
starts so indirectly that it's getting
too late right now now we'll do some
modification in this code to just may
make our code more efficient or more we
can reduce the number of lines acquired
I say this I'll tell you one thing if
you talk about this are how many times
we're using this reference to the
requirement for any type of reference
where an object is so that our in in
future if you want to use this are you
can use it but here you can see this are
we are using only once right that means
we can use this line here this is your
object so what I can do is I can just
cut this code and paste it here it will
still work it's because we just want to
pass an object because thread
constructor will ask you for object of
the new interface or you can say
instance of anybody interface and
they've done it right so we have we have
defined a very defined object here which
is declared a variable object and then
we are providing the implementation for
this so this is an enormous object and
this is an honest class that means we
can do the same thing using this concept
also and Knifer on this the output will
be still same they're getting the same
output right we have hi hello hi hello
and all those parallel processing now so
does the does the advantage of using
anonymous class but since the
introduction of Java 8 we have something
else lambda expression no dance the
that's the beauty of Java in every new
version we have something to next flow
and this now not thing about this you're
ready class will always ask you for
object of relevant
that means anything in this packet
anything is in this bracket which is
defined in this invisible will be an
object or anything so why wait to
specify that why wait to specify this
whenever interface now so that means I
don't require this line so let's drop
this time since then I move that bracket
we have to remove this bracket also now
now the next part is why I required this
one method since you're the Nibin
interface is a function interface or you
can also call as s a.m. which stands for
single abstract metal interface that
means in runnable we have only one
method which is declared in this
scenario don't have to mention the metal
name that means we just have to mention
the number of private it will accept not
the actual function alright so we can
remove this part also now what we are
remaining with is adjust meaning with
this and this package will give this
back it's here and we remain remaining
with this code but to specify this code
belongs to I'll run interference
we just have to use a symbol called as
atom and this is your lambda expression
right we have replaced the whole goal
which is boilerplate codes which is
extra coded with this lambda expression
and that's the beauty of Java that's the
beauty of Java 8 lambda expression all
right so we can convert our cohort from
the huge chunk of lines into some
smaller code again you can reduce the
number of lines also here we can just
say open the bracket here close my
bracket here and then I can write
everything there it makes your code
looks very simple look it makes your
code look beautiful again it's not
difficult it is not difficult and since
you're saying for the first time maybe
you will find some pretty nice here but
it's not difficult if you have a good
knowledge of lambda expression this is
amazing
so America my recommendation will be go
to some books whatever expression or go
to some videos of Revelation
maybe in the future I will start with
the basics of Mavericks mission but for
this tutorials I've shown you how to
work with threads from a normal thread
to a lambda expression now maybe in
future and future tutorials we'll have
some advanced pattern threads maybe
about concurrency or all those things so
I hope you got a basic general idea
about threads now again if you like my
video do subscribe and if you have any
comments please thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
