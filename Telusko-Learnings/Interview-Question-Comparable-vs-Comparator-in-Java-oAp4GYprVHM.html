and in this video we will see the
difference between comparator and
compatible when to use comparator went
to is compatible so let's get started
now what we'll do here is first of all
let's create a list of values normally
when you want to use comparator
compatible this is where you will be
using it so let's create a list of
values and I will say I want to create a
list of laptops now can we do that say
yes we can do that we can get a list of
laptop provided you have a laptop class
and you can see we do have it here now
we don't have any variables here let me
create some variables I would say
private int the first one would be
laptop let's say let's let's name it as
laptop brand and then the next one would
be I want to create a amount of RAM it
has and then I want to create I want to
make one more variable which is price
again we can have some more variables
but then this is enough so we got to
brand the god ram and record price now
here i want to assign a getters and
setters for this i will say right like
generates organisators and said all the
variables click on ok now once we go
again who does let me also use or to
show me those I would say sews to string
and regard all these things now once we
got a laptop here that's cool right
let's go back to run now if I say least
of laptops and if I say labs here equal
to your new added least and if I say
okay we got a least right and let me
input the package for at least and we
got it here okay so we got a list of
laptops you know whatever would be I
want a constructor to assign the values
I would say right click and say Souls
I want a constructor with field so I
will say select all click on OK let me
add some laptops I would say labs dot
add I want to add the first laptop by
saying new laptop and here I want to
pass those values so the first thing I
have to pass is the laptop brand name so
I would say the brand is Dell and I want
to price specify the RAM amount of RAM
it has well it's a 16gb and the price is
let's say $800 okay so we got the first
laptop here let's go for one more I will
say lab start add it's a new laptop and
this laptop let's say this is Apple and
I want to say this has let's say a GB
RAM but the cost is let's say $200
because as you know Apple machines are
costly and I
say laps dot add one more will say new
laptop and we got let's say this is ASA
and ASA also has let's say - L GB RAM
the cost of ASA is let's say $700 okay
so we got these three laptops here right
and now what am I do is I want to sort
them now basically when you anyway you
have a list of integers when you have
lists of string we can very easily sort
those values by saying we we have a
class for less connections connections
dot sort in which you just have to pass
a list it will work so if you pass laps
I mean if you especially if you have a
list of integers then it will perfectly
work but in this case you can see it is
not working so list of integers will
work list of string will work but least
of laptops is not working what this sort
will do is his sort will sort the values
based on some parameter right example
let's say if you pass five values and if
you say hey sort it now your Java
framework is smart enough or do
collation framework is smart enough to
know that when you say sort numbers you
have to sort them in ascending or
ascending order
but in this case how do you sort this
laptop ascending order on which
parameter you want to sort maybe you
want to sort based on the brand name
maybe you want to sort based on the RAM
maybe you want to sort based on the
price we have not specified the
parameter here right and that's why this
will not work so I will just click on
sort
so you can see if you are aware our
genrich's so what it's saying is it will
take only those things which are
comparable so this sort method will
accept only those things which are
compatible now what it is so if you want
to sort your laptop you need to
implement a interface called as
compatible otherwise it will not work so
the best thing you have to do is you
have to implement our interface called
is compatible and that's where now you
can sort them can see that it is gone so
when you say you want to pass at least
you have to make sure that whatever
least you have all the values in them
are compatible and the way you do that
is by implementing compatible now you
can specify a logic so you can have your
own logic here by specifying what
parameter you have to compare this and
to implement that we have to implement
or method which is compared to so
compatible interface has this mythical
as compared to and let's say this takes
laptop object I would say laptop - so
this is a laptop - up
now what happens is this will sort right
so this sort method will sort all the
all the laptops but the concern here is
which sorting technique is implement
doesn't matter and that's the power of
Java right the object unit programming
you're not concerned about the
implementation what you're concerned
about is we are getting the output now
when you say is sought
internally it will try to swap values so
if you have seen all the sorting
techniques in algorithms you must have
seen that right it's all about going to
swap and when not to swear so here in
the compact - we just have to specify
when to swap and when not to swap so
basically you'll be comparing two
objects and by comparing those two
objects you will specify when to swap
and not to swap but here the problem is
you are passing only one object right
how can you pass two objects the thing
is come back to is a method of laptop
class so for sure to call compare to
method you need one object so that means
by default you have an object which is
calling compared to and you also have
one more object which is getting passed
so in total there are two objects which
are acting here the first object which
is calling this method the second object
which you are passing it here now how do
we access an object which you are
calling so let's say if you are using an
object lap one and by using lap one
object you're calling compared to how do
we access that object here so basically
we use our this keyword to access that
right so we can refer that to the above
this keyword and then the second objects
laptop now how do you compare these two
objects so compared to says you just
returned me some values it may be a
positive value or a negative value or
zero now when to return what so if you
think the first object is thick is
greater than the second object you
return positive number if the first
object is less than the second object
you return a negative number and if the
first object and the second object are
same then you return zero so what I mean
by that is if you say a valid in comment
I will say this if this first object is
greater than the second object now based
on whatever parameter you want so in
that case you will return you will
return a positive value so I will say
plus if the first object is less than
the second object you return a negative
value and if the first object
is equal to
the second object you return zero now
how do we implement this see it's very
simple you simply say if if this okay
now we own which parameter you want to
sort so when I say I want to sort
laptops I want to sort them based on the
RAM so the first laptop will have the
least RAM and the last laptop will have
the highest RAM in that case you will
say this dot Ram or maybe get Ram is
greater than lab two dot get Ram in this
case you will return a positive value
this positon bur can be anything we can
say 356 you can use any positive value
but why do you specify such a big number
okay 256 is just a random number you can
also specify one or you can specify 250
you can specify 500 doesn't matter any
positive number so I will say +1 and
else you will say return -1 you can also
verify if this dot get ram is equal to
equal to lab 2 dot get ram you can
return 0 if there if they are equal but
then that's fine this should work so we
are comparing it right now let's correct
it on now let's verify if they are
sorting it but how do we know that they
are sorted - let me just print the
entire collection here I will use our
enhance for dr. Parenti collection so I
would say laptop L :
labs and then I will print one by one
object I will print L let's verify if it
is working let's run this code and you
can see that we got the output and all
the laptops are sorted based on the RAM
we got 8 12 and 16 it's that simple so
what you do is if you want to sort a
collection of values or list of values
what you do is you implement a
comparable interface so every class need
to have a compatible if you want to sort
them so this is perfect okay that's
about compatible ok I hope you enjoyed
you understood what is compatible but
now the next point is what is competitor
and why do we need competitive and you
have compatible now we will be using
comparator in two's to situation the
first situation is what if you got a
class and this class is not implementing
any interface imagine you know the thing
which we have done here let's say if you
don't have this now what you will do in
this scenario you cannot sort the values
right then you will say ok we have to
make sure that you have those interfaces
or you
you implement that interface on you you
implement that method the point is what
you get this class from somewhere else
so maybe you are using some third-party
library and that library has this class
now of course you cannot change the
source code right you have a class file
now what you will do in that case what
you do is you so if you can say sort you
can give a comma and you can specify the
logic here see the sort method is only
concerned about the logic right so can
you pass a logic here and the answer is
yes if you can see this sort method it
takes two parameters also it takes a
least first time it takes a comparator
object so basically it takes two
parameters so you can pass one list or
you can pass two parameters that's the
first scenario well be using comparator
you can specify your logic with type of
comparator the second scenario is even
if you have this logic here so even if I
say you have implements compatible you
have this method what if I want to sort
them based on some other parameter
because by default it will be getting
sorted by on based on Graham I want
maybe I want to sort based on price then
what you will do is you will pass
compared again so let me pass a laptop
object and let's give a comma and here
we have to pass an object of comparator
and the way you do that is by saying
compare comparator so you will use
compiler interface and I will say this
comparator is working with laptop I
would say comparator kumkum equal to new
comparator
now basically comparator is an interface
so of course we cannot directly get
object of that right so we have to
define the class here it's this is
basically anonymous in the class if
you're not if you're if you don't know
what is anonymous in the class you can
watch one of my video on anonymous inner
class I do have a video on that so this
is where this is how you instantiate the
interface by creating a class enormous
in a class here now which method we have
to define so if I go back on the in the
comparator you can see the method name
or medium the method it has is compare
method name is compare so I will say
public in compared and this compare
takes two parameters if you can see here
it takes two parameters so I would say
it is laptop l1 comma
laptop l2 so basically we got two
laptops here now in the case of
compatible we were comparing with this
right the current object and lapto but
in this case we have those two objects
itself
amita so what you will do you you will
just say Museum logics if the first
object is greater than so I will say if
L 1 dot get rise is greater than L 2 dot
get price you will return a positive
value
I will return 1 else return 0 so now we
we are having our own logic just pass a
comparator object here your job is done
so now it will sort the values but based
on the prize so if you're in this code
you can see oh it's not working
something went wrong oh sorry I just
made a mistake here it should be minus 1
a negative value right and let's run
this code now and you see that we got
700 800 and 1,200 it's that simple so
when you will use a comparator when you
have a class which is not implementing
an interface example if I even if I
remove this now we don't need compatible
if you're using comparator so let's go
back to runner and you can see it is it
will get it will get sorted because we
are passing a logic so when we use
comparator to situation first when your
class is not implementing compatible and
second situation is when you want to
change the logic or when you want to
change the way it sorts the value now
you want to thinking when we were
sorting the list of integers it was
walking because integer class so all the
classes in Java you know the integer
class if you click on integer integer
class you can see that it implements
compatible if you talk about string
class even string class implements
compatible so all the inbuilt classes
which we use where we store values they
all implements compatible but by default
if you sort those values they will have
their own logic what if you want to have
your logic then in that case you will
use comparator so I hope you understood
some difference between compatible and
comparator if you have any more
questions on this let me know in the
comment section and I hope you like this
