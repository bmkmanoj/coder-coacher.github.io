in iTunes right so we have talked about
a single level we have talked about
multi-level and I also say that in Java
Java doesn't support multiple
inheritance now I exactly doesn't
support so let's let's say we have a
Class C okay so we have a Class C here
and in this class C we have a method
palace we don't have any method let's
say and in your main methods to
somewhere in your main method you have
you're creating an object of C so when
you say C obj equal to nu C now what
will happen is it will create the audit
of C that's perfect but when you try to
call OB did not show but unfortunately
we don't have a show method in in C
right
so it will give you the error which is
compile time error that we don't have a
show method there so what with radius
will say we have one more class which is
Class A and now your class C extends
Class A so will it work now again the
problem is show method is not dead in
your C class and it is not even dead in
a class so it will give you error let's
say we have Class B and now you are
trying to say Class C extends class a
comma B I mean imagine if it is possible
in Java when you can have one class with
exchange two classes a and B so now if
you say oh we do not show and if you if
you see you don't have shown with
anywhere right now if we have show
method in B so it will try to fetch it
will try to call this show method of B
because we don't have shown in C so it
will try to call the show of B but what
if you have show in a and in big boat so
you have a method show in a class and in
big class in both the classes and now
when you're getting calls it up C here
so we know creating object of C here and
your call trying to call show which show
it will call so that's a real confusion
right and this type of problem is called
as AM be guilty problem so this is
called as ambiguity problem and to solve
this problem Java says okay to solve
this problem what we'll do is let's
remove the concept of multiple inherited
Java doesn't support
people in height is directly so it does
but ties we'll see later how it supports
indirectly but using classes you cannot
achieve multiple inheritance simple
right so yeah that's it about this video
we've talked about multiple editors
let's talk about something else now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
