reading on political earnings and in
this video we'll talk about exceptions
either way when it comes to programming
we are concerned about others I normally
we need to solve
we don't expect output we expect other
side so whenever you write the first
code for C programming maybe if you're
learning Java if you are learning any
language the first concern you have is
others right if you write a code the
first thing you see is an error right
example if you have we can you know when
you declare a variable but when you
don't declare a variable and you try to
use it when you when you perform all
those actions you get errors but in Java
we have different types of errors right
so if we talk about errors we have two
things here we have errors and
exceptions okay so we have two different
things so we have errors and we have
exceptions so basically what happens is
when you write a software there might be
lots of four different kinds of
exceptions are example you are trying to
open a file and file isn't exist right
so there is an exception you are asking
for the input from the user and user is
not giving the giving you the input so
that's an exception you are trying to
you are trying to run a process but CPU
is not available so as an exception you
are trying to divide a number by zero
and that's an exception right so there
are different kinds of exceptions so
normally this exception is you know if
they have a tree here for the exception
so the main class is the thurible class
you can see that on the top so so if you
talk about the exception hierarchy so
the main class is throwable okay that's
a catch here normally what happens is
whenever you have a able at the end
example cloneable
closeable then we have what serializable
so all this able their interfaces but
here this flowable is not interface it's
a class okay so the subclass of
throwable is exception okay so in fact
we have two we have exception and errors
so difference between exception and
errors are so exception we can handle as
a user as a programmer we can handle the
exception what about errors we cannot
handle errors example your JVM is not
working properly what you can do for
that nothing right maybe your you have
your ram is going out of memory you
cannot do anything for that right so
others you cannot
what about exceptions exceptions are
something you can handle right now in
exception we have two different types
again one is a checked exception and
then we have unchecked exceptions again
we'll talk about that later but we have
two things we have checked and we have
unchecked right so let's let's let's
talk about what exactly exception means
first and then we'll discuss what is
checked and unchecked whether we talk
about the software or when you talk
about any code you know when you when
you buy a software there are lots of
statements why so this statement can be
initialization statement there can be
some operations there may be class
definition by the definition there are
different type of state statements right
so we can classify these statements in
two types the first type of statements
occurs normal statement and the second
type of statement is called as critical
statement not exactly it means a you
know when you let's say you you are
you're you're you know you have a nephew
with you a small small kid with you you
are going out somewhere okay and you are
you are sitting in a restaurant and
you're having something and you're that
kids the small kid he is running here
and that and that's okay right there
will not be any big issue because it's a
restaurant maximum what will happen is
he will fill it down and then that's
okay right so but if you are if you are
walking on highway and suddenly you're
that kid leaves your hand and running on
the highway alone and that's critical
right so you will run for learn to catch
him right so there are two route
situations one is normal situation and
second is critical situation right in
the same way in your software when you
write a code we have to double
statements normal statement where you
will not face any problem then we have
critical statement in which you may face
some problem example if I say eight I
equal to one and there is no problem
with that right we can assign a value of
1 to an integer variable that's okay so
that's normal statement but as soon as I
say 8k is equal to I divided by J now
this statement becomes critical now you
will say what what was critical in that
the thing is J the value of J might be
zero in this situation any number
divided by zero will throw an exception
right so that's a critical statement so
first you have to classify your
normal statement from political
statements okay so you can write the
normal statement in normal way but the
problem starts when you want to handle
the critical statements so whenever you
have critical statements always write
your critical statements inside a block
okay now what that block means is if
that blocks is generating any kind of
exception it's you you have to handle it
okay
then question arise how will you handle
it so for that we have to use a block
which will be called as dry block okay
so you can see here so we have this
statement inside a try block okay if you
find any exception if you find any
problem there the pointer your your
execution will go to catch and what it
means so let's say if you are if you are
right if you are returned this statement
which is i8k equal to I divided by J
where J is 0 it will throw okay it will
throw the exception so normally what
happens in Java
everything is object right so it will
create the what you say it will create
the object of exception and it will
throw the exception now you have to
catch it now how will you catch it so we
use a try block and then we use a catch
block so this cache block will catch the
exception
okay so throw a try will throw it catch
will catch it okay now there are
different kinds of exceptions right so
this is this is normal what you say this
sample we have try
we have catch okay so he are trying so
this I divide by 0 will throw an idea
term attic exception so you have to
catch an item attic exception but let's
say in your block you have another style
another type of exception which is maybe
i/o exception example if you are trying
to open a file and then the file is not
available it means well it will throw an
exception right so we acquire a catch
which will accept i/o exception but
unfortunately we have a catch here which
only takes automatic right so what we
have to do is we have to write one mode
catch so we can have one try and we can
have to catch statements one catch will
accept which which will work for
ultimately exception one catch will work
for i/o exception let's say in your blog
you have one more exception again you
have to add one more catch there but the
problem is let's say there is there is a
statement and you don't know what kind
exception equal throw now what so we can
go for a general exception well as
exception okay exception is a superclass
of all the exceptions so if we talk
about i/o exception this super classes
exception
what more automatic exception superclass
is our exception then we have array
index out of bounds exception again we
have exception so what you can do is if
you write exception it will handle
everything so what you should do is
after this these three catches you
should write at the at the end you have
to mention exception or catch with
exception okay so we can have multiple
catch with one try okay so that's how
you you mention or try with catch but
again we have some tricks here well so
once you complete this theory video this
is just a theory of that when the
practical session we'll talk about how
to handle the exception how what what
should be sequence can you can you just
write exception catch exception on the
top is it possible we will see all those
things once you see once you once you
start with all the practical stuff okay
we have one more thing let's say we can
handle the exception with with the up of
try catch right so the exception can you
have two types it can be catch or it can
be on so it can be checked or it can be
unchecked so when you say the exception
is checked it simply means that you are
allowing your user to or if you are
allowing your client to handle it okay
this so let's say if this is the way or
you this is the way you can actually you
can actually jump to the different way
if you are finding an exception okay but
let's say if you if you are if your user
cannot do anything they cannot handle
the exception make it unchecked don't
don't make it compulsory for them to
handle it okay so if they can handle it
make it check if they cannot handle it
make it unchecked make sense right so
that is checked and unchecked but let's
say we have we have three methods here
we have method a B and C okay so method
a calls method B whether B calls method
C okay in this scenario if C has an
exception so if C is throwing an
exception now we have two choice one C
himself can actually handle the
exception by using try catch or what we
can do is we can
see don't solve the exception by
yourself
send that exception to B because b is
good at handling the exceptions okay now
we have two choice B can handle the
exception using try-catch or B can throw
the exception to a now a will handle it
okay
so we can also handle the exception
using throws so throw simply means you
are sending the request about this stack
so C calls B to handle the exception B's
be asked a point of the exception so we
can also use throws keyword for that
okay in fact we can create our own
exceptions using throws keyword or throw
keyword so we have throw we have throws
we have finally so we'll discuss all
this although stuff when once we start
with the practical implementation so I
think that's it that's what is exception
is all about so make sure you watch the
practical sessions also to make the
clear understanding of it if you you can
just find the practical session in the
description in the description area so
that's it thanks for watching but do
make sure you subscribe the channel so
that you can watch more videos so that's
it thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
