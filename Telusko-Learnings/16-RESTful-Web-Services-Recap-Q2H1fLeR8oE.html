this point what we have done is we have
worked with different methods of HTTP
right we have worked with get requests
we have work with post foot and did it
and you can see we have used we also we
have also used a postman as a tool to
send a request to the server and
everything was working fine right and we
have enjoyed the video still this point
now if you observe this scenario here
what we are doing is so in terms of
recap what we are going to do now is
let's try to understand what are things
we have done for it let's do with the
get request so let's say if I use the
sense of get request and a user user
intention is to fetch all the aliens
here for that we have written this
method which returns all the aliens now
as you can see we have get aliens method
now this method will be called whenever
you request for the aliens so this path
annotation will map your request right
so which is when you request for alien
this was a map it and you can return all
the aliens but again in bitch for Mikey
returning them so we are littering them
in a nice format now you might be
thinking can you can you really send at
least format to the user because user
will be a client right it may be a
browser it may be ended application so
of course we have to convert this Java
object into some format which is
understandable or with all the
application and that's where XML and
Jason comes into picture okay but the
question arise how will it convert your
Jay Deal object into JSON format so we
don't have to worry about that
like remember in your libraries we have
added one of the dependency okay instead
of opening this we should be opening our
XML or not this XML the power maximal
files now in this table we have seen
that some dependency is using which you
can convert and luckily or we have Joe
see here now Justin says here user or
hippo gramma you just have to give the
object it is my job to convert that
object into XML format but then what if
you want Jason so for Jason we need or
one we need one more dependency which is
voxi right again we can also use Jesus
you can
Jackson if you love it but just to say
hey why you have to add extra libraries
when I can provide you those libraries
so here you think Jersey library here
but you have a choice right we can also
choose between Jason and Jackson and
also of this one which is Maki okay so
we have added these dependencies using
which you can convert your object into
either XML or JSON it's just that when
you return you have to mention what it
produced now your application says see I
can produce a JSON data or I can produce
a XML data now depend upon what our user
requests for you for user is requesting
for XML you will return XML for you for
user is requesting for Jason you will
return JSON right now that is called as
content negotiation so you are
negotiating a content with the user and
that is perfectly fine so that is about
your get request right now we also need
a post request or is that this is here's
a post request let's say if you want to
create a new alien in fact what we have
also done is we have connected this
thing we did a base-wide so if you
create a new alien that alien will be
stored in the database and to do that we
have used a repository here and in this
we have done with all the configuration
again you could have used data source
here if you have a different
implementation for database you can do
that our application is so this code
this file here is not concerned about
whatever database for you have it on
there you can also fake it in fact if
you remember the first few videos we
were faking that we have little base
wise we were using some dummy data as
any storage but now we actually have
masculine white everything was working
you know we have a post request we can
use get requests we can use put and
delete so get it so the same thing is
just that you have to change this
annotation some foot delete we have a
post and the also mentions Park now why
we read apart we have was it only
specify path here right now to get that
link example if I go to my postman and
you can see we have aliens here so if I
say I want one particular area nor if I
want a alien to be updated or if I want
it to be deleted they say I want to
delete this was your - we just have to
go here just say
delayed request insists and it will be
deleting it will get deleted vice that's
how it works
so everything was working so why I mean
what next we are going to do see we have
Josie is not the implementation right
and if you are working for a company
they take a chance that you might be
implementing Jersey or maybe some other
implementation now one of my favorite
implementation for restful Web Services
is a spring good spring the worst
because Spring Framework is a new plane
book which provides you lots of features
right if you implement spring MVC spring
code it's an awesome it's not something
booked to work with so what we are going
to do now is we will be working with the
same stuff the same get request same
post request for delayed all the same
thing with it a bit of course but with
the help of rest spring list right so we
start with spring list and let's like
let's also add the database feature but
that will be with the help of hibernate
or maybe some jba right so let's make
this more exciting let's also add
database and all those stuff but then
before going for all those things there
are some prerequisite the first
prerequisite you need to know is spring
code again it's not that difficult you
can just search my channel or you can
just go to description area and find the
finding videos for spring code those
things we all need and that's it
everything else will I will teach you
how step I will teach you everything
step by step in fact if even if you
don't know spring code that's fine
because when I explain you about those
spring cool features while in spring
rest you you will understand you would
understand all those things but you
don't have to worry about that okay
now we of course we are going for Spring
Framework right the second thing we need
is also using a different IDE now
earlier we were using Eclipse right
again you can continue with eclipse but
then it is authors by self to use
advanced one specific for spring same
work we have STS as a IDE you can see we
have HTS here SEO stands for spring tool
suite which is specially designed for
spring based application again you can
also use eclipse here okay it's your
choice but then I will go forest year
and you can also learn that right so why
don't you let's expand our knowledge box
and let's also learn HTS now
question arise from where you will
download that so I will show you the
down okay let me show you that if you go
to a browser
let's go to okay let's go to STS this is
the official it will take it off to the
side of STS which is here spring to
sweet you just have to download STS from
here there's option of all versions you
can you can click on this if you depend
upon bitch machine you use it will
automate detect your OS and it will
download that particular version for you
you don't have to worry about this so
once you click on this it will get
downloaded you have to just you just
have to unzip it and you can use it now
you might be thinking oh we are using a
new IDE now we have to learn lots of
thing you don't have to worry about that
because st of itself is based on Eclipse
Eclipse platform so if you are using s
tears internally you are using eclipse
right so let's start with that in the
next video we'll talk about the fast
code with things list so that's it from
this video if you are enjoying my
sessions do let me know in the comment
section and duplicate that like button
if you are really enjoying it thank you
so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
