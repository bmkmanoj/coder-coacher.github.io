about we'll do one thing will I will
take a number so you should have remove
all these lines so as we know we'll be
requiring CLI CL and gates use will put
it there now let's say I have a int
variable called as N and the value for n
is let's say 24 now I want to check this
24 is a even number or an odd number
that means I want to do some operations
and then depend upon the output I want
to give the answer as it is even or is
it odd number now how to check our given
number is even or odd if that number is
divided if it is divisible by two
it means it's an even number otherwise
it's odd number that means now how to
check if the number is divisible now
when you say the number is divisible by
this number the remainder will be zero
now how to get the remainder so we have
a special type of symbol called as
percentage sign also called as modulus
so this mod is used to find the
remainder now what I mean by that is if
I say n mod 2 okay let me just print the
value of N mod 2 so what I will do is I
will say double quotes say person D
comma let me just print this value now
if you print this value the answer
you'll be getting is 0 it's because the
remainder is 0 but there's a difference
between divide and mod if you say divide
it you will get questioned if you say
mod you will get remainder what if my
number is instead of 24 if my number is
25 you find on this code the answer is 1
right is because the Dementor is 1
I shut off let's say if I instead of 2
if I say 10 that means if I 25 mod 10
will give me remainder as 5 right so
this symbol mod here gives you remainder
now I don't want to print the remainder
I want to check the remainder depend
upon the remainder I will say it's is it
even or odd so when you say you want to
check something you have to use a if
condition now if is also called
ting statement now how to check for the
condition you have to write that
condition which is n mod 2 what I want I
want this n mod to be to come bad with 0
if this is 0 then the number is even
number but hold on
when you say equal to sign is it
assignment operator we have views here
also this this equal to means assignment
operator that means to compare we have
to use double equal to
so single equal to means assignment
operator and double equal to means a
comparative operator now
so if always goes with this curly brace
collision open dress if you have
multiple statement if you have only one
statement inside if you don't required
those curly braces so what we'll do here
we'll say just a even number if it's not
a even number what will printers will
say else so it's not if then it will be
else like we use in normal English
language
so we'll say print F and here we'll
print odd number so say odd number
simple and we don't want to put in the
remainder we just want to check is it
even number or odd number if an on this
code obviously this 25 is a odd number
if I run this code now the answer is odd
number all right what if I change the
value of this and if I make this and ask
let's say if I make this as 24 now this
number is even number simple so this is
how you have to find even odd numbers
with the help of if-else condition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
