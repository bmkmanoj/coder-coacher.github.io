about rest Web Services and the areas of
the same which we are left with in our
discussion so the first thing I would
like to discuss about is why such a name
was coined by the presentational State
transfers so let us try so let us try
understanding one such a name was coined
what exactly is the importance given to
this very first part in the statement in
that chronic representational state
transfer so let us take an example so as
a developer I will be responsible for
developing Web Services for the
simplicity of the discussion let's take
a scenario that this web service makes a
call to the database pulls in some data
from the database there will be some
client who will be interested in
consuming the same so there is a client
code which interacts with the service
the service is responsible for providing
the data back to the client now this is
not a correct way of developing an
application in which you will have a web
service talking to a database there will
be layers of communication in between
there will be technologies explained
hibernate and others which we will be
using for getting to the backend so it
won't be like this case you will be
writing a web service which directly
makes a database call this is just for
the discussion I am using this kind of
reference so let's say we have a web
service which makes a call to the
database pulls in the data now it's
trying to send this data back to the
client so the question is like what
should be the format in which this data
should be sent back to the client should
this data be in the XML form should this
data be in the JSON form so what should
I use as a developer now someone would
say go for XML someone would say go for
JSON so what is what is the idea behind
a representational state transfer
service so the idea is like this the
very first word in this
representation so what why the person
behind designing the specification you
can say says develop web services in
such a way that they support multiple
representations of data in short
representation oriented developed of
services in such a way that whatever
data you have with you that you want to
provide it to the client we don't want
to fix that oh I will only give you the
data in XML form no I will give you the
data in JSON form let us develop Web
Services in such a way that we will be
supporting XML as well as JSON both we
want to support both the technologies so
it is up to the client the client can
tell me that please give me the data in
the XML form if there is another client
who wants the data in the JSON form I
should be able to do the same so that's
why the very first part in the differ in
this acronym test it gives importance to
the format in which the data will be
exchanged between the client and the
server and whenever we develop web
services we try a developing in them in
such a way that we at least support XML
as well as JSON both there are web
services live examples where you will
find that we are not supporting both the
formats for an example if you go and
look at Twitter's if you look at the
Twitter's REST API you will find that
they are only supporting JSON the only
format they are supporting is JSON
they're not supporting XML the only
supporting JSON format so whatever data
Twitter provides you it will be in the
JSON format so are they violating
anything which exists talks about no
it's not it's just a concept which is up
to the implementation up to the
architect up to the system for which we
are developing the code nowadays Twitter
has a very good reason why
not supporting XML the kind of data that
you will pull from their system it's so
huge you can go and check the
documentation of Twitter and you will
find it that the kind of data that you
pull from the system if the same
information had to be sent in the XML
form it will obviously occupy far more
bandwidth as compared to what JSON is so
nowadays people are giving reference to
JSON format over XML but many of the
times it is also a good idea to support
both responsible so how do you answer
this question which might come up in
your mind when to use XML when to use
JSON a simple answer if the client for a
service is a web based client if for
example it is a web based client where I
am using combinations of HTML and
JavaScript for developing my application
it is a good idea to use JSON because
support for JSON is very near to you to
JavaScript it is very much like any
JavaScript object can be easily be
converted into JSON and vice versa
it's neetu to JavaScript JSON that's why
the full form javascript object notation
what about XML well we have support for
XML parsing in JSON in XHTML also I can
write some JavaScript code for parsing
an XML document but it will be like an
overhead and performance wise I'm sure
many of you already know this JSON is
considered to be a lightweight
alternative to XML so common answer if
it's a web based client I would like to
support JSON and if it's a b2b client a
be to decline would mean some business
application running within the system
somewhere we are still using XML because
XML can be validated easily and there
are proper constructs in place for XML
validation people are working on JSON
validation also those things are in
place but when we talk about XML well
it's a technology when it's stablished
you will find much better options for
XML validation XML parsing and there are
so many techniques available for the
same so if it's a b2b client which is
interested in talking to my service I
might want to share data with this
pro-consumer in the form of
maybe so I'll decide as a developer what
should I support let me support both you
know my answer always to this question
is I will not fix one I'll support XM
Eliza support both that that's how I
fulfill the first part that is what is a
presentation oriented now what about the
rest state transfer it's very simple
you're pulling the data from the
database now whatever data that you're
cooling that data is in some form some
shade right now let's say it's the
customers data data will keep on
changing with time so can we say the
state keeps on changing with time so
let's say I'm pulling some information
from the database and I provide that
information to the client tomorrow when
you invoke this service again the data
that you might get this time will be
different the state is different every
time and it's all about developing Web
Services which are designed to transfer
the state of your system so all you are
trying to do by developing Web Services
is expose the state of your application
that you are developing and provide that
information to remote users who are
interested in accessing the same it
could be a banking system in which you
are providing details about the
customers account that they are holding
it could be a trading system where
you're providing information about the
trades that are happening in the system
the information about the trade keeps on
changing every time so it's all about
developing Web Services which support
data in different form XML or JSON and
you are using HTTP protocol to transfer
the state in which that data is right
now that's how you can try you know
coming close to what is the meaning
behind this word representational state
transfer I just tried whatever best I
could to give you an idea about what
this actually means I hope some of the
points that at least should be the
takeaway from this what we discussed
about that we should be developing
services in such a way that they support
multiple formats of data representation
and yeah the rest is more about just
understanding the concept how do you
transfer this data so we use HTTP
protocol what else do you do you use
HTTP headers to convey more information
about the same to the client so it's
rest is nothing but building of the
required artifact
needed to send and receive the
information between the two parties over
here so that's a bit about what rest
means</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
