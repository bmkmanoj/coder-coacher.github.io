numbers so the I need a jframe order
swing application which will be used to
add two numbers so it may close this
window let's create a new file so it's a
Java class and we'll say this is ADD GUI
ok so what we to do here is the first
thing you need is a class so there are
new class will say this is class
addition
now this class addition is not a normal
class this class should be a frame so we
to exchange it with J frame and maintain
party package so we can say control
space J flame it will input a package
with Java swing dot X and let's let's
call this for let's get object of this
class how do you get object of this
class will say addition will say obj
equal to new addition simple since we
are calling that object we need to
create a constructor here so we'll say a
public addition now if you remember we
need to write some codes here and those
codes we can write with the help of a
template so we'll say swing swing code
swing code tab so we got this thing into
input package also for flow layout and I
can Floriade belongs to our package
which is a WT it's because we don't need
to create a new flow layout for swing so
we can use a package of a WT which is
the which we used to use before swing so
once again
aw strands fight is up strike window a
toolkit now what we need you we need to
add two numbers which means we need some
we need a field or we need a component
from where we can take input for that
what we need is I need something called
as J text field now you can also say
text box but in Java we say it is J text
field and would say this is t1 because
it will take the input so textbox t1
text will t1 do J text field simple now
vetoes yeah so we'll say new jtextfield
we need a label or to show the outputs
will say label L equal to nu J label
this will be used to link the output or
to show the output will say the output
will be resolved in fact we need to text
field is because one text will will take
one number and second text will take
second number so it's a jtextfield
and we say t2 so when it require two
text field to take two numbers we
require a label to show the output and
we require a button because you will do
some event right so will require a event
where you say when you click on that
button it will execute the code and you
will get the output so require something
called as button and will say but it is
B equal to new button J button okay and
in this J button you have to specify the
caption so as the caption is okay now
once you got all these four objects what
we can do is we can add those objects
how to add those objects is by simply
saying it is add first we to add t1 then
we'll add t2 then we'll add B and then
we'll add el so once you added all the
elements let's run this code to see what
what the output we are able to see now
so let's run this we'll say run file and
the output yeah so you got something
here you got two lines I don't know what
those two lines now and this is your
button and this is result so this result
is your label this okay is your button
what about these two this two are your
text field unfortunately you are not
able to see the text one is because the
size of that text field is for zero bits
way to specify at least take space for
20 so let's save and if I have this code
now be close the previous window okay
and let's go this code and the output is
yeah so we got two text field now so we
got this one this one and a button and I
result if you just adjust this it will
look yeah so it looks much better than
so if I add two numbers if I say 5 &amp;amp; 4 5
&amp;amp; 4 and if I click on this button it
should execute something and the output
should be sold or shown in this result
not exactly it is done that we'll see in
the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
