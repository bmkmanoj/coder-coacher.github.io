dispatcher and send redirect let's
implement them in fact we in the last
video we have implemented liquid
dispatcher right the practical video now
let's implement redirect so the idea
what we are going to do here is we have
a page when in which you will be asking
for two values that want me to click on
submit it will send a request to add and
when you send a request to add it will
call this add servlet that's what we
have configured in the XML file and once
you call this it will call do get method
because we are sending a get request
then you will be passing these two
values and your you are fetching these
two values you are adding it and then
you are setting the DITA in the request
object so that when you fire a request
or when you send a request to this next
tablet which is sq by using a liquid
dispatcher you can simply forward by
passing the request and using the same
request object on the second servlet
what we are doing is we are fetching it
from the request object we are storing
our variable and then we are performing
the operation and printed now in this
video we'll try to do the same thing but
with the help of some other thing which
is send redirect now how do we do that
so what I will do is I will come in this
section the thing is I how do I call our
second servlet because without this
thing you cannot call them so that's a
question how do we do that so what we'll
do here is now since we are not sending
a request object let's remove this
because in central redirect we don't do
that so we have a response object so
we'll say response dot send redirect
because in this scenario what you are
doing is this servlet which is ad salat
is sending a response to a client by
saying this response dot send we write
by saying hey client just go to squirrel
servlet that's what you have to do go to
ask where servlet now a client will send
a request to this quad servlet let's see
what is happening behind the scene so
right click here I will say run as or
non server let's get back to Firefox and
here I would say any number doesn't
matter so I would say a seven and five
click on submit you can see we got an
error
it says null point exception do get
what's that
the SQ surveyed we have the issue the
issue is not with the ad server the
issue with the SQ servlet now if you
observe the URL it is SQ because what is
happening is you are sending a request
to add but your ad servlet says hey go
to SQ so your client is sending a
request to SQ and if you see the send
react is a method belongs to response
object and you simply say redirect to sq
now the issue is you can see in the
request dispatch or in the in the
request object you are trying to fetch
the object of course we are not sending
a request object then how can you use
the same object here that's why your got
you got that nullpointerexception
but basically let's not try to do all
these things we'll try we'll do this
once more with the another example but
then here let me just try to bring
something so that you know I will get
some output at least on the console yeah
nothing somewhere maybe on the console I
would say sq called just to see if if
this sort is getting called or not I was
on my server once I did that change and
I will go back to my browser and refresh
sent and you can see it is able to call
sq by doing nothing you can see we're
not we're not getting anything on the
page but if you see the console in the
console we got sq call so yes we are
able to call the second serve it from
the first servlet and the one this is
one way one way you can verify this the
request is going to s cute that means
this is the second equation or the first
request so in total a client is sending
two requests at request and ask you
request now the point is how will you
send a data because that's important for
me right I want to send this data okay
now what if I will correct there and i
will uncomment this because i want to of
course i want to calculate this thing
right and the way you can get that is
let's say because we are not sending
data in the request object so I cannot
say kit you get attribute but how about
think about this if I say get parameter
will this work so I would say get
parameter and I would say data is coming
from let's say K itself okay I mean of
course we are not sending data but let's
try let's try let's do some experiment
here and I would say
request object dot get parameter I'm
expecting the ID data is coming
a format normally when you say get
parameter the parameter comes from in a
request you know is it a get request
then it is a get request it will coming
from the browser address URL remember
every is a post request then a different
way of fetching data but the data should
be coming from the client
let's try so what I will do is I would
say I have to convert that of course I
have to say integer dot pass end and I
will convert whatever coming on the way
so the value of K will be converted into
ain't and your calculating it now let's
verify I will go back to my server as
usual restart it go back to the browser
and refresh I'm going to click on submit
again we got the same problem right
number from an exception because the
data which you are getting is null and
you cannot format it but what if just
after the question mark after the SQ if
I say question mark and k equal to 9
kids then it worked the moment you pass
a value in the URL it worked because the
second servlet is asking for a value
from the parameter and normally when you
say parameter
it's a Duquette request so of course the
data is coming from the from the URL and
that's why it is working but what if I
want to make it work without even
changing the QM in the address bar or
the URL in that case what if in the ad
server itself I can give a question mark
here and I will say K is equal to plus K
I don't think about it adequate the
response which a client will get is a
new URL which is SQ question mark k
equal to whatever the value you are
passing let's try with this I will reach
at this hour and I'm always having the
same value 75 click on submit so it
worked and in the address bar if you can
see
sq Kashima k equal to 12 so that's one
way you can pass a value from one
subject to another servlet with redirect
because as we like what is happening is
this server is ad servlet is responding
to the client by saying hey client go to
sq and the URL mentioned k equal to 12
because the value of K is 12 and the
same thing is requested by the client so
this is request requested by decline
thanks to add servlet and this is what
you are getting
now this tyke this technique comes under
session management again we'll discuss
session management in a theory video but
then we have a concept of session
management where you can transfer data
from one server to another servlet with
the help of three concepts one of them
is session whenever one of them is
cookies and the thing which we have used
a here is called as you are L rewriting
because you are changing your URL and
that's why it is called as URL rewriting
so that's that's one of the way again we
have two more ways one is session one is
cookie so we'll discuss that in one of
the video in session management but here
we have worked with lewd act and that's
how you forward a request so yeah that's
it from this video I hope you enjoyed it
let me know in the comment section if
you if you have any questions and so
that I can make I can clear that in the
next video so that's it thank you so
much for watching everyone and I hope
you're supporting me on YouTube by

video with your friends thank you so
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
