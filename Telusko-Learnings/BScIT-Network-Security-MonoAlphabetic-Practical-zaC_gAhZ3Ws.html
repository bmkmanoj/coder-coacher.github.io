we'll talk about
now Oman alphabetic
for that we have already created a video
on YouTube so you will find that link
below in description area enough now how
monophyletic work is you have to instead
of having like in CSI for what we have
done is we have talked we have taken
like a a bib will be added with three B
will be added with three and any other
number any other later will bet it with
three right so is relatively your cypher
text in modified version instead of
adding with thee we have taken any
number between 125 right but with some
of the opticians or some of the
calculations anyone can attack your
cypher text to get the plain text is
because you can go for different
combination so it starting from 125 we
can take any number if you go to one
character or one later you will get all
the letters so what we want we want to
specify every there should be a key
value right for every character there
should be a different value example let
me start with the pi start with
practical so let's name it as mono alpha
I'm gonna have okay oh now what is more
alphabetic is like let's suppose we have
a sequence so let's imagine we have a
sequence called as abcdefgh
and we have this goes on right so what
we can do instead of having a we can say
a will be replaced by X then they will
please by n then your 3 will be replaced
by Y and a like derivatives by a then P
then H so any combination so next time
anyway you see a in your plain text
every replaced by X whenever you see a B
in your plane ticket will replace by n
ok so to make it work we have to write a
big code now so just let me check if
it's working oh it's going on ok so to
implement this what we'll do is we'll
take a main function this is your main
function now
okay I hope your family with all the
shortcuts now okay so what we need is
again we need uh plain text and we in
the cipher text now we'll take a key now
now what this game means it's a string
value like will named ASCII and this
will have all the characters from A to Z
but a that it will define the key values
like a should be replaced by X B will be
replaced by and something in that way
you can take any sequence but make sure
all these characters are unique there
should not be any character which is
repeated and we need 626 characters here
so we'll define in this way so it's x
and y a HP oh-- then g z q then w bt s f
lr c v then mu EK z di again this is
pretty fine a string I have it's not
compulsory to go with this sequence but
make sure every character is unique
there okay now we have to take input
from user right so we do quite a plain
text for music so what we'll do we'll do
fine above folder using which user will
take input from input from user so we'll
this before tito BR equal to new
buffered reader and we'll say new input
stream reader and in bracket you have to
pass your input device which is your
system dot n so this this is how you
write it before he does again there
might be some date this is a checked
exception so what you have to do is we
have to say those exceptions again we
have to import the package so you can
click here and add import package now
what next we'll now we have we have
taken put from user a sweetie again we
have remains missing with one package
done now so you have to take into from
user right so we have to say PT will ask
user to enter so it's out enter plain
text
now what nice we have to ask user to or
to enter details so it will enter his
plain text or do we have to say that
paintings into PT so we'll say B dot
read line now again for simplicity we'll
convert this text into uppercase so we
can see directly say to uppercase this
will convert your text into uppercase
once you got this we have to find cipher
text now and again how to find cipher
text we'll create a method called as do
and click OK doing Krypton will pass two
things we will pass plaintext and then
with this we'll pass a key okay as
simple as that
and once you've got the cipher text then
we'll directly print our cipher text
user will say assistant or dot println
cipher text : it will be your
concatenation CD so once you got the
encrypted value this value will be
printed here okay now the question arise
how will you convert this PT into city
that's of that much does mean we happy
to find this do and crip method right
again we are calling doing kill for
static method so we have to define this
method static so we'll say static string
to encrypt and in this we are we have to
accept two values money will be PT
second will be string key now now to ask
is let's imagine user is entering our
text like oh like my name it's novel
okay so if you got a name Naveen so you
have to replace n with a subordinate
value of n let's imagine now what I
don't know what is end and character
value let's let's take a so if you take
a here it should be X right so once you
compile this code the other output
should be if you say it's a it should be
X I will say it is V it should be
somewhere e or yeah it should be e right
so what we need is we have to convert
each and every character with its ibadi
hit key for that for that we have to
start with we have to first take the
index value of the character so for that
we'll take a
well as we'll say I D X which is defined
index and then to face the value will
fetch that we will save that value in C
now now we have to take we have to take
this PT and we have to take each and
every character right so what we can do
is we can just say - again - if you take
a string here because spring is
immutable we want something notable here
so what we can do is we can create
object of string buffer as we have seen
today also so string before s be equal
to new string before and in bracket now
you have to pass your PT now now we have
to fetch each and every value right and
for that what we can do is we can just
use a for loop here oh okay we can just
use a for loop here and this for loop
will start with 0 so we can die-cut you
find it as int I equal to 0 and this I
will go till again I know I don't know
the length of the string right so what
we can I can actually say is SB dot
length so it will give me the length and
then I plus plus now now let's imagine
via our first test a first test does it
character or value is n right now for
this and we have to fetch its index
number now how to fetch the value of n
or index number of n it's very simple
first we will take the character so how
to break will save that index number in
ID X equal to now how to fetch the value
we can directly say SB dot care add now
cat add well carrot from I so first
value will be I equal to 0 so it will
fetch n and I need its index value so I
can directly say - 65 right so it will
return me a sky value and a sky value -
65 will give me the index number simple
right
and then then what we can work what you
can do is we can save that character we
could we have to fetch the character
from this range where your index number
matches for example if your n is
let's assume it's 13 so you will not get
at it exactly you will get somewhere
between 88
so you will get n as 88 then then 88
minus 65 will be 13 not it I'm going for
long calculation let's imagine 78 right
so let's imagine it's any 78 the Oscar
value for n is 78 so what we can do is
we can find us K value for n which is 78
78 minus 65 will be 13 which means the
index value is 13 so we have to fetch
the thirteenth value from this string
okay now to do that it's very simple
again we'll say Z equal to so from key
we have to say God from key care and we
want ID x value you will get a collector
from this string and that's it then we
have to replace we have to replace this
end with that value I guess it should be
between T or something so I don't know
so let's see
so we'll say we can directly say s be
dot said care on location I and we want
a new value so this this new value will
be replacing this and symbol right then
once you've done all this thing we have
to just return this we have to return
this string before so how to return
string before so we'll say return a new
string and in this if you pass SB it
will convert your string buffer into
string and you will get the value and
you will get the output all right so
let's let's run this let's see if it
works as I promised I will go with my
name first
just for demonstration oh yeah it's
asking for a plain text what we'll say
is an avi n enter oh it's not T it was s
so this is my n is as a is x as we know
a is X and then again for this and it
will be s
as simple as that this is your cypher
take this is our model if everything
works right
now what if we warned like let's see how
to go for decryption here now
let's now the case is bit difficult here
so for that let's define a static method
called as static string do decrypt again
it will it will take two values one will
be string C T and second will be string
key again what it will return it it will
return a plain text now I can't we have
to follow some steps again we want index
numbers I will say ID X then we require
a character so we'll say cat C okay
again we have to have to replace value
so we have to say string buffer so it's
string buffer s be equal to new string
before and this time it will take it
will take city right so since we have to
find a PT we have to take CD has a value
and again the same stuff we have to
follow we have to take loop we'll start
with zero loop will go till SB dot
length as we have done previously and
then here first step is we have to face
the value of C now so instead of going
for the index value first we have to
fetch the character and for that we'll
say C equal to SB dot can add and will
fetch value of I here okay
now once you've got the value of I that
is your C like initially my output was
this one right so we have to fetch this
s and it was told in C now we have to
fetch the index value of that of that s
right and to do that will it's difficult
to find that value that's why we'll say
ID X equal to we'll use a method called
as get index again this is a
user-defined for method
we define it and we'll pass two values
here one is C and key and let's define
that method also because we want to get
the index so what we'll do is we'll
define our starting method
static and get index which will provide
me the index and we'll take two
parameters means you're passing you two
are two parameters we have to take that
parameter so we'll say C and key and
this will start the index value from
negative okay and we have to start your
for loop because we don't know the index
value right we have to face the index
from the character and to get that we
have to run a loop which we'll start
with to start with zero and we'll run
the loop till the key lengths again it
will be 26 so you can either use 26 here
or you can use key lengths and this will
be I plus plus now we have to check that
if that the character we are passing is
matching the value of key here like how
to check that we have to use if
condition so you can directly say if key
a K dot care add I is equal to equal to
see we can simply say your ID X equal to
i right it's so simple it's just you
have to traverse from this key if you
got any value I have to return the next
value all right so if we're done with
this if we're done with this after your
for loop what you can do is we can just
return this ID x value again it's not
compulsory to take -1 here we can take 0
also or any value but for for simplicity
we are making it as minus 1 because if
you want to go for validations you can
check that thing if it is minus 1 or not
so for that we have done that minus 1 is
not compulsory since we have to pass one
value because you cannot make it blank
you have to pass some value so they are
passing minus 1 now once you got the
index value the next step is if you take
that character you have to replace this
kiter
with you have to replace this value with
index since we are going with index plus
65 since last time we have done minus 65
this time we
have to say a plus 65 and we have to
include that in since it's an operation
we have to include two brackets and the
next step is once you've done that we
have to replace your character with the
additional value and we have to replace
it with I and C right so this is was
your ciphertext let's take our plain
text so we'll say pt equal to do decrypt
I'm going to pass city and key
now let's PT let's plain text : and this
will be your pity
all right let's on this code depend upon
my input if my input is an avi n Oh
something is missing your return
statement but we're we're okay here I am
saying a little statement so what to do
is after your for loop you have to say
new okay return values or whitneyhl
string as we did last time
it's ASB okay that was the newspaper
let's run this code again my plaintext
will be it's Naveen enter C and this is
your ciphertext and this is your plain
text since we are going for the
uppercase that's why we are getting the
output as our four kids so this is Arman
alphabetic works so for a do subscribe
for next video thank you so much for
watching thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
