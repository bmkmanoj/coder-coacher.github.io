ready and in this video we'll try to
make a simple spring code application on
NetBeans so again when you want to learn
Spring Framework first of all we start
with XML configuration then we moved
towards annotation configuration and if
you see my plate I do have a playlist on
spraying weight which starts with XML
and at EQ which goes to annotations all
the way but then I have done that on
Eclipse IDE I wanted to demonstrate that
how can we do that on NetBeans now some
of the universities they use NetBeans
for that IDE and that's why I'm making
this up this video for NetBeans now what
about what we will do is if you want to
understand if you want to understand
from start to end how spring works you
can check out my playlist I will I will
give the disk I mean I will give the
link in the description area ok if you
already know how to do that in Eclipse
let's try to do that in NetBeans so for
that first of all you have to install
NetBeans or NetBeans 8.1 8.2 whatever it
doesn't matter it will work on all the
IDE s now if you clear new project so
when you can new projects it just select
Java here and say new because we are
making next because we are making a
simple application so simply click on
next and we'll name this application as
playing demo again you can name it
anything you want and then we will click
on finish now you can see we got a Java
project here with a main function now
what I want here is okay first of all
let me just increase or font size to
quit so what I want here is I want to
add spring libraries now again spring is
basically a framework right and there's
lots of advantages of using a framework
it makes your work easy especially if
you are making a big application C for
small application doesn't make sense you
know you can simply write hello if you
want to write hello world
if you want to add two numbers it don't
need to use Spring Framework but then
when you make a big application let's
say enterprise application with multiple
services like you want to handle
transactions you want to implement
security in that case Spring Framework
will make more sense it will make your
work easy so there are lots of advantage
of using this but why no it's for small
application because when you use an you
when you use a framework you have to use
some external jar files you have to do
some configuration I know it's a one
time
job but then people find it difficult to
do that so yes if you are going for a
new framework of course you have to do
some configuration but then you have to
do that only once right otherwise you
have just have to use it so what we will
do is of course you have to do some
quantification but we will do that on
the go we will do the configuration as
of when they require what I'm going to
do here is I'm trying to make a simple
application of any very simple code
where I will create a class called as
alien so I will say right click and I
love alien so I will say Java class and
we'll name this as class as alien and in
this class alien I just want a method a
simple material and I will name that
method eyes public void show and this is
where you will show your skill set so
you are an alien okay that is for the
Eclipse yeah so you want an alien ear
you have to you have to demonstrate your
skill set and you can simply say hello
world right and you can print whatever
you want you can print you can you can
showcase your skills how many
technologies you know or which
technology are currently working on so
you can demonstrate that here now once
you have with this aging class what I
want is I want to call that show method
from here and as you know whenever you
want to call a method the first thing we
need here is an object because without
object we cannot do that I can till this
point I haven't I'm not using spring
anywhere so this is simple class I will
say alien a1 equals your new alien and
this is my first training I will say a 1
dot show now this will work right
because we have done a such a simple
code so you can see we got hello world
that's not the issue
now what the issue here is whenever you
create object by yourself this is not a
good way especially if we talk about the
enterprise world they use multiple
objects and sometimes we want to use
single object or you can say single 10
design pattern or we can also we also
want to use fact to design pattern where
you want the object to be created by
someone else and that's where Spring
Framework comes into picture because
spring has this module called as spring
IOC which is inversion of control well
you will not get the object spring
Spring Framework will give you the
object let's see how we can do that I
cannot be using XML based quantification
here I'll be using annotation based on
fiction
to show you how to do that in NetBeans
so I will remove this and here okay so I
don't want object to be created by by by
a programmer so I will say explain do it
for me but to use this we have to create
object of interface called as
application context because this is
where this is how you will configure
your application so we will say
application context because spring has
its own container to work with so to use
that container we have to get object of
application context but unfortunately if
you can see we are not getting a Pishin
context application context is a part of
Spring Framework so of course you will
not get it by default right to make it
work
you have to add some libraries and you
can see on the left hand side we don't
have much library is there only one
libraries there which is its own JDK
itself what we want is we want to add
the libraries for spring now how do we
do that normally we have to add some
some jar files you have to go to google
download those jar files by yourself and
you can do that otherwise you can simply
right-click and you can go to properties
there's option of library here so when
you go to libraries this option of add
library just click on this and select
spring now NetBeans is such an awesome
IDE it provides you all the Java files
which you need all the dependencies
which you need so I just I simply want
Spring Framework here now if you if you
go for spinning and we see we can choose
this one if you want to go for spinning
over them we don't have a choice there
but yes enough we are good with Spring
Framework 4.0.1 click on add library and
then click on ok now you can see we got
all the Java files required by Spring
Framework as you can see we got all the
Java files required so we don't have to
add anything by ourselves that's awesome
right and that's why that means is one
of the one of the best IDE in the market
other than Eclipse and IntelliJ so let's
say control space the moment I do that
you can see we got the we got the
packages let's go with the first one so
I would say a picture context context
that's my reference name ok ok we'll say
context equal to now here if you want to
get an object now first of all
application context is an interface so
of course we have to create user class
to get an object so the class which
implements application context is
annotation
annotation application punt fake
application context okay so this is what
you have to use now depend upon what
type of quantification you are using you
have to change this class example for
XML we normally use classpath xml
application context and we use
annotation country annotation configure
boostin context for annotation based
configuration that sounds good I will
simply say a 1 dot show but it will not
work right of course so you have to do
that you have to say context dot now you
will say hey spring framework I want
object of alien so we will simply say
get Ben because all the components or
all the objects inside spring frameworks
are basically called as beans so I will
say hey I want an object of alien dot
class now ok we are doing that now will
it work the thing is I am asking my
spring framework hey spring framework
just give me the object of alien because
since we are using spring framework it
should work right but the moment I
learned that the moment I on this code
you can see we got an error it is not
working because it says hey you are
using spring framework that's great but
then spring framework is not Rajnikant
to know everything what you have to
provide is or ok if you are confused
with Rajnikant if you are from out of
out of India ok so you can imagine
Superman so spring framework is not a
Superman to do everything right so you
have to configure your spring framework
for that and to do the configuration
what you do is you have to get a new
plus here and now this class is for
configuration so I will call this class
as AB contact because I'm configuring my
application you can name is class
anything you want but I love this name
AB conflict and this class need to be
annotated with ad config or a trait
config so have to say configuration yeah
so you have to say adder it
configuration at the top of it and this
class will implement or this class will
have methods so this class will have a
method which is called as get alien so
this class returns an alien object and
we can simply say return a new alien
right so we can do that so but so we
just have to mention application or
configure app config class so what we
are doing is we are informing our
application hey I have created the
application config I mean app config as
a class in which I am configuring my
beans so if a user wants in an object
you can do that but don't you think
again we are ready new keyword here
that's not good right because if you
have multiple classes if you have ten
classes you have to write this you have
to create ten method then ten methods
for those ten classes if you have
hundred classes you have to get hundred
methods that doesn't make sense right so
we can remove that and what we can do is
on top of alien so we used to do that
before before coming to the the example
which I am doing now is a recent recent
one but before that people use to do
that so what we do is on top of every
class which whatever you want an object
you can simply write component so on top
of every class just write component so
we have an alien here and we have to
mention component by writing component
there we are meant we are mentioning hey
Spring Framework this is actually a
spring bean so anyone wants app in an
object you can simply pass it
that sounds good right but then here you
have to mention one more annotation
which is called as components can I know
there are lots of annotations but then
initially you will find it difficult but
don't worry once you start using it it's
damn easy thing so initially I used to I
used to do all these things by looking
at my code so we I used to have a
written notes but then now since I have
done this a lot of time I know so you
can try this out practice more and you
will remember all the annotations so yes
we have a add component annotation so
all the classes if you want alien just
write add component if you want if you
want to configure it if you want to
configure so this app config is app on
fusion class just write conjugation on
top of it this is this specifies that
you are doing configuration and write
add component which will mention which
will mention the package name so you
have to mention the package where you
have all the components you can see the
package name is spring demo in which you
have a component now this should work
let's try so if I am this code or you
can see that we got hello world it's
that simple
you might be thinking we could
done that with new keyword right and
that's right you could have done that
with the help of normal new keyword and
new alien but then this when you be when
you make a big application and let's say
if your application has 5060 classes
then this will make more sense and
sometime you know you also have a
concept of interfaces right so normally
what we do is we create a reference of
interface and we could object of a class
just to give you a demonstration of that
what I do here is I will go back I will
I will go back here and I will just
create a simple class and I will name
this class on not a class but an
interface I will I will then him that
class to interface but then I want to
create an interface which is called as
computer okay so just to because every
agent will have a computer right so okay
when I say alien I'm talking about you
people programmers so let's say we have
a class or we have an interface so let
me just rename this to interface we have
a interface computer and into computer
we'll have some features you can show
that you can show the config so you can
say public void features right so every
company has a features but then we will
declare we will be declaring it we are
not defining it so let's make it a
declaration now our alien will have a
computer right of course every alien you
need to have a computer so I will say
private private what computer so alien
has a computer all will say calm okay
it's that simple we can create our
reference you you can get a reference
here and then for this reference we need
we need Gator setters I will say
generate get an setters for this
computer let's click on generate and you
can see we got this - we got a gator and
record a setter and that's quite simple
now once we have done with that once we
have created these two methods which is
greater than Seto
ok now till this point this we are not
using Spring Framework right we are
simply we are simply doing some code
here now what I want from you is I want
to understand from you in show if I if I
print hello world and if I print calm
dot what calm dot features because I
want so I want to know which features
they use so what I will do is I will so
what do you think if I run this code
will it work let's try so the moment I
done this code you can see we got
enna which is with our favorite error
which is nullpointerexception and
obviously right because you are simply
creating a reference of computer you are
not creating an object of a computer
right and till this point you don't have
an object it will not work so how do I
create object of computer here and first
of all computer is a is an interface we
can't even do that so what you do is
first step you have to create a life you
have to get a class which implements
computer so I will say this class as
laptop of course white laptop implements
computer because laptop is also a
computer I will click on finish and this
laptop implements computer and this
should have that method so I will simply
say click here and say implement all the
methods and the method name is features
and I don't want to do any error here
okay so here I will print okay which
what conjugation I have let's say I
three machine so I three 2 GB RAM and
500gb hard drive ok let's let's go for
that configuration ok so this is my
laptop and now what we we can do is how
can you assign this laptop so how can
you assign the object of laptop to alien
now first of all as I mentioned all the
classes need to have component on top of
it right so we can write add component
and then so once we got this laptop and
we got this alien what do you think if I
done this code will it work of course it
will not work is because the computer so
in this alien the computer is not
assigned to laptop yet so what we
normally do is we before calling show we
should be creating object of a laptop
here so we'll say laptop l1 equal show
on context dot get beam and you can say
what a laptop laptop dot class right and
you will get the object and here you can
say a1 dot and you can say set computer
and you're setting a lab computer as l1
laptop so which company you have you
have a laptop right there with 2gb RAM
and all those configuration knife here
on this code you can see it works you
can see it works so this is one way
so this is one way the another way is
what you can do is you don't have to
mention any object here you don't have
to do all the setup by yourself you can
ask Spring Framework to do that and you
can do that just by writing at Auto
wired the moment to write at Auto Body
your Spring Framework is so smart that
it will it will get the object for you
so it's written on this code and you can
see it still work so in superfight
instead of getting object of laptop by
yourself or doing that stuff you can do
it automatically and if you see this
code of alien know where we are talking
about laptops can you see that alien has
a computer doesn't matter is it a laptop
or a desktop right now
with this let me give you one more thing
what if you have a class which is a
desktop because computers also I mean
desktop is also a computer right so it's
a desktop and of course this desktop
will implement okay this desktop will
implement a computer and of course even
this should have those methods which is
this one let me remove this extra thing
from here yeah and this will print so of
course a desktop will have a good con
fiction let's say i7 16 GB RAM and 2 TB
hard drive so that's the conjugation of
of this dick stop now let's say someone
says hey I don't want a laptop I want a
desktop so what you can do is on top of
this desktop you can say add component
because every class need to be a
component ok now what what we are doing
is for a computer so for the computer we
have two candidates we have a laptop and
we have a desktop so let's say at your
home you have both the machines you have
a laptop and you have a text op now if
we run this code it will be it will give
you that confusion hey you are you are
having two things you set the error here
it says expected single matching beam
but found - you see that it says expect
a single matching beam but found two so
we have to provide only one instance
right so there is a confusion so even
alien is not able to figure it out which
company you want in that case
you can simply use and so let's say if
you want to play a game of course you
will give prior to the extra flight so
what you can do is you can write add
primary so it's all about annotations so
when you the moment you say a dramatic
stop in case of confusion this will get
the higher priority and if you want this
code you can see we got 17 i 7 + 8 16 gb
ram
so this is where desktop is getting the
priority but what if alien 1 you decide
hey I don't want to give priority to
desktop I want to give priority to that
top you can do that so at the alien
point itself we can give at qualifier
and you can mention hey I wanted a I
wanted a laptop here so we can write
simply small in small optimization
laptop so that else should be small you
have to remember that and now I feel on
this code you can see laptop is getting
the best friends so if you want to give
the preference from the class side you
can write to add primary and if you want
to give the preference from the alien
side you can write add qualifier again I
will be making a detail with if you want
to find detailed videos video we do have
a playlist there but this is where I'm
trying to do all this thing in one
particular video so that it will be
easier for you to I'm in recap or what
you say device so yeah so you can do
that with add qualifier we have talked
about at at at primary right we have so
we have all these annotations to use in
fact there's some more conjugation but
you can see that you know in the other
videos so yes that's the power of Spring
Framework if you can see we are not
getting object by ourselves we are
asking for the spring framework to do it
and that too we are using singleton
design pattern by default so in total
you have only one object you are not
getting multiple objects and that's the
beauty okay so yeah that's it about this
video we've talked about Spring
Framework on on that beans I am also
planning to make a video on spring AOP
on NetBeans let me know your thoughts in
the comment section and if you like my
