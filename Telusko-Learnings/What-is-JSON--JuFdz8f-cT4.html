pronounce it what matters is what
exactly this means now again there are
lots of people they do pronounce it as
JSON and officially it is pronounced as
Jason but is it that doesn't matter what
matters is what exactly it means again
for this for this video I will refer
that's Jason you can you can say that's
whatever you want but then let's let's
name it as Jason now Jason basically
stands for JavaScript object notation
and why it is so famous as you can as
you have heard about Jason before it is
used in Android it is used in web
technologies rest api is it is used
everywhere right so what is Jason and
how to use it so in this video we are
going to talk about this thing
welcome back aliens I'm now in the
different icicle earnings and let's get
started
so as we have defined Jason simply means
JavaScript object notation so when you
talk about Jay when you talk about Jason
the full form is so it simply says
JavaScript object notation right so of
what happened you know when you talk
about Jason it is simply a format in
which you can transfer data from client
to server and from server to client C in
the initial days of web development we
used to work with HTML white hTML is
like the what is a de facto design
pattern so everywhere we used HTML to
design websites and we don't have any
other choice other than we use CSS then
we use JavaScript so initially we used
to create static pages but now the world
is changing right we are making more
dynamic pages and when you say dunnock
page it just simply means that the data
which you get from the server will be
dynamic or on the de pon your request
you will get the response example a
typical example would be if you go to
any web site like Facebook so on
Facebook what happens is you have a
mobile application and then you have a
website right so all you'll be having a
server so this is your server and this
is your application so what we do is we
send a a synchronous request now if you
don't know about X asynchronous that
that's ok what it simply means is your
view have opened a app or the website on
your while phone what you're doing is
after some time your website is sending
a request to the server and in response
your server is sending some data now
this data can be in any format ok now
normally we talk about websites you
return HTML format but in addition of
returning an HTML format you can also
return something or you can also return
only data example let's say if you have
if you have any object on server side
because data are coming coming from data
from servers right now it doesn't matter
which which technology are you working
on server side maybe PHP Ruby Python
Java you can use oh maybe maybe P ok so
the technology which you can use on
server maybe it is Java maybe asp.net
maybe PHP doesn't matter what matters is
from this server what you written on the
client side would be only data because
sometimes it happens you know you have a
application here you don't have a
website but then you have application
now in this application you already have
a design what you don't have is data so
this data will be coming from a server
now when you send a request you will get
a response in some format right I don't
want HTML because HTML will give me the
design as well what I want is on the
data so what can be used here so can be
used text plain text something like this
when you when you get data you can also
return text or plain text we can do that
right we can send the data from server
to client in text in train format but we
just have one issue here the issue is
when you send data in a text or plain
format it will be difficult for you to
pass it here say when you send
HelloWorld that's fine right when you
send data like I am loving ready that's
fine but the moment you send some
complex data and we are living in
object-oriented world right when you get
you don't send simple data you send
complex objects example let's say if you
want to send our information about
employ again so this is a very typical
example right when you talk about a
database system or thing so when you
talk about the employed self-employed
we'll have certain things right so let's
say if you have this employee object
this employee object will have certain
properties maybe employee will have
employee ID then employee will have
employee named employee will have a
salary and employee will also have the
department so which department and
employed belongs to right so this is not
a simple object now this is a complex
object so what you want to do is you
want to send this object in your in your
application so that you can read it here
now when you send a plain data it's very
easy to read write hello world my name
is Naveen ready but the moment you send
this complex data problem starts here I
mean you can send it in text format
that's not an issue
how will you pass it here how will you
fetch one one value because you are
sending a string then on the client side
you have to write Java for yours right
PHP code any I mean JavaScript code and
you have to take out one one element it
will be a I mean you have to do lots of
programming there what if you can have a
object-- format here so you know we when
talk about JavaScript in JavaScript we
can
a JavaScript object we can create an
array so what if you can directly send
this data in the object format itself
maybe a JavaScript object and that's
what is called as JavaScript object
notation right because what you sent is
not a plain text but something in a
format which will be readable by your
JavaScript which will be readable by
your by Java code as well and you can
imagine this you have a Android
application here okay and then you have
a java application on server nobody is a
java application maybe sublets maybe
sublet spring technology doesn't matter
maybe rest api so when you have Java and
Java because Android is also Java right
so when you have Java on both this side
instead of sending a plain text what you
can do is send this object ok Java
object here in the idle application but
then how can we send object so what you
have to do is we have to size the object
now when you accessorize the object it
simply means fetch the values of an
object put it in somewhere and send that
something to the client side and your
client will read that and your client
will be able to pass it I mean that's
awesome right if it is possible only
when you send data in a JSON format so
that means you have to convert this into
JSON format so how do we do that so
let's say shop saying employee ID let's
refer this as e ID so let's say the e ID
is 1 then your name is something you can
say Naveen and then your salary is this
6,000 and department is education right
so if you have all this value so we have
a ID 1 a name Naveen and salary 6,000
Department is education you will send
this information on the client side in
some format and that will be Jason now
let's represent this in here so let's
write Jason so we say e ID equals show
in double quotes 1 that's mighty ID then
give a comma so you have to open a
context close bracket you have to give a
comma then you have to say a name equal
to in double quotes you have to say
Naveen and then again comma is important
that right and then you will say salary
equal to in double quotes 6000 then a
comma and then you have to say
Department is equal to oh it's not
- its : how can I forgot that we have to
make sure that we put a colon there okay
that's a collection and then we have to
say education so that will be education
here right so we have e ID : 1 e ID :
Naveen and then this goes on now this
data you are sending on service anyone
clients idroid some clients that you can
read this data now if you're using
javascript is very easy if you name this
object as employee let's say if you
create a variable in JavaScript when you
say Brad EMP when you open the curly
brackets and if you have this data so
this data will be coming from server it
will be assigned to EMP now what you can
do is you can simply say e MP dot e name
he MP dot salary this will work now you
might be thinking okay working with
JavaScript with Jason is easy
how about Java code what if you want to
do in Android so in Android we create
Java objects right so that means from
Java object which is this let's say this
object name is EMP itself which is e MP
class EMP object if you are sending this
op check in JSON format that means you
have to convert that object or JSON
format right and on the client side you
have to convert your Jason into Java
object so I want to convert so I want to
say I'm going to do something like this
I want to convert an object in Java to
Jason and then on client side I want to
convert this Jason into object okay now
how do we do that so don't worry there
are certain libraries available example
Jason we have Jackson
so all these libraries are available and
you can use any of the slab way to
convert your Java code into Jason and
Jason into Java object it's that easy
but then Jason is the only way to do
that all ok let's have one more thing
what if you have object inside an object
now maybe you have a collection inside
the object example under this employ
this employee has how many mobile phones
maybe you can have this example right so
maybe a Salesman how many wild phone
brands is sales so we'll be having the
least of mobile phones right because you
will not be having one mobile phone you
will be having these two mobile phones
and let's say if you have three mobile
phones how will you send data here so
again you have to say Mobile's
and whenever you have a list we give a
addressing button of any member we have
added so we have to open the array we
have to close the add it in this array
will be having all this values that
means Jason is an object and inside this
an object you can have an array object
now the amazing thing is inside this
array object you can also have adjacent
object so maybe mobile phones will be
having its own object so we can open the
curly brackets and you can have the
first mobile phone data here then second
mobile phone data here that is that
awesome so object JSON object can have
Java added or JSON array jason add a can
have JSON objects and Jane again that is
no object in have java jackson jason add
it's like Inception right but then okay
that's how it works it's it's quite
simple the only problem is when you
generate this data by yourself you might
have to write it on Google so if you
just go to Google and search for Jason
why data just paste your Jason there it
will give you what's wrong and watch
right so that's that's an awesome thing
but then oh is the easy to only option
you have Jason can use something else
and what what we were using before Jason
because Jason came I guess in last five
years and I am Not sure but then what
about what what before that what they
used to use so before Jason people used
to work on XML so when you want to send
data from server to client they used to
ex use XML in fact now also people do
use XML but then Jason is trying to what
you say was right the XML features so
whatever you can do Jason you can do an
XML so why to use XML when you can when
you can use Jason so Jason is a very
standard format now in fact if you
follow all my tutorials on on richest
API or maybe on spring rest will be
using Jason there so the idea behind
this video is to make you understand
whatever we are going to do in rest api
this is the foundation for that so just
remember Jason is a format from which so
this is the format using which you can
send data from server to client and from
client to server as well when you want
to post data you can also use Jason
right so that's that's an awesome thing
so this is how it looks like and that's
you will be sending date data but how to
make it work that we'll see in the
practical video of REST API so that's it
