ready and in this video we'll talk about
Java anion but you might be wondering IV
have what do you started with Java nine
right we have talked about J shell now
Java nine has so many features we call
it J shell we also got modularity now in
this series we'll talk about modules now
you might be thinking what do we really
need modules because we will happy with
Java files right we will happy with
objects because Java is object oriented
why do we need another topic now the
reason is Java is getting updated every
now and then right we got so many
updates and because of all these updates
they also say it is backward compatible
which means every new feature will not
make sure that you are removing the old
features and that's why the main jar
file which we use in every project that
is a jar file which we all use is RT dot
jar which is one time tortured and it
has so many classes so many packages in
one jar file every time you get a new
Java version you just update the jar
file so from one MB now you get 2 mb 5
MB 10 MB maybe in future we'll be having
1 GB of RTO jar just imagine just in
your own project you have a project of 5
KB in that you have a jar of hundred MB
or maybe 100 or 1 terabyte this was a
good way right okay that's exaggeration
but then that's the trauma we are facing
nowadays so in fact that's why if you
really want to work on a project now you
have to think about modularity now do we
really need to do that what if I say if
using Java 9 your JDK itself is kind is
created using modules now so your
article judge for example if you are
making a new project in Java online you
don't have to download the entire are
your jar right because in that jar file
you have all the packages which we use
we have object class and land package
you have all those file classes in
higher package right all those classes
are available in our dot jar so even if
in that also we also have our mi we also
have code about we have so many so many
packages which we don't even use I mean
when was the last time you've worked on
all mi it spits me a long time right so
if you don't want those classes why do
we will have to include that in a
project so now you're at your jar file
is broken down into small small module
so whatever module you want to work with
you can say DOS module example let's say
if you want to work with basic
calculations if you want to your string
class you can use one of the modules
which is therefore the java dot base so
java dot based have all the basic
features you want but maybe you want to
work with XML so for XML we have a
special a module but then XML module is
dependent on base module you don't have
to worry about base module because when
you use you are using XML in XML module
they have defined that we want to use
base module you don't have to worry
about that what if you want to use SQL
features now to work with SQL you need
XML an XML need base so this is the what
you say the the module graph you have
all the object graph so one module is
depend upon some other module so you
don't have to adapt worry about the
dependencies you have to simply mention
hey I want SQL SQL will get the XML one
XML will get the base one you don't have
to worry about that so whatever module
you mentioned it will you will get the
same module you don't have to worry
about which one you want right
in fact jar is Jazz's also have point
set where we we have one no concept
where jar hell now jar hell is not a
good thing to work with I having jar
files are very difficult to understand a
second we have plus path issues you know
from the start of my Java career I used
to hate class part things because if you
miss one jar file imagine you're walking
with hibernate project or maybe some any
spring project so when you use spring
jar file
you also have transitive dependencies
which is spring itself needs some other
jar files what if you miss one jar file
so let's say spring needs five jar files
and you miss one jar file you will not
get issue at compile time you will get
issues on run time now imagine you have
compiled all the project you have
deployed this deployed your project on
the server and you fail it to test all
the features and the untested features
maybe have a bug now it will give you an
time at all and trust me runtime errors
are horrible so it's better to get error
at compile time and using modularity you
will get that but how exactly we can do
that so first of all we discuss about
why modules we'll discuss about how to
get a module and how we can use it in
the future so I hope you will enjoy the
series with me so
that's it doose's careful subscribe for
further videos guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
