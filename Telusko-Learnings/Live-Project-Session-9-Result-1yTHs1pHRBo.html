live sessions I was busy with some some
work for one or two one and a half week
and finally I got some time to take out
so that we can go live and yeah this is
the best time to go light by the night
time where everyone is available okay so
we can go we can go live now let me just
share my Eclipse with you
in fact okay just just hold on let me
show my screen here
we should I put it should heal okay so
everything looks good let me show you my
screen
oh the font size is very low okay sure
that okay so that's my screen for you
okay so
that's my screen and I know the font is
not that visible so let me just change
the font size in fact I should be
changing my system so in fact my machine
was on repair for few days and
everything is formatted everything is
new in this system now so I have
reinstalled all this office and so there
was some issues and now it is working I
guess ok I do one more thing here which
is the look mr. started recording as
well because there will be a good
quality video on the way ok and then
stuck oh I forgot to change one more
thing I forgot to change these settings
and appearance the text font I'm sorry
for this trouble which taking some time
come on
ok so here we go so we are live now and
I mean we arrived from a long time but
then ok so last time what we did let's
let's go for a quick recap what we have
done last time so we have created this
test module where the you because you
will be getting questions from this
server and they will be getting a page
where you can actually see all the
questions right so in fact will be
talking will be saying only five
questions so when you when you say hey I
want to give a test it will give you
five questions and then again as a v1
you will or you will answer those five
questions right and at the end when you
submit those questions will be going to
this cell wall for the verification now
what I do now is let's let's run this
code once again let's see if it is
working or not I will simply click on
write like one as one server I will be
have a tomcat server installed so it
will run locally
and run finish it will take some time to
run of course I know you are impatient
but then it will take some time okay so
here we go so this is this is what we
got a question right I mean this is what
we got here which is a page but then
what we want here is a we want to give
test whites and that's why we have
created this thing which is called as
test dot HTM so when I request for $10
Chiam uh what I will get is okay I'm the
commissioning potential asymmetry is
taking some time and in fact I should be
I should be using this on a browser
right because Eclipse inbuilt drawers is
not that good so I will use external
browser I will prefer Safari here
because I'm already using Chrome for
something else so okay so okay so what's
that what's that I should be printing
okay so that's weird I know
so it means train my browser that we use
I don't have a father's in the system
because I forgot to install it let me
just run this once again or maybe I will
try that on a browser so this is
localhost colon 8080 slash test or
that's great and then we'll a liquid
request for test dot HTML is what we
have done last time press again see if
we are getting a question and then we
are also getting options now which are
the four basic features of oops I know
the answer this is a polymorphism oh
this is ah okay any answer will do let's
go for next Java is designed by James
Gosling next how many types of errors Oh
three types of Veloz compile them
logical error and runtime error is go
for next
I don't know what's the answer poppy
poppy this is just demo questions right
and java application runs on JBL when
you click on end text so what should
happen when you click on end test it
should call a page which is Diesel dot
result dot JSP again we have not
returned
okay so we have not written any code for
this okay we have not written any code
for verification now how do you process
this question so as you can see when you
send a request and look at the address
bar we have created this address bar
something like this so when you send a
request to the server you have to send
the question ID one so for push anyone
the answer was I mean the answer you
have given is 3/4 koshari to the answer
you have given is 1/4 I mean the for the
next question you have given some answer
so everything is there in the address
bar okay so if I want to show you this
address so let me copy this code let me
go right to STS which I just use it's
here and in this STS what I will do is I
will just come in this section and let's
put it here so this is the request you
are sending by important part of about
this request is you are sending the
question ID you are sending I mean you
are consenting all the question areas
with the answers right so as you can see
we got questionary one regards we are
given the answer which is 3/4 koshari
too we have given the answer 1 and then
so on what I do now is I want to verify
all this answers on the server now how
do you verify it's actually very easy
first of all I have made one more change
in the table so in then asked last time
you have created the database as well
right now I just made some change here
now if you remember I don't know if you
remember or not if we talk about a
database which we are using so we were
using Porsche quiz database again you
can use MySQL or you can use SQL server
your choice right but then here i am
using a post close now inside this post
quiz as you can see the last column I
mean let's cover the first one the first
column is question ID which is which we
have the question number then you will
be having the actual question then
you'll be having the options first
option second option third option and
then so on the fourth option then we
have answer so answer initially was the
text which
let's say for this portion for this
video question the answer is james
gosling so this one in the answers
section you will be having james gosling
but then I made a change and I made it
integer so that we can we can save the
number there so if your answer is first
answer you will say what if you answer
second answer you will say to and that's
how I have defined this answer column
okay now the point is how do you verify
all this answer so this is what you are
sending from from the client machine to
server machine right now all the
requests will be coming to this verify
the list gmx remember if you see the
address bar where is that if you see the
address bar we are actually calling
verify dot HTM again I just forward to
mention if you are new to this session
you know this is I mean every day I am
getting lots of subscribers and maybe
you are new subscribe on here so in that
scenario if you don't notice what is
going on basically we are building a
live project from last month and this is
the ninth session for the live project
ok so we have already completed first
eight in fact the first two sessions was
just theory about it and what this or
this session would be the actual session
starts from session 3 so if you are
interested in this just go back to my
channel or search for a playlist offline
project and follow that this is the
ninth session so if you see something
beard or don't worry okay this is
actually weird it's just that you have
not seen the earlier videos so make sure
you see the earlier videos as well just
to make this I mean just - I mean this
will make sense then again and if you
are new to this video do share this
video with your friends and do like if
you are enjoying this session ok so what
is happening here is we are calling this
video part of STM right now when you
call this very for benefit of Astrium
I'm passing all these parameters as you
can see we are passing qid one we are
passing qre two we are passing and so 1
we are passing also 2 so what we can do
here is we can accept all those values
here now if you remember in spring or in
spring MVC we have to use at the rate
controller or we have to use internet
request request parameter right or the
quest pattern so when we use request
parameter
just imagine you are sending ten
variables of course it will not be a
good idea to tend to send those ten
variables right the good thing would be
what if you can create a class here
which will have this ten variables so
let me just state that class I will say
in the entity package I will say the
class name would be quest because
question is already done right so let me
create a class class quest now this
quest class will have n variables five
question areas and PI one source okay
now instead of typing the entire code I
already have a phone with me just to
save big time again this this is not a
some some scientific thing so we can
just copy this code right so I have
already written the code somewhere let
me just copy that and put it here okay
so how many variables I want I want ten
variables I got q ID 1 and so on cutie
to answer to and then these goes on so
you can see we have ten variables here
and for those ten variables of course we
have we have getters and setters and at
the end we also have two string method
if you want to print or in case if you
want to print somewhere okay once we got
this class what next Oh see all the
questions which is coming I mean all the
question IDs and the answer is coming
from the client side I want to assign
those values here right again we could
have used request param and you could
have returned ten variables there but
the best way to do here would be to use
a model attribute let's say model
attribute that's weird actually
attribute let me just input the package
Oh what's wrong why this is not getting
important or maybe it's already
important so we got one attribute and
let's create an object of quest I would
say quest a quest I got an object of
quest so all these values okay all this
values which is coming from the client
side will be assigned to quest now we
have to import the package for that let
me just import the package for quest so
all the values which is coming from the
client request which is q ID one on
sighting one will be assigned to this
quest now what next what you will do
with this it's actually very simple once
you got this first
we will verify this quest but then how
how to verify this so what I will do is
I will ask someone else to verify so
after verification what I want I want
this code example let's say if I if I
give a test for five questions and not
about out of those five questions three
or two questions were right in that
scenario you have to give this code
right so three questions was right you
have to print three if two questions
were why do you have to apply it you
have to believe the answer is true so a
user expecting a result from you so if I
if you ask for three questions or maybe
if you ask about five questions out of
five question it forward right you have
to print four so that you will so that
you user will know that you are printing
or you are giving you the user got four
points now how do you verify so first of
all I am expecting a score right so I
will I will say that for result I want
someone else to do this job for me so I
already have a quotient down now if you
remember we have created this class for
this question Dow and in this question
now as you can see we have a classifiers
question down here and in this class we
have certain methods now in in that one
of the method I want is verified so what
I do here is I will say Q Dow that's the
object of question now which we have
already created and again don't worry
there once the session gets over maybe
by tomorrow I will I'll be uploading
this project on github so you can just
you know clone this project from github
for you okay so regard Q Dow which is Q
Dow and then here we say Q Dow dot very
fine okay so of course to verify we have
to pass those parameters I mean I want
you to verify so what if you want to
verify we want to verify this quest
object so all these values which is
coming from the client side is stored
inside this quest
I just want to verify I just want to
verify those those questions or answers
were right so I'm passing that here and
I'm saying verify but the problem is we
have not defined a verify yet
okay B I'm not defined a method verify
here right how do we do that how do you
how do you verify a thing so what you
can do is
you can go to your question Dow and
let's define that method here
which method we want we want a mess of
it is public the method returns are int
value and we'll name this method as
verify itself which takes a quest object
so it's a quest quest recorder method
expects or which is a verify which takes
a quest object and of course it will
interactive a database so we'll make it
ad transactional as it will be dragging
to interacting with database I would say
a transactional ok now what I would do
here is I will say ain't scored now this
is the variable where I have all the
values and will return score okay that
means if you run this code of course it
will give you 0 that's not what what we
want right I mean no one expect to get a
answer which is 0 right so I mean so
that's a 0 so what we have to do is I am
sending this quest right I'm sending
this quest and it will return me the int
value which is result
I just want to print that result ok I'm
still getting some error here is the de
niro no there's no otherwise give me I
don't anyway so I got this method right
I got this method which is very v is
taking a quest object now how do you +
how do you provide a verification step
here ok this is bit this is bit tricky
to understand ok so it could be with me
let's try to understand how do you
verify if the answer was right or wrong
not only when you want to verify
something one of the best way is to use
a select query I mean of course why do
if you want to enjoy my database you
have to fire a select query find the
Select query we have to create such an
object right so first of all we need
this object so I need a session object I
need a query object as well in fact we
have seen this earlier why we need these
two objects so we did session object so
that you can use the current session
since we are working with hibernate here
of course you can do the same project in
in gdb C as well but then using
hibernate provides you or in concepts
and we were trying to implement new
technologies here so we have worked on
AWS we have worked on a spring we have
wondered hibernate so you are you are
basing it on learning all new
technologies so maybe if you are going
for the
use in future you give a bit confident
after after watching all these videos
right okay so yeah so we got the native
Korean we got the session but then this
is not the query which I want I want to
defend wedding so let me just let me
just define that query here
now what query I want now this query is
actually very important because this
query went to find how to check if our
answer is right or wrong
so the query I'll be using here is I
will say select star I am using SQL
query okay now I'm not using SQL query
here is because I mean you can use HTML
but then I'm keeping it type to you how
do you provide how do you how do you
make this as hql query but let me just
use SQL query here since the select star
from question or does it people we have
where where qid
is equal to 1 I mean let me just give a
static values here and unser is equal to
maybe to see if this works if you
execute this query in fact if this query
returns you a column or if this query
returns you the data
it means the answer is white let me go
with this if you fire this query okay
why don't we just try this okay let's
try this in pose with itself so let me
go to post quiz as you can see recorded
data here let me just go back here and
say tools ok tools and query tool okay
if I oh what's that
because not tied to what that's weird oh
so copies doesn't work here so it's a
select star from question oh where where
your question ID so it is your cue ID is
equal to 1 and your answer is equal to 1
again I'm not sure Beyonce's right so as
you can see if I on this code there is
an error because Unser is in string
format it unfortunately have made it
string it should be integer I know so as
you can see the question number one
answer is not one and that's why it's
not working again
then if I change the answer to - I guess
they are H - let's try now the other is
not - the answer is three because I had
to check that answer a little bit we can
also verify the answer right we have
that answer here so question number one
as the answer is three as you can see
from this query now you can see the got
data that means when you get data
the answer is white when you're going
when you don't get a data
the answer is wrong is that simple right
so we are when you fire this query if
you are getting some data that means
your answer is right if you don't get
data your answer is wrong we can
implement the same concept in in spring
again the normal way would be a fetch
all the questions from the database
which all the answers and then check
each and every one what happens is when
you fetch all the questions from
database that repeat when you send it to
your application it will take lots of
time right
you are wasting lots of time if you say
if you want to verify this answers by
Java code which is always better to
verify because verify the answer using
SQL query because it will not take much
time come by the java code okay so this
is the query on file so I will replace
this thing with a SQL query here which
is SQL when we have one issue see I'm
not getting one and two from the client
Lloyd I'm getting five questions and
five answers how do you how do you make
this work so time a let's go with this
one statement and later we'll replace
this thing with multiple quality so the
question is one answer is three now what
makes if I find this query what should
happen it should return you the question
column literally the question object and
it will return only one object you not
return multiple objects so it's a unique
result because unique result will give
you one we one row and we are not
expecting multiple rows here I put it on
you on the one row now way to store that
object so when you said unique results I
don't know how many of you are devised
your hibernate concepts here but then
when you say unique results it will give
you only one row and you can store that
in a question so let's let's say
question Q equal to unit result and then
let's prank with this question let me
just print that question so now I don't
know what will happen which one is good
let's see what happens to run this code
of course I will restart the server I
will go back to my Safari to see the
output
and okay let me I can say enter here
because I already have answered all the
questions right so it will take some
time they treat for that time and it's
working it's working it's working it's
working expecting some time come on give
me the answer
oh we got and we got another that's
weird okay we got in error because I've
just made a mistake here this should be
screened be enclosed in single code
white
so let's run this once again let's go
back to our browser and let's say enter
and waiting for the output okay as you
can see we go
result page but then we have not got
this code there's a different thing
right let's go back to our code and
let's see what is there so if you see
this oh well if I is not called or is it
called or it is called can you see that
we got a question here so we are
printing the question ID so that means
when you print queue here it is actually
printing the the entire question but
then what if you give the wrong answer
let's say B answer you have given is 2
so the aqua charity one we answer which
you are giving is is 2 now what will
happen which one is good just to
understand what is happening let me
check a server so service getting
started or what is the project name
project is this project is a disco
project ok raise my browser it's here ok
let's enter now once again and as you
can see it is working and come on give
me the output ok we got the output but
the output this time is null that means
when your answer is right it will give
you the object of question when your
answer is wrong it will give you a null
and that's our benchmark right that's we
got a logic here so what we can do is
you can check actually you can maintain
a school so whenever your question I
mean of course you have to verify 5
questions right not one question we have
to first do that now how do you run this
5 times it's very easy when you will say
you to do something repeatedly the best
thing we could we could use here is a
for loop so we can use a for loop we can
say 8 I equal to 0 and then we say int
risen 5 and I plus plus okay so we are
running a code here so this will be run
5 times and every time you run this code
oh yes bottom I am doing this from
scratch okay so we got
question there so we got question Q
equal to query dot eunuch results now
how do you verify so what will you do
okay first of all I just need to I
cannot write one here right I have to
mention the quotient ID oh that's a
difficult part now how can I get portion
I this from quest that's one of the
issue oh how can we do that so see the
problem here is just try just try to
understand this we got all the question
IDs and the answer inside quest right
which is an object how can you pass
those things inside the query because I
want to execute this 45 times of
different values so I don't know there
are different ways of doing this if you
have some other better way just let me
know one of the way which I can do here
is I can create a queue ID array it will
be a static array for me and this array
will have all the questions I would say
against your business or typing this
code I have already written this
coordinate in is copy - so let me create
two arrays here one for questions and
one for answers okay and let me
face dot here okay be quite a point from
a rather drawing rate but I think your
URL contains unser yeah that's that's
right or the judge if I'm giving all the
answers on URL that's a very difficult
thing but then or the desert repeat
that's a bad thing I know we'll be
changing that request type from gate to
post okay so we will be changing that
budget and Gotham or if you if you can
just go to tennis court arm you can see
a website we are really like the same
website I mean we already have a website
we are just redesigning it okay so you
can see I have got all the question IDs
and all the answers so this quotient ID
array will have all the questions from
one to five and this answer will have
all the answers which are users user has
given so I'm fetching those questions
using question anyone coach I need to
and then it goes alright again you can
you can see this code anyone understand
what is what I'm doing now once I got
everything in this question IDs and
Unser's what I can do here is I can just
verify how can you verify I can replace
this Q ID with oh there is my java code
right so we have to point Q IV I just
hope you are good with concatenation
because I'm doing convolution
concatenation here and then this answer
will be having a short which do I have
to write answer of I when I got this
query and I'm I will running this query
how many times five times right and
every time it will give you a question
object some time it will give you a null
when your answer is wrong it will give
you it will give you null if you are the
fiance is wrong if you it will give you
object of question if you answer is
white so other just check if question is
not equal to null in that scenario
increment the value of score because the
default value for sport is zero I will
just increment the value of school if
your position is not null and that's it
at the end I will return the Xcode I
don't want to print this object every
time as you can see
with my question answer is right it will
increment is coder that's what we want
why we wanted to score so this verify is
returning you a int value let's go back
to question controller and here I am
accepting that end now I have to add
that end in MV object I will say MV dot
add object I want to set this code right
so I will say add object Oh what is MV
MV is down here so we'll say MV dot add
up check and in this add object I will
say I want to send a research and this
result will be a would be stored in
result itself to the caption would be
result and the values also reside okay
so we've got a question from hitman mr
structure safe from injection no okay so
this is not safe for SQL injection but
then we are learning in a basic way
right this is not for experienced people
this for facials so we can do this now
but then it is not safe this is not safe
okay so so we got we got the results
here like and then in the result our JSP
I want to print that thing so I've
already created is this this isn't our
JSP again design is not that good as you
can see we have already seen a design
page the result page is not that good
but then that's not the important stuff
for me at least now so I want to print a
result here and then also want to print
this percentage example if you score one
out of five the percentage is 20 if you
score 2 out of 5 the percentage is 40 so
in that case I want to send one more
thing I want to also cite the percentage
of the person so I will say mb dot add
object recently percent page as percent
and I will be sending a percentage now
how do you for Calcutta possibly is very
is in this case I will simply say result
into 20 so if you score one the
percentage will be like a 20 okay I know
that that's weird concept by then that's
how I code okay so
so I run this code let's see if we are
getting the output let me just go back
to my Safari the so for the best let's
hit enter or string some time because it
is loading it's loading ass loading
finger crossed and here we go can you
see that we got five oh that means all
the answers which are ticked all right
that's weird
let me just stick the wrong answer now
that was really weird
how can I get all white answer let me go
for wrong answers now that Britney
should go for one white answer I don't
know about other answers here okay see
that we have we got a different value
now because I once said only one right
answer so this thing is working so we
have we have asked for five questions
and then we have verified that it is
working right so Cheers
we the code is working the test is
working Bhagat ezel Paige now what I
want from you as a help I'm asking you
from a long time I don't know how when
you will support for support this see
this should be a two-way process right
if you are getting something from this
type of sessions I want something from
you as well so I'm expecting a good
design for this page of course no one
will like this type of design right so
please provide me a good design for this
you know what to do right you have to
quit as well Paige in which you have
just you just have to provide it in fact
I'll be showing this code on github and
you will just you can just pull this
project from github and make the changes
on the design page and send it to us
okay so that's what we'll be doing here
so yeah that's it we have we have worked
on result page today in the stos as you
can see again we are done decoding here
and let me show you the DAO page which
is this so inside now this is the code
we have written okay so this is our
agenda for today now next time next
