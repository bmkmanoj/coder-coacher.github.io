talk about the practical implementation
of mavin so in the last video we have
talked about the theory of mavin so just
to give a quick recap what is mavin so
mavin is a build tool so let's say you
want to create a new project in which
you want a project structure you want
something that will compile your files
you want something which will test your
application and you want something which
will give you all the required libraries
so the main problem arise when you have
you when you want to create an
application using spring so let's say
you want to build an application in
which you have to use spring maybe you
have to use hibernate for those spring
and hibernate we have we require some
dependencies which is libraries so I'm
going to work with hibernate you require
lab is to work with spring or starts you
require lab use now to to get all the
saplings you have to go to a website
which is like say spring dot IO and you
can download your libraries here that's
very easy right but the problem is so
when you go to go to this spring so
where you will get all the Java files
required so if you click on this project
you can see spring provides lots of
frameworks so we'll select spring
framework here and if I go to spring
framework I have option of download T
jar files and we have download link no
we don't have a download link so you can
see we cannot download the die base from
here the problem is even if you can
download you know if spring provides the
feature to download this that is if you
don't know about spring it's ok we are
just using spring in our application
because I'm making this video so that I
can work on string in future on this in
the success of tutorial but people who
are not concerned about spring they are
they are only watching this video just
to learn mavin so it's ok you might be
implementing spring using maven you
might be implementing hibernate using
maven so everything is almost same you
just have to deal with this part ok so
it doesn't matter if you're walking one
spring or not so come back to this
spring parts ok when you talk about this
download file so even if you can
download this putting libraries maybe in
future you're downloading the current
version which is for maybe in future you
have five so again you have not going to
establish by yourself right so as our
daughter / you have download all the
reviews what if you can just mention
someone in application that I want split
I will use and someone else you know but
not you maybe someone else a software in
your system which will download all the
required libraries and that someone is
mavin what you have to do is you just
have to use this type of text in your
application automatically to download
all the required Java Java files for
spring not one all that's the advantage
so how to use this part in your
application so we do not have to create
a normal web app McDonald codes our
application we have to create a mavin
application so for that we have to click
on new with equal click on another by
default when you create an application
you always choose Java project but this
time we'll choose Miami project because
we want to create a moment project we'll
click on next
it is asking for the default work
location and I will keep it as default
which is checked if you click on next
there are lots of options so you can see
a term here which is archetype so as we
have discussed in the last video so
archetype is just a template of your
project so let's say you want to build a
co java application so you have to
choose archetype
you have to create our web application
so you have to choose a different talk
type so you can see if you want to
create a web application you have to
choose this archetype which is mavin -
archetype - web app in this I will be
using a co-chair application so I will
be choosing this one which is mavin up
type QuickStart so QuickStart will give
you the coach of application so if you
think we don't we have only this number
of options and the answer is no so you
can also click on all catalog so as soon
as I click on all catalog you can see
something is happening here we just
tried trying to download all the
archetypes available in the remote
server
okay so mavin is a network ready
applicant work ready framework so
whenever you walk with mavin you have to
make sure you have
proper internet connection enabled so I
will not yeah so you can see I we have
lots of Ark types available so if you
want to work with App Engine if you want
to work with AWS for everything we have
a different octave available so you can
see this is App Engine we have lots of
of types here you rather than all the
sub types doesn't matter so we have to
choose the next one which is internal so
this is internal archetypes which will
choose nav and archetype we start and
then we will click on next so you can
see we have a group ID so basically
group ID is your package name so we will
say group ID is just a comm dot nubbin
and we'll make this application named as
a telescope ok that's my application
name so group ID is your package name
and then this artifact ID is your
project name so it pack the package name
combines the group ID is a confirmation
of group ID at artifact ID which is
common telescope and then that's it so
we'll click on finish so click on finish
it will create a project ok and then you
can see if you expand this maven
dependencies you already have a jar file
here ok now from where you're getting
this jar file so this document is coming
from the remote server but hold out
every time you create a new application
the jaffas will be coming for node
remote application since already have
created a project in which I have J unit
so what your maven will do is it will
create two repositories one will be the
mote repository second will be the local
repository the remote repository will be
on remote server and the local
repository will be on your machine now
how to check waste anymore trap AHS
Ettore so it is giving the path so it is
users knowing it's my user account name
and then the folder name is dot m2 which
is by default hidden folder in m2 folder
we have with a positive and it positive
we have the type of library which is
where is the problem
it is Ju 'not and then J unit and the
version 0.8.1
okay so just to confirm let's see where
it is where the file is so I will open
my terminal so if you are using Mac or a
Yonex so you can just open your terminal
and type LS and you can see we don't
have any folder called as dot - you say
dot M - so what we can do is we'll say
clear and we say LS v 1 a so as soon as
you say LS - a you can say you can see
there is a foldable dot M - so again
that's a clear we'll say LS not LS we'll
say CD dot M - so you are so currently I
am - M - folder and we say LS just to
list the folders I have a repository
folder let me go to deposit tree LS I
have all this folders here so you can
see there's a generate folder so say
silly J unit LS I get a gigantic folder
so say J connect LS and then we can you
can see we have two jar files one is
three point eight point one and then we
have three point eight point two so
maybe some you know maybe last time I
have created a project using the latest
Java file which is three point eight
point two but will not well have been
Chennai which version I want to use and
which jar files I need so in this first
structure you can see there is something
called as p om dot xml so the main part
of mavin this this valve is p om dot XML
so you can see all your configuration in
this file which is Bo m dot XML now also
call is formed or XML now in this you
have to mention something you have to
mention the group ID I can you to
Detroit all this thing when you create a
project you will get everything so you
will get a group ID you will get the
artifact ID and the packaging time so if
you're creating a job application it
will be a jar file if you are creating a
web application it will be a wire file
next of this then this is very important
for you this is called a dependencies
now whenever you put in an application
into an application if you want to use
any third party API so you have to
mention that dependency here so if you
want to use RJ unit in your project so
yeah
to mention this dependency since you are
mentioning a group idea j-unit artifact
ideas J unit and then version 0.8.1
that's why you are getting this one how
about let me do some experiment let me
write three point eight point two so
against it says building a workspace and
then it is it has changed three point
eight point two because it was already
in my local shop local local depository
let me know some expired oh no even that
exists three point eight point zero so
if I say you can say it takes some time
to build an adder so if we don't have
anything called as three point eight
point one or eight point zero maybe just
a wild try I have not done this
experiment before so I might get an
earlier so I'm getting in these others
so we don't have current available three
point seven point one we have three
point eight point one at the point eight
point two okay so that's how we have to
create this three part this generate
here now the next part is you have to
when you expand this folder SRC so you
can see not this is also not respond
this SRC so in a sense if we have two
folders one is main and test so if you
expand main you have Java so I hope you
remember the package name which is comm
dot nothing dot then is Co if I expand
to you I have a file which is app dot
Java and by default you can see we have
something called as HelloWorld awesome
right so you type right enjoy like this
where it is you will be getting the
basic code by itself and then this is a
better structure so the advantage of
using map in here is you get a project
structure you also get all the required
dependencies but hold on I want spring a
breeze now how to get those libraries
x time easy just open your palm file so
you can see we have a dependencies tag
here and then tin that dependencies we
have a dependency which is generated how
about if I add one more dependency now
how to do that just go to spring website
and just copy this dependency as we have
done we have navigated this part in the
shuttle tutorial so just copy the
dependency go to eclipse and paste and
see the beauty of
my oven now so you get all the required
jar files right and it is everything is
coming from the remote server I can
since I have done this application
before I am getting all this from the
local repository so if you are doing for
the first time it will download
everything from the remote repository it
will take some it may take some time
from 20 seconds to 1 minute depend upon
internet speed or maybe 10 seconds if
you are using a high-speed Internet
since I already have this into my local
repository it doesn't take much time
simple so this is how you have to create
a simple mavin application so the next
part will be talking about how to
implement spraying and how to achieve
dependency injection so I hope you have
laug liked this video so do thumbs up
you can see the bottom side it is a
thumbs up button and do comment if you
have any doubt I will try to resolve in
my next video
