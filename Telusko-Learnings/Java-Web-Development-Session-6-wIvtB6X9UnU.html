time again when I say last time not
talking about the last session talking
about the actual session which we did of
two weeks back not the not this week
session okay so if you remember we have
created of method for tense touristy and
which was returned me believe stuff
questions why so what do we do now is I
will simply Don the code let's see let's
see what happens now I just made one
more change in the project before going
before going live I have added or one
more tag here which is called as MBC
annotation driven because if you want to
use restful web services you have to add
this navigation which is MVC annotation
driven because you want to return a
adjacent file right so I have added this
annotation here yeah as I was talking
about the people who are joining for the
first time so if you are joining this
session for the first time we are doing
a live code here we are building a
project we are Riki signing my website
so if you don't know about that just go
to my website which is the disco calm
and have a look what executive squad com
is and you will understand what we are
trying to redesign okay so this is what
I have made a change we have changed MVC
annotation and this is the eighth
session okay so make sure you have seen
the earlier session to get debate
understanding of it okay so let me run
this code let's see if it is working or
not so if I say right run this code or
just taking some time to load okay done
so if I'm not wrong I'm using a port no
which is eight zero eight five and the
project name is tusk and we are
searching for test dot HTM so in a sense
when I send a request for test dot HTM
you can see it will try to fetch digit
data from the database and yet you can
see we got all the questions the awesome
thing is every time you on this code
every time you run this code you will
get our different questions why this is
what we have done in the last session
now the first thing is what you are
getting here is the least it is the
least of value okay so you are getting a
list of questions here but to make it
work I want to fetch adjacent file now
how do I fetch a different file you how
do I convert this data into JSON now
first of all if you compare these two
methods we have get questions and pests
you can see we have this same code
so let me remove the extra code there is
tension extreme of it simply you get
questions because even guests questions
will give you the same thing right so I
will say guys questions I would say get
questions dot HTM and if I do that okay
so you can see we are getting questions
but there's only one problem we are
getting more than what we expected
because it is giving you all the
questions i disremember i should i think
we should go for this one only because
this is get test question and that is
get questions okay so get questions will
give you everything and get test
questions will give you on each test
question so what I will do is I will
change this meter because nowhere I want
all the questions right I want on the
five questions so I will go with get
questions only which will fetch only
five questions and let me just go back
here when I say get questions now I made
the changes and it should reflect now
and you can see we got five questions
now every time an underscore do every
time I say enter it will give me five
questions now what I want is I want to
represent I want to fetch this data in a
page right example think about this if
you are a participant and if you want to
give a test just imagine if you go to my
website and if you see a question or
something like this you will not like it
right so you want questions in such a
way that you can actually attempt you
can actually give answers so of course
we need a GUI here we need a page where
you where you can show this question so
I have created a design design for this
so now I have created this design okay
now that stuff fingers I'm not that good
be designing so what I am doing is I
have I'm using the earlier design again
this design is open to change okay so
you can change the design of this so I
can change the design for this okay so
so this is designed which we did last
time so inertia okay okay this is what
we have done last time okay I mean the
same design here again this this design
is open for change if you want to if you
want to change something just let us
know what you want to give it to us so
there is design and so how it works
exactly so before a one of doing
anything extra one let me just run this
code let's see what happens if I fall
how do i call test dot JSP
so when I call for okay now first of all
we have to call that page
because this is the page which will be
getting called and you will see this
question
okay now question arise how do we call
this test or JSP because I want those
questions on test or JSP now to call a
test or JSP we need one more controller
so when you call for dot HTM it will
call for dot JSP so what do we do is I
will copy test dot HTM so I will copy
this code okay I do have a code already
I will just use that code and so
whenever I use the call for a test dot
HTM it will call test dot J's bin is
what we want here right so anybody call
for definition which we call it test dot
JSP let's let's see if it is working or
not let's go back to the Firefox and
let's say one and against taking some
time or we are calling for gate
questions right we should be calling
test dot HTM now if I run this code you
can see oh we are not getting questions
cancel as we got a page because the
design here but we have not we are not
getting the data okay so now we are not
getting data right so I want to put a
design here but not data so how do I get
the data here to get a data of course we
need to I some code right yes so what
I'm doing is and whenever whenever you
call for tests or a stream it will call
for tests or JSP droids now if you go to
tests or JSP I did I just read one more
thing here so in this state dot test dot
JSP if you go down you can see I am
sending adjacent requests now I don't
know how many I feel comfortable with
the JSON here or how many are
comfortably with jQuery now again this
this is not about jQuery Here I am NOT
Deadwood's it with J's or with jQuery so
what you have to do is you have to send
a request for get JSON so you have to
send a request and so I'm sending a JSON
request here and for that JSON request
I'm sending a request for get questions
oh but I am sending a request for gate
geez get questions and get questions
hands dot HTML let me remove that dot
HTM here I don't need that I would say
our request for gate Jason so we get
questions now this gate question should
return a JSON file right now
they what we did till now is whenever I
was whenever whenever I was running this
code I was getting those okay when I say
get questions now if I let me just show
you something if I say get questions not
dot HTM but without dot HTM if I say get
questions okay you can see we are
getting data but this data is not in
this we are not getting data in a JSON
format I want data in a JSON format so
to do that if you want to convert it
into JSON format you don't have to do
much about that okay you is very simple
what you have to do is you just have to
return these tough questions the awesome
thing about spring is spring internally
has a JSON library which will convert
your least into JSON you know you don't
have to do much about that in fact
earlier we used to do everything by
ourselves we used to we need to convert
a JSON file we need to I mean we have to
create a JSON file from the links but
now we have a inbuilt library called as
Jackson so using Jackson's we can
actually fetch data we can convert the
list of questions into a JSON format and
that's it let's try to work with this
now if I say get questions you will get
the same questions but in a different
format you will get adjacent format here
can you see that we got everything as
Justin format and that's what I love
about I love about Firefox you can see
we got everything in our operations
format again when you fire the same
query in in Chrome if I'm not wrong you
will get a normal JSON text but in
Firefox what you get is the conceived as
we got a normal JSON text here but
inspire Fox you can see everything in
JSON format it is much variable okay and
I can see we have 15 people watching and
10 likes and 3 dislikes come on guys you
can hit that like button to get to
motivate me okay so yeah so you can see
regards JSON via voice so what I'm going
to do now is in test our JSP I'm sending
a JSON request now this JSON request
will give you the JSON data right so
data which is we are getting here or not
this one but this one so whatever data
you are getting here you can actually
fetch so you're fetching that data which
goes to JSON 1 text so ok again if you
are if you are not familiar with jQuery
and I Jax request
so when you when you send our Jax
request so this is a Jax Equestria which
we can do that with the help of get JSON
method this is this is a jQuery stuff if
you're not comfortable with jQuery just
do watch the query videos and then you
will understand what I'm talking about
so get jason is a jQuery thing because
these how do we get how do we know that
this is jQuery so whenever you have
dollar and dot so whenever you say dot
and methods or function name that's a
jQuery thing okay so when you send a
jQuery thing when you print our -
requests it is pending request whatever
dita whatever response you get from a
server I mean you are getting a response
this you are getting this response from
a server right now that response will be
stored in JSON one so that response will
be Jason one now this Jason will is one
will have all the questions now what I
am doing now is first of all I am
fetching all the question IDs because
the idea is let's say if you get all the
questions and on the page you are
showing all the questions the moment you
are showing the moment you are showing
all the questions you have to give
answer so as a student you will give
answers now at the end when you click on
submit those questions and answers
should go to the flowers why for the
verification if you let's say out of 5
or 5 questions here once or 3 right
questions how do you verify those 3
right questions right or three right
answers so those questions will be going
to server so what are we doing now is I
will be sending the question ID and the
answer so whatever whatever answer you
gave to for that better version ID I
will send out on a server to do that and
first of all I am fetching all the
question IDs so from the Jason from the
Jason which is Jason once we ingest and
once we got all the questions void since
I am I am stretching all the question ID
which is which which I am storing in Q s
now Q s is an array here
well I have all the questions so they
got all the question ID nqs that's the
first thing we did the next thing what I
want to do is when the moment you load
your questions the moon the moment you
load your questions what it will do is
it will load that question and okay
first I think we should first run this
code just to get the understanding what
is happening behind the scenes so if I
paste s dot HTM and if I say enter can
you see that required question and we
got options as well I know the UI is not
bad good so the UI is not that good I
know about that but then at least we are
getting questions right so we got the
question and we got the option so when I
say my favorite technology of course
it's Java I was the next or which
compilation of java java application
ignore that spelling mistakes
application we have to use which
competitions this is a long question I
guess why the compilation of ok ok we
have to use a plus file and then Java ID
totally depend on ok we are not able to
print that saying ok that's a question
mark or that's - - concept so Java is
based on object oriented questions again
next one Java runs on bitch platform all
the platforms right we will click on
next and then ok we got the same
question again because of some database
issue that that's a different thing so
when I click on submit can you see that
we are sending all the data on the
address bar how exactly it is happening
so we are doing that we are doing that
on the on the test or JCP so if I go to
my editor again the entire project will
be uploaded on github one position gets
over so once the accession get session
gets over I will upload the same code
which we are doing now on github you can
access those codes and you can you can
make it work by your for yourself ok
so you can see we are sending a request
to verify for HTM so what I'm doing here
is we got all the questions from the
Samba server
I am so unsetting I'm sending a request
to get je get questions where I am
getting the JSON data so the moment I am
getting a data from from the server
which is going in a JSON 1 the from JSON
one I am fetching one one question so
that one question so see we've got five
questions I want to I want to show the
first question and to do that we have a
counter again the people who are good
with Java they know about this thing
right so they know I mean they know the
counter so initially counter will start
with 0 and then I am stretching the
first question to do that this is my
elements of the object page so we got a
portion number
you can see if you see the output if you
see the output here this is your
question number right circulation number
one we are getting that because of this
one because we have an element which is
q qn 1 q m in qn oh and then we got a
question if you are getting this
question because of this one I mean we
are getting this question because of Q
we are getting the options because of
option one option two option three
options for right and we are fetching
all this data from the JSON so whatever
data you got from JSON 1 we are
assigning that to Jason so you can see
regards Jason okay so regarded jason and
we assign that value jason went to Jason
here and we are fetching data from Jason
now you might be wondering why I did
that why I copied the concept con
content from Jason 1 to Jason it's
because the moment I click on next what
should happen when I click on next
because the moment I click on next it
should increment the value right it
should increment the value of this 1 to
2 and then it should also change the
question to do that we have created or
something called as a dot click I mean D
click function okay so we got a click
function here and that click function is
happening on our next element so the way
we have next element we also have a
previous element vector if I scroll down
we have a previous element I mean the
code may look difficult but then once I
upload this code on github okay so the
moment you click on github you will get
the entire project and then you can have
a look on the code you will get D clear
understanding of it okay so okay so we
got this thing the guard oblivious so we
got we got before function of you got
the next question we got the next button
and record of previous version right so
when you click on next this is what
happens when you click on so when you
click on previous it will go back so
every time you click plus I mean every
time you say next it will increment the
value of I and every time you say
previous it will decrement the value of
I okay so when you click on next button
this is what happening right it is
changing the question every time you
click on next so when you click on next
it changes the question okay so it is
happening because of this I plus plus
the thing is if you remember this Jason
one so Jason one is a
the point where you are getting all the
questions right and the scope of Jason
was different one is only for this
particular method which is not available
for the next one right and that's why
what I did is I have created one more
variable which is called a Jason so that
when I get this data from Jason one I
can assign that value to Jason so that
now this jason has a bigger scope right
it can be accessed from anywhere and
that's why we are doing here so we can
access that Jason from anywhere it can
be accessed from so in the next in the
next dot click as well I can access that
Jason thing so I can access Jason here
so so we can access that in next and we
can also access that for preview okay
now what next now once we got this thing
there getting all this questions right
so you can see when I say a while
compile of java application okay so when
I click on next next next we are getting
all this data right now question arise
when I click on end
text and test what happens when I click
on none of this and when i say next when
I say iOS that's a long answer I know so
when I click on any of this answer here
and when I click on end test what
happens I want to send all your
questions and answer all the servers
right because the verification will be
done on server now how do you think
we'll be verifying this thing so to
verify we have so what I've did is with
on that on that button which is end test
so if I go to design now so can you see
that when you say and test the moment
you say end test which is the better
which is the button you can see on the
screen it calls a function called as go
now go is a function in JavaScript I
mean it's not a predefined function we
have created that function here and that
function is defined somewhere below so
somewhere here okay so can you see that
we got a go function here now every time
you click on n test it will call a go
function now inside go function what I'm
doing is whatever it whatever you have
selected all we have one more point here
which are forward what happens when you
click on next because see if you if you
are waving this first answer here if I
if you are giving the first answer is
let's say a SS when you click on next we
want to preserve that data right
whatever you have selected in the last
answer so I am doing that in one of the
adder here so every
you click on next okay wait is that so
every time you click on next you can see
we are checking which one is actually
checked before
so is it opt one which is checked in
that case it will assign it will answer
the answer would be one if it is opt to
which is checked it the answer would be
2 if the opt three-straight the answer
would be 3 the opening four is straight
down so before so we are also saving
that data somewhere so we have an array
which is called as answers in which you
are storing all the data right so at the
end when you click on go you have to
send two things you have to send the
question IDs and you have to send the
answers so if you remember question IDs
are stored in queue s and now the
answers are stored in answers so we have
two arrays one a day has question IDs
and second ad it has answers I hope
everyone you are getting the stuff which
one to be as to which we are talking
about we are talking now in case if you
are new to this session you have to
watch earlier five or six videos just to
get the understanding what we are doing
the live project okay so we got a
question IDs here and we got answers
right I want to send this question IDs
an answer okay one more thing when I
when I click on this end end test after
clicking next next next when I click on
end test can you see that in address bar
what we are sending is we are sending T
name because if nu is whenever you give
a test you have to give a test based on
some topics wide it may be Java it may
be C++ it may be any of any language so
in that case when you have we have to
specify the language as well again we
are not verifying that here that will be
doing later
the main focus here is this this answers
so the question I do one which are
selected I mean the question ID 1 is 12
because we are getting random questions
right so you can get questions on anyway
then we are getting the answer 1 h2
because I have cited the second option
for question ID 2 which is 9 as I said
the answer which is again 2 for question
93 asserted the answer 1 override it -
and I guess for every Unser's rated the
for every question of cited the second
answer that's why you can see all the
answers are 2 - 2 I want to send this I
want to send this question to this I
want to send all this thing to
hours right the way I have created that
URL is by using a for loop so using the
concept of appending you know if you
remember the quantitation operator using
the quantitation operator I have
concatenated everything to create one
request and I'm sending that request to
the server by calling very pedestrian
I'm sending the T name and then I'm also
sending the JSON data so I'm sending all
the Daytona's
okay now it is not a distance format
actually I'm sending data in any
particular format I'm just giving an
Impala jason okay because I was doing
some experiment and then later I
realized instead of sending a JSON
request we can also send a normal data
in fact it will be better if you send
the question of post format because if
you use post by default we are sending
our get request right I want to send a
post request very aware you will not see
all the things on the address bar and
then once you've got the link we are
calling that page using JSP calls and
that's why you are getting that page
which is verified of this TM but then
question arise we are calling for verify
that so well so we have to create one
more controller which can work with
verified or this GM okay now the thing
is okay B so going ahead if you are new
to this session just click on the like
button so that I will know that you are
liking this session so I'm sending this
request to verify the HTM right and so
we have to create a controller to exit
that light so in the quotient controller
we have to create a controller which can
accept the request for verifies of this
TM so what I will do is I will create a
controller here I will mention something
like this okay so I have created this
verify that HTM so whenever I use a
calls for way for the extreme I will
call this verify method
now this verify methods will take
multiple parameters as you can see we
cause question ID one I have just
written only for questionary one we
should be writing for caution id24 also
ID one on sorry to all those things
right we can do that but instead of the
addition of having all those values
there is one way you can create a class
here and if you can send all this data
there so what I would recommend you
people to do is you try this code by
yourself create a class - class will
have ten parameter then properties
cautionary one question I need to
question is Rico Shanti for question is
5 and so one answer to assess we also
for
five so in total you will be having 10
properties create a class with ten
properties the advantage would be here
you simply has to use a delayed motor
attribute and let's name that class as
maybe a question/answer class so great a
classless question answer and create
just use motor attribute and it is you
can string to specify the object of that
and all the questions answer will be
stored in that class and later on you
can verify what is this code okay so in
this session we have we are focused mode
on the verification or the design so
again I will be uploading this project
on github for you to watch or to check
so download the project have okay so
clone this project from github I will
look input this project on your on your
IDE and just make it work with that and
try to complete this thing again I will
be completely completing this thing and
I will upload the project on github for
you to watch or do for for you to clone
it so yeah and in the next in the next
live session we will be talking about
result generation how can we generate a
result if you get all this questions so
yeah that's it this is what I wanted to
talk to you I mean I wanted to convey to
you today this let me let me go for a
quick recap what we have done so first
of all I wanted to fetch all the
questions and that's what I am using get
questions so the moment you say get
questions it will fetch all the
questions from the from the database on
it will return you this question the
thing is these questions will be
returned in this in a JSON format but
this is why we are getting JSON format
here is because of response body the
moment you say response body it will
return a JSON format right okay now
which why these in one of the xml is
because by default string supports jason
that's why we are getting Jason here so
once we got a JSON data we are sending a
JSON data okay that's good okay we need
to call this from somewhere right so
what I am calling is from the address
are from the browser I am calling for
test dot HTM so I am calling for test
dot HTM the moment I call for test dot
HTM I can see I am getting a question I
am NOT just just getting one question
I'm getting five questions
now those five questions are actually
coming from database and so when we call
schedule HTM they're actually calling
tests or JSP this test dot JSP is
sending a jack request which is a earth
single request to the server to get
decent data and what we are doing is we
are fetching one one question at one
time so every time you click on next you
will get a next question again we are
not sending five requests okay we are
sending only one sequel so we are not
wasting lotsofs our time we are not
wasting lots of bandwidth here so we are
sending only one request we are getting
five questions and we when you click on
the next recruit gate it will give you
the next course that's how the things
are working here okay so every time you
click on next you it is going for next
and the moment you click on end test
that end test will take you to the next
question and it will it will submit your
question to the server and the way you
can do that is by I hope you know the
concept of window dot locations or
gesture which will which was send a
liquid which will rewrite your request
to some others others other link
so whatever think you provide here will
will will take you to that link and for
that I have created a link which is
verified on HTM and I'm sending all this
data now in very Indic ocean controller
I am creating our method which is
verified on HTM where you how my toggle
is verified which is taking only one
parameter now you have to change this
code for the entire object so yeah this
is what you have to do if you have to
complete these project and make it work
in the next session will try to complete
this code in fact I will become in this
code and I will upload this project on
github and we will try to do the results
model in the next session so that fits
on this session everyone so let me just
stop the recording this video will be
uploaded for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
