and in this video we'll talk about
pointers in C but we'll also talk about
how to fetch a daze on how to work with
arrays using pointers now we we have
already talked about what is pointers
right so what is a pointer it refers to
the address or it refers to the value of
an address which is it stores right so
let's say we have a variable which is I
and the value of I is five so we can
provide if we can't save the address of
I instead of pointer which is P as
ampersand I and then we can fetch the
value of I using star P right that's how
it works but let's say how to use
pointers with Aries now to do that let
me take a day here okay so let me take
it a day so let's say we have a int a
day so we have int I and I will provide
this box which refers to the size of the
a day then we can provide some element
so let's say the elements are five Oh
not six let's say the value is three I
will say H then we have nine then we
have seven let's four so we have this we
have this value so we have six values
now how to print this value so normally
what we do let's say let's not keep it
on it say this is what let's say this is
int value so have a variable Yuma's
values right now how to print this value
so what we do we use we use a variable
it's a I and the value of I usually will
be one let's work with this so we have
we apply a for loop right and then we
say I or let's not use for Louis let's
let's fetch each value individually so
what we can do is we can fetch the value
of this a day using values in bracket
you convention zero right so this will
fetch the first element right which is
which is five if I say values one it
will fetch the second element if I say
values - it will fetch the third element
right it will fetch this one eight now
how do you point a zero so you should
off using value so let's say we have a
printf feel so we have inside up to
interfere so in shove
using array index number we can use
pointer so let's say we have printf and
after comma let's say we have this
person D we can simply say it is star
values now the advantage will be you
don't have to mention the index number
you if you write star values what it
will give you it will give you the first
value which is 5 so by default if you
mentioned star values it will give you 5
okay then I want I don't want 5 right I
want 8 so before that how it works so if
we talk about this a day it will store
inside a memory right and this value
this value refers to the first location
so if you have an array okay and this
values this variable refers to the first
location and as soon as you say star
values it will fetch the value of the
first location but I don't want the
first location I want the next location
right so what you can simply do is you
can say values plus 1 you should say
values plus 1 now what it will give you
is it will say ok value is the first
location plus 1 the second location and
then you are saying star so it will give
you 3 now instead of 1 if you say 2 it
will give you the third element which is
8 ok so that's how you fetch values with
the help of pointers ok so we can we can
also we can work with an array with
pointers which are simple but let's say
I don't have a one dimensional array I
have two dimension earlier than what so
in that scenario what we need what we
will need is the first thing that you
specify that we have a two dimensional
array which says we have 2 &amp;amp; 3 so we
have a two dimensional array here with
two lows and three columns so how it
will look like so basically if anybody
create this type of array
the representation is something like
this so we have a adding inside that you
have 5 3 8 that's your first added first
row the second row will be 9 7 4 right
so that's your second row giving out
deploy semicolon so we have added so
this is how it looks like right so it
will be 5 3 8 9 7 4 so that is if that's
one way of reading two dimensionally
this is the second way we can also write
everything in one line in fact this will
do okay so we can define a
two-dimensional array with this box here
and how we match it with the story
inside of memory it will be like two
rules we will be having two rows and
three columns right so first one it will
be five then we have three then we have
eight nine seven and four now how to
fetch this values using arrays so what
we do we say value so let's imagine we
are inside a printf okay so if I say
values and 0 comma 0 so of course which
value will be betting it so let's say
this is 0 1 0 1 2 so if I say 0 0 I will
get 5 right if I say 0 1 I'll be getting
3 and if I say maybe 1 1 I'll be getting
7 right that's how we fetch values but
what if if I remove the last box here so
this represents the row number right so
if you talk about this - so this is rule
number this is this is column number
right so the first bracket deals with
the row number the second bracket deals
with the column number so if I remove
the column number this represents the
whole row okay so this represents so if
I say values 0 so it will represent the
first row if I say values 1 it will
represent 2nd row but I don't want the
whole row I want only the first element
of the row so I want 5 so we can write
star okay so that as we have done in the
single dimensional array just had to
specify star it will face the first
value but then question otherwise I want
to fetch this second value so simply you
can you can do is you can give a bracket
okay and say plus 1 so it is the first
row second column because this this up
this plus represent second one the
second column right so that's how we can
work with too emotionally but hold on we
still have added here right if I remove
this array we can do that also if you
remove that and if we just have to give
one more star so how it will look like a
if I say star star and if I say values
so now it will give me value which is
five okay this is five year so it will
give me five
I don't want a five on three so simply
for this three so this is your row
counter so that's your row counter and
this is your column okay so we just have
to say value so that's values and we can
simply add by one okay but we have to
provide a blanket here so I had to
provide a blanket so if I provide a
bracket here so this will change this
row okay so if I provide a bracket here
for this star it will take you to nine I
don't know what nine I want I want three
for that you have to provide a bracket
so you have to place a plus you have to
say plus one okay so you have to give
one more bracket okay so that's how it
work again I will see that how to where
to give bracket when we start with the
practical okay so you can work with
two-dimensional array okay with with
with your with pointers uh let's say let
me ask you a question now so let's see
if I write something here so if I say
star star values plus one plus one now
any guess what I what output will be
getting so try this try but try out this
thing and let me know in the comments
section what output will be getting here
okay so let's see what output you get
and we see in the practical session so
