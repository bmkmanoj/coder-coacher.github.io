let's try to code it so in this way what
we have done is we have taken a image
view we have taken edit text then we
have taken two radio buttons and we have
email and password field now what we
want here once you click on this button
which is create account it should show
you some text what we have entered here
so let us say if I entered Naveen and if
I select mail if I enter my email ID and
password once I click on create it
should show the details at watch that is
what we're expecting from this code now
before going for this will first check
if this button is working or not now how
to do that for then first we have to run
this code to check if it's working or
not so once I click on this button it
will run the application I have already
opened my emulator here so if I open it
so you can it will like some time to
load again so what we expecting so once
you click on this button should have
something should happen right and let's
try it out so it's waiting waiting
waiting and okay we got oh what's that
now the problem is I have created
multiple activities in my in my project
right so you can see we have three
activities here so that is my layouts
okay so if you see I have different you
have different activities here so we to
run this this form right which is which
is sign up activity for that we have to
go to Android manifest so we can see we
have created lots of activities here
what we will do will just take this
intent filter which is responsible to
launch the activity and will cut this
part and will paste it here
is this this is intent filter and you
have to mention the name of your H name
of your activity or so this is this is
possible to launch your activity and
this is your activity which is sign up
activity so it will launch the activity
you are working with so let's go back to
this sign up and knowledge ones than
this again let me just pause the pause
the video so that it will not waste time
now you can see we got the output as
name and then it is providing me this
detail once I click on this button you
can see nothing is going on right
nothing is happening so in order to
provide the action to a button we need
to add a listener by default your button
is dumb or deaf so we need to add a
listener there now how to add the
listener for that you have to go to your
Java code that's here let's go to sign
of activity and to assign a listener to
your button first we have to create a
object for the button or reference for a
button so we'll say this is button we'll
say B equal to not equal to here we have
to assign the object inside this
oncreate so we have to say this is B
equal to then we have to say find view
by ID we are we have already mentioned a
name for that button and the name is it
is BT and sign up can you see that so we
can see our dot ID and we can say this
is BTN seinem now the problem is this
find view by ID will give you the view
we want to be specific I want a view
with the type is button so this is
button view type okay okay so once we
have got the button so to add the
listener to your button you have to say
B dot set on click listener which will
take an object of on click listener we
have seen this in the last video which
is we have done for addition right so we
will create object of onclicklistener
here and how to do that okay so we say
this is new view dot on or not view
let's let us say control space it is on
click listener
as that Oh
so we have to say this on click is
nowadays we got view dot on click
listener and inside this there you have
there's a method called as on click
which so every time you click on a
button this method will be called now if
you don't know what is this you can just
go back go back to my channel and watch
a video about inner glass ok so you can
just you can just search for that video
there I have talked about how to use a
anonymous inner class ok now in this
what we'll do is we'll try to plain
something now what what I want to print
I want to show a detail on the screen
like a pop-up thing so to do that we
have to use something else toast and
we'll say toast dot make toast which
takes three parameters the first
parameter is on bit screen will say on
the same screen and to mention that we
have to say signup activity dot this the
second we have to mention this is it
text what we want to show we'll say this
is clicked and the third we have to
mention let us say the duration so we'll
say this is toast dot long duration so
it will be there for a longer time right
and that let us run this code now and
let's open the activity it will take
some time to load
output here if I click on this button
which is create account Oh
nothing is happened right so you can see
nothing is going on so the thing is once
you say make text we have to also
mention that we need to show this we
have to say dot show that is important
right so if you want this code now once
again
if I click on this button you can see it
is it is showing clicked and you can see
the duration it is wait for a longer
time right
you can also mention instead of saying
length underscore long we can also say
length underscore short it will be for a
short duration so that's how you click
on a button but we don't just want that
button we also want to show the text
right so for that we need to fetch all
the text which is present in your on
your forum or your page activity so how
to fetch that if we have name we have a
gender we have email ID and password
so for that we need to create all these
buttons or the objects so the first is
textview or not text blue that is your
edit text right so we have to say edit
text we'll name this as name obviously
this is et name ok the next thing we
require is again we require to my edit
text and we say this is for email
this is et email and next is for
password edit text et Pass okay now next
we require for video button so we'll say
this is radio button we'll say r1 same
thing for r2 we'll see just reuse the
code and we also require button radio
group so we'll say this is radio group
and we say this is our G okay so we have
we got all this objects this is r2 now
once we got all these objects we have to
link this objects with the XML file and
to do that we have to mention this is a
e
T email with fine view by ID if you say
r dot ID and that will be input email
and then you have to mention here as
edit text okay now next let's reuse the
code again so next is for password we'll
say this is a tea pass okay and we have
to say this is input password next is
for names
we'll say 80 named Sigma doesn't matter
so we can say it it texts oh I should be
using reusing the code right so that
paste and this instead of this password
you have to say this is a name now once
we got all the reference or we are still
remaining with button group and so the
radio good radio group and radio button
and so for radio button we say R 1 equal
to radio button and we'll say this is
fine view by ID and we have a convention
ID dot was the name of radio button I
forgot that was F right so R 1 is F and
R 2 is M male and male female so that's
our two here sorry and that's M now we
took provide for radio group also will
say rj equals you again let me just let
me just type for this we say this is
radio group fine view by ID we'll say r
dot r dot it was the radio group name ID
suta group itself now once we got all
the reference here sorry
now will try to print all these details
with kind I'm sorry yeah so we had to
print all these details in on this on
click event
have assigned all the reference now
let's try to print the values to do that
we have to face the values first
so we'll take a string which will have
names we'll say string name and this
data will be coming from et name right
and how to fetch so anyway you want to
dig fetch the data so if you are
familiar with swing or VB so you know
there's something has get text right so
we got get text but we have to also
convert that text into a string from a
string format because this get text will
give you a format of edit text we want a
string right so we have to say to string
then we have strength in spring what a
male will say e-mail equal to the same
thing we can say 80 email and we'll say
get text dot to string and the same
thing for password we say this is string
password so actually this is not the
right way of fetching password right we
are hacking we are hacking a software
you so we say get text and to string so
we caught the password also now so once
we got name email and password let's
walk with this and let's see let's see
the radio button later so I want to
print all this data on the not toast
will say will print everything inside a
console so I want to print on the
console here now how to do that what I
will do here is I will simply say s out
which will print our system to order
printer which will print on the console
I will print the name first I will say
this is name okay and we'll say plus it
should print name then next thing will
print is email on the next line services
slash n will say this is email plus and
that's email sorry the next thing we
have is what a password so we'll say
this is password and that's my pass ok
and everything is good
yeah so now there is one thing whenever
you want to access a variable inside a
anonymous inner class so this very those
variables should be final right because
it doesn't allow you mutations so we
have to make it final okay now let's run
this code let's see what what what will
happen here so if I on this code
but the screen let's enter values so
we'll say this is Naveen that's vo2 I
cannot type on keyboard now I have to
use this
so that's Naveen doesn't matter what
what gender we select anyway if I say
even if I select male doesn't matter
right because it we are not fetching
that value let's say this is N and at a
rate GG and the password let us say this
is h h YY so that is the password we
have entered right and as soon as I
click on create account it says click
and you can see we got the details here
so we got name which is blank we got
email which is blank and we got password
which is blank
okay the problem is we should fetch this
detail inside the con clicker right
because we are entering the data after
loading your screen right so we have to
cry this inside on click so will again
run this
was a we were trying to face this detail
outside the on click right and we are
entering data after this screen is open
so so this like this method will execute
when your screen gets created so we are
entering data after that so we to face
that detail after the on click method
right so let's enter some data now once
again this goes via data's will say this
is n n I am timely Xena so this is n n
at the rate GG and the password is again
h h YY and if i click on this button you
can see we got a data we got name we got
email and required password right so
that is how you fetch data from a text
edit text but now we want to also use
the radio buttons right now how to fetch
data from radio buttons is not that easy
as it seems
so let's fetch the radio button data so
let me create a string MSA this is
gender the initial value for this will
be blank and we'll check here so if now
how to verify which it if it is checked
so the radio the first video by the name
is r1 now this r1 has a method called as
is checked now what is each trait if you
are ready button selected it will give
you or if you read when you subtract it
will give you true right in that
scenario will say gender equal to male
oh other one is female Y so that's V
male and will give a semicolon else will
say this is gender equal to male right
and knowledge and will also play in the
gender so we'll say this is plus slash n
and will say this is a gender plus also
of that way let's make it more fancy Oh
instead of printing the gender will
print the will say will not say gender
will say salute okay and we'll say this
is salute if the first is selected which
is female will say this is
mess and this is salute this is mr.
right and here I will print before name
will plant or not here but here will
print salute and some space plus even we
do not give a space we are we require
space with dot right now if I run this
code let's see what happens and if I say
run
once again of this time let's go for BB
let's select female and we'll say email
id as BB a date CC and we'll say
password GG YY so once we haven't at
that let us click on create account and
we caught miss BB it is because we have
selected female right so that is how
your radio buttons radio button work
even we can also print this detail
inside a toast so let us let us meet let
me take this whole detail and let us
copy this and you should off type ensure
printing clicked let's print this data
and let us see what happens if I run
this again
the values will say this is PP mail RR
that's okay so we said this is duty at
the raid PP that sound like DP right
well so this is password and and let's
click on this and you can you got the
details as a toast flight so we got
because we got it for the shorter
duration because we are mentioned it as
short write that short here so that is
how you fetch data from radio button
that is how you do it right but that is
not the best way to do it there is
another way using which you can do this
and let's see what that way now now how
to do that so the problem is on this
screen we have only two radio buttons Y
so let's say we have 20 radio buttons
what you will do you will write if-else
for 20 times that is not the best way
right so will come in this part since
this is not the best way now what is the
best way here so the best way will be
create there is a method with radio
group itself so we'll say this is our G
dot so there is a method called as get
checked radio button ID now this will
return you ID which will let us say this
is int I that's an ID you will be
getting now I do not want the ID right
we want the radio button itself so we'll
create a radio radio button here and
we'll say this is our be equal to this
is our G dot find view by ID in which
you have to mention the index which is I
I here and depend upon the index it will
give the radio button so if you select
you first why it will give you the first
video button if you say a second why to
select it will give you a second radio
button right and we have to also convert
this into a radio button now this will
give you the radio button which you have
selected okay but okay now how to verify
so what we'll do is we'll say you have
will print the text not the solute here
so let me remove this solute and let us
print the gender itself just to make it
more effective so not here let me just
comment this part inside toast only I
will print it
after the password so here I will say
against Plus we'll say this is gender
we'll say plus and this is radio button
which is RB dot get text it will give
the text which which we have mentioned
there and to shrink so if you select
male it will give you male if you
selects female it will give you female
right and does not matter if you even if
you have 20 radio buttons doesn't matter
it will give you the button you have
selected you do not have to apply if
else every time let me run this code now
okay
into details here let's say this is FF
female and they say FF at the rate D D
and that is my password AAA and if I
click on this great account you can see
we caught the gender as female if I
select male and if I click on create it
says male right so that's how we can we
can we can work with radio buttons we
have two ways either we can use if-else
and is we can say is checked all we can
use this way so that's the best way of
doing this so that's it from this video
so I hope you liked you have liked this

there's one more thing if you have any
suggestions for the tutorials for
