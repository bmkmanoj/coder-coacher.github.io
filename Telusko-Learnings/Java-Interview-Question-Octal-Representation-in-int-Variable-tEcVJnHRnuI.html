series in this will write a code and you
have to guess the output okay
so the code is let's say we have paint I
and the value of I is seven okay and if
I print this seven if I print the value
of I so of course the value is 7 right
so don't have to guess that let me run
this just just to print so value is 7
right what happens if we write 0 in
front of 7 nothing nothing right if you
run this now such till 7 right so what
is doing it's removing this 0 that's it
let's change the code let's try to write
0 1 0 okay so which means it will print
10 right so it will skip this 0 because
0 is on the left side or you can say on
the most significant bit doesn't matter
okay and now for on this boom the answer
is 8 wide so so in interview they will
give you this question okay this this
code and they will ask you to guess the
output okay maybe there will be round
you have to guess the output and if you
say the answer is 10 and then you're
wrong the answer is 8 then question
arise why the answer is 8 it's because
whenever you represent a number starting
with 0 so whenever you start a number
with zero it directly becomes a octal
number okay and when you say in octal
number when you talk about 10 it is 8
okay so I hope you know how to convert a
decimal my doctor number just try to
convert this octal number into decimal
number it you will get 8 so by default
this number here is an octal number just
give up give one more try let's try to
write one zero one double zero and the
answer will be getting is 64 okay so
let's try to convert this this octal
number into integer you will get 64 so
pointer remember whenever you use 0 in
front of any integer number it becomes
octal okay so that's it from this video
and the next part will talk about
less about the hexadecimal system so
thanks so much for watching and do
subscribe for the further videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
