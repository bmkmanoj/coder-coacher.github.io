ready from the disco learnings and in
this video we'll talk about vectors so
it is vectors so a vector is a type of
list so vector implements list and it is
almost same as a de least so if you
people are familiar with other lists you
know then you also know vectors then
it's just a name right so what is vector
so if I go to the implementation of
vector so a basically vector is a
dynamic array in which you can increase
the size of a vector okay you can
increase the size of the array now in
case of so you also say we have least we
have at least we have a collation
framework right so we can do the same
stop with collection framework so one of
the thing is let's say if I start with
vector so let's say we have a vector V
equal to new vector now the advantage is
this vector is so it mean put the
package control shift o so this vector
is a dynamic array which means we can
add the elements so we can add elements
dynamically and you can it will increase
this size automatically so let's say if
I add V dot V dot add four so it has a
value which is four now if I add one
more value it says sex so let's say we
have two values and I can also print the
so in this way we have a method which is
capacity which will print the current
capacity fine on this code so you can
see the default capacity for this is not
this is not because of the addition
let's change the values and you can see
this is not the addition of two those
two numbers okay so we are adding these
two values for 97 and the capacity is it
is printing as 10 right so by default
the added capacity is 10 but what if you
add the value so if I add some values
here let's say 6 and let's add some
let's let me add the same values again
and again so let me copy it and we'll
paste it here so I don't know how many
add it so this is 4 and this is 6 so you
can see we have the cutting capacity as
10 and have added 10 values as I said on
this we got 10 let's run this again and
you can see it is 20 now right so
because if you if you exceed this size
it will make the
positive 20 so that means vector
increase the increases size by 100
person so initial size was 10 so now it
is 20 and if I add a 20 value so let me
just copy this and paste and if I want
this thing so you can see the capital T
is 40 so this is the case with vectors
right so it it increases the capacity as
per the user requirements so as soon as
you exceed the current limit it will go
to the double of it value I mean it is
it will increase the capacity by 100
percent okay so let me just print out
all those values let me change some
values here let me make it seven let me
out y seven let me make it nine and
we'll make it - we'll make it 61 we'll
make it 65 so we have this values how to
plan the spending is a very simple as we
have done in the array we can use
enhanced for loop here so we can use a
int I in V okay is it okay so now it
gives a problem it says we cannot
convert directly so instead of int will
will take object because we have we are
not using genrich's here right we also
apply genrich's here right so but let us
okay let's apply generation how to apply
genrich's we can simply say we have all
the values as integers alright so we can
mention integer here and now instead of
object we can say int we can so this all
values are int values now so we can
print those values we can say print I
for me but before printing the value it
may print the capacity here right and if
I on this code so you can see we are
printing all the values so that's the
capacity and then we are printing all
the values right so this is how vector
works you can add elements again even
you can remove elements so we can say V
dot remove and we can remove the second
element we can remove this 7 here and if
I say index number one so it will remove
7 by the way I will let me take the so
that if you see the output there is no
change in the sequence right so we have
added for first so it is 4 then 7 now if
I run this by removing the first element
you can see 7 is not there now right so
we can also remove elements
can add elements we can do all those
stuff so this this is our vector work so
this is a dynamic array so we can call
it as dynamic added right and if I go to
vector so vector is the implementation
of list interface which itself so you
can see vector came in jdk 1.0 at least
came in 1.2 and that's the does it trick
here so vector is there from a long time
so when the first time java was
introduced it came with vector and later
vector was modified to work with list
right so even before collection
framework so you can do the same stuff
with collection framework right so
instead of using collection framework we
can also use vectors but collection
framework was introduced on 1.2 and
vector is there from 1.0 then question
arise when to use vector and when to use
as it is because both both this will do
the same thing right so so now we'll
talk about the difference between added
lists and vectors because added list is
the implementation off list and even
vector is the implementation off list so
which is better
let's have a look so let me just comment
this section of vector the whole section
here okay that's not this one let us
come in till this point okay and now
let's create an added ease so let me
create an added list okay of integers
and we'll name this as V as well so
we'll say this is as a risk
oh that's not a list so this is add a
list right and we'll give a semicolon
there package is already imported now
before adding any elements you can see
we can see if it's not specifying the so
there's no method called as capacity
here that's it at the case Agnetha
capacity is undefined for this so we
cannot use this method capacity let's
see something else so if I say dot so we
have a method which is size right and
you fire on this code you can say size
is zero and do we have any other method
to get the capacity here oh okay let's
try let's get some method to check the
capacity so we don't have any method to
get the capacity here is it the case so
we don't have any method to get the
capacity here so the thing is whenever
you work with adit whenever you work
with vectors so vector if if you exceed
the limit it will increase the capacity
by 100% but that is not the case with
additives it will increase the capacity
by 50% okay so this will help you to
manage the memory right so vector waste
lots of memories and added East will
save the memory second difference this
vector is so if you go to vector it is a
synchronized so it is synchronized by
default so you can see we have every
method in vector they are synchronized
that means it's a thread safe right so
theoretically it is thread safe not
practically so we can also it also get
affected by threads so it says it is
thread safe but not practically so
theoretically vectors are thread safe
and others are not thread safe okay so
we have the first difference vector it
is it takes it increases the capacity by
hundred percent to add additional
increase the capacity of a fifty fifty
percent and vector is thread-safe
added it is not okay those are two
difference the third difference since it
is a thread safe it is slow and since it
is not read so if it is fast okay so in
all in all at least wins the argument
here so if you compare between this to a
catalyst and vectors added edged is the
winner okay then how when to use vectors
when it is specifically mention that you
need to work with vectors then only work
with vectors otherwise always prefer
added edge because it is how it is much
superior than vectors you know I don't
know why people teach vectors in the
colleges or why it is compulsory to use
vectors in a week when we can use at
least I think because of the outdated
syllabus we have so yeah we can you
should know about vectors but you should
you should not use vectors in the
project always use at least okay so
that's it from this video so now at
least wings and that is the introduction
for vectors
