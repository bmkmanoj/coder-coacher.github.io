video we'll talk about how to call a
private method so what I have here is I
have a method which is show which is a
public now so if I make it private so
let me make this method as private so in
order to call this method so can we call
a private method of course not right so
in our convention we cannot call the
private methods from outside the class
so we can call a private methods from
inside the class right but let's say I
have another class which is efficient
demo here and from this class I want to
call this show method so for that we
need to use something called as a
reflection API so we have reflection API
so reflection API is a part of Java in
which you can get the you know if you
want to know the behavior of a class if
you want to know the fields of a class
if you want to know the class the dot
class file is an interface or the class
file you can or you can verify all this
thing's using reflection API so
basically we can use affliction API for
testing we can use for different
different purpose to know - and to get
the understanding of the class we can
use reflection API but in this example I
will be using reflection API to call
this private method ok so now how to
call this private method so for sure
whenever you want to call a method via
instance so we'll create a instance not
in a normal format we'll create an
instance using a class concept so if you
don't know how to create a object using
class concept you can search for a video
in my channel which will describe the
way to create an object using class so
we'll say class C and we'll say class
dot for name and the class the object I
want to put it from class which is your
test so we will say comm dot now in dot
test because this test class belongs to
a package called as comm dot naveen now
what next we have so
once you got the glass let's create the
object so I need object of ten service
it s t equal to so in odd in instead of
using new keyword here or new test we
can simply say tis class dot new
instance okay this class dot new
instance will give you the Z dot
instance will give you the object of
object I need object of test so we can
just type caster's so after typecasting
we got the object of test now say by
default we have this method which is
private right so in order to call the
method we need to create our object of
method class okay so we'll say method M
equal to B now what we can simply do is
here we can say C dot though so this C
which is an object of class has a method
called as get declared method now this
get declare method will ask you for two
parameters the first parameter is the
name of the method which is show so you
have to define this method name in
double quotes and then you have to pass
the type of parameters since we don't
have any parameters will send null here
okay and now let's import the package
for this method so in order to import
the package we can simply say control
shift I in that means so we need a
method from this reflection API there
sufficient reflect package now once you
got method
so when you say this method which is
your show is private so we are not
allowed to access this I want to make I
want to make it available or accessible
so in order to make it accessible we
have to say m dot we have to say set
accessible so there is a method but I
said X is the body vamp you have to make
it true now once we got the object once
we have made it accessible now we can
access the how to access this so we can
simply say m dot so there is a method
called as invoke in this invoke you have
to pass two parameters first one is the
the object
which is a test here and you need to
pass the parameters again we don't have
any parameters so we'll say nothing
cool so once again we have this method M
we have the object of method which is M
we made it accessible and then we are
calling invoke by passing zero
parameters or no parameters just have
you specify the object where the method
belongs and that's it and now if we run
this and bingo it's following this
ensure that means we are able to call
the private method then caution arise if
you can call the private methods from
using reflection
what is the use of this private because
when you say private we need to hide the
behavior right we need we need some
privacy we need some secrecy so what we
can so what why the Fisher is able to
call is because just for debugging so we
don't use deflection in the normal
scenario okay so we are using the
deflection here just to test up class so
that's how you can call a private
constructor using reflection API so if
you want to know more about reflection
API so I will be creating of the whole
plane strong reflection so do let me
know if you need that concept soon and
that's it from this video thanks for
