about localization and
internationalization now what exactly it
means is let's say I want to create a
soft and that's off
they've been up on the country or let's
say I'm using that software in India we
have lots of languages right we have
Hindi Marathi we have Gujarati but if
you use that software and let's say us
you'll be using English if you are using
that that's offered in China you will be
using Chinese right so depend upon
different different countries we have
different different languages and since
we have different different languages
the caption or the text that that should
be shown on yourself I should be
different so if I choose Hindi so all
the text which is in English should
convert into Hindi if you choose let's
say be Chinese so all the text which is
in English should be convert into
Chinese language now to achieve that
what we can do is we can use a concept
of internationalization which simply
means there is a concept of l10n notice
l10n means is it stands for localization
because between l and and we have ten
characters so you can see we can count
from go - oh yes ten characters then we
have a concept of it is i18n now
iighting stands for it is inter
nationalisation so you can count from n
I and and we have 18 characters so
that's your localization and
internationalization in order to use
that yeah you know to use this concept
you have to use two classes first we
need a locale class and second we have
to use this sauce bundle so we need to
use two plants one is low count again
one second is resourcebundle and both
these classes belongs to our package
called as Java dot util package so
you'll be using this package and this
classes in the tutorial to work with
localization so our aim will be to tie
will be a printing of a wish the
a late example I have a friend so today
his his plate it's birthday so I had to
wish him happy birthday
so let's say if his Indian and he knows
him the on he knows English I will
division in English language but let's
say he's from China so intuition in
Chinese language so I don't know what
his Chinese language so whatever I go to
google translator I will say happy
birthday and a chai and the language I
will be using is will go for Chinese so
this is the text I have to ia to visit
this I don't know it's a sangre blah
blah blah let's say I want to wish him
in Marathi so I have to go to Marathi
it's an Indian language so so it's VAT
do such a selection and if I want to
print them Hindi I can see here it's
Hindi like it's general info bottom
right so which we can choose multiple
languages we can also print in a bit
array because I can't read Arabic so the
choice we have lots of languages right
so you can choose any of this language
and then you can print that message in
different different language depend upon
the input or depend upon the language to
specify you know exactly how to do it
that would say in the next part of the
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
