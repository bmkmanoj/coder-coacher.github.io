motivational video not exactly
motivational bharti know I was thinking
about this from the from morning
actually you know there are I mean we
have different days in our life I mean
we have lots of days in a year right and
that we have lots of years to live so we
normally have maybe maybe 365 days in a
year and then we have a lifetime of
approximately 60 years right and so on
an average we have believed for 60 years
and then most of the time I mean first
20 years or 25 years we spend doing
nothing I mean so we spend most of our
time doing nothing doing degree and all
the stuff so we actually wasting lots of
our time doing all those things and then
once you join a company and then you
think okay let we have joined a company
we've got a good job then what next we
need to improve ourselves right we have
to improve our skills we need to improve
our knowledge because everyone wants
growth and the moment you you say you
want growth you need skill set right and
when you join the company you work on
different projects and then you work on
different stuff you improve yourself and
that's why you get hike and that's why
you get you get a prize and try to get
all those things the thing is there are
some days which are productive and there
are some days which is not actually
productive right so we have multiple
things where there are some days which
are very proactive there are some days
which are not predictive while making
this today I'm making this video today
is because the whole entire day from
morning till this point I was not that
productive I mean at least for Idris
this 3 p.m. I was not that productive
and then I was thinking is it this this
is what I want from the entire day I am
resting my entire day I was going to
facebook i was checking my mails i was
doing all the stuff doing nothing
productive then you know then I realized
why I am visiting lots of time it's
because today I don't have any purpose
right I missed I am wasting all my time
because I don't have any specific
purpose to achieve today because every
day I have some have some task to do
exam
let's say I have online batches i have
on i have training to be busy with i am
working on a project and today i was
having that thing you know since I was
having not not of I mean nothing yes I
guess there's some network issues I
guess they something network issues so
nothing as specific that's why I did
nothing right so at 4pm I got my purpose
what I should do next and that's why
that's why I worked high 41 are and when
and how far and I got I've achieved what
I should achieved in one day in one odd
so if you want to achieve something in
your life have a specific purpose okay
not exactly a life purpose but maybe a
device purpose or day wise aim so
certain aim for every day because if you
don't set an aim for a particular day
you are wasting your day because we
humans have this tendency we only work
when it's a high time so create hiding
place set a deadline for yourself if you
want to learn something new set a
deadline if you want to do something if
you want to achieve something yes I mean
do I mean set a deadline and try to
complete the things which is very
important early in the morning because
if you delay it again it will be we
delayed a lot okay so that's what I
wanted to say today just went life to
save this thing to you so if you want to
get success in your life if you want to
achieve something even if you are
working for a company and if you think
that you are you still not got success
yet it's because you are not setting the
purpose I mean or you can also say a
goal so it can be a longtime goal or it
can be a short-term goal but set a goal
or have a purpose in your life so that
is what to say in this video so thank
