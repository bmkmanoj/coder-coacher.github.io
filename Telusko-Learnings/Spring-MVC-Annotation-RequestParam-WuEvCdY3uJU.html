ready from the fiscal earthlings and in
this video we'll talk about a new
annotation which is request param so why
require like why we require requests per
ampere so that we run this code now so
wild running okay it will take some time
to load so it's running it's running so
it will open in Firefox now so you can
see when I when X when I search when I
type a number which is five and eight
and if I click on the submit query in
this address bar we are sending the name
of the request which is add and then we
are passing two values Y page t1 and t2
so these two values they are the quest
parameter right so how to first that
value in the controller is with the help
of request parameter right but for that
way to use this request object response
object ensure that what we can do is
what we are sending values here we can
directly access those values in the
method itself we can simply say int I
and int J so the I value so the t1 value
should come to I and t2 value should
come to J that means we didn't have to
mention these two things so it should
happen automatically right white why you
have to face the value assigned the
value then how all this will happen
automatically is with the help of
request panem attribute or addition in
which you have to mention the name of
the field which is t1 so the value of t1
will go inside I and the same thing they
would do for the second one second
variables you have to say at request
param and here will mention it is t2
right so if we have the second object as
t2 right and will give a space so the t1
value will go into I and t2 value will
go to J and those I and J will go for
the addition right so let's try run this
code after our making some changes so it
will open in the Firefox now and now
what is happening with my Tomcat is
running slow so if I is 77 and 99 oh
that's viewed that is 99
and we got the output doesn't matter was
the output is what matters is this value
is exactly going into the variables with
the help of at request padam annotation
okay so so there are lots of annotations
in spring MVC or we have talked about
the controller annotation so basically
when I talk about controller it comes
under component so controller
annotations are part of component
annotation so when we talk about this
component annotation it has three types
we have the apposite reawy have
controller we have service uncontrol one
of them then we can also provide the
configuration with the add configure
sanitation we have add beam and then we
have yeah we have this thing so that's
it from this spring MVC video or we have
talked about lots of things right so in
the in the subsequent tutorials
if I'm if we can make we can talk about
different features of spring we can
include in spring MVC like interrogation
of hibernate onto all those tops so
that's it thanks for watching and this
is couple of other videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
