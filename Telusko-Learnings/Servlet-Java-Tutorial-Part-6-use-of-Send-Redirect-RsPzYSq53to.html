call a sublet from a servlet so we have
created a HTML page from which I will
click on a button if I click on this
button it will call first servlet and
the quiz will go to first servlet which
will call second subject right so I am
calling the sub language second servlet
from first serve that with the help of
request dispatcher so the equal
dispatcher just dispatch your request to
somewhere else now why we need why we
need this so let's say you want to get a
service okay so we are calling a sublet
for the service but let's say that
served it says okay I don't know how to
do this I know a sublet which can do
this so what it will do is it will
follow forward your request to the other
servlet and that's why you are also
sending this object of request okay so
that's one way the second way is so
let's say you go to a person and you say
okay I want to add two numbers that
person says okay I will add two numbers
and if it ant those two numbers it will
give you the output right let's say if
you if you send the numbers are 2 &amp;amp; 3 so
he will take your number and we'll add
it and we'll give you 5 right so that
you got the output well it's say the
second scenario you go to a person and
say I want to add two numbers the other
person says okay
I will do it but but the problem is he
don't know how to do it
but he knows a person who can do this so
that person will send a request to the
person who knows how to do it and that
person will add it and you will get the
output so for you the the person who
have done the idea there the done the
addition is the first person you have
contacted right so that's the second
scenario the third scenario will be you
went to the same person you say ok I
want to add two numbers he will say I
don't know how to do it but I know a
person who can do this and he will send
you that he will send you to that person
so instead of sending the request from
from you know from from one per from the
first server to second servlet what we
can do is we can actually send the
response to the user and we'll ask to go
to a second serve it what I mean by that
is
so doing this just let me just come in
this part in stop doing this we can
simply say response dot send redirect in
which I can mention the name of a
servlet which is second servlet now the
advantages in the first scenario if you
use liquid dispatcher you are actually
sending a request the first servlet will
be sending a requester second sorbets
even your client don't know from where
you're getting the output right but if
you are using response dot send you a
direct you're actually letting your
client know that the request is sent to
the second circuit what I mean by that
is let me just comment this part and let
just move the last part which we have
commented and let's remove this comment
and then we move to comment let me run
this code once again and I'm running
this code now so I can see if I click on
this button if I click on this button it
says in second servlet but see the
address bar it says I'm getting the
output from first solid right because
whenever you work with liquid dispatcher
for you the output is coming from the
first circuit you have contacted but
it's instead of working with liquid
dispatcher now I am working with the
response okay this one send redirect
response dot send way direct and now I
forego to the client page for reference
this page now if I click on ok so
getting the same output which is in
second servlet but you can see the at
the output is coming from this again
solid so client is aware that you is
getting the output from second servlet
ok so again let me recap whenever you
work with a click where dispatcher once
applet calls a second servlet to persist
the data if you are working with
redirect or send redirect it will send a
response to the client and we'll ask
decline to go to the second servlet cool
so that's how we can work with the
liquid dispatcher and send redirect cool
so that's it from this video in the next
part we'll talk about some session
management so thanks for watching and do
