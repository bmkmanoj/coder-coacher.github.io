user-defined exception now what I mean
by that is let's say let's start the
example let's say my value of I is a so
I have a variable I here and the value
is 5 and I want to check if my variable
value I value is less than 10 then I
want to throw an arrow now to throw the
error we have to say throw and we have
to pass the object of the exception so
we'll say it is new exception so this is
the instance of exception class so we
can simply specify exception all right
and you can see it says since they are
throwing the exception and it becomes a
checked exception because you're
throwing an error so this code should be
enclosed in try and catch block so if I
say try catch exception II and then here
will print will say it's out the value
of e I'm getting error okay so I missed
the catching and spelling mistake my bad
okay now so if I just say format to make
it look better okay so now I have a try
catch and I'm saying it is a catch and
will print the error so if I run this
code now you can see we are printing
error which is Java law Lang dot
exception but what if I pass a message
here if I say or if I run this now you
can see we have an exception here and
the message we are painting is error
right that means we should pass a header
here or we should pass some string here
to print now in order to create our own
exception now we are using in build
class exception right so let's say I
want to create my own exception so for
that what we need is we need a class
we'll say my exception class say my
exception class and since we want to
create an exception that means it should
have all the features of exception we
have to say we will fetch some important
properties or normally all properties
from exception class
are all the features that's it we got
our exception here now instead of
creating instead of calling exception we
should call my exception but we my
exception don't have a method or
constructor with takes a string
parameter so we need to insert a
constructor so it's a constructor okay
you type Lacan to you so public my
exception this constructor should accept
our string message it's better if write
a message key were you write message and
then can be anything but it should be
our problem
now that's it now if I run this it
should work right now since we are
throwing an exception of my exception
will be expecting we exit accepting with
the help of exception it will work if I
run this code now you can say it is my
exception right but I want to print a
message also I want to print error
the problem is when you want to print
something with error you should call the
constructor of exception now how to call
the causative special exception with the
help of super method we can pass message
here so this will call the constructor
of exception class and now I feel on
this bingo we are getting my exception
error simple
even you can't rightly say here my
exception even this will work and Adam
so this is how you can create on one
exception by extending our exception
class in in fact you can create multiple
exception you can create IO exception
you can generate SQL scripts exception
you can create any exception your want
okay
that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
