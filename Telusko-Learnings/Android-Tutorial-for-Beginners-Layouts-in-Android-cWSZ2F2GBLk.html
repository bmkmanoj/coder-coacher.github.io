confetti Tom telesco learnings in this
video we'll talk about layouts so once
we have done with the configuration of
Android studio we have done with the
view let's talk about layout now
now let's are very important when you
when you design an Android app I am NOT
a big fan of designing but unfortunately
we have a design an app before to make
it run right so what we need here is we
have basically we have lots of four
layouts we will talk about only three
layouts in this video we'll talk about
relative layout we'll talk about linear
layout and we'll talk about frame layout
so let's start with relative layout so
what unit of layout here is let's go
back to design and we have a view here
which is a textview okay
and let me take one button and let me
put it next to this this text view now
you can see it's this button is trying
to make some relationship with the view
here so if you go back to the text you
can see we got a button and then we got
something called as okay it is to the
right of textview so this button is
depend upon this textview okay what if
if I take this button to the top
somewhere here and if I want to text you
can see it says a margin okay see is
where yeah so it is your align padding
top it says true okay so this buttons or
this view is always depend upon
something so if I take a new button if I
kept it below a below this text view you
can see it's below the text view and if
I go to text this button say is now
layout below that is your text view so
this is how your relative layout works
now you can put your you can put your
views anywhere but that view will try to
make some relationship between your
maybe your a screen or maybe with
different views so that's relate you now
next we'll talk about the linear layout
so in linear I already have a code here
okay so this is linear so in linear we
have two
one is your vertical linear layout and
then we have horizontal orientation so
we have vertical and then we have
horizontal so let's start with the
horizontal one so I have a come I have a
code here if I uncomment this code okay
so we got that is called nothing so we
got two textview one textview prints
telesco
and the second textview prints
learning's okay and both this views are
next to each other in horizontal bar so
we have a linear layout in which you
have to mention the orientation as
horizontal and if you have any number of
textview everything will be in the one
line
okay that's horizontal view simple right
so once we're done with the horizontal
one let's go back to the vertical so if
you write the same text in a vertical
layout so I have a code here for
vertical layout so if I uncomment this
part you can see we got the disco and
learnings in vertical ways so we got we
got two lines and we got two components
on two lines that's your vertical layout
okay now so we have a horizontal layout
we have vertical layout can we mix this
- can we have a view in which you can
have both a vertical layout plus
horizontal layout so I have also I have
also created one more layout linear
layout in which you can have we can mix
this to these two things so we can have
a so you can see we have a linear layout
in which you have horizontal which means
you can have two components imagine
telesco as one and android tutorial as
one of the component for horizontal but
inside this second horizontal bar or
second layout which is here we are
mentioning something called as vertical
so the next two buttons will be in a
vertical fashion okay so this is so this
is one component and this second
component for your horizontal and inside
second component we have two more
components in vertical fashion okay so
what whenever you work with linear
layouts you need to also mention a sxd
for your XML and you have to mention
these two things
okay but if you have the inner layout
you do not have to mention that because
you have already covered that part in
the apparently out so that's one of the
thing you have to consider so that's how
we use linear layout so we got we know
now we know about relative layout and
then we have linear layout the next is
frame layout now just to understand
frame layout let me create a new
activities I will say new activity and
if I select empty activity here we'll
name this as frame demo okay so we got
two things one is the Java file which we
don't we don't want Java file now let's
only focus on the XML file now whenever
you work with frame layout we don't
require any padding okay that let me
remove all the padding from bottom left
right and top and instead of using
relative layout let me use frame layout
so let me remove this rative and it'll
make it flame now the advantage will be
if I go to design and if I select a
image view and if I drop it here so you
can see we got some grid there okay let
me just take it in the first box so we
can say we have a good layout here by
default and if I go to text you stop
saying wrap content if I make it as
match parent I want and background
background image here so I will say
match parent which will cover the whole
area so you got a image view which is
covered and I also want image there so
just to get that image we want to add a
açaí tag from this folder so we have
in mint map we have this image which is
icy launcher so if you want that you can
just mention add rich mipmap this bitmap
slash mipmap slash okay it's here and
then we can mention IC launcher so you
can see we got an image here that's how
you add a background image to your frame
layout again now it will also act like a
card layout in swings so if you have
walked on swing all AWT in Java you know
about card layout right so in which you
can put the components above your frame
layout or frame layout so you can put a
buttons radio button here you can put a
button here so that's the advantage of
using frame layout so it's all depend
upon your requirements it's all depend
upon what type of design you want to
work with okay so my main concern in
this series will not be designing my
main concern will be development so so
what you can do is you can learn Android
using development this is the basic
thing you should know when you design
something
so first we'll design it okay with basic
features I will try to make the advanced
development features like sending
requests to the server or using
multi-threading things and all those
things so my main concern will not be
designing it will be development okay so
once you have learned Android
development then you can learn different
material design all those things and you
can embed those features inside your
Android okay so this is from layouts and
from the next video we'll talk about the
actual implementation using code so
that's it thanks for the thanks for
watching and make sure you subscribe the
channel so that you will get the news
latest update of the videos yeah that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
