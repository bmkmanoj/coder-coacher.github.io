where is that waistline
okay yes so we are live on YouTube and I
hope people can watch this session I
don't know I can see two people are
waiting is it live it's showing life my
page no yes okay so it's like great so
what does everyone explain the address
okay so this is the okay today's topic a
lesson soft by testa now make me do this
session every week right okay I can hear
my own voice sort of I guess your mic is
on just I guess you're playing on
speaker yeah that's okay now okay great
so as we know every time we go live and
we talk about we discuss with different
industry expert and this week we have
sort of Burma and the topic is exciting
because I don't know much about it and
that's why I'm really excited too for
the topics which I am not about aware of
and we get so many questions on that
topic in fact when I go for training
when I talk to different people they
have this question very commonly you
know what's the future of software
testing and if I get into software
testing what things I have to do and if
you're interested in software testing
was a part what are the opportunities in
software testing so and I'm not able to
you know give proper response because
I'm not sure about it and that's why we
got in this fix foot here who sort of
was working in tech industry have a long
time and I would let sorta talk about
himself more because he knows more about
himself then I know so so love all yours
thanks and I mean thanks for your
introduction and as you say welcome
aliens yeah so yeah so I been in
software industry from last 11 years and
in starting of my career I was also
confused what to do what not to do
yeah that's what happens and yeah it's a
good field and you you get to know lot
lot of things when you are part of a
software testing field
so one thing you should remember is the
software testing is all about knowing
everything in the application and if
something goes wrong in your application
you are the first person who you get
caught so this is not to scare you but
you know what kind of a responsibility
we take so it's like you you put the
quality thing so I used to remember my
mom or someone in my family used to ask
me what do you do in software industry
so I used to say that
remember in old days we used to have a
VCR I don't know how many of you have
seen we share or any electronic item
there you might have seen a tested ok
sticker yeah around color black color
blue guy sorry
red and green color sticker which was
saying tested ok and a check mark so
that's what we used to say that and that
that sticker says the validation of any
product it says ok this is an
authenticated product someone has tested
it and I rely on this particular product
and that's how people used to buy the
product so that's that's that's ok
sticker who puts that sticker is that
you the people who are doing the testing
for it are you little bit tough aware
now about what software testing is you
and there are many examples if product
be not tested good you know I have seen
in this NASA projects getting failed and
why they getting failed properly so when
we launch any product any product it can
be a software or hardware anything when
you launch you take this thing up you
test it thoroughly and you test it
thoroughly in some environment and you
see how it is going to behave in the
actual environment and then you may get
defects on the it or you may not get
defect when you get the defects you fix
those defect and when I say you fix the
Fed it's the entire team which fix the
defect so your entire team is all about
testers there
purrs product manager everyone yep and
then we fix it and then we launch the
product so this is what the software
testing is we do right so now let let me
see if I can answer some of your
questions which which people have asked
I think the we might have shared you
some form where you might have asked you
to fill up some questions a kind of a
prelim preliminary questions which I can
take up and answer clears your doubt
yeah yeah that's why I have sent them
the link in the previous video the
announcement video where I have
mentioned two links the link for this
video the light one and the forum where
you can submit your questions and we
have received some good amount of
questions right sort of also can yeah
yeah there are a lot of questions yeah
interested yeah it's an interesting
field actually and a the best part
anyone can do software testing it's not
about you being a part of IT background
or you've been doing your engineering
and computer science if you are from a
medical background you are from the
semiconductor industry or anything you
don't be we do software testing in our
day to day life so I'm not saying to
appear testing but we do testing in our
day to day life you go and buy the phone
you do a testing of that before you buy
it right so so yeah so in a way be all
our tester we all our tester and that's
how it is yeah okay so let me see what
questions we have so I'll take the first
one which is the what are the
prerequisite to get started with
software testing okay
right so the prerequisite is you need to
be knowing a basic protocols how to do
the software testing and I want to start
a testing I think it's just in my tongue
right now coming software testing so how
to do the testing so the basic things is
there are certain protocols like when
you say I want to become a programmer
there is certain protocols when you
write a program you have certain loops
you have variables and then you write a
function the end
that's how you construct your logic and
you give your program the same way it
goes with software testing also so then
we say that you need to be knowing what
is manual testing what is functional
testing what is a yeah ad hoc testing
what is a regression testing so these
are the few points a few concepts which
should be known before you get into this
field if you aware of these concepts
then what will happen you may talk in a
language which development team can
understand and it will be easy for them
if you find something as sub some bug
which I think that the way Naveen used
to say a Eureka moment for you so the
moment you find above it's a Eureka
moment for you and you need to express
that and you express express it to your
development team and the way you express
is a again a kind of a again protocol a
procedure through which we accept and
that's how all things you learn in
software testing yeah okay so the
prerequisite is you should be aware of
what is manual testing and there are
certain things like what is software
development lifecycle and what happens
the software is released to the market
so these are the prerequisite for
software testing I would say and to get
into this field or the only one
requirement is we should be
self-motivated if you are motivated and
you know that I can I can break this
software any software or any application
that is where you are into this field
okay now I have yeah great in fact sort
of we can take this first question for I
mean the questions from the forum first
okay yeah yeah yeah because yeah let's
pick up those one first okay great so I
have oh wow I have put a good amount of
questions for me to answer right now
great great great let's get started so
what do the first one says so I want so
I'm not going to take any game right now
so I have a list of questions with
Minami and I'm going to respond them so
so let's see yeah so it's really funny
question a person wants to know they can
raise their hand or just put it in the
light said I think you can forward me
with the name right sure sure yeah so I
wanted to ask so I have first question
which say is that I want to ask whether
I should start my career with software
testing program or directly try for a
developer program okay I think you this
person is more a kind of a fresher who
is uh who wants to know that where do I
go should I go into development field or
should I go into the testing field see
it totally depends on your choice and
the way you think so if you feel that I
am I can put the logic and I can build a
beautiful software which users going to
like it very much
go into the development field if you
feel that no anybody has built that
software
I want to inspect that software I want
to you know I want to know how do I
break this software get into the
software testing program and okay and it
started programmer so a programmer I
don't get what do you mean by the
software testing programmer you mean to
say automation testing or development
testing so little bit confusion there
but that's what I've believed it's
question is all about so it totally
depends which field you to is choose so
it's all about you you you you have to
make your choice you need to make your
choice that I want to get into something
where I want to break the things and I
want to give a people up software or a
product which is a defect free get into
the testing field that is your job if
you feel no I want to fix the things
then get into development drop P yeah
that's how it works right so let's go
into the second one which says why we
use Java we have Kotlin oh yeah it's not
Kotlin we also have C shock
we have scripting we have Perl scripting
VB scripting we
peyten we have C sharp the love language
it's totally on to you what you want to
use mainly people you prefer Java
because it's a word why I mean it's
widely known to the people C sharp again
it's a paid version it's not an
open-source Python is gaining right now
when you go out talk about a scripting
like BB script from Microsoft limited
things I'm just talking in the sense of
where software testing is all so yeah
you may see that in software testing
people just say that go with Java I'll
go with anyone scripting language the
question here is not wired this
programming language it should be more
how do I build my logics right and if
you know any one programming language
either it's C C++ Java Python any anyone
I think that should be the deal and
moreover like Java is actually
compatible with rough lot of your
software testing tools which are
available in the market so that's the
reason people prefer Java there right
and there lot of like things like right
nowadays you heard about like API
testing GUI testing all these things so
when you talk about the API testing you
use Java they're mostly then when you
want to do anything of a back end
testing order like you know SQL kind of
testing where you have a MongoDB there
you use Java so and again now Big Data
testing all their Java is being used so
people prefer Java there and Catalan
even I have not worked but yes I would
love to see what cuddliness I think it's
a subset of Java only yeah so yeah it
depends what you choose yes so let's see
what we have next I want to know which
is the right time for manual tester like
me to jump into automation every time is
a good time to jump into the automation
and yeah yeah yeah right right so so as
I said see as an if you are coming from
an background which is non IT background
when I
non itit's mean you are not from the
programming background stick to manual
testing for one year understand the
process of manual testing and then get
into the automation testing because both
are different
I am automation testing is more about a
development thinking and manual testing
is more about breaking the product so
you know even when we make an automation
testing to a framework or a tool we give
it to the manual testing team to work on
that and they give they give you like if
anything breaks or anything goes off
they come to the automation testing team
and they say fix this thing for me for
unison automation testing is more like
testing the product but from the
development prospectus yeah so anytime
is a good time to jump into that but I
would recommend if you really want to
like grow into toss a testing field it
was one drawback with automation testing
is if let's say you started your career
as a automation testing engineer you
will not learn the essence of the manual
testing and believe me or not when there
is any breakdown of a software any
failure it's not the automation team is
asked the moment any big failure happens
it's a manual test testing we do manual
testing on that we don't rely on
automation testing that much so yeah so
now you have to make your call which
should I choose right okay so let's move
to the other one sir I have selected as
a Java developer but I have been given
the manual testing job and from the last
three months from the date of joining so
I'm interested in development field if
it is fine I can quit this job and find
Java developer job
welcome to the job welcome to the
software industry world this is what
happens right right right
now this is a very interesting question
and the the only thing which is worrying
me in this particular question is if I
quit this job
friends don't ever think about
if you are trying to quit a job make
sure you have a backup for you
backup in sense you have an additional
job in your hand you have enough money
to support you for 2-3 months at least
finding another job is not so easy trust
me it's not so easy to get an another
job so I believe VB get so you know I
mean our friend Adam we when we joined
engineering I've been from this
background the first year when you go
into your engineering you always think
that I am a CEO of the company second in
years you say ok I am a manager of the
company third year you feel ok I am a
senior engineer and by the time you pass
out from the engineering you know that I
am no one but only a junior engineer or
a security guard to the company so you
realize the things by that time so the
quiet so if you have got the job it's a
very good thing
do one thing I would suggest you if you
want to move into the I think many of
the companies offer you that thing where
they say that stick to one project or
one product for 18 months and then you
can shift your career so if you don't
want to try if it is a very good company
I would say look for ijp
inside the company itself and go for IJ
pieces which is called internal job
posting apply there you have a good rep
o within your company where I have a
network with people into development
site and what best you can do I would
say at this particular moment you
showcase your work showcase in a way
where people should know by your work
and the moment you say that and then you
can put up your point X I want to do
development so I think people will agree
you won't believe I come from the
background where I was doing you know
support tech support I was into the call
center and I move into the sales field I
am being him support center I got an
option to move into the sales field
because I made a very good sales for
three months there in my support and I
was supporting Apple that time Apple
iPods and I sold a quite amount good
amount of Apple iPods I moved into the
sales and then I realized no I don't
to be here and then I moved into testing
field so you would you see how I change
the things in between I have done a
little bit of db8 which is your database
administrator administration job and
I've also done a little bit of
configuration stuff so so you remember
one thing in industry is not about
testing and development it's there are a
lot of things which happens in the
industry
it starts from you know deep here you
have product management you have lot of
things which which is there you have a
configuration management Audis DevOps is
getting lot of things there is a release
operations when a team then you have a
maintenance team escalation steam so
there lot of fields within an industry
and as i stoled you try to stick to your
job have because if it is your first job
I would say or a second job
stick for some time you will learn lot
of thing and manual testing is not so
boring it's actually good when you you
may start loving it because development
again it's something I would say I won't
say development is wrong but you get
limited scope what if tomorrow you get
into development also and you don't find
it good I have friends in development
from days and days they are only Jake
you know they're just making labels I
know you can answer that you know they
just go to some website and they're
making labels there and that's how they
say development and people are there in
development for four or five years and
they come for interview and I interview
them but they don't know basics also
when I go to them and ask what are you
doing they say ok on a website you know
what you see a button I used to put a
label on that button I was like oh wow
that's a good thing you do but that's me
that doesn't mean you are into
development right so there's a lot of
things which happens so so if you see
that yes I have a guarantee I if I quit
my job I can surely get next job within
one or two months go quit it and go for
your passion but then think think twice
before leaving the job just think twice
yeah
then we have next one which says why is
that
the testing team comes first and laying
off I I guess I've never seen this in a
do ya first so I've been part of my I
think I can answer this question I've
been part of three layoffs and I have
never seen a person being laid off from
the testing team only okay so lay off
there lot of things which is when you
say a layoff its from outside it's you
may think you know I've seen person
sitting next to me has been gone and he
was very good programmer he was a very
good you know a person in a in his
performance yet he been laid off the
other person who been laid off he was
not so good pro forma but that was like
okay makes sense now I'll tell you why
people get laid off there are two three
things keep in mind first thing is your
salary is more than what is the budget
of the company so when we say this let's
say I have been allocated my my team has
been allocated ten thousand rupees a
team who is charging six thousand rupees
I definitely let him go I'll say I work
because that that's a huge in with them
in a you know liability it with ear it
will become a liability on me second
thing are you ready for the changes and
believe me when you in you are in
industry for two or three more than four
years you spend in the industry in some
kind of a work maybe development in
development some kind of particular
field or in testing you're doing similar
kind of job for two three years and you
know you you are actually away from
what's happening in the market and you
are not ready for the change what
happens company says I'm going to so you
have followed a waterfall model or any
model in your company and then later
management came comes to you and say you
know hey from tomorrow onwards we going
to agile and you were like over as
what should I do now and then you are
not ready for that change you you try to
buy quad that changes you say no no no
you know what I am strike I am I'm loyal
employee to this company everything is
going good with this company I'm not
going to change my - Ajay that's where
you will be asked to lay off so there's
a lot of scenarios I mean they and there
are I think when you go and spend some
time in industry
it's not about software industry in any
industry and manufacturing and if you
see from software to manufacturing
industry there are lot of layoffs in
manufacturing compared to software but
we will be tend to see it in software
more likely because we are from this
field well are there lot of layoffs so
it's not just make sure that you should
try be ready for the changes and when we
say changes it's like keep learning new
things you won't believe my I am in a
industry from 1112 years and I keep
learning new things right now I am
learning a new which I have ops I
started learning I want to go into this
big data and that's not you want to jump
into that field but it's more like you
should know what is happening in the
market right and it's not only about the
testing keep learning something new
develop some other skills like
presentation skills develop something
nowadays you can even go for YouTube's
you can go and learn what YouTube is all
about how you do analytics in YouTube's
all these things you can do just learn
something new you never know what can
help you in your future right so yeah
and and don't worry about layoffs see
one thing if you are good you should not
worry about layoffs that much and second
don't love you company love you you know
people say oh this my dream company I
love my company love your job don't love
your company you do you never know today
you are a good asset to company tomorrow
they feel oh you are a liability to me
get off so don't okay so the better of
care I have the other one which says
better profile software tester or
software analyst again I think I have
already answered it this in previous it
depends on your choice on your personal
choice
and software testing if you want to go
into testing or and I think software
analyst you're more talking about the QC
role yeah it's it's a good road if you
feel that no I don't want it's more like
a process-oriented
where you define the process which going
to be followed in the T oh yeah
that's also one of the good rule but
sort of sorry I have a question for you
I think this question is from Suraj and
the question is interesting interesting
huh is it necessary for the owners no
not that one
okay because she's from the lip and the
question is nowadays developer alone is
way to test uh-huh
so yeah yes so nowadays developer is
alone to test and then why will he tests
us when developer cases offer oh well I
can say a reverse now tester can also
develop why do we need a developer yeah
I mean I I'm learning Java with you I've
been learning it from long and I believe
I can code yeah yeah why do I need
developer so you counter that question
believe you know what you should come to
that question oh my do just to answer
from my side for this question is you
know I feel there is a different way of
thinking when you talk about the other
pipe and testers developer have a
positive mindset you know we can solve
this issue but tell us how can you solve
that issue there's always an issue with
than with a solution credit credit
because I as a developer you always have
that positiveness okay it will work as a
tester you will always have that
thinking it will not work I will find a
bug in that there's always a bug in some
software and and I mean to tell you now
now even most of the companies you know
what they do
I think the leap question was like why
do we have this fee you know X point it
comes most of the company they prefer a
testing big background person to get
into the development because they know
when when a tester writes a code he as
you told he knows it very well well this
may give a problem I should take care of
this
yeah and moreover a second thing why do
we need tester is also important no II
new rota code
and you believe that it's a good code
but somebody has to inspect that right
yeah and if somebody has to inspect it's
a tester who has to inspect it so there
is always an inspection and I tell you
the example of all the companies there
is always one is two for ratio so there
will be four developer there will be one
tester means there is a reverse ratio
when there is a like you know
mission-critical product in Google's you
have one is to four ratio where is one
developer and four tester you won't
believe that how the ratio change there
and a mission-critical when we say when
you go to NASA products or Israel they
have a different kind of role where they
say one developer ten testers know you
you won't say that no no why don't we
mean that there is always a need of a
tester and this this field will never go
because when I am a developer I can
develop to certain you know I know
certain things I can develop that thing
but tomorrow let's say you come to me
and say that you know I have a product
related to accounting
I don't know accounting but a tester
knows it very well he knows what is
accounting because you will study that
better or that particular you know a
lesson and then comes for testing so
domain knowledge it is what you get as a
testing but as a development you don't
get that domain knowledge so I think
that that that's that's something which
is in similar line yeah yeah but uh yeah
yeah that's how it goes so you don't
worry tester will be always there I am
there for eleven years early as I know I
will be there for ten more years if that
was a kid I should have tried for
something else
right yeah right perfect yes so let's
move to the other one which say Scotland
okay we did that one why is testing
thing okay we did that I attended too
many interviews as I am a final year
engineering student but I haven't found
any iit complete looking for testing
profession so I am interested in the
field but it's worth it should I take
the stinker year as an option for next
four or five years reasons because I
actually because I know every java
technology including md
he's still not pleased okay I think this
guy wants to this person of my friend of
mine is first thing if you are attending
your interviews
I have no in your interviews are you
sure that your team is or the person
who's interviewing is asking for the
development background I don't think so
because when I interview I go for campus
interview I never look for a person who
is into development or into testing or
into this what we look in interview so
when we when we interview any fresher or
one or two years of experience person we
never look they how good they are in
Java or any kind of programming language
should no matter what are they are good
into testing we don't never look all
those things what we look is how
confident you are how easily you can
solve the things what are the different
ways you go for solving the things so
that is what we look and that always
comes in development as well as in
testing so make sure you you you have to
not work on right because right now as
you are in final year I would say start
working so this is the for every final
year engineering people because I have
attended fine a lot of interviews and I
have know I am part of the other side of
the chair where I take interviews so
yeah so what happens is where be always
there I think there is objective
questions try to solve all the objective
questions then you will get one or two
those questions are related to
programming and that's not because they
want to check your programming skills
but they do they want to check how good
you are in solving skills so there two
things one is I can i code or one thing
is how can I build the logic so they're
most looking for how you can get the
logic and how you can get different ways
of solving the things so work on your
aptitude and work on your data
structures I would say because most of
the company look for data structure so
all this for final years students and
one or two years of experience students
work on your data structure no matter if
you even if you are in testing or in new
development
or in DBA or in technical support or you
are in any kind of field but if you are
looking a job in Daiki work on aptitude
work on your data structures work on any
of money of your choice of your
programming language and then I don't
think so you will get rejected anywhere
so these are the three things you should
keep in mind and be confident and be
straight when you say when I ask you
some questions as I interviewed or when
I say okay what do you mean by classes a
simple example and if you don't know say
that I don't know don't just say oh I
think classes could be something like
this no I'm not interested in your
thinking it should be same I don't know
be straight on that say I don't know but
I would love to know what it I think
there are different presentation or
interviewing is skills where you should
work on this right so that the and if
you are after that also if you want to
choose your career again what is should
I look testing as my career option for
the next six five six years if you want
to try in that yeah you can look yeah
that that's something I think we have
already answers in past questions so
yeah how penetration testing for website
differ from okay so the penetration
testing is more about the security
testing and your software testing is
more about your functional testing so
there are two fields in two and I won't
say two but the majority of fields in
software testing the security testing is
where you know you you try to hack into
the system and you hack the system not
by doing you know functional testing but
trying to penetrate in the system like
you know if your particular project is
connecting to DB or it's connecting to
some other server which is located on
AWS anywhere so in that the network goes
from you know you pass acknowledgement
happens so like you send some data and
then some data comes back in between you
can in you know encrypt decrypt the data
those are the things are called so if
you I would say it's a good field and if
you are someone who are into like
ethical hacking
I won't say hiking but I think the
lacking if you want if you believe that
I should take this as my career I think
this this is a start penetration testing
is a good start where you can learn
about the things about how people hack
the system and how can I prevent my
system from hacking it's a good field
you get a job in banking domain in this
and again some security network security
and any virus companies also look for
penetration testing but again you are
limiting yourself if you are into
penetration testing so believe this
if you feel yeah I really want to stick
into this then go for it
but open yourself for everything so as a
tester you should be open actually for
everything and you should be knowing
this thing yeah and then let's go to the
next one I want to learn at first of all
on creak and symbolic testing okay and
then I want to know the new idea by
mixing these two okay okay so you want
to mix both of them right okay let me
see what do you mean by that
okay I think I need more concentration
on this particular question and may know
who has asked this question
or I I can just or you can rephrase this
question also I want to know what are
the drawback of these testing method and
how to mitigate these flowers so
concrete or symbolic testing I have
never done this testing but I don't know
why maybe I need to rephrase this
question I need to look this question
again I mean so if someone has asked I
would surely like to know the name maybe
if he is not giving here if he is okay
to give here you can rephrase it and
send it on the chat I'll definitely look
onto this yeah I'll pass this question
for now sure sure in fact please make
sure some point where the angle chart
okay I'll just go to that one Oh Kives
interesting
yeah so that's what okay so please
mention some points in Italy okay user
expect okay acceptance new eighty okay
so we always do you ready and what is
monkey gorilla okay
okay okay okay okay and then what we
have is okay so yeah so let's see okay
so let me come to the Hangout questions
first yeah so yeah so I have a question
where people are asking what is the UAT
or user acceptance testing mainly alpha
testing and beta testing so when we do a
testing so when you are doing it in
house so your product is ready to be
released but before that you do some
testing in house that testing is called
your alpha testing wherein when you do
the testing going out house where
actually the product is going to be
deployed in the production then you
perform some testing there also that is
called beta testing so this is again you
know trying to ask for these kind of
testing so this there so alpha testing
is something which you are done doing in
house before releasing it to the client
and beta testing is more about getting
into the client environment and doing so
nowadays it's not about alpha beta but
now we have a concept called testing
environment staging environment and
production so anything which you are
doing in its staging environment is
called alpha but what you are doing in
your production environment is your beta
testing okay and monkey gorilla least
they are the only ad hoc testing form
yeah the name looks very I'll tell you
it in very interesting way if you give
your keyboard to a monkey or gorilla
what they're going to do they're going
to just cut cut cut doing the thing
because they don't know about the
product right so are you oh the best
thing is you give you a product so what
what we do I do generally or we do in
our team we make a software and then we
release that software to some people who
are not aware of that software at
so like you know I would say the
examples are these smartphones again I
think phones are something which is very
common nowadays so what what happens
when first time you gave a phone to your
grandma or your grandpapa anyone who is
not seeing that kind of phone right or
any kind of work so what they do is
j-just Ming meddle with that phone and
you know this phone and they'll try to
see what best I can do in this phone so
those things why we do now these may a
monkey testing gorilla testing is same
thing in this testing we don't know
about the software at all and we just
try to randomly do something on that
software in order to break that software
because there are certain kind of people
when you make a product it's not only
for some user but but but not of users
right the some user will be of your kind
who don't know about the product and you
need to make sure when such users are
using your software your software
doesn't break right so yeah it should
not break in fact I don't know I should
give you an example of not enough
testing than on Samsung phone and it
started blasting so this is not related
to this alpha or beta testing but this
is something which has happened well
I'll tell you the importance of testing
everything functional testing was done
properly I mean the software is really
good everything was good even I think
battery testing might have done but they
have not done the battery testing in a
way thinking that okay in this
atmosphere it can even breast so those
things have been right so this is what
the importance of testing is all about
yeah so yeah gorilla testing and monkey
testing the form of ad hoc testing
whenever you have a question because I
think this is a common question being
asked to in a lot of interviews what do
you mean by gorilla testing or a monkey
testing just say these are the ad hoc
testing where people don't know about
the software and they just try to break
the software or they work on the
software thinking what next will be done
and if there is any flaws in the
software that should we address
gracefully yeah what is quality control
and quality assurance so quality
assurance is like
IATI that this product is good and
quality control is more about telling
people not people but it's a light mode
of kind of procedure which we follow to
make sure that product is good simple
very complicated thing but just make
sure this is only the quality control
and called quality assurance yes it's
more about prevention and quality
control is more about making bales how
to prevent those things yeah and of
course in Google you Google it out
you'll get a lot of people talking about
the quality control and quality
assurance it's a tricky question
but make sure you you just apply this in
a single line I like to I'll tell you
one thing when you get such tricky
questions from your interviewer if you
know the answer just give a one-liner
don't try to elaborate more on that if
you give an option like speak more on
that what it opens a door for an
interviewer to ask you more question on
that so just to make sure if if today if
someone asked me also what is Java I'd
say Java is a programming language
that's six I will not make myself open
for that question because that's my weak
point but yes if someone again asked me
know what is interface inside and then I
say okay interface is this thing but if
I say someone asked me you know if now
inquiry interview me and say do you know
Java yes I know Java
I know concept I know this I know that
and it opens up knowing immediately
saying okay what is whoops and I got
stuck there right so make sure you these
kind of tricky questions you always make
sure give a very short and crisp answers
all right
when to stop testing when your client is
saying I have no money no so the so when
this is when it is done when we save I
went to stop testing whenever you're all
happy path testing has been done and the
happy path is again one a you know the
the flow which we say is a
we'll never break flow those kind of
flow is done then you stop testing when
your release time is about to come prior
to that you will stop testing and there
is always a time line attached to the
testing so you always get some time for
the testing and because testing is a
never-ending process so but you need to
say okay I will be stopping my testing
at this particular time when I have all
my you know regression test cases got
completed or all the functional testing
has been done so these are the
checklists and this is mainly done by
your test leads or person who is more
experienced in your team because this is
more with the client interaction where
we negotiate with client on this so we
always say you client ask so how much
testing do you require we'll say okay
how much you want do you want all the
functionality to cover I will cover that
and this will take this much time so it
depends so when to stop what is the
right time to stop testing yeah again do
you when you feel you your team feels
yes I have done all the happy part
testing and I have taken care of all
major defects so yeah again the defect
since we are talking about it so there
are some major they are minor and there
are some load priority defects so when
you say we you want to stop the testing
so you negotiate with your client saying
when all the major or the you know PA
tier 1 and tier 2 defects are closed
that is the moment I will think my
testing is the stop okay so it totally
defend where when you say that all or
all when what we generally follow is
when we release our product we say no p1
defect should be open at the time of the
release if any p1 defect is open I
cannot release and that is what we call
showstopper bugs and then you say no
that's where you get like no I will do
more testing on there but at for a
certain point you'll say no fee when
defects are do open I can stop my
testing for this particular release
because the release also happens in step
in step it's not that you release your
software on one way right yes okay in
fact again equal time now it's 50 almost
okay so we got 5 more minutes for two
questions and then
we can have closing because it's been a
long time yeah thing is like yeah it's
actually you know when you talk about
when oh when you talk about the Jonah
which you are walking on you cannot stop
talk about Java
it's not stopping but yeah that's that's
reminding me one one thing which always
people say hey I'll say development and
tests are never good friends yeah good
friend is why we don't say it so yeah
this thing will always come to people
they will have this tricky question I
would say yeah because we I I will I
generally ask this question so what
happens when we say good friends they
are always good friend and you have to
be very diplomatic in your answers well
because I don't like somebody pointing
finger on me if if I am writing a code I
know I am writing the best code you are
no one to point fingers on me but if you
say politely this actually saying that
okay you have written a good code but
there is some flaws in the code together
we should fix this when you use such
terms you get a good rapport with your
development team right and believe me
you have to be getting a good rapport
with your development team then only you
can get a success in your testing field
yeah so let's take some questions from
Naveen which he might be pulling it from
the live chat right yep yeah maybe
though question for you what is the
future of koo kumba framework I'm not
sure if you I mean if you're walking on
yeah yeah so as a future combo framework
because there are many students asking
me for koo kumba flamebook correct
correct so so so so yeah student means
it's for you who has asked well I don't
know so I just copied the code chat a
question from the chat window oh yeah
his friends or maybe he's a and so yeah
so again it's a automation testing
framework which is a koo kumba is more
about BDD approach which we say behavior
driven testing
it's nowadays very much used in the
company so we're you know we companies
now work earlier days it was more on the
waterfall model where you developed a
piece of code and then you test it and
you release it now what is you get a
rapid development if you don't do the
rapid development you are out of the
market so what happens we work in agile
manner now as a tester you say as a
tester so I'll take you a login screen
so let's say you as a development and
Naveen has made a login screen and he
says as a developer I'm going to
implement login screen that's it
now I as a tester I'm going to provide
the user name I'm going to provide the
password and I will click on login
button and then it should attend ticket
me so I as a login so this is one use
case what we say it's a persona you know
where in you you believe that I one of
the person who is going to perform this
activity and then what the operation
should happen so this is why we do such
kind of coup combo framework that gives
you that option of writing in such me so
you write your test case in a way like I
as a user going to login and I will be
successfully authenticated now in the
background the programming happens in
the background the programming which
happens is done either using Java or
using Ruby so koo kumba was i initially
means made for Ruby then it was
implemented for Java again it's a j.j
unit it is it is on the top of J unit
right the koo kumba is on top of j unit
and it's it's used now nowadays people
are using it a lot so and what is the
future your future is this so and one
thing you remember this these kind of
frameworks if you are targeting to the
service industries there you will be
using if you are targeting for product
industries they don't go for the scoober
framework until unless team is very new
because the end product industry is
there more mostly having some legacy
products I'm talking about the MNC which
are running from the past ten years or
more but the industries which are run
right now they go for these things so it
depends which company you are working in
right most of the testing frameworks are
the or since we talked about you have
tests ng framework J unit framework and
then BDD koo kumba then you have
protector nowadays which is very good
and in c-sharp
we use n unit and the coded UI so these
are the few ones which which which are
commonly been used so these all are
different kind of frameworks which are
commonly used in this market right now
yeah in fact just to clarify the the
person who has asked this question is a
tweener that's how we can figure it out
great in fact you can take one more
question and then we can sign off
because it's been a long time and let me
pick up the last question oh okay miss
that question is is it is it necessary
for developers to learn software testing
III is a tester if I am learning
development yes you should and I I think
I taken this question in earlier I have
explained wherein I say I am NOT in but
in some of a bit off I talked about the
thing when if you are a tester and
you're moving into development field so
yeah as a tester if you learn sorry as a
developer if you learn this testing it
helps your team it helps a lot and you
have you know you've got a beta CH with
your peers you are on top of your peers
your performance will be really good
because you know that my DIF my if I get
defects on my code I think with
development team also they have this
defect count something like your piece
of code should not give more than these
many codes if it is giving more defects
that means something is wrong right so
if you know testing I won't say you
should know functional testing that much
but you should be knowing a mode of like
API testing and REST API testing or some
back-end testing SQL testing those will
really help you in your life because one
thing is more which is going in market
only manual testing is not going to help
you and now the industry is looking for
s deck role so that is what we call
software development role
in you as you should be knowing testing
you should be knowing development I
think someone asked that man I adays
people use hire these people that is a
different thing but yes you you should
if you know both the parties both side
of the coin you you you can think you
are more secure in the company so if you
know if you know only one side you have
you may stick to the company until
analysts come in and needs you so right
now yeah even I am learning development
a little bit of development I also do
yeah okay great stress or no development
and develop and developers should know
tester so it's like a hand yeah yeah
yeah that's why they both should go you
know mix handy together and it's it's
just the other side of the coin testing
and development at the end of the day
remember you are giving a quality
product and it is up to you up to you
means your team you you are not alone
you have your team which is responsible
for delivering something which is good
for humankind offer your client and that
can happen and you see if you're working
in a small team there they don't have
like two three testers four or five
developer there are only one or two
person he will only develop he will only
do everything right when I've made my
first project I only tested it I only
developed it and I only released in the
market I think every most of the
engineering student might have done that
kind of job right so you should be
knowing each and everything but yes if
you know everything what happens right
I'll tell you when there will be I think
firing question was there right when
there will be firing or any kind of
layoffs happening
you may will not consider because you
will be a kind of a more asset to the
company when you know everything you
know yeah so that is how it goes so I
would say not only you should know
development and testing but also know
few of the release management because
nowadays that is also which is so dev
ops it's something you should go for
Linux commands you should be knowing
Linux some little bit of the DBA options
also you should be knowing yeah database
yeah yeah those are the things you
should be knowing yeah
great you know all yeah so in fact uh so
you should know everything right I mean
you should be takeoff hall and master of
one so yeah yeah yeah that's that's the
correct word I would say yeah you should
be knowing everything and mastery in one
thing because if you are mastered one
thing you can use same concept or same
kind of you know things on your other
things like likewise we say that like
now if if we take simple examples you
know English right you mastered English
now you are using that English in your
programming you're using it in your
testing when you write a program you I
am sure you're like writing some
documentation on that how do you are
doing it using sales because you know
English that's how you are writing but
if you didn't know English how would you
have done that now when you write
defects you know you have to use that
right so yes get everything but master
one thing I would say yeah that is how
and whenever you are doing testing don't
take it or development anything don't
just take it in that particular box
think out of the box go out of the
system and see what people are doing
with your product and then work on it
yeah I think yes that that's how the
approach should be and one thing before
we conclude on this and I mean I
especially for freshers just to make a
note of this and all the people who are
trying on the testing field for one or a
year I would say they should go for one
programming language and Java take Java
is a your preferred thing because that's
that's something which will be widely
using all the frameworks second go with
one operating system and when we say
operating system not Windows on and off
of the windows just you should be
knowing how to create ad how to install
or uninstall operating system basically
server so if you can go with the Linux
it's well and good and third one DB so
DB SQL commands basic basic SQL commands
with join and enjoy not much on that you
don't have to just bug everything like
you know that one n norms are Danna
- n3n don't go for that but you should
be knowing basic SQL commands so if this
and these three things you should be
knowing and then your manual testing if
four of the things you know I think you
can easily get job in testing but make
sure that you know and then go on on
this online try to solve some puzzles
online because that is where you will be
start thinking when you try to solve the
problem and one of the website I would
say now I mean I think they can go with
you test so if you are looking for some
free work in testing someone might have
done course in testing but you know they
depress bills one thing they come in or
where do I get like projects right so
for that they can go to you test is one
website which offers you such kind of
worry so you just work there and they
don't pay you much but yeah forex means
you can just try out and there yeah and
a lot of things in Audis mobile testing
is coming up so there is a scope
everything there is a scope but learn
one programming language and Naveen is
the best person to get in touch for
programming he teaches it really well
great so thank you so much Tala between
awesome time with you it's better I have
learnt so many things in testing I'm not
a desktop basically
but then I love testing I start that I
hate testing is just that I don't know
how to test properly okay so I I
converted when developer to the tester
see ya
okay maybe future will be also making
testing videos I am planning to make
some test videos if I mean if I can
learn something so let's see how it goes
and but thank you so much for everything
sort of it's been a you have taken your
your son date time for for us
subscribers and for me at least so thank
you so much I hope you will join these
obsessions again with some other time
yeah maybe end on how to you know how to
do how to give interviews and how to
prepare for their interviews right right
yeah those are the things I think I
think we should take those things how to
and again we can even talk about
specific testing related because these
are more general question I am sure
these question
in everybody mind and to an extent we
were able to solve some of the query and
I know I haven't taken up every query
I'm sorry for that but yes to an extent
I just wanted to make sure that the fear
should go out from the people and they
should start loving and if I made you
successfully love I think one or two
more every day like yeah you are instant
here who converts the people to testers
not about testing I say take up anything
but take it seriously
right yeah and it's not about testing
it's not about development at the end of
the day you should feel that I have done
something good for the mankind right and
I've delivered and that feelings comes
only when you know you talk about a
Eureka moment that eurocom moment comes
either you are interesting or in
development or you're non IT background
anywhere even if when I make P and if my
T is really good that's how you take a
moment for me yeah things are there okay
so that's that's great
it's an awesome time with you again
we'll see you next time and so I hope
everyone liked this session I could NCBI
so many people have already watched this
session I will give you the stats they
tell sort of how many people have seen
this video and how many comments we have
I do get all those stats all right but
people who are watching this if you like
this session because like button but
that's what motivates me and that's what
motivates our expert to come on a live
session if because your likes will
define how helpful would this session
was in fact further will have a good
sleep only when he can see those lights
right so though okay I mean some a day
was coming yeah so I didn't get you last
one more what you said said we ever it's
just that we get motivated by those
likes on the AIA
yeah yeah the moment you get like it's
like oh I have done something right say
okay then yeah
one thing more everyone one thing more
be happy and try to you know break the
software but
don't break your head always always keep
smiling anything you are doing just keep
smiling try to love the work you are
doing as I say love the work but don't
love the company
the moment you start loving the company
you don't know what happens next
that's great I'd sewed up your boss
knows now you don't love the company oh
my every boss great so that's it
everyone
signing off it's been a long time see
you in the next life session which is
coming next week and we'll have another
industry expert we'll talk about some of
the topic and all your questions welcome
all your questions into this chat window
all in the comment section of this video
thank you so much for watching bye
