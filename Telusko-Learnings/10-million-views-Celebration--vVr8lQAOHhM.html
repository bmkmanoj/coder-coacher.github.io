that sounds good okay I can see my
position there welcome everyone and how
many people are watching much this the
app is not getting updated here what's
wrong let me verify if everything is
working fine oh I can see one like white
no views I don't know what what's wrong
there okay so our sound is perfect and
yes finally we got about 10 million
views on our channel and that's an
awesome thing for me great oh okay so I
can also messages here great okay yeah
Levin likes that's great I'm Samir hi 21
likes oh that's great
so people are watching this a lot and
okay so first of all okay Congress
congratulations for the risk of learning
in fact it was all because of your
support I'm here today and I was not
knowing about the about the views just 5
to 10 minutes before I just checked my
YouTube channel and I got that number
that that number there okay so okay
okay oh great so where are we so yeah
it's all about celebration today is
right so we have crossed that 10 million
views that 10 million views benchmark
and we are almost reaching now how many
subscribers it's approximately eighty
two thousand point eighty two thousand
five hundred seventy six subscribers
awesome number okay so I am very excited
for this the number of views number of
four subscribers and both content on the
bay
okay so awesome thing okay so let's see
what are the messages in fact I will
also do Q&amp;amp;A today because last week I
was supposed to do a Q&amp;amp;A but then I mean
we did Q&amp;amp;A but then there were lots of
questions which we missed right so today
I will try to answer those questions as
well
in fact I've also asked you to comment
in the video itself in the last Sunday
video and so I will try to finish those
questions first and will will go with
the four will go with the questions here
okay so okay party doesn't say okay
party is there but then how would you
reach here because this is a different
location and you are in different city
that's the thing it's advanced okay so I
wish you will reach one hundred millions
or with you all your with all your
support I made each one hundred million
okay so that's great let me just open my
previous video so that I can answer your
questions oh okay so I just open my
previous be a previous video here
it was 16th jus today I'm not drawing
yet that's what that was the date so now
I can see we have 83 people are watching
and 41 likes
oh that's great okay I can see that lots
of questions coming alright so first of
all I just there are some announcement a
from next month I am getting busy with
all the training it's a very big
training for me
normally I went when I do training as a
perfect trainer as a corporate trainer I
do get some time to do some other stuff
as well so I make videos on YouTube I
make I work on project but this ten
training is very what you say a very
difficult training for me not executive
but then it takes lots of effort lots of
time I go there at 8 a.m. we will be
leaving by 9 p.m. so there is no time to
make videos so I will try to make I will
still try to make videos on weekends
let's see how that goes and those are
those are the updates ok so let's start
with the questions now okay so is that
was that oh it's here so first question
from SHINee okay I was working on Java
15 years back and then I got an
opportunity to work in a software
testing side and I'm continuing the same
if want to go back and work on Java
should I need to go to Oh what should I
do and how John market is in Hyderabad
okay so Java Market in Hyderabad is very
good in fact Java Market in turn in the
entire I mean in the everywhere is good
not even in Hyderabad entire India or
you know all over the world we have a
good market for Java it was there it is
that it will be that in future as well I
know there are different programming
language which are which are coming
ahead but Java will be there for a long
time even if you're going to Java and if
in future if you think there is a new
technology that's fine you can just move
to any other technology so I just know
it start simple okay so next question
yeah so you have one more question what
to do now so you are in the in testing
field right but you were working my job
from last I mean you were you have
worked on Java 15 years back so Java has
not changed yet what the flame books
have been updated so Java language is
same again we have some versions and in
every version we have new new features
but then that's fine you know you can
still start with Java in fact if you
follow my entire playlist for Java you
make I mean it will clear all your
doubts but the only thing is in
afterwards I mean you have to practice a
lot because if you really want to you
know build projects you have to practice
a lot and I would suggest start learning
and okay you already have a base of
programming I guess not that you're
learning programming for the first time
so it will not be difficult for you it's
just that you have to work hard you have
to build up projects so that you will
get the confidence this is a point I
think I think you don't have you don't
have much confidence so
so first point of must first be
confident and let's see how it goes so
do make a budget as well okay our next
sir can you start Python to do tutorials
okay this question is from I thought you
are God bless us with tutorials mais
okay so you have main question is you
want me to start with by the tutorials
and the answer is no as of now I'm not
planning for any Python tutorials for
two reasons first I'm into Java I I
don't feel any need to learn Python now
but still I'm I was thinking about that
from a long time to learn Python but the
only thing is you know it takes some
time it takes lots of time to learn a
different technology I do know Python
not entirely but bit of it and to make
videos see there are two different
things one learning a technology and
second to teach it
see I'm uncomfortable in teaching Java
because I know Java right I have worked
on Java so I know lots of lots of I mean
I know about Java you can say 80% the
only thing is if it comes to Python I
can learn Python that's not a big issue
I can learn Python in one week or maybe
five days but the problem is can I teach
it even if I can one examples I will
take whatever top of a or whatever Rajat
I will build on that so there are lots
of things which I have to take care of
right so it will take time so even if I
make better tutorials if we take lots of
time because I'm busy for the next two
months so next month I'm entirely back
after that maybe I will get some time
but I have other thing lined up as well
so first of all I will complete those
things and then I will think about
moving back to back to jar back to maybe
if I get if I get some time I will make
Python tutorials okay so next is why did
you go for udemy why can't you make
videos in telescope row I can I have
answered this question the last session
but then still that is how I was
supposed to upload all my recent videos
all the what you say the new framework
videos on telescope no but the only
problem is that is scope through Pro is
terminated maybe because I have uploaded
to my ability the same same video on the
risk on learning and the disco Pro and
maybe YouTube thought that this is a
fake channel someone else has copied
that video they have not given even the
copyright symbol I don't know why
YouTube does this but then okay that's
fine but anyway I was I was thinking
about stopping today's kopelow for
Tori's for one one more reason is
periscope law is not available all over
the world because I have subscribers all
over the world not just from India are
not traditional not just from us it's
it's there from everywhere and in some
countries we don't have subscription
models so they might not got my video
they might not get my videos and that's
why I thought about ok let's not go fall
that is too low now why you Nami you
name is still not fixed I'm still
planning out I'm still making videos and
they are with me I was supposed to
upload videos after hdpi on udemy but I
thought okay I don't I want a list API
to be free for everyone so I operated
STP our videos on YouTube for free but
then there are some players coming on
the way not this man may be nice month
that will be uploaded on udemy and you
can download from there okay you can
watch it from that not download okay our
next question us what you will prefer
spring boot or spring without bored see
if I make a new project now of course I
will go for spring boot because spring
boot will make lots of your work easy
right and that's what we want right we
want to make things easy for us we want
to focus more on the programming part on
the logic part then on the con on the
configuration if you talk about normal
spring the only thing is you have to do
lots of configuration then we can build
the project right but yes if you want to
build a new project of course you will
go for spring with boot I mean spring
boot but then you know there are some
projects which you don't actually you
don't normally create project from
scratch every time right you already
have a project in that scenario if that
project is built using spring we will
continue with spring right I have seen
lots of projects which are still on
spring and what got chopped is it I have
we have lots I mean 90 percent of the
budget are still on spring no we have
small animal ecology class which are
spring boot now because it is new okay
so let the exploit we got one not eight
people watching this and record only 74
lights
what's your doing come on if I enjoyed
this such this off sessions do click on
the like button ok so that's good
okay next question is is that question
okay where can we get more information
on your upcoming online courses
okay time when I'm not thinking about
any other course at least for two months
or maybe one month I was thinking about
that in September you'll be getting the
updates on telescope comm the website
the on my website you have the link
where you will find all the recent
courses but we don't have any courses
for next month August Monday scientastic
Bank so I don't have any course in
coming in August but maybe you look at
the updates on this website next from
Alexa please make all - all Hindi coast
of Java I was thinking of making hindi
videos for Java but the only problem is
there are already lots of videos
available in Hindi right there are some
channels you can go there and you can
learn in Hindi and the second problem is
you know programming is something which
it's better if you learn ninja in
English because the thing is if you if
see let's talk about Kotlin now the
thing is I learned coordinating from
documentation because we were not having
good good videos available for Cortlandt
so what I did I went to document
documentation I learned coordinate from
documentation so that documentation is
in English right so it's better to learn
programming language in English and
there's one more thing in programming
language we don't use lots of
vocabularies right we have limited
vocabulary have curly brackets we have
methods we have functions so I would
prefer you to learn a programming
language in English especially it there
will be a time in future where you can
write programming in any language
okay so ai is coming on the way right
using AI you can do anything you want so
maybe you can you can write program you
can write software in your regional
language or maybe you can just have to
imagine do you want to solve and you'll
be getting a software so AI is on the
way so let's see what time in I'm not
planning to make any hindi videos I'm me
in future if I get some time because
there are lots of other things on the
way okay Oh
okay so do advanced Java life course on
the disco he's costly
please minimize the fees okay I know
compared to the market price my courses
are bit costly but the thing is I my
main aim is to provide a quality content
right because if you go to different
classes and different courses online
they will give you a course but there's
no guarantee that it will be a quality
ma a quality thing so I provide - I'm
trying to provide quality content so it
will so okay what I'm challenging is not
that costly okay but then come back to
market prices bit bit high but then I'm
trying to provide as much as content as
possible right so I can justify that
okay so okay I'm familiar with PHP
should I go for Python or Nadia's see if
you know PHP you can build the entire
website right so you can build the
entire website you can do everything you
want in PHP but still if you want to
learn different technologies there's no
no one is stopping you right I would I
always suggest you to learn different
languages the reason is once you learn
different languages of course you will
be building software and run particular
language right example I prefer Java
language doesn't matter what software I
want to build
I prefer Java maybe Android maybe
website maybe standalone software
I prefer Java but then when it comes to
different languages I do learn different
languages again for two reasons one to
teach it on YouTube a second is if you
learn multiple languages it will change
your mindset you know there are so there
are certain things which are available
in different language not available in
your language what you can do is you can
implement those those techniques in your
language manually right so that's not
something so try to learn multiple
languages but then I know you will if
you're confused which one to choose
learn different languages and see what
you are comfortable with which with
which one okay
okay next question about angularjs view
juniors Ray J's or and I'm very bad with
with Java technologies I don't want to
comment on that but I guess reactive aim
getting famous nowadays
okay which web service you are using in
your website and which one so AWS or
Google App Engine timing the deployed
website is on OpenShift and the live
project which you are doing last month
it was done with the help of AWS I
started with Google App Engine event Oh
aw just to show you different ways of
deploying it but the official website is
deployed on App Engine
okay so on openshift openshift is a web
service from open from that ad which I
love I love with a hat company anyway
okay next question next question is okay
I'm coaching joint
oh I'm drawing for or like oh oh that's
a v8 question okay are you planning to
make videos on spring AOP okay I am
planning to make videos on spring AOP
which will be a paid course but let's
see how it goes I'm still not into it
I'm still figuring figuring it that
should I provide the free content or
should I go for paid one let's see how
it goes but yes spring AOP videos are
coming may be free or may be paid like
that 800 Cassandra no I'm not trying to
make videos on that no I can draw
nothing okay these are the questions
from the last session let me just target
questions from this from this thing okay
so here we go so first thing Congress
sir thank you so much
I like your videos love your lectures or
thank you so much someone's talking
about lemon likes a record once you have
four likes now I just saw that's the old
message
okay so Lenovo IdeaPad seven one zero
for programming I don't know about that
model but then you know I'm getting
those lots of this questions you know
nowadays which which laptop to buy even
I was confused a few days back which was
which which machine to buy when you want
to go for programming recently I bought
a new machine
okay just mention that machine I was
thinking about buying a new machine for
my office because the thing is I do I
have a Mac I have a Mac for me okay so
this is my machine but then I also
wanted one more machine for my for my
interns so that
I can say so that they can process
because he when I make videos it takes
lots of time to process that to render
it
I wanted the machine for video editing
plus I also wanted to machine for
Android and for Eclipse like for STS
so I was thinking about buying a new
machine from a long time and then you
know then I researched a lot on Google
which one to buy because I was knowing
which one to buy but then actually I was
to the countries I never knew when you
invest lots of money you are very
confused which one to buy right so what
I did is I researched about a lot what
happens is whenever you buy a machine
yeah there are something some things you
have to consider the first thing is
about the processor now the first thing
is the budget okay I guess the first
thing epi but you have to specify the
budget if you know that you cannot go
beyond Teddy K or 30000 rupees in India
Indian currency make sure that you go
for a three at least okay go for at
least a three if your budget is maxed to
max 3000 because I have seen lots of
students they put the budget of thirty
thousand you aren't that limit go for a
three machine at least with 8 GB RAM if
you are working with Android studio if
you are working with Eclipse STS all the
software's because especially the
Android studio it takes lots of lots of
memory right if you are using emulator
but if you're not using emulator if you
are using your own mobile phone for
running edge then 4gb RAM will be enough
right ok so that's it that's the thing
but if you have a good budget let's say
if you're going forward maybe 50,000 or
45,000 go for I 5 ok at least go for I 5
I would prefer to go for i7 right
because if you're planning for long-term
maybe for 4 to 4 to 5 years of course i7
is a must machine for programmers
because see if you're working on your
new notepad and thing you don't need
those things but the moment you go for
Android studio the moment you go for
bulky softwares maybe fear I'm doing
server-side programming specially for
Java it needs lots of processing power
may not be i7 but I 5 is minimum but I
also wanted machine for anything right
so I went for this machine which is esos
or Asus Halloween I do not pronounce it
this is Asus and so this machine this is
actually a gaming machine reason I went
for a gaming machine you don't need to
buy the IDE okay
to buy a gaming machine for programming
but then I wanted to buy AI 7 machines
for rendering but then this machine it
actually has I 5 which is a quad-core
processor so I 5 particle because in
laptops you don't get quad-core you get
dwell cold even if you buy AI 5 when if
you buy i7 you get dual coal desktop you
get quad-core CPUs but MOBA laptops you
have to consider this there are lots of
people they say you know lap times
better than desktop because laptop has
i7 Dijkstra versa also has AI 7 but the
thing is laptop has dual core i7 and the
X term has quad core i7
this machine which I got has I 5 quad
core so you have to consider all those
things before buying a laptop okay is it
a dual core machine is it a quad core
machine how many how much RAM you have
available for you I also want to the
graphic card because rendering is very
important anything for rendering between
good good good graphic card but for you
do you don't need good graphic card
right what you need is good lamb and
good CPU it doesn't matter which brand
you go for lenovo Dell HP doesn't matter
they all are same nowadays they all
provide you on-site support right it if
something goes wrong they will come to
your house you don't have to go anywhere
so it doesn't matter which brand you buy
but what matters is the the
configuration go for I 5 at least and
8gb ram for $90 pint thank you ok next
question
ok hello hello hello hello
congratulations oh thank you so much
everyone saying the same thing
okay okay so many messages you know
where are we
party party party awesome okay
everything everywhere everyone's saying
Congress I'm not able to see any many
questions now where are the questions
again 129 people are watching and I can
see when a less number of likes that's
weird
come on guys if you're liking this
session don't becomes like button okay
telescope Road not working yes this
cupola is not working again I discuss
about that before okay I want to know if
you can teach machine learning no I'm
not into machine learning now I'm I want
to do that from a long time but again
you know as a person I want to learn
lots of things I want to learn about
angularjs I want to learn about iOS I
want to go for machine learning but then
it's not possible for me to learn
everything for time we know much not
machine learning in my list I'm focusing
upon a Java because Java is so vast you
know I thought about finishing Java in
one year but it's not possible so okay
next is we want that is caught t-shirt
you want a you could be studying when
I'm not wearing a tie just a t-shirt I
don't know what then if this is I was
planning to go for a you know giveaway
of teach t-shirts but I'm not able to
find a good place where I can buy things
you know I'm not good in with those
marketing skills maybe if you can help
me with this I want to market and it's
called learning I don't know how would
you help me with this because I've seen
lots of channels you know they do they
know how to market things they know how
to get more subscribers in three years I
got 80 ton subscribers there are people
they in in one year they get millions of
subscribers I don't know how what they
do I'm not promoting my channel I'm not
doing those give ever thanks
I don't know that's why I'm not getting
so that t-shirt will be a marketing
strategy for me let's see how it goes so
if you have a good idea let me know you
can you can you can keep giving
solutions within the comment section
later ok again yes Paul IdeaPad 7 1 0 as
oh it has to 58 or 256gb SSD
that's a very good thing nowadays if you
want to improve your performance get a
right in fact I'm going to do that now
today I realize you know I learned
something new today I want to share with
you in essence
okay so we have a hard drive right we
have hard drive and we have SSD and
everyone knows about it everyone knows
about hard drive ever knows about SSD
but in SSD as well we have two two SSDs
now we have normal SSD and we have m2
slot SSDs just search for SSD on Google
and search for m2 SSDs m dot 2 m dot two
SSDs looks exactly the same as same as
ram okay we have a chip format in this
machine which I bought which supports
only m2 SSDs that's a v8 thing so when
you buy a machine make sure that you
check these two things SSD and m2 SSD
and m2 SSDs and to spare SSDs are four
times faster than normal as it is
awesome thing okay okay you are hugely
talented oh thank you so much I love to
look I love to hear those comments ok
Android project live
you caught me there Android project live
in fact I started with Android project
life but you know there are lots of
things on the way and I'm not able to
complete that but still my team is
working on that once we get all the
modules will I will make videos and for
Android live ok one of the best place
with knowledge oh thank you so much
okay okay how is angularjs it's good you
ain't doing good okay
okay so you're not so keen I know degree
for programming yeah you can go for that
I heard about good things of that okay
questions questions questions let us go
pro China is not working yeah okay it's
not working I know I wanted to know -
shoes that need to be solved in Android
apps but what help you need okay so I
wanted to learn Jason Alice's and
database in real time in Android okay
Jason the videos are on the way for
Android but Alice's I doubt even I don't
know how to work with Alice's let's see
okay so Android development as a
full-time career why not I mean there
are lots of companies they want and $1
per so why not you're behind development
come on
it's I said it has a good career okay
good evening yesterday I started
learning Java from your channel that's
great give it up keep learning
watch the inter once the entire place
I'm sure you will learn Java from start
to end
okay okay next next next next next okay
sometimes when difficult to understand
what is your question because the
statement and questions looks similar
and whenever you ask a question put a
question mark at the end so that I will
know it circle as a person okay
what are the first between AI machine
learning deep learning okay I'm not sure
I don't want to comment on those things
I'm not good good in those things okay
all machine learnings how many so many
questions are machine learning
oh that's weird that means I need to
learn now yeah that's great okay how
many days I will learn Java you will
okay it takes approximately 15 to 20
days to learn Java provided you work for
food of five hours a day okay so if you
if you're spending four to five hours a
day you can learn Java in 15-20 days but
then it all depends on one people why
there are some people they are good with
programming they are good with logic so
they will they will not in ten days now
there are some people it takes two
months for them that's fine
I cannot specify exact number of days
but then you have to figure it out so
start walking for four to five hours and
keep practicing so whatever so if you
are watching my videos watch those
videos and do some intense practice as
well so if you practice you will learn
it very efficient way so with that okay
so does Java has a better scope then
dotnet comparatively yes Java has more
opportunities then dotnet now that
doesn't mean it doesn't have
opportunities but any when you compare
Java has more opportunities to ensure
front ordinate reasons Java is open
source and I mean Java is open source
from a long time dot edge is open source
now and all these big technologies they
are built on Java so I'm not saying Java
is the best it's just that other
technologies like Big Data cloud
computing mobile development all are
working with Java now so yes so Java has
more opportunities
okay oh okay
ai is killer yes ai is skill in fact I
heard a quote yesterday and the code s
okay it was a code okay said it was a
photo so in the office a boss has
written of code on a chair and it says
work harder or I will replace you with
AI so just think about it AI is
replacing humans now for what for all
the tasks
so yes it's a killer
Oh amazing the way your pizza oh thanks
so much onion
okay best laptop under 35 K okay so
again I'm not much into a laptop buying
okay and I I'm not a kind of youtuber
who provide all those things but and I'm
trying to do that let's see how it goes
maybe the next video will be what which
is the best program electric laptop for
you let me know if you want those type
of videos okay I was thinking about this
will not suit on me okay but then let me
know if you if you want those our videos
well I will give you suggestions what
laptop to buy which one to buy right
okay so
okay try butch okay so Baba don't they
say see and reply but Baba Ramdev is a
question okay that's weird
Oh can you post angularjs tutorials no
see I'm not a program I'm not actually
what you say a designer I'm a programmer
right I don't work on front-end so I
don't consider fronting technologies for
two reasons I'm not good at it second I
don't have time to invest on those
things I'm lying to and has my back end
what you say back in power
okay so next question best laptop below
one leg Oh first time some invent a bow
and one lakh a best laptop for
programming would be again the laptop
which I bought that that is a gaming
machine that is not required that but I
would suggest to buy them so there's our
HP machine HP I forgot the number

answer your question
show some respect at least okay so when
I will get Android no God for hey you
have freedom 251 are you serious you got
that mobile phone oh no I thought it's
it's just it's a scam
hello is Bitcoin is just over height I
don't know some longtime people are
talking about this after that I wanna
cry attack people are talking about
people are talking about Bitcoin now but
then in a big in Bitcoin technology we
have something called as blockchain
which is getting very famous now so
whatever it suggests it is learn to
learn drops in as well
there are lots of tutorials available or
that on on blockchain which is of the
way which works with Bitcoin now but I
know I don't I'm not sure or from where
you will learn that I have not seen
videos on that okay
okay next question do you have videos on
mobile database also my app need to
store 10k records and query ah
no idea how to I mean I do have a video
on database but then I I don't store
data in mobile databases so whenever I
make an application so whatever I think
so I made now for Android so it is
Android and DITA will be there on this
server so that's my plan so in that I
use masculine suicide and masculine
store huge amount of data but I'm not
sure about mobile database we can use
SQLite but I doubt about the performance
of a skew light if you have huge
database of 10k records so I don't have
to go on that anyway talk about machine
learning machine learning okay machines
nothing is actually a I AI technology
where a machine will learn itself you
know but how exactly it works I'm not
sure HP machines has heating issues all
the machines in fact my Mac has dating
issues you know if I if I use my Mac for
video editing for any of the ADI heavy
stuff it gets very it gets heated I I
think all the machines have eating
issues Java is better than no dot genius

better than no tortillas okay so will
