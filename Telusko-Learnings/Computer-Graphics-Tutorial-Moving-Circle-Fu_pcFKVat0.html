our computer graphics in which we will
just move a circle from one position to
another position in a slow motion
again for that we have a basic graphics
program in which I have detected a graph
I have initialized the graph now I need
to move a circle for moving a circle I
required I require a four loop basically
first of all vegetto simple circle then
we will see how to move it for drawing a
circle we have a function that is circle
circle will ask you for three parameters
first two parameters are the coordinates
of the circle or the center of the
circle let it be the 200 comma 200 the
coordinates then let make like hideous
as 50 when I see the output for this I
will get like output something like this
so I got a circle here the only thing is
I need to move this for moving a circle
like let's move the circle in horizontal
the way that means I need to increment
its x-coordinate whenever I increment
its x-coordinate by say 50 I will see
that the circle is moved yeah it has
been moved if you remember the first
output and you will see the second
output you will say something change
with you all right
by the thing I want to I would I want to
see this circle is moving so for this I
need to shift this circle point by point
oh you can say pixel by pixel that means
by plus one then question is how many
time I need to add just one plus one
plus one so I here here I need to do
same repeated things so for that I can
use loop let's let us just use a for
loop for at a required for counter
variable so let let us just start my
photo from I equal to 1 and let I just
move for 2
100 pixels and I plus plus so for this I
need a cuddly basis I need to move this
x coordinate by eye time that is your by
plus 100 from one 200 when ice when now
I say this output I'll see something
like this the thing is the circle is
moved but the circle is moved in such a
way that it has left is last point in a
consecutive way so I need to clear the
last point when I draw a new point
because here what happens is your first
circle is drawn as 201 202 hundred one
when I I equal to one so here we have
two hundred one then two hundred that
means my x coordinate is 201 and Y
coordinates two hundred and I have a
radius of 50 when my father was
incremented my I I will get to that it
is 202 that means my sentence position
is moving horizontal way so every time
when I draw this circle I need to clear
the earliest one so I use clear device I
hope you know that whenever I went to
clear the console screen we use CL SCR
but when we need to clear the graphic
screen I need to use clear device so
when I say the output now yo my sucker
is moving but I want this circle to be
moved in a very slow motion so whenever
I want to make any slow motion I can use
a function called as delay there is a
function which can which can delay my
execution let's delay is my execution by
500 milliseconds so this 500 is a bit in
milliseconds but whenever I use do they
function I need to input include up add
a file that is dose dot H so I hope I
can now I can see this motion slow yeah
you can see that
the circle is moving in a very slow
motion right this find it picks up our
waste low so let's let us just make it
bit faster so whenever you decrease the
dealer you can we can just have a look
on this thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
