driven bean so first step you have to
start a server now if we talk about eg
B's so forth a GPU requires something
called as application server so your web
server is not enough so if we talk about
application server so just go to the
service service type in that beans and
this you will see we have two servers
one is your Tomcat and second is
GlassFish so in order to create two in
order to start the server just right
click on use the GlassFish you can see
there's a start button here so if it is
already started what we can do is we can
just verify it is started or not just go
to this server you can see the address
is localhost colon and the port number
is four eight four eight so you can go
to a browser and simply type localhost
for 8 for 8 for got a colon here
it's colon and enter something is
getting open like it's yeah so you can
see this is your GlassFish console I
guess it is zoomed let me just reduce it
yeah much proper now you can see there
is something called a JMS resources here
so if you click on Seamus resources you
have lots of things here you have
something as applications so all they
deployed application on your glass which
will be coming here so if i open i have
already - let me remove this deploy ok
so you can see I don't have any
application which is deployed and in
this JMS resources you have two things
one is connection factory and second one
is destination resources so first we
have to create connection factory I have
already - this time we'll get a new one
for this so I will select ok let me
select jndi name here and we'll give J
India name you can give
so I'm giving here GM s GM s demo slide
so the gem has damaged my directory and
my name will be let's say my message so
you can have anything so we'll save this
thing somewhere it is GM s demo slash my
message let me keep it simple it's a JMS
demo slash Naveen just to remember
so this JMS demo slash Naveen and the
type of connection factory I'll be using
here is Q is because I'm going for point
to point and then that's it you have
lots of features here I will simply say
okay so once you have given JDI name
which is JMS demo slash Naveen and I'm
soaking Q so JMS demo / Naveen okay so I
can say I have JMS demo / Naveen now we
had to create a destination so we'll
create a destination by default I have
one I will click on new and here I will
provide a G India name so you can have
any name again I will say it is JMS demo
/ the win test for destination and you
can have any name here we'll say this is
my service say my service
alright to add a description and you can
select or type as q and you can simply
click on ok so I can see I have two
things now I have connection factory and
make sure it is enabled and I have the
wind dust which is again IQ make sure it
is enabled so once you're done with this
step will then will create a project in
NetBeans but how to get a project in
NetBeans for MDB that we'll see in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
