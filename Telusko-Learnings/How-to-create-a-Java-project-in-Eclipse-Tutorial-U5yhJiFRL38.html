the Eclipse IDE which is the Kepler
version and then we have done with the
unzipping now if you open this Eclipse
so you can see there are lots of files
and one of the file there is your
Eclipse application now in order to use
eclipse you don't have to install it you
just have to unzip it
okay so plug-and-play software so just
to use it just double click on this
Eclipse and then it will take some time
for the loading since it will be your
first time it will take some time now
you can choose a workspace here so you
can define a workspace anywhere so what
is workspace it's a place it's a folder
well where all your project to the site
let me say this workspace name as a sure
of saying this I will say eclipse this
is my project and click on OK now it
will create a folder called as Eclipse
Hadj in your home folder and then it
will open your Eclipse IDE with the with
that ring what with that workspace and
that's your eclipse here
ok so initially it will it will look
something in this way so if you can view
just tutorials you can view some sample
codes will not do that here close it now
in order to use eclipse so this is your
area so this is the area where you will
be having all your projects
this is the ADI you'll be having all
your servers then console ok now to work
with Eclipse or to create your sample
application what we need is we have to
create a sample project so to create a
project just right click on this project
or project Explorer and click on new
click on project now there are multiple
options you can choose here
so in this will create a normal Java
project so we'll select a Java project
and say next we'll give a project name
will say sample application that's your
project name sample app and then
we can simply sell next year and that's
it structure you'll be following so
click on finish now once you click on
finish it will ask you for the
perspective so if you can see this area
here then the right top you can see
there is something Java EE so Java EE is
a perspective here but since we are
walking as a java application which is a
co java application we have to switch
from Java EE perspective to Java
perspective and that's what it's asking
for so we'll say yes it will convert it
will change the perspective so you can
see from Java EE it has changed to Java
now that's your application here now in
order to create your first application
of first class what you can simply do is
you can just right click on your order
SRC folder with a new and we'll say
class here and we'll name this class as
let's say test demo now and we can also
mention the package name we'll say calm
calm dot loving dot test demo and by
default all the classes in Java it has a
superclass which is object class we also
need a main function here so we'll say
publisher avoid mean or a method with
which will be generated automatically
and just click on finish so you can see
we have a test demo class here in which
I have a main method yeah so in this
video we have seen how to how to open
eclipse how to choose how to choose a
workspace and how to create a sample
application in which to create a sample
good so in the next video we'll see how
to route a code in this and how to
execute this so thank you so much for
watching and do subscribe for other
videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
