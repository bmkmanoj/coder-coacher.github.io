use anonymous class right so let me
repeat what we have seen so we can
create an anonymous class by specifying
the object and then the implementation
of it normally what happens is we create
a class and then we create the object
right
but in anonymous class we first create
the object and then we specified the
implementation of it I mean what exactly
that that object is so let's try to
implement that concept in interface so
an interface what we what we have is
that if you focus on this implementer
class the only purpose of that class is
to implement ABC right since we wanted
the object of ABC we have created a
class here which implements ABC and then
we can say ABC obj equals a new
implementer and we can call it what if
we I can simply say a new ABC will that
work and the answer is no is because you
cannot create the object of interface
you can see that it is giving you an
error you cannot instantiate the type
ABC because in ABC's interface right now
why we cannot create the order of
interfaces because it doesn't have the
implementation what if I can just
provide the limitation here itself or
something like in an anonymous class I
can create this method or I can just
copy this code and if they should here
so I can just create a class and the
method definition so I don't need this
class right so if you can focus on this
this thing here now we have an object of
ABC which also has the implementation
which is void show so we don't need that
class you can see that we don't have a
class there and if I run this code you
can see we got the output as anything
because we are printing anything here
and if you change this text if I say and
the best and if you run this code you
can see we got the output as I'm
depressed so that's how you use
anonymous class to instantiate the
interface the advantages it will not
waste lots of your memory when you use a
normal class it creates a class file
this will also create a class file but
this will be used only in this
particular class you cannot reuse this
definition so if you see if your idea is
not to reuse the definition you can
always go for anonymous class in fact it
is my favorite afters
after some videos you will understand
the real power of anonymous class so
stay tuned for that but you can create
the object of interface using anonymous
class so we can say interface I mean ABC
obj equal to new ABC and we can provide
the implementation here itself we don't
have to create a new class for that so
yeah that's about this video the next
video will to see the types of
interfaces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
