from political earnings and in this
video we'll talk about jst l function
tags now we have seen decode tags right
so we have this see where we have here
using Co tags but jst also provides you
some function as well as example if you
want to find this length of the string
or maybe you want to check if the
current if the if a string I'm Emily for
what is there in this particular string
if maybe you want to check if the
particular string is is matching with
the end of the string and all the stuff
in early if you want it you're going to
do some if you want to perform some
operations we can use inbuilt functions
of jst L so in order to use gstl
function we have to use again the tag
lip but this time we'll say okay prefix
will set FN and we'll go for you our I
as HTTP colon slash slash let's ask it
for function so this is functions now
what are the functions are enable so
we'll go one by one the first one we'll
use is let's say maybe length which is
easier so let's let's try to find the
length of the string so I will take a
string now okay how to assign a string
so let's create a string will say set
where we'll name the string name as STR
and we'll set a value and then the value
would be Naveen Reddy's or Naveen Reddy
is a Java trainer okay so we have this
string here and I want to I want to find
the length of it so I will print length
: I want to print the length here and
how do you do that we'll say we will use
this percentage I mean the dollar sign
and then we have to provide angular
brackets and this you have to mention
STR but if you mention H th will bring
the string right let's try it out let's
run this code let's see how this goes
okay just printing the string I don't
want this spring I want the length so
what we'll do is we'll use a function
here we say function : and the function
name is length and in this length if you
pass STR it will print the
of it if I say enter now you can see we
got length which is 29 I don't know what
is 11 or 13 14 15 maybe it will be
tonight 20 and if you can count it it is
29 right so that's how we use length
function that's one of the function we
can use what are the function we have
let's say I want to what else we can do
we can use we can use split here I want
to split this string based on space here
so whenever you have space we have to be
way to break that I want to split it so
what we can do is let's not print this
length now see when you split it will
create an added right because if you
split instead of having one variable you
will be having an array which will have
Naveen Reddy is a Java trainer so we
will be having six words not to have to
store that six words again we can use a
for each loop here to print everything
and we'll set okay what we'll do here is
we'll first of all we specify the items
now this items would be I cannot say STI
because if I say STR it will be one
string right I want to break this string
now do you break it will use a function
okay so we will put that into a function
but that function name would be so we
say function the function name is split
okay see up to a split and then you have
to pass this STI displayed but hold on
on which basis you want displayed so if
I split with on the basis of space you
can see if I am specifying comma a space
and single quote it will split the
elements based on their space right and
then we can store the elements somewhere
against let's say I want to store the
element in s and now I can print the
element before printing I want a break
now do you print it it's very simple we
can say a dollar then a curly brackets
and s and now if I go back there if I
say enter you can see we got all this
words here with as simple as that right
so we can we can have a string which is
now in 2008 we know and we can split
that with the help of double code I mean
with the help of space and then we can
put all the element
that is that is split method what else
we can do we can split based on the a
later so that we have a here then we
have a here then we have a and a we have
lots of a right let's try to do that
let's let's see if it is working with a
you can see we got with a as well okay
that's how you use split method what
else we have we can also use another
method like or function functions like
index off now index off will give you
the index of that particular string
let's say I want to find this index
number of ease now how do we do that
we'll say index : we'll use a function
here so used to use function again you
have to use this thing
then we have to is use FN : the method
name is index off okay and you have to
pass two things first the string which
is STR the second one is the string
which you want to pass I want to pass
let's say is so it will print the index
of is so it should be 11 12 13 maybe or
12 12 it should be 12 or so it will be
12 yeah you can see regard 12 so that is
the index number of 12 that is the next
number of A's so that is your index of
or we can also use we can also use
contains now how can we use contains we
say is there we can print is there okay
- is only print is there and because if
I want to check if this string contains
Java so I can do that we can say a
dollar then you can use a function here
function : contains okay and then we can
use a function by passing a string not a
zero but a string so we can pass a
string the first parameter and the
second parameter would be your okay
watch of the string itself we'd say this
is do we have Java there let's try
yes Java is there so is there true which
is there but if I say does it have JSP
let's try you can see false so you can
use contains in fact normally we use
contains an if condition we can also do
that
and say we can also do if here we will
say see : if in your code tags we do
have if and we can apply tests here
because when you say test when you want
to check your applied test we say equal
to and we can put everything a double
quotes here which will check and if okay
we have to also a we have to also end it
so this is a if block here and inside we
can print we can print a JSP is there
right if this matches you will print is
there otherwise it will not print okay
we got an error there the error is it
should be in single quote now because we
are using a double quote there my badge
okay so you can see we are printing
nothing because it is not there but if I
plain if I check for Java and if I
planed Java is there it will say yes
Java is there right so that's how we can
use contains function we have moved some
more functions we can check with ends
width if this function ends with or if
the string ends with Java I mean it with
trainer then we'll print you are right
body
okay it should ends with which it should
end with or trainer okay its ends with
not ends with ends with and if I say
enter your right body but if you say
Java trainer is a Java trainer and
Mumbai and if I on this now so you can
say last word his Mumbai tights which is
not matching so he can also check with
ends with okay what are this we can have
so yeah so we did so we have all these
functions what you can do is you can
explore more function you can simply say
dollar then curly brackets f n : and if
you say you can see we have lots of
methods here we have joined we have
replaced with it right I would try all
this all these combinations you can also
use to uppercase to lowercase the same
way we are doing this example we can say
STR and it will it will print in to
uppercase if I run this code or a to
lowercase right so you can see
everything is printed in lowercase here
if I use a perky
it will print everything in uh pockets
if I say enter you can say regard now
into it is a Java tone in Mumbai s dot
awesome right so the Jo steel has so
much of power so that's about function J
