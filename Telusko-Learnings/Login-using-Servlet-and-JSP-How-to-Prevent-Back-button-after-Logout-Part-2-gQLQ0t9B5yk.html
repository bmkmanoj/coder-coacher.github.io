ready and today they're going to talk
about login using servlet and JSP
practical part two in fact I made the
uglier video last year and luckily I got
good numbers of views on that video and
people were able to run this code and
everything is working perfectly but then
with one particular issue and that issue
is when you click on log out and when
you go back using back button you can
see the paid last page which is the a
secure page and this does not happen
right example when you go to Facebook
and when you click on logout now when
you click on back after going to
Facebook it will not show you the home
page right it will go to it with login
page automatically how that works
because if you see our code in fact I
have written the same code in Eclipse
now as you can see we have the code
ready here and whatever you do is okay
in fact if you have not seen my first
video make sure that you watch this
video because then it will make more
sense otherwise this will be what you
say a costume up video for you so make
sure you watch this video first and in
fact you will find the link in
description area and you can continue
with this video then okay so if I've run
this code if I don't this code once
again if I so right click and run as one
on server okay it's running on server
now it will open my Firefox of the
browser because that's what I've set in
my Eclipse so the moment you run this
code what's happening is it's running or
taking some time so by the time it opens
let me open Firefox as well and you can
see in the Firefox we have to navigate
to login dot JSP because that's where
you have your things will say login
dodgy in fact before going for login
jsut what I'm sure is I would say
welcome dot JSP if I click on enter you
can see we got a login page because
welcome JSP and the videos videos dot
JSP those are secure pages if you have
to go there first you have to login so
we'll set that is co and l and you can
see this is one more issue we are able
to see the password that's not that
that's not a good way and if I click on
login you can see because the welcome
page now if I click on videos here you
can see record video link in fact I want
to change this as well we'll do that in
some time if I go back and you fight
on logout now we are logged out of the
system right and if I click on the back
button can you see that we are able to
see the secured page now this is not a
good thing right this is this is what
you say a security flaw now how to avoid
this so we do all these things in this
video first of all let me change
something let me change this password
from L I mean instead of saying this
password let's make it dot now how do I
do that I will go to my Eclipse and I
will say okay I don't want to see the
password so I will go to login dot JSP
and when you video you have text for the
password let's mention password because
this will make sure that you cannot see
the password okay we can verify that if
I go if I refer this page now and you
can see whatever password you type now
it will be in that dot format right now
you cannot see the password if I click
on if I plus L you can see we got dot so
we got our first time the second thing I
will do is if you can see in the form
tag when you say form if you don't
mention the method name it is by default
get and in fact in serve it as well I'm
using doget not again this is not a good
practice whenever you send data from
client to server we have to make sure
that we are using a post request because
when we will send data to the server you
should use post whenever you are
fetching data from the server you should
use get now in this scenario post makes
more sense so first of all I have to
change this to from do get to do post
because I want to send a post request
now and in login dot JSP as well I will
mention the method as post so that's one
more change which I had done here so we
got a post request and the are using do
post there so we have done two changes
the third change what I do is in this
video those videos dot JSP entry instead
of instead of seeing that link example
if I if I logged in here and if I go
what's wrong okay we have to shut this
server because I made some changes in
the servlet so let me us do that let's
say they start the server and if I go
back to my browser if I click on login
now oh I forgot to enter the password if
I click on login I was taking some time
because the server is still getting this
started
what's wrong I'm using a get request is
it a get request here okay this is a
post request that's perfectly fine in
login that we got do post what's wrong
here let me just run this application
and know what is going wrong there okay
it's not able to fully restored eating
as well okay it says SUV metal gate is
not supported by this URL
but why we are using a post request
everything is perfectly fine there okay
so this should be do post and we got do
post nothing nothing else the thing okay
so now sometime it happens you know dump
you can what you can do is you can clean
your project just to make sure that
everything is perfect you know you also
get some catchy files in the in your
eclipse as well okay let's do it
so we have done with the cleaning and
now let's run this project once again if
I say run as the non server this or this
server and let's verify okay so I was
getting started and I will go to Firefox
just to verify everything is working
let's reset the first this page and we
have to call login dot JSP it will ask
you for two things let's insert insert
either just go and password el and if I
click on login oh it's working perfectly
now I guess there's some issue with the
debris files okay if I click all videos
here you can see we got the link I don't
want a link here what I want is the
video the way you can do that is okay
watch what's going wrong there is we
have written the videos link as it is
this is not a good way we should have I
think the link of the video you should
be using some embedded text now so where
do we get the embedded link so if you go
back to the video and inside every video
will have in fact on YouTube every video
will have this option off share now if I
click on share this option of embed now
in the same bed if you just copy that
embed link and paste it in your Eclipse
your job is done now the moment you is
click on I mean the moment you pasted in
JSP if you say
let's go back to Firefox let's refresh
this page now instead of getting a link
you can actually watch a video in fact
you can play this video and it will get
today and as you can see it is getting
played now okay let's go back so we have
done all those changes now the most
important change what we want is a
guillotines to that once again the most
important change is if I click on logout
if I click on back this should not come
now first of all before solving that
issue first understand why the issue is
coming the issue is that because you
know we have this awesome feature which
is called as HTTP HTTP protocol now HTTP
protocol provides you lots of features
examples session is provided by OTP we
got cookies and the most important part
is cache now cache is what makes your
web browsing experience way faster right
if you go to Facebook if you go to
youtube you know what I'm talking about
you know you can access all those pages
as quick as possible because we do men
do maintain the cache now same thing is
happening here when I click on logout
and when I click on when it go back this
is the page which you are getting here
is a cached page what I have to inform
to my browser say browser please don't
catch these pages because this are
secure pages I don't want this to be
cached but how do you interact with your
browser now whatever you want to mention
to the browser you can do that with the
help of headers now every browser read
headers as well so how do you how do you
send a header that I don't want to save
this page not just video space but also
welcome page let's do that in the
Welcome page first now the way you can
do the way you can send these headers to
the client is using the response object
so we can say response dot this is a
medical asset header so you can send
lots of data to the client one of the
method is set header now inside this you
have to mention two things the first is
the label so what you are sending a
label is you are sending a label for
cache-control now your browser
understand what cache cache control is
you can pass your instructions here now
if you don't know what the instruction
is it's very simple in double coach
mention no cash again you have to buy
hard this because this is
browser-specific or this is what you say
this is browser is something which a
browser needs this thing ok so they say
no cash no store and you have to mention
must revalidate for every action I mean
every time you call this page it should
rewrite it if it is logged in or not I
mean whatever you want to whatever you
want to check for the validation right
so you just have to set the header as
cache control no cash no store rewrite
it I will copy this code and let me just
paste this in videos GSP as well because
I want it there as well so whatever you
do is once you have done all the changes
let me restart the server okay and if I
go to Firefox and if I refers this as
well now if I insert L and if I click on
login okay it's happening something is
happening behind the scene okay you got
you got your page if I click on videos
here it's working perfectly if I go back
and if I click on logout now so logged
out successfully if I click on back can
you see that we are not getting welcome
to our JC page that means that it was
not cached and your browser is not able
to give that welcome to our JC page so
this is what we want right when you
click on logout it should it should show
login dot JSP and it should not allow
you to go back now this was one way the
another way is you can disable your back
button right but then this is not a good
way because if you disable your back
button what will happen is it will give
you a user a bad experience because no
one wants to disable their back button
how how dare you to do that right so no
one will use your website so this is one
way I mean this is the best way which is
response dot set header now the thing is
this works this perfectly works on HTTP
1.1 like this this is the this protocol
version supports this type of text what
if you have the older version of HTTP
working in that case you have to set one
more thing because this will not work
there so you have to say set header and
you have to specify
pragma and the value for that would be
no cash if you are using for this thing
if you are working on the older version
which is HTTP 1.0 but then if you are
using any proxy server then you have to
say response dot set header and you have
to say expires because proxy server will
have your cache if you don't want to
maintain the cache it there just say
expires and you have to mention the time
0 so for 0 minutes or 0 seconds you have
to mention this this should be I mean
expiry zero second the moment you exit
that page it will be gone right for
proctors fluxes so one point one for
HTTP I mean for one point one the first
line one point zero second line and
fourth roxas this or third line the same
thing you need to be done on all the
pages which other pages you have so
individuals of GSP also I will do the
same thing remove those ok then so
that's how you can stop going you can
you can prevent some bad button so yeah
that's it from this video I have talked
about the back button working ok now
what else I want to do here so there are
more some some more changes the changes
like and so if we talk about this log in
J log in Java here we are checking
statically right we are verifying the
static coded text now the thing is this
will this doesn't look good because the
data should be coming from database so
again we'll be doing that in one of the
video and then we'll also do JavaScript
ideation now I want to show you one more
thing in this video which is very very
important now in in one of the comments
I saw as they were talking about this
thing session dot get a tribute username
so I'm started writing username here
which means I mean according to the
comment it says whenever I user logged
in it will allow all other users now
that doesn't make any sense because if
we talk about session object
this is browser specific which means the
moment you've changed your browser a new
browser will have a new session object
when you are verifying here you are
verifying for one particular browser
right let me prove my point so if I go
back to Firefox you can see if I log
into the system now I am logged in if I
go to if I type here manually
by video star GSB I will be able to do
that because I am already logged in but
if I go to a different browser example
if I go to Safari here and if I enter
the same the extra files I enter you can
see it is not opening videos or J's
which is opening a login page because
this is a new browser a new session and
of course if you have a new session it
will it will it will send you to login
page again right so yeah that's it from
this video guys I hope you enjoyed it
