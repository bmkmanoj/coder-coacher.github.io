have seen we have created this list with
five elements and then we tried to print
this with the help of normal for loop
and then with the help of enhanced for
loop now the problem with these two
loops are there are external loops which
takes some time to print in Java 8 we
have internal iteration in which you can
fetch the value using for each method
nothing so if you want this code you can
see we got the output as 4 5 6 7 8
but the problem is we are using
something called as this arrow here now
this arrow is called as lambda
expression so this is your lambda here
now to understand how lambda works what
we'll do is we'll create a new file so
we'll create a new file here we'll name
this file as let's say class we'll say
this is lambda demo so we go to file
which is lambda demo here in which I
also need a main method and so in this
class what I will do so let me let's say
we have an interface here we have an
interface and we'll name this interface
as a just to make it simple we have a
interface a here and in this interface
we have a method which is which is so I
guess if we got a method which is show
here right by default all the method
interface our body for public so we
don't have to mention public there so we
have a method a in which I have or we
have interface a in which we have
ethical as show right now i what i want
i want to instantiate this a and I want
to print hello so whenever I call show I
want to print hello that's it right so
the way you can instantiate that a is
because you can create our reference of
a that's possible because you can you
can create a reference of interface but
you cannot create object of interface
right because we don't have the
implementation of show so what we need
we need a class here and we'll end this
class as maybe XYZ so we have this class
X Y Z and this class implements a write
and then it is our responsibility to to
write this show method
and then in which we'll print and which
will print hello right that's how you
implement interface so we have an
interface a and then we require a class
to implement that interface so that you
can define this method show and indeed
you can't we can print hello right now
we can say obj equal to new a so we can
have a difference of interface an object
of a class that's possible right so we
have obj equal to nu X Y Z and then we
can say obj dot show and if I on this
code you can say we got an output which
is hello right so we can we can create a
number of interface and then we can
define a class which implements that
interface and you can define all the
abstract methods and then you can just
call it sounds quite right but there's a
problem here now if you see this XYZ
class so the whole purpose of this class
is just to implement a write that said
that stretch what you're doing it's
there's no other work for this class and
we are using this class only once so if
you have this scenario where you where
you're using a class when you for once
why to even create that class what you
can do is we can dice you say a right so
we can say a obj and then when you click
and say obj equal to new a now why we
cannot create this is because a doesn't
have the implementation what if if I
provide the implementation here itself
you can just give a curly brackets after
this object creation that's how you get
anonymous object right and then we can
provide the implementation here itself
and to provide implementation we have to
define a method which is show and here
we'll print hello so instead of
providing the implementation in this
class we can provide the implementation
here so before running this code let me
show you the class file there or the
when you compile this code what what are
the class files you will get so let me
just open that folder for you
and see that this is the this is the
folder we have so in which you have
class a of course because we have a
class called as a or we have a interface
called as H which will also have a class
file we have a demo for it that was the
earlier file we had let's talk about
this in file so we can say we have a
lambda demo and then we have a we've got
the implementation of this let me just
go back to the previous code we'll just
copy this code okay let me just cut this
part and again make it XYZ and we'll
comment with them of the comment so if
you if you go with this type of coding
and you if you can see the files here so
we can see we have a we have lambda demo
and then then we have X Y Z right so we
call three files and if I just comment
this again and if I replace this with a
bracket and then we can just paste that
code here so if you have this type of
implementation so this block here is
called as a plus right whenever you have
methods inside a block that will be a
class so this is a class here now this
class is a class inside lambda demo it
is called as inner class now this class
doesn't have a name that's why this type
of classes are called as anonymous inner
class right sounds good so we have a
class which is anonymous and when you
create animals in the class you get a
class which is lambda demo dollar one
since we don't have a name for the class
it will say dollar one now what we'll do
is if you just observe this code okay so
if you just op the observe this code we
have an interface which has only one
method okay and then we are trying to
implement this now if I if I show you
something in this way if I have a obj on
the left side is it quite obvious that
there will be new a on the right side so
this is obvious thing right what about
the method inside a you just have one
method which is public void show then
why to even write that because when we
talk about implementation or a method
you need three things the method name
the method parameters and the method
return type if you have
and everything inside the interface
y-you have to write this thing here so
that means this part this part is called
this this is called as boilerplate code
we don't require this thing it's not
compulsory right so what we can do is in
Java 8 it gives you a feature you can
remove this code now since you are
removing this curly brackets we need to
also remove this condom package so let
me remove this first and then we'll
remove this part here and we can simply
say this block is the part of this
method so this is the method declaration
there so if you remember that section so
we had let me just write this once again
so let keep it there let come in this
part and we'll write this code I once
again so what we can do is we can say
obj equal to we don't have to write this
thing here from here to here we just
have to mention this round brackets so
we'll use a non bracket here and we'll
mention whatever you are writing here
will be a part of this arrow and it will
be with the help of quality brackets I
will say it is s out and I will print
hello right and then we can provide a
semicolon here so instead of fighting
this block of code we can simply write
this block this block of code and if I
done this I in mind you this only works
in Java 8 so we can say we got hello
here but just we just have one line
right here so yeah this thing is for a
lambda expression so we just have one
line here so if you have only one line
you do not have to write this curly
brackets also and we can remove this
semicolon and we can write everything in
one line so we can just remove this and
that's your way of implementing an
interface so this is same as this block
and this is same as this block right so
it is it just this syntax difference no
if you check this files you can see we
don't have any inner class and that's
the advantage of lambda expression
awesome right and yeah so that's your
method definition and we need to print
something now let's say if I if I change
this thing let's say I have a parameter
here so I'm taking a parameter which is
ain't I and so if you if you define this
cos I have to mention
I and then we can print the value of our
year providing if you pass a value and
the same thing we're to do for the new
class we need to take a parameter again
if I have just commented that part I'm
just talking about if let's say if you
are working with that way now what about
this here also we need to mention it is
int
I and then we can pass the value of I
here just to print it we can also pass
the value so we are passing sex so this
6 goes here and then we are printing the
value of 6 so it will print hello six
and if I run this code we get we got
hello six right now Java 8 Pro Watch is
one more feature if you see the
interface we have we have already
mentioned that inside show we have int
then why to you one mention this we can
just remove this part and we have I
right and then we do not have to declare
that I also and as the advantage again
with Java 8 it removes lots of boiler
codes and if you have only one parameter
you do not have to even write that round
brackets you can simply use I of a dough
and then hello great so that's how you
use lambda expression so this is lambda
expression here so whenever you try to
implement something you use lambda
expression so you are passing a value
and then you are trying to print it so
this is lambda expression here now let's
go back to the demo demo for each method
so if you can see it's almost same right
whatever we have mentioned there so it
is almost same so for sure this line
here is the implementation of some
interface this is the implementation of
interface a so this line here is the
implementation of some interface right
and that interface is consumer interface
so it is consumer interface okay now
what exactly consumer interface is that
we'll see in the next video so thank you
so much for watching and do subscribe
for the consumer video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
