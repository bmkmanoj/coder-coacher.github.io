define methods and interface with the
help of default methods okay so we can
we can define methods or interfaces in
default methods right so let's say we
have we are using these object values
and using values I am calling a method
which is for each but hold on this
interface this leads to the interface
right so if I go to list you can see
this is an interface now that means this
list will up is it belongs to it belongs
to a version which is 1.2 so it is there
from 1.2 version that means this method
for each belongs to least so it should
be there from 1.2 but no it is
introduced in Java and 1.8 right so is
it a declared a method or defined method
you cannot modify a interface and that
means you cannot add a declared a method
interface once it is published so that
means this method for age should be our
default method so let's go to forage and
you can see this is our default method
which means you can directly use this
method which is 4h instead of defining
this method you can directly use it so
this for each method is a default method
so all your latest latest interfaces
which has latest methods they all are
default methods clear now let's see what
are the extra methods it has or what is
it what it says so this for each method
is not a part of least it's a part of a
table and list exchange collection and
collection if I click on collection
collection exchange it table so this
method for each comes from a table to
least so they have not changed anything
in this they have changed things in this
method web interface called as bit
tribal and which is introduced in Java
1.8 so in future if you are seeing any
extra any new method any any interface
so by default their methods are default</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
