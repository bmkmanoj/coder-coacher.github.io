question you have to solve this I never
find the option whether it can be all
good it can be landing and it can be
knowledge the first is no solution you
know what are these kids so it is or
negate both if any of this one is
anybody without the input is 1 to 1 this
is navigate this is not so it is an ant
both are one than one for this man
it is not yet it is not all and this is
XO XO this if both are same then that
was it is so you want to solve this it
was the green footages X bar the swipe
at the whole house and the effects on
with X plus X on thanks picks off and
the whole bar so you have again or they
can solve this so to use suitable find X
find by X bar Y bar X plus X square plus
y bar the whole pile and then your pixel
that's the easiest way okay a second way
second way is you have to solve this so
this will be e so X plus X bar plus y
power the whole bar this is X
like I saw this this will be X bar bar
dot y bar file using team of the swap
and this will be Excel and if you solve
this this will be same no change here
this will be x dot y it is x dot y ik
solver thanks
and I thought you have to solve that
this is thanks y bar plus X bar Y which
makes our formula okay and then the
whole bar I've salted this will be X Y
bar bar dot X bar Y we're going to solve
this this will be X bar plus y we can
using the most common and this will be
dot this design height of X plus y bar
if you cross multiply this really text
file into X will be 0 X bar into y bar
plus thanks Y because Y into y bar will
be 0 then this textured with x dot y we
have to solve this but this X on so just
on the SEC saw this is thanks dot y dot
X bar Y bar plus XY the whole bar plus
this is H dot y the whole van dot X bar
plus y X 1 1 y bar plus X 1
I mean if you saw this will be I can
wait to remove this barrier so Helios H
dot y dot this will be X bar dot y bar
by dot X dot y 5 Plus this will be what
if you multiply this this is I start
divide the whole bar dot X bar dot y bar
plus when you smelled you like this 2
this will be 0 it's not buy the whole
bar and x1 in the remaining part is okay
and multiply so say if you multiply this
number if you multiply X Y into X X 1 Y
it will be 0 so by using be more
personal you know it should be X double
bar should be X bar plus y double bonded
as a wider bye-byes
that's a dancer is about what next job
you can isolate this X bar can you see X
bar plus y bar X bar Y bar and then this
will be X bar this will be X bar Y bar
plus X bar Y bar which turns out to be X
bar dot y bar and the answer is this
will be X plus y the whole bar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
