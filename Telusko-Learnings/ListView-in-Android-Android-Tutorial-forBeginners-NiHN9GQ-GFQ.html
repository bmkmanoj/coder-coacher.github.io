from telesco learnings and in this video
we'll talk about least view so whenever
you have anyway you have your mobile
phone let's say if you are working on
your mobile phone and you if you see if
you open our application which is your
contacts you can see we get lots of
contacts ID and all those contacts in a
format of least view if you use a decent
call log so everything is list view
right so we'll try to implement list
view in this video so for that me to
first create an activity so we'll say a
new activity which is empty activity
here and we'll then this activity as
ListView activity that sounds good so we
have list to be activity here we'll
click on finish and okay so we have our
activity here with the XML file so in
this we require our list view now how to
include a ListView so basically least
view is the grouping of items in a
vertical format so what we'll do is
we'll we'll take ListView so you can see
once you scroll down in the containers
you can find this view there just drag
your list view on the screen and this is
how it looks like so we have okay and so
we have list item 1 item 2 item 3 and if
I run this code we can see the same
output on the emulator but we don't want
to see the same output what we want is a
different set of values here and once we
get the values once you click on this
button any of any any item it should
show that item they toast so that we can
also achieve the listener now how to do
that so we have to follow certain steps
here the first step is you have to link
this view for that we have to provide
the ID or we already have an ID which is
least viewed to will say this is
programming or prog list that's my list
name so it is prog list and here what I
will do I will mention the abaca object
of first I will play it or provide
reference for the ListView so this is
list view
oh the best list view let's list view
control space yeah so this list view
space we can provide any name we'll say
L V okay and here we had to provide the
object or the memory for the list view
so we'll say this is least view and our
default code which is fine view by ID we
have to say r dot ID dot that's
programming list right so everything you
do with this LV it will effect on that
programming list now whenever you want
to insert some value so what values I
want to insert so this is my this is my
view here so that's my view I want to
insert some values now what values I
want to insert the programming language
names okay so for that I will create a
array of string which will hold the
programming languages name so we'll say
string values equal to we can provide
directly an array and we can say the
first language it's a all instead of
having a so we can say C language then
we can have C++ we can have what Java
yeah we can also include Android here
right and then we can say sure I take C
sharp that will be a crime right but
sure let's do it and then we can add
last one or VIN to add lots of right so
we'll say assembly then we say Python
write some more we have Ruby
we have VB and one more okay last one
more so we'll say this is Scala okay so
that's the programming language names
now I want to show this list on the list
view so if I try so if I say LV dot so
normally when you want to add values how
we add we can simply say LV dot we can
use add so you can see there is no
option of adding this values how can you
add a normal array into a list that's
not possible directly and that is why
list view follow something called as
adapter
so whenever you want to add values into
the ListView we need to use something
called as adapter so there are certain
types of adapters we can use we can use
an adapter we can use simple cursor
adapter and there are multiple adapters
we can use whenever you want to fetch
data from an array so if you have an
array and you want to set that values to
the list we need to use an adapter when
you have when you want to work with
database so let's say you have a phone
database you have SQLite so you'll be
using something let's cursor so this
simple cursor adapter will be used for
when you want to fetch the data from the
contacts or phone contacts since we have
an adder here we have been to use
something called as a adapter and in
order so before before setting the value
so let's say this is least viewed dot so
let's see if I am using an adapter we
can simply say set add adapter and in
this you have to pass the object of
least adapter so you can see that we
have to pass an object of adapter since
you're passing object of least adapter
will pass object of an adapter we can
pass any other adapter by so now
question arises how to create object of
adapter so it is very simple we can say
array adapter and we can we can provide
a name for this we'll say this is added
up to itself equal to we'll say new add
adapter and we can pass wait to pass
three values here so if you can see the
construct the constructor of an adapter
it will ask you for three parameters
first is the context and we can say the
current instance is the current context
so we can pass this the second thing is
we have to mention the type of list we
can say simple list which is one simple
is two so we have multiple choice and
the third one is the values so we'll say
the first one is this which is the
context the second one is the type of
value so we can say Android or not that
one so that is Android dot r dot layout
. so these are those of the multiple
option we have we have least simple list
item 1 we have simple list item 2 and
all the stuff will take the simple one
which is simple list item 1 now the
third parameter was the values right but
the thing is if I mention value 0 and ok
so if you mention values here it will
give it work so we can even pass values
odd for the better way we can pass the
list of values instead of passing string
array we can pass the list of values how
to do that just convert this list into
how to convert this adding to list we
can say at is dot 2 list is it working
that is taught to list do we have this
method here or something wrong so we can
provide the black kit it is arrays dot
IO so it is addley as least when we can
pass values so which will convert your
array into least right now once we once
we got the add a list we can set the
array adapter here simple right
and that's how we will we will get this
elements on this screen now just try it
out let's run this code it will take
some time to load so what we are doing
here we are just passing this values
okay so we are we have the set of
programming languages we want to show
this values on the screen which is your
array which is your list view to do that
we need to create a add the adapter
which will hold some values so to create
a add up object of adder adapter you
have to pass three parameters the first
one is the the context which is this
second is the layout type which is
simple and the third one is the values
but the values you have to pass on least
format so we have to say address dot as
list and you can specify values and if I
open my emulator now and there are no
values
the problem is we have opened a wrong
activity so we
go to androidmanifest so you can see we
have what leads to view activity which
is here so I want this to be the first
activity load so I will cut this part
which is a launcher part we paste it
here and it will remove this one also I
think it should work now run okay so
let's see what happens if you are not
comfortable with this method to convert
a values into lists or you can also do
one more thing you can use a for loop
and you can fetch the values from the
array and you can put it in the list is
that's one way you can do that
okay let's see if you're getting so you
can see we got the output as C C++ Java
Android all the stuff right now what
I've worn next what I want what I want
here if I click on this button which is
if I click on this view which is C++ you
can see I'm clicking but nothing is
happening right if I if I click on
assembly nothing is happening if I click
on baby nothing is going on now to
achieve that thing what I want once you
click on that C or C++ button or the
item it should print or toast with that
name for that we need to add the
listener to the view so we can say L V
dot set on click listener in which you
need to provide on click listener oh it
is not on click it is on item click
listener ok and then we can say it is
new on item click listener so that's the
that's the method name which is on item
click so what you just have a type on
item click it will and controlspace
automatically you will get the code and
now here we need to just print the toast
right we can say toast
dot make text as text and we can pass
the parameters we can say not the main
activity but ListView activity dot this
then we need to pass second parameter as
the message you want to show so you have
we can
a you clicked and then the item you want
to show but I don't know which item is
clicked so let's say you click on let's
say you are clicking on see so the
position of C will be the initial value
which is zero right so this zero will be
coming here in the position and you can
fetch the value from the listener but
since unfortunately we don't have lists
so we will use adding so we'll say
values in bracket you can specify the
position right and then so that's the
position you have okay so the error here
so that's values but we cannot use
values because it is so let's make it
final okay so we are you can you can
only access those variables which are in
the inner class or in the anonymous
class if they are final next we have to
mention is the what what next we have to
mention the length so we'll say give it
short and then at the end we'll say dot
show now if I run this code
let's see what's what what output will
be getting so it is opening the window
after running so it will take some time
now if I click on Android so you can see
we are able to see you clicked Android
if I click on Python it says you clicked
python if you click on Scala it is your
clip scholar so that is from this video
this is how you use list but before
going out let me ask you a question so
normally in every video we'll be having
our question so the question for this
video is who is the founder of Facebook
okay so if you know the answer just
comment in the comment section and let's
see who gives the answer first so thank
you so much for watching and do
