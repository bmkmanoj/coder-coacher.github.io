for morning motivation and today's topic
is sure okay so up doesn't means you
have to show off your phones you have to
show off your clothes with brand you
wear sure of is the you have to show off
your skill set you know there are lots
of people they didn't know lots of stuff
but they don't know how to present their
skills right in fact I know people they
know lots of stuff right I mean they are
working on projects they let's say if
you're a Poli student if you know lots
of stuff how are you present I mean how
would people know that you know stuff
that's why they take exams and they have
a whitewash session so I mean why what
they ask your questions and you answer
right that's what that's how you perform
show your skill set but what about
companies let's you're you are working
for a company and then you are very
hardworking person you work on projects
you complete the project on time but the
problem is no one is noticing you the
only way to get promoted or the only way
to excel in your life is people should
know you are doing something right I
mean you know we have that code right do
good things and automate everything
happens to you that's not the actual
case in an incorporated if you are doing
something good you have to let people
know that you are doing with something
good I mean have your boss let's say if
your boss is providing you the increment
order you have some person to to analyze
you how would they analyze your work
they will not they will not be there 24
hours with you right to analyze you the
way you work the way you talk I mean the
way you work what are the things you are
completing so you cannot you cannot
convey them by using excel file hey this
is what I'm doing so you have to inflate
you have to let them know what are the
things you are actually doing okay so
you have to you have to show up not
exactly
observing about yourself but letting
them know that what you are doing so
every day when you go to office when you
when you do when you complete something
let your boss know what you did you know
spend some time with your boss or some
people let them know what you are doing
so that they will know how much you know
and how much potential you have
okay because the only way to increase
your increase your pose to increase your
salary is letting people know your
importance and the only way to do is let
them know what you are and what you can
do right so yeah so sure I'm okay let me
repeat don't show off your the material
things show off your knowledge of your
skill set what at what potential you
have okay that's the way you can you can
let people know about you okay so maybe
in your college or office we do the same
thing in your college you can you can
show off your skills not saying by doing
it okay and let people know what you
know so sometime it doesn't matter how
much you know what matters is how much
you show okay so that's it that's the
morning motivation for today if you have
some more suggestions for morning
because I'm not fighting some topics to
talk about so if you have a citation
like we know I will make a video on that
maybe I know certain stuff but I'm not
able to put that into a topic and of
words in this video so if you have
citations let me know solutions are
welcome if you like my videos make sure
you like it so that I will get more
motivated to make more videos like this
and do comment what are your thoughts
about it that's it thank you so much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
