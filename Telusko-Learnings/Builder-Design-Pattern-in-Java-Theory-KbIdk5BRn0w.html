from 30 school earnings and in this
video we'll talk about builder design
pattern so we avoid already discussed
about design patterns right so we have
three different design patterns we have
creational design pattern we have
structural and then we have behavioral
builder pattern is a part of creational
because it will be helpful when you
create an object now just to explain
this let's go for an example so let's
say we have this phone class in which
you have a five variables so we have OS
we have battery we have a camera we have
processor and what we have screen size
so let's say we have this five variables
now in order to create object of this
phone we require those five values right
so we can set the values with the help
of setters or we can use constructor way
right now let's say I'm using
constructor here so in my constructor I
have five parameters so I am using a
parameterised constructor right so that
that's a that's what the class we have
here we also have a two string method so
that when we print the object we'll get
that method right now I want to create
object of phone here so we have a class
which is shop and inside that you have a
main method so what we'll do is we'll
try to create object of phone here now
how do you get object of phone so we'll
say phone P and we have to say new phone
right you have to pass power five
parameters and that's the question what
are the parameters we have to pass here
and within which sequence so I have to
pass OS I have to say I have to pass
battery I have to pass a screen size so
we have to pass all those parameters
right so the concerns are we have to we
have to pass five parameters we have we
should remember the sequence of the
parameters in which sequence you have to
send so does the problem here and maybe
I don't want to set all the parameters I
want to set only the OS I want only I
want to set only the RAM or not trying
but but maybe size I don't want to set
all the parameters example if you want
to buy a phone you check all the things
why do you check which when you are
buying maybe OS you check which was a
screen size you check for the battery
but let's say there are some people they
are not concerned about all those
features they are only concerned about
the phone they want Android phone does
not matter which Android form they want
it depends upon the budget right so they
want an Android phone there are some
people that doesn't this
does not matter which OS they have they
want a phone to call someone or they
want a smartphone does not matter which
OS they have maybe Android maybe iOS or
Windows they want a smart phone right so
in this scenario we cannot pass all the
parameters right so there is a problem
here so first we do not want to set all
the parameters second even if you want
to pass all the parameters you should
know the sequence of the constructor
right so that's why we use design or is
a builder design pattern here now how it
works so just imagine we have a class
here which is build a phone builder and
now in this class we'll be having all
the variables which are there in the
phone class itself and then we'll be
having some setters now the not just to
explain this how this phone builder
works let's say an example of a
coca-cola factory where they where they
pack their bottles so just imagine
you've got a bottle okay of course this
is empty bottle right so this empty
bottle goes ahead and it gets sanitized
so we are providing the same bottle and
the same bottle will we get the output
the same bottle and then that bottle
will go ahead and it then will we will
put some liquid in that which is
coca-cola now the same bottle will go
ahead and then we have to provide we
have to attach a cap there so we have
ways of applying a cap the same bottle
will go ahead and then we'll be applying
a label right so that's how it works
so this we are providing the same object
as I input and the output will be the
same object right so if you are passing
object a it goes inside the same objects
comes out so that is build up pattern so
how this phone will de will works in
every Center what we have here is in
every Center it returns the object of
phone Billa itself okay so that's why we
said it done this right so we are
passing the same object and we are we're
changing the values and we are taking on
the same object right there is phone
build up and at the end we have a method
we just get phone and this get phone
will give you object of phone awesome
right and the advantage will be now
inside your shop class what you can
simply do is you can say phone P and
then we can say new phone builder dot
then we can say it is set os set screen
size set battery and the
then we can say get phone you will be
getting object of phone and sequence is
not important again how to do everything
we can we can we will see in the
practical of that which is the next
video so make sure you implement this
thing whenever you have multiple
parameters in the constructor
so that's your builder design patterns I
hope I hope you got the idea what is
that just to make sure you understand
everything just do the practical of it
in the next video so thanks for watching
