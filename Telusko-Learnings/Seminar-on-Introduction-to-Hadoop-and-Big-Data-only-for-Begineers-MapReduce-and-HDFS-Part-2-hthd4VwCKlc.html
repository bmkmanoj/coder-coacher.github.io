of data required Big Data okay
now also in year 2000 around 1998 Google
wanted their data to be processed by
Oracle or some company but the problem
is as the data amount increases the
check amount also increases and Google
was against this so they wanted their
own production team or development team
to work on some type of tool so that
they can process the own information so
they came up with something called as G
and pence and he gets what is reoccurs
this is from GPS it is Google file
system right so Google founded their own
file system so that they can store all
the information in their own file system
so that it will be easier to search it
will be easier to store and again it's
not a replacement for a DBMS sponsoring
this will use our DB problem starts when
you want to analyze those data okay
because if you talk about data it has
some characteristics and all this thing
goes with something but us B now three
important three important B's is volume
and you get a second one will be
velocity and
it's where I keep babies like Nikki here
is it
it doesn't matter which variety so yeah
it goes with this three B's first is
volume velocity and variety what is
volume now as user increases as devices
increases volume increases velocity the
speed of incoming data example let's say
you have a system here and I want to
store some data here here so let's say I
am giving data there is something called
as Java they still give us IBM WebSphere
he's taking some input and showing it
right but let's say if I increase my
speed is it easy to store them no right
so as we nos it increases you have to
manage that data also
okay and then we have something called
as variety what is when I do we have
different set of data some data can be
text type some data can be audio type
and some data can be video time because
if you use different defense websites
you have different type of data like if
we talk about Twitter normally we have a
text if we talk about Facebook we upload
images also videos also and we upload
text also if we talk about whatsapp so
normally water is all about text but
also we share images and audio visual
video also so we don't work with one
type of data we work with multiple time
of data so because multimedia so to work
with multimedia it comes on the variety
and all this data you can store in our
DP problem starts when you want to
analyze this data no tell you one thing
you all use SQL except these two guys
you have to use SQLite may be masculine
Oracle or SQL server let's say you have
a table of 10 records and you want to
search a data let's say you want to
search the same thing select box from
least where rule number is equal to if I
search this data it will take some time
depend upon your screen CPU speed may be
milliseconds right so let's say talk
around 3 milliseconds and we are happy
that we are getting output in the
milliseconds when a masker is so happy
wow I am giving you data in these 3
milliseconds you are happy but let's say
your data increases from 10 records 200
records there will be slight difference
between time now so from 3 milliseconds
will take up top 75 milliseconds I'm not
saying it will be the boiled or into 10
maybe 5 milliseconds let's say your
number of Records is thousand now time
in time will increase let's say your
number of recalls is in maybe lakhs or
millions it will take some time so from
3 milliseconds it will take now 5 to 6
seconds
is it ok for you we are so
don't have patience when you go to
Google I'm gonna type something you need
your team to cut your you need your
results in seconds not 19 seconds in
milliseconds as soon as you enter you
you need your results in case Google
fails to give you users what you will
say even you will blame your entire
service and you will bring Google right
that means you're so impatient
you want your records in milliseconds
and Google has billions of records then
close your eyes how Google manage that
speed any guess say you're fetching
speed let's say you want to fetch a
gator so you have a table here and you
want to fetch data so for sure you need
us superior to present a data faster the
CPU less time it will take so you want a
sip yogurt or maybe octa-core CPU the
CPU using your laptops or mobile phones
right so let's say you have an octa-core
CPU but still to search billions of
recalls is not a cup of tea for that CP
also it will take around two days or
three days to fetch one record from
billions of Records maybe you will you
will get some smell from CPU buzzing
smell it's because your octopus if you
cannot manage this amount of data so
what this company do they assign
multiple CPUs they buy a data center in
the design data centers they have got
soft servers and each server will have
high end CPUs that means instead of
having one CPU will be having multiple
CPUs but question arise how to
distribute this data is it that easy to
distribute data no again it will take
some time to distribute as a programmer
you have to do that podium that this
data should be good should go to this
CPU this part of chunk this chunk should
go to this CPU right and that's why we
acquire some
distributed crystals you heard about
this car topic all the dispositions you
can distribute your tasks to multiple
CPUs and that's right doc that's what we
do in threads multi-threading sorry pick
no okay so for you guys what about
monitoring you have Java okay so in
multi so in multi-threading what we do
we try to use maximum part of your CPU
is because nowadays CPU comes with ports
we have four posts we have eight poles
to use the complete power of those cores
we require threads what so what we are
doing we are doing
distributed computing right but as a
programmer you do it right just let that
say you don't know any number of servers
now what you will do because when you
work with threads you know the number of
cores available if I say you have cocoa
so you will write a code only for Coco's
if I say you have 18 code a 16 course
you will write a code for 16 goes if I
say you have 20 servers you will write
your software for 20 servers what if you
don't know is number of servers and
that's where we have something called as
MapReduce now MapReduce is a technology
built by Google again so Google founded
something but as MapReduce to work with
this thing
okay now what is map means mapping
reading a summary what is reduce
aggregation or aggregation example if I
say you have to map so let's say you
have some some data and all this data
have similar type of elements so what
you can do you can use something else
map and you can collect all this data to
create something with a key value pair
that's what we do in Java map API we
create key value pair example your roll
number is key your name is value so key
value pair once you've got all the key
value pair then you can go with
something called as aggregation like we
find average we find maximum number we
find medium number that is called as
aggregation you know about that in a
skill we have aggregation function or
aggregate functions mid function mac max
function count functions average
function so what it does I do
aggregation again point so if you have
chunk of data what you can do you can
first-period a map of it something
called as map key value pair once you've
got all the keeper you keep value pairs
then you can go with something called us
aggregation and that is reduce what I
mean by that
let's say you have a chunk of data okay
and you have lots of system and each
system has octopod processors that means
you have eight pause it pause it pause
it pause it once you have total
particles and you have this hunk of data
so you should have going for video
execution we are going for parallel
execution
what is serial means one CPU out input
and output is parallel means multiple
CPUs multiple inputs multiple outputs
this final execution reappoint so we
have to distribute all this data here
clear
so one chunk will go you second chunk
will go here a chunk will go here simple
focusing video point but let's say we
want to search something this time we
are going for operations let's say I
want to search something for searching
also we will be having multiple servers
how would we know in which server I have
which data and therefore then we have to
use something called as mapping now this
map will do now all this so I can create
a summary file so from all this service
will be getting a summary file that is
first mapping key value pair so value
will be inside this server key will be
here value key value key and when you
start something search will be search
will be search will before key is not
four values once you got the key then
you can search for the value example
let's say all you are MCA data and say
students are in this server all your
busiest routes are then this server
be a study students are in this server
so what we can do we can write here MC n
BCA and BAC ID
so you know saving values we can store
their keys and then we have to go for
aggregation yeah
with their power reduce yeah so there's
something that has MapReduce
now for sure we have to use somebody of
some type of file system for this right
so Google publish miss file system
Google file system but this file system
is only available for Google what about
the remaining world they're helpless so
in 2004 or 2002 Google released a paper
called as Google file system why so that
other companies can create their own
file system and then there is a coming
community which they founded a new file
system called as HDFS so they said
instead of using GFS which is used by
Google we can use as GFS which is open
source
now HDFS stands for it is a new
distributed file system
so instead of using GFS you can use as
gfs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
