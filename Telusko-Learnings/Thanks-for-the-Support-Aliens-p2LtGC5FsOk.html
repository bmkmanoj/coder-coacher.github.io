and I was on huge okay so I was I was
talking I was a huge that's bad that's
really bad okay so I can see myself on
YouTube okay I hope he's not evil now
hey I wasn't good
okay so I was I was talking I was oh I'm
just checking my voice again and if the
voice is there I was just I just made up
my step
okay great so yeah that's funny I know
that's funny I was talking on mute
okay I'm not married yet I am going to
marry I'm going to get married and the
lips wait yeah coming week so yes it did
somebody
okay so uncle says called my name a
honker okay so one to five people of
watching Oh
looking cute is it okay okay so today
okay first of all I guess the topic okay
what a title so thanks for your support
I don't know how many of you noticed it
big last one fifteen thousand
subscribers I think as I mentioned
before that's one of that's not a big
deal
now because now it's just number gain so
after 100,000 subscribers it doesn't
matter how much you get because anyway
you have been recognized by by YouTube
now because we got a button that's
important because in fact there's so
many things you get from bleach if not
in terms of money but in terms of
features once you cross this number so
that's I'm happy for that and thanks for
all your support there at that point in
fact I would like to thank for one more
reason so the last week I'm in Nashville
last week I announced about the three
courses wide so all the things argue
this channel will be free and for that I
wanted some support and luckily I got
some support so some people take donated
something for this channel okay not a
big amount but whatever they have they
have given that so you know if you have
so many people if they can contribute
and that will be a good thing for this
channel
so so thank you so much whoever has
donated any em I mean any amount doesn't
matter
I got good support from you so thank you
so much everyone I loved it
okay okay so great so we got so many
questions here that's what that's all
the time for support for two reasons
let me just go back to questions now
because today we don't have much to talk
about and we are live only for 15-20
minutes because as I mentioned and
visited some other stuff okay so first
of all one routine people are like
watching this come on guys click on the
like button so I will know that you are
enjoying this okay some who say it's
learned a lot from the disco that's
great
no audio yeah but we are back now then
just go down for some questions okay
that just says please talk about dotnet
okay so dotnet is a focus of that film
from Microsoft and so using Dante
platform you can build different
applications it was one time on that
thought head platform we have we can use
it because you see sharp we can use baby
to be used VB nowadays or what we have
ASP so it has certain things now luckily
I mean I was not a big supporter of
technical but now dot is open source oh
yes I can see some hope for dotnet in
future but you know Microsoft just
messed with the they just miss the
opportunity of becoming the best
development platform but they missed it
and now just they just made a dotnet
open so so I guess they stays some hope
okay so okay what next
okay so now I will say is I want to
become deviated what I can do for it
give some it back advice so I would say
anyone you don't want to be a DBA I
would say go for TB certification Stan
should be a good option
so get certified and join a company
that's what I would say if there's any
other other way I'm not sure because no
idea about DBA
bah depart okay so there's one day you
can get certified okay so Jake Krishna
says it's pleasure attach plate I just
need punkish nod on what set that a
great life
okay okay then with us says sir party
sub part in your case I will do that
once we have a bad know me come I guess
you I'm banknote ad so let's see if I
come to Bangor for a meet up we'll have
a quick party or good body
okay so okay what next
yeah some people are some people are
suggesting some videos to make the thing
is as I mentioned I cannot take any okay
I cannot make any video on demand for
next two months that's the issue yes I
will be uploading videos which I have
already planned about so normally what I
do is I make videos which I want to do
planned and I some I make some videos
these are not planned but bitch odd on
request for example I do get something
question on Facebook on LinkedIn on
YouTube so I don't maybe I don't replied
those those passages or I don't reply to
those emails or messages on facebook but
I do consider that I I know when I get
any suggestions on all these platforms i
I see to it that I will make a video on
that but at least for next two months
since I'm busy with other stuff so I'll
be uploading videos but not the not the
sadistic videos ok so then it says when
what you see a manage dates also its
23rd if fair it's on this on this body
ok so ok what next
Rafa's says please say my name because g
s okay so something is wrong with my
light ok the weird thing is all my setup
they were there so I was supposed to
reset up everything because I thought I
will not go like today and some people I
call some messages from some people that
they are they missed my life session and
I've not taken blacks to play so I
thought let's go for a bit life so maybe
that's the issue of in the light like is
not liking it ok ok so
we are areas where's the spaceship it's
your mind it's your skill set that's
your spaceship you an idea and that's
your skill set so your skill set is your
spaceship so if you improve your skills
you will fly your fly okay so what next
a python for Nazia sky yes again try one
of the easiest language to learn Oh
g-god of say is alien or thanks wait Ian
in fact that's that's the sign for
Indian for us okay so what you're taught
in becoming an android and iOS
turner person simultaneously you can try
it okay so I tried it when I started
learning I'm going for the first time I
was not like I needed to know but before
I came from job at dawn I was walking on
suicide I learned I enjoyed I was
working 100 for some time I came back to
Java because that's what I love more tea
this wasn't coding but I tried learning
Android and iOS together I got stuck in
between because I was running sweat and
I was doing Java I was mixing these two
concepts so yes if you are learning for
the same time then it will mess it up
when I would suggest complete false
complete Android first and walk for at
least one or two months then you can try
and iOS as well but because learning
both us think same time it might confuse
you maybe it might not confuse everyone
I got confused between so I kept iOS
aside and focused on your Android and
the thing is I haven't never I never
went back to iOS against that's thing
okay we will do pass so Pithom it says
you will do party once I quite job or
that wait which should we showed it to
that okay I lost all the questions
everything went up in a strength V okay
so what is the question okay so I will
pick up random questions now because all
the questions just went up okay mama
shakes a is alone ro Bhavana that's what
I
I know Telugu okay so Brittany says one
day go live with your family serve I do
that
on this channel but not some other
chance of it I will do that okay okay so
our kid says to why why hTML is not
called as a programming language because
see when you say programming language
first of all hTML is a language but
that's a markup language not a
programming language because when you
see focus on language it means you are
teaching your cpu to think about you
know example will you build a software
you are making your cpu think what to do
next
you keep instructions are you specify
the flow using if-else you use for the
blipping statement you create variables
right so you do all those things which
is not possible in HTML because cobraman
simply means you are talking to your CP
or your instructing your CP or what to
do next
which if you want to be next HTML is
that okay so next question
take my question but what is a question
of this okay
next what is Jango so Jango basically is
a pH specify the framework I have not
worked on Python much but I just know
about it
so Django is something with bit by them
okay I am NOT going to buy that much
Baba Chaudhary says why you're not
making video on VBA for web services I
do have a services video I do have REST
API videos you can just straight out
okay so please read my comment delay
stays okay I think your comment brother
says collab I was thinking about collab
but as I mentioned I'm busy with this
stuff so may not be possible very soon
maybe in May month I will try to do
Apple a bit but so I have seen
least a lot of youtubers to coupon the
product this time I will do one more
collab with my surgery again in the May
in the month of May or June I'm trying
to go to Bhopal to meet him this time
and let's see who else I can elaborate
let's see okay next question
but a person to be good in programming
isn't insight to know the attack of a
system I would say yes but not a no not
as a pressure because when you learn
program is language you don't have to
know everything about computer that's
fine even if you don't know about how
that works our city works ok not talking
about the bases we kept talking about
eternal walking some people do talk
about those things because you should
know how to CPU box right you should
know what is threads you should know
what is my loop course if your means but
isolations ok when if you don't know it
but as you work both on programming I
would say increase your hardware skills
as well how your CPU works on RAM and
CPU communicates all those things as
well because I have learned all those
things when I was teaching a subject is
comfortable Dementors I know so that's
so I would say learn but it's not
necessary equal to pressure okay when I
say you should know about CPU and RAM
I'm talking about the basic level and
the higher level basic not basic is
anyway compulsory ok
congratulations
ok thank you ok you wanted to be family
money ok so people who want to see my
mom put the clicker Connie hey
subscribers so yes she's juicier she's
my mom and yeah ok so will be so she has
a channel which is the disco kitchen I
hope you have seen that
they aggressively so that's my that's my
BOB that's a family okay so someone
wanted us rewrite she's busy with her
phone yeah so what next next question
say about no genius no Jesus is a
JavaScript framework for for our pudding
so example in JavaScript now we can use
JavaScript to page everything or you can
build the client-side using so you heard
about Mitch time right so it means that
you use you use node
like programming because initially
people used to use jaws developer client
but now you
I mean client-side programming but now
you can use jaws before back in and no
jeus just give it to you
okay how about future in blockchain
blockchain has a great future you know
so you can try it out because every
company will be going for block change
soon okay can you share head a video on
that flux I wanted to make videos on
plugs but let's see maybe not soon in
the month of May the babbling okay
oh okay so give you your appointment you
want my appointment you don't need that
so i'll be i'll be having us I will soon
are having an office some menu my I will
let you know so that we can have a meet
so your family speaks Hindi yes so it's
so be used all three languages at home
so how the language is available right
so I use in the videos we also use
Telugu and Marathi sometime because my
my sister-in-law is also my Russian my
tobe wife is also Maharashtra so it's
one day okay so Monica says hello aunty
so Monica mom is missing you Monica is
one of my intern and a friend okay so my
Cortlandt does okay why not quarreling
support available is because Courtney is
a bit is very new to the market okay
when I say new a new it's been three to
four years now but still you know it
took time for people to adopt Portland
and it's just being around the line once
now who will just made official foreign
official language but I enjoyed it it
will take some time once you know once
you get a lot of developers working on
the same platform that's where you get
more supposed and that's my Java is on
top you know because we have so many
people and that's why we have so many so
much of support for our language okay so
last five minutes last five minutes okay
which question I can say that off
question based on my mom yeah I would
say hi
I mean say so say my name I are higher
that's okay how would you proceed to be
a full strike another poll I would say
when you say first I turn up or you
should know all three levels the first
one is the front-end level the backend
level when I say back-end it's outside
coding and also the database part that's
how you become full stack so be good be
designing okay when I say full-stack I
don't like that I don't like that idea
of being a post rifle type of drama at
least for myself I don't know about you
but I feel the people who are women
creatively they are not good with
development that's why it's please okay
I have talked to many people and that's
why I realize people who are very big
with creativity they are not that
development with logic and people who
are damp with logic they don't they're
not creative I don't know because maybe
they are focusing on you on one thing
example when you watch cricket
we have premolars and we have put
batsmen we have a less all grounders and
that's what is force development yes you
need to be so I guess people who are
pushing up with a not that rating then
they are not dad with logic they are
both so they are good in that both okay
they're not ready for that put it so
maybe they might have it too with
experience and there are people on of
companies now they are asking for first
example so in case if you want to be
first type of all
front-end back-end the deprogramming
side and these the database then you
become some more questions and last one
two questions okay
what is the question okay what's the
future of contouring for next three
years companies are adopting pot line as
as for my ex for my knowledge for
companies are erupting Portland because
it is easy to work on and less bugs
because in Java I enjoyed a lot of foods
and more pods right the more and the
more works you find so as the equipment
as a good future okay about dock
for charities yes there will be a lot of
opportunities it will take some time
because India on this takes time because
everything starts in US and Caucasian
countries they adapt us technologies
whatever this point on there it will
take some time okay so that's it
everyone
last one question and then we are going
to sign off because I'm a tired now okay
so estas says is your is YouTube your
only source of income not at this point
no YouTube is not my only source of
income and I think for my corporate ring
as well
I do take online trainings I take
corporate training I'm doing YouTube
because we don't earn much from YouTube
I don't know why people have this thing
called as we are youtubers we earn a lot
we do it because it's all depend upon
which audience you're targeting so since
we are targeting Indian audience and
some US audience we don't earn much
people who are focusing only for you
just us audience they earn low because
you do the ads in u.s. is costlier than
ads in India so no we don't earn much
from YouTube so I'm not talking much as
myself I'm talking about all the
youtubers who have who have Indian
audience as the audience so we don't
earn much from YouTube but yes
sustainable income but the effort which
we put here is not worthwhile so YouTube
is not glad for me to get on home but
yes it's a good exposure for everyone
okay so that's it everyone
I know I was not going to answer all the
questions because I wanted to just go
for a short life I was it was supposed
to 2015 - but we went forward
don't worry minutes now and I didn't see
160 people watching this and no more
guys you can liked it you don't like bit
it there and that's it - see you next
time I'll try to pose like once again on
Sunday that will be my post marriage
then city how thing goes and more gears
all on the way I'll be uploading three
to four videos more before in this week
I will try to do my best to do that so
that's it everyone
I hope you enjoyed let me know in the
comment section okay after this video
and let me know type into eyes well how
was the experience today
and you can see I'm damn tired I just
came back home so okay so so last five
minutes I will just see what is going on
the chat because every time did you want
to talk about it so I guess under will
says goodnight said of course is by
awesome channel thank you so much
witnesses feed manage types okay thanks
