ready from those colored things and in
this video we'll see how to multiply two
matrices so as we have seen it theory
that you can multiply two matrices using
for loop and all those stuff so if you
have not seen the theory of this video I
will recommend it recommend you to watch
that video first to make the better
understanding of it and then you can
watch this video okay so in the theory
we have talked about what is matrix
multiplication we have talked about how
to multiply two matrices in maths and
then how to how to do it in Java right
so let's try to implement that so the
example we have taken is with two
matrices one is m1 and the value of M
one which will be a two-dimensional
array because when you want to represent
them it rises or matrix in Java we need
to represent with the help of two
dimensional array right so we can define
those values here we can provide the
static values again you can take the
input from the user that's your wish
okay but let me just provide those the
value by default will say one two three
so I'm creating a two dimensional array
with two thousand three or two rows and
three columns right so we got an array
here okay
let me get one more which is M 2 and
this up is such I will say I will create
one more added here ok this is also to a
nationality this will be M 2 and you
need to make sure that the dimension so
if this dimension is 2 2 comma 3 and
this is 3 comma 2 so you have to make
sure that this one this column and this
rows are same right so let's specify the
value as 7 &amp;amp; 8 and this would be 9 and
10 and this would be 11 and 12 okay so
once you've got these two matrices let's
let's calculate the resultant metric
matrix here for that we have to specify
a matrix the size of this matrix will
depend upon the number of rows here and
the number of the number of the number
of rows in this block and the number of
columns in this block and luckily they
put our two we can have any anything but
it doesn't matter so let's make it to
two okay now to work with any matrix so
doesn't matter if you're walking
duration of tradition of to do matrix if
you are working with no multiples of two
metrics we
a nested for loop right so we'll start
equal to zero I less than two again I
plus plus so this value here so this
value here is depend upon the number of
rows in the resultant matrix which is
two
okay so the I will go from the it is
given up at the row number and we
require I should for loop inside which
will depend on U of this J or the range
of this J will depend upon the number of
columns in the resultant matrix which is
two right so both are 2n 2 and then we
can so what we do is when you multiply
these things we require one more loop
which will be your K loop right now
again we have discussed about this why
we require K loop inside this in the
theory so I will again ask you if you
are not seen that video make sure you
watch that biggest first and what we
have done is we have the required one
more loop which is a K loop and we'll
say game is then now this K value will
depend upon the number of columns in the
first matrix or the number of rows in
the second Matrix which is three right
that's three and then k plus plus now
what next once you got this you have to
applaud formula but to implement that
formula require one more variable which
will act like a sum right so we can take
that anywhere let's define somewhere
here okay I can take it anywhere let us
say this is int we can say this is inte
R or not our internal right so we have
to say sum and the instead of sum will
be 0 and then somewhere here you have to
mention sum plus 1 equal to sum plus and
then we have to specify the formula and
the formula is M one of you have to
specify I and K so K will become you
know K is the this this loop here and
this will be M 2 of K and J that's the
formula we have to use and once you are
on this loop you have to make sure that
you assign this sum to the to the matrix
itself so let's say M 3 are not M 3 it's
R of I comma J we can assign the value
as sum
and then once you assert the value of
saying you have to make it zero so that
you can start the new calculation for
the next value right so once we have
done this we'll get a loop which is will
get the output in this loop okay we'll
multiply these two things and the output
will be here inside this are adding now
what we do is we just have to print it
now there are multiple ways we can do
that we can use normal for loop or we
can use an ass for loop initially let us
work with normal five loop so let's take
an array of I'll just take in a loop for
I equal to 0 I less than two because
that's the length of your of adding the
number of rows and the next to go for
number of columns which is int J equal
to 0 and J less than 2 J plus plus like
and let's print the value here let's
print in a proper format so we can say
print we can specify the value of M R of
I and J okay we can also specify some
space here so that you know you can see
in a proper format and we also need a
space after the printing so after every
line we want a space on my new line
right and if we run this code you can
see we got the output this is the output
viewer we want it right so that's how
you multiply two matrices in Java again
we can print this this end with enhanced
for-loop if you know how to work with
two dimensional array using announce for
loop you can watch my video on youtube
you can just search for enhanced
for-loop the disco on youtube you will
get the video there we can satisfy int I
: r okay int i array of our okay again
if you don't know how to use and ask for
it just watch that video because I am
NOT going to explain what is announced
for loop in this in this example just
watch that thing there and we'll print
the J here and we'll provide a space we
can provide one more space and then
after every loop we want a new line so
let's print a new line and if I run this
code racket will get the same output
right so we can print we do another
folder but we can't range with the help
of enhance ball for loop the important
thing is this is how you multiply two
matrices in Java
okay so that's it that's what on this
video make sure you subscribe the
channel for the further
and do like the video if you liked it
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
