different political happenings and in
this video we'll talk about why one plus
one is zero again don't get confused I'm
not talking about a normal number system
but in balance system whenever you add
two numbers where you have one plus one
it gives you zero right so it's not
exactly give you zero it gives you 1 0
well about where your 0 is your value
and one is your carry right so that
means when you say 1 plus 1 what you get
you get is 0 and then you carry do it do
it one know why exactly we get 0 now the
answer is very simple it's because in
balanced system the last number is 1 so
the next I'm up will be 0 right we'll
just try explain this in a better way
let me take an example here in decimal
system so when you talk about decimal
system we have the number starts with 0
so number starts with 0 and it goes till
9 right and so decimal system
but then what after 9 so it goes in the
circle way so when you say zero then you
say 0 plus 1
it's 1 1 plus 1 is 2 2 plus 1 is 3 3
plus 1 is 4 then 5 then 6 then 7 then 8
then you got 9 right so when you say 2
plus 1 it is 3 liters 1 4 6 this one
seven 7 + 1 8 8 + 1 9 9 plus 1 is 0
right since we don't have anything out
after nine it goes back to zero now
since we complete one circle we say 1
carry right in fact we say 1 carry then
we say 0 plus 1 1 1 + 1 2 then it goes
on when you complete two circles it says
to carry that that's that's how we do it
right so we say 1 9 + 1 is 2 0 so since
9 is the last number 9 + 1 is 0
it's the same way in binary system
number starts with in fact we can also
talk about
octal system where you have the base 8
so octal system goes from 0 to 0 to 7
right which is 8 digits so it goes from
0 0 + 1 is 1 1 this one is 2 then 3 then
4 then 5 then 6 then 7 in fact it should
be 7 now when you say 7 + 1 it goes
again 0 so 7 plus 1 in your - in your
dr. system not decimal you know if the
system is zero right so the last number
plus one gives you zero and it gives you
one carry in the same way in binary
system numbers start with zero it ends
at one so when you say zero plus one you
get one now since one is the last digit
when you say one plus zero it gives you
1 plus 1 so 0 plus 1 will give you 1 1
plus 1 will give you 0 right so 1 plus 1
is 0 and then you say can you 1 make
sense and that's why 1 plus 1 is 0 with
carry 1 so it happens with every number
system will it be octal or it can be
decimal all money system everywhere the
last number plus 1 is always 0 with
carry 1 so that's it from this video we
have talked about what this one is y 1
plus 1 is 0 that's it thank you so much
