enjoyed some very solid links in this
video we'll talk about how sublet work
so just imagine we have a client machine
there and we have a server right so when
you talk about this website world or
this web world so a client sends a
request to the server expecting a page
right again you can even ask for
anything on internet but let's say
you're asking for a page now now this
page can be a static page it can be a
tenant page when it's a static it means
which is already made and when you say
dynamic it means it will be built at one
time so let's say a client sends the
request which is a study request which
goes our server on your server you
already have a file right so that file
goes to declined requests online so we
called a request on response finish
right but let's say if you are asking
for a page which is different which is
from the beaches which will be billed as
one time so a client sends a request to
the server
now services hold on I don't have any
page with this with this length so you
have to make that page right you have to
build a page so that request goes to a
helper application then you see I think
we got in the helper application on the
server now this helper application is
also called as web container okay so we
in this web container you will be having
soft light nowadays subject subject is
basically a Java file which can take the
request from the client on the internet
and it can process that request it can
provide you a response in the format of
HTML page like so this sublet will
convert your request and it will take
your request to stretch the values it
will process the information and it will
send the HTML page right so let me just
go back once again some client-side VIX
which goes to server on the server side
since it is a dynamic request it will go
to your web container which is so
whatever weapon terms we have so we have
a tomcat we can also use glass which we
can use JBoss we can use WebSphere in
fact all these other servers those are
called as app servers but they also have
a feature of web server so basically we
always use Tomcat in fact in my
videos you will find all the things
inside using Tomcat right so that Tomcat
is a web container so on your server if
you want to achieve that where the
dynamic web web pages you need to
install Tomcat ok so you can see that is
Tomcat there so judge web content is a
tomcat
so when request goes to your tomcat
Tomcat States hold on I got a request
now but that request is for ABC dot HTM
and if you don't have any pages it on
the screen right so we have to build
that page so that request goes to a
servlet hold on solids will be having a
Java name right example when you create
Java classes let's say I want to add two
numbers again a basic example is going
to add two numbers I will be having so I
will be having the sublet name as add
sublet that means when a request for a
TC dot HTM the page which should be
getting called is your servlet how can
we do that so what we have is within
your entire center instead of container
you have a special file which is called
as deployment descriptor and this is
outlook
so you have a file you do deployment
descriptor in which you mentioned for
which request which server should be
called ok so let's say in our in I mean
in your Tomcat server you have maybe 50
to 60 servlet so every servlet will be
mentioned I mean every request live map
with one sublet it may happen that you
mean you have multiple requests trying
to access the same sublet right
everything need to be configured in a
file which is called as deployment
descriptor and the file name is web dot
xml so this file here is your web dot
xml file so let me repeat when clients
of the request which goes to the server
now server thanks ok this is the next
page let's send a request to the web
container now West container will check
ok this is this request will be mapped
by this public that can be done with the
help of web dot XML file so you can seem
to affect XML files we have two tags we
have sublet tags and we have service
mapping tags so the service tags you
have to mention the class name and in
your service mapping tag you have to
mention the you are those patches so for
this URL we need to call that particular
but hold on how do we get us off this
now and that's very simple you can see
we have a file here so this is this is
your file structure so when you want to
create a servlet it's a normal class
okay which extends HTTP servlet since we
want to sublet features like we can
estate normal for Joe which is a normal
glass we have to create a special class
which extends HTTP servlet because this
HTTP servlet will provide you all the
features which you need okay now when I
say all these features it means it
should be able to take you from this
equation of this server it should be
processing the request and it should be
sending the response how it will be done
that will be in the next video but it's
take the request its purpose the
information and it will send the
response now that respond will be in
HTML form eyes again you can send a
response in JSON format or an almost
string you can send a response in XML
format you can also send the response in
the HTML format
now that HTML speed this is which is a
dynamic page goes from your server to
your client must read in the format of
response object right so now we have one
more thing right we have web web
personal file here do we have a
replacement for that because the column
is be our job or graminoid and we don't
like xml that's not in the case but we
but let's say we try to avoid xml now
how do we avoid xml so in this subject
3.0 we got a new feature which is called
as annotation so we can use annotations
on your sublet so you don't have to use
XML file or graduation one file you can
you can do your mapping using
annotations I can how - done that is
done that we'll see in the subsequent
tutorials but this is how your service
basically work with the Tomcat server ok
so a quick recap we have a client
machine visualize equation console
server from the server request goes to
your web container web container uses a
file called as web dot XML to detect
which serve it to call and it calls
itself that that sublet will go to the
information and it will send the
response to the client machine that'll
judge that's how it works in the next
video we'll talk about how that how
exactly your
container searches for the tablet and
how its get loaded and the life cycle of
the subject thank you so much and do
