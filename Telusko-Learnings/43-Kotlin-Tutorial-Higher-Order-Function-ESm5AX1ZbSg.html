aliens I'm never in two different days
collecting and in this video we'll talk
about higher order function now what
exactly higher order function means now
if we talk about Java languages we talk
about any object to his programming
language we always give importance to
variables right because variables is
something which you can create where you
can pass the partial different methods
example if you have multiple methods and
all this method want to communicate so
one way you can do that is by passing
values right so variables and objects
are your primary thing what about
functions so function we always use to
call it right we call functions we
create functions but we cannot call a
function in a function but in in
functional programming this wall is this
is what is happening we pass a function
in a function I know that is that sounds
weird for you because if you are not
familiar with functional programming
this looks weird but interest me in
functional programming your functions
are the first class members which means
you can treat functions as you treat
variables you can pass a function to a
function you can define a function to
the function you can do all those weird
stuff let's try it out now to make you
understand how functional programming
looks like we'll go for a simple example
let's not get into the complex structure
now assuming that you are coming from
object-oriented programming it will be
difficult to get into functional
programming in one go it needs certain
levels of practice to understand how it
works
it's not just about syntax it's also
about how you think about programming
because if you have worked on Java
before the way you think is in object
only because this is how your brain is
molded by Java language so what we do
here is we will print this value so I
want to print the values of this values
I want to print all the value incises
values now the way you can do that is by
using a for loop right and we have seen
that the way you can use a for loop is
by saying afford and then you can say I
in values and then you can print
individual values for I this is what we
do
and we have done that before which let's
try to run this quadrant let's see what
happens double major on this code you
can see we got all the same values
now whatever value we have in the list
we got four eight three nine two one now
if we talk about this for loop this is
something called as external for loop
which means the for loop here is not a
part of this it's a part of Portland and
some feature of Kotlin is trying to
fetch defeat it is trying to fetch the
values of a list now this says hey why
you have to use some other members why
you have to use some other feature so
instead of using a external for loop
what Courtland says is you can say
values dot there is a method called as
for each now you can quite as method or
a function let's go for for each now
this foliage says okay you can print all
the values so what is my job here is so
far it says my job here is to fetch one
by one value of the list now I will give
you one one value as a programmer you
define what you want to do so remember
for each says I will give you one by one
value it's depend up on you what you
want to do it do it I mean do what it
with it what I will do is I will use a
very simple syntax here I would simply
say print Ln and it will print it okay
and if you run this code you can see it
drains the same thing which is printed
by your normal for loop let me just
remove this normal for loop just to get
the output which you can actually see
what's happening and you can see if I
run this code you've got the same output
okay now you are thinking what the hell
is this right how can we write something
in this syntax there are two things
which are weird here the first thing is
this for H is a method or a function and
we are passing a function to a function
that is 0 right because we have not done
this before I mean how can you pass a
function is a function and that's the
beauty about this functional programming
so codling does support functional
programming and here you can pass a
function inside a function so we are
passing a parental and
inside forage that was the weird thing
the second weird thing is what is this
eight that sounds weird right so
whatever you do is just to make you
understand how executive thing works let
me just go to the detailing of it so
first of all before continuing with this
remember whenever you want to print the
values from fourth from the collection
or the list you can use a for each and
you can print all the values it's just
that you have to mention because four it
says hey hippo hippo gramma my job here
is to fetch one by one value so the
programmer you are saying okay you give
me one month one by one value what I
will do is I will print the value which
you give me so your 40 gives you the
value in it and you're just printing it
but just to make you understand how
exactly this thing works or somewhere is
derived because to understand it better
you have to understand how it is derived
so what I will do is I will cut this
part and let's try to understand how
exactly it works so it's a control space
the moment I say control space can you
see that this for each function actually
wants an object of consumer now it is
what exactly consumer is now consumer
basically if I click if I click on
consumer so consumer is an interface
again it is fetched from Java 8 or so
this is a Java 8 part consumer interface
so consumer is an interface in Java so
what you will do is instead of writing
this stuff here I will go up somewhere
here I will say let me get an object of
consumer and let's name okay now how do
we the way you can get an object is by
saying bad
you will say bad a con okay so we'll say
rad-con and okay so we'll say Val con :
we will measure the type of wait we'll
say consumer and this takes a integer
value so this con consumer object so
this is a consumer object for us it
takes an integer value and now
personalized consumer the interface
white how can we create object of that
now in one of the video we have talked
about this if you want to create an
object of interface you have to use a
anonymous inner class concept the way
you can do that is by
in object keyword so you want an object
of consumer so you have to say object
off so that's : object of consumer which
takes a integer but it says okay if you
want to do that you have to define the
function it so if I open the credit back
isn't closed this is where you have to
define the function which is the inside
consumer now I don't know which which
method we have there so actually don't
have to remember that what you can do is
if I go here you can see it will give
you an option of implementing members so
whatever method which are declared that
you can do you can implement those
methods and you can see the method name
is except which takes a integer value
and it returns unit now unit is same as
what in Java so in Java and C we use
void incontinent we use unit alex ikonn
okay we got our implementation here so
you can see the method it says override
fun accept - the method we have it takes
a parameter which is T whatever you do
is whatever value you are getting just
print so I will print the value of T so
remember this
I'm getting an object of consumer I'm
creating a method well as except which
takes an integer parameter and I'm
printing that value of nothing else
and whatever consumer object you have it
is gone will pass that object inside for
H so inside this for H I am passing an
object of consumer that's what it wanted
right if you remember when we talked
about for H it is asking you for the
object of consumer let's try it out so I
will go back and run this code okay this
ready five this loop okay okay so you
can see we got all the values you can
see we got four eight three nine two one
right so basically if this four it
actually wants an object of consumer
which we are passing it here now the
thing is this looks cool right this
looks good but then there is a concept
of boilerplate code what it means is see
on the left hand side when you know that
the object is of consumer then why on
the right hand side we have to mention
that is a consumer I mean once you know
that we are getting orders of consumer
why to mention that we are getting
observe consume on the right hand side
as well why you have refined the methods
except because if I go to
my interface this consumer interface has
only one method which is declared you
can see we have only one little area
which is accept so what you can do is
you don't have to mention all this thing
here you don't have to mention this
stuff from here to here so this is this
is something it is which is optional
right so the important thing here is
only this T and this println so what you
can do is you can just go back here
instead of your instead of using corn
you can say hey I have a value which is
T so whatever value you give me I will
put that back I will put that value in T
and I will just print that value T let
me repeat instead of passing an object
of corn instead of doing all this weird
stuff for each says I will give you a
value right so that value that
particular value will go inside T and
that T will be printed here so this is
the parameter which you are passing so
in the accept method the parameter which
you're passing is this one T again it's
not composite you use T we can also use
n that's our choice actually we can use
any variable name so whatever value this
forage gives you that value will be
going in N and that n value we are
printing here so we don't need actually
call object we don't need all this stuff
and that's why I said you don't have to
remember about something anything about
consumer so I'm just printing this for
each I am fetching that value N and then
I'm printing it if I run this code you
can see it should work and you got all
the values here you can see the output
window record all the values that's that
sounds cool right but then why to even
mention this n that that looks awkward I
mean why to even mention this n whatever
you do is will remove all this thing if
you don't mention any variable names
that's what you're saying right I don't
know it is n is if I don't know the
variable names you can also use it it
means that particular value so if you
don't mention any variable name by
default it will go into it variable
right so it is already there in Cortland
you just have to use it so you can see
if I go to 8 it says whatever value you
you will get even it will print it here
and let's run this code and okay waiting
for the output you got the output so
this is how it works
so what we are doing here is we are
passing a function inside a function in
fact why do we one mention this idea
that that looks V or Y - I mentioned
this idea I T let me just verify this
work if this thing works I don't want to
mention any variable name I just want to
mention a function is it possible let's
try with two colons okay can you see
that even this thing works let's run
this code and oh it works and I see that
it works so what exactly this thing here
now again I know you what you're
thinking you are thinking this is this
is okay now I know there are two
reactions one it's weird
second it's awesome now it's actually
awesome what you're doing is before we
are we are passing N and then that end
is printed then you are said okay you
don't want to mention the variable name
you can simply use eight but then why do
you even mention the variable why do you
want mention that thing what you are
saying is hey for each 40 she will say
you will get D values we just have to
print those values inside println so
what you're passing is behavior so
whatever value I will pass we do
whatever you want so as a programmer you
are saying hey my intention here is to
print it so println will take that value
from for the change will print it's just
that you have to mention that this is a
method reference now why you're using
these two colons over okay we'll talk
about that in some time so what you are
doing is we are referring a method here
or you can call them as function
reference as well so you are saying
whatever value you get from for each the
value will be automatically get gets
saved inside println so ultimately you
will pass the value from for these two
println so whatever value for which will
give you that value will go to println
but in what is this double double quotes
here it's just that it is possible that
your method is all your function is
there in some inside some class so if
you want to refer so which class it
belongs to you can refer that class name
here so you can mention the class name
you can mention the class name colon
colon you can mention the method name or
function name so that's the beauty about
method reference or function reference
in Cortland so yeah that's that's how
the higher-order function
works it's actually a beauty thing I
would recommend you to practice this
more because this is something which is
difficult to understand so if you have
not understood from this video what you
can do is just try it by yourself you
will get some idea about it and the more
you practice you will get the idea more
clear but remember the only thing is
this is a new concept is not this is not
actually a programming concept it's or
this is not a syntactical thing this is
a programming thing you know we are
changing the way we think initially we
used to think in object world now you
think in functional world does the only
difference you have so that's it from
