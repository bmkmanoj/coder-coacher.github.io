set a name thread thread and we'll talk
about the priorities of the threader so
we start with the name first so what we
do now as before before doing all this
any stuff if anyone's starting the
thread what we can do is let's plane the
name of the threader so do we have a
name for the thread let's try that the
different t1 dot get name so you can see
we have a name for the threader and if I
try to run this code you can say to
spending the thread 0 let's try to do
that if the second thread here will say
copy-paste and let's make it as t2 and
if you on this code of course it will
print thread 1 right so by default when
you create the first thread the name
will be thread 0 the second thread will
be thread 1 now once you got these two
threads
let's okay can we change this thread
name because I don't like this thread
name so there are multiple ways you can
do this one is you can can you say set
name yes we can do that we can say this
is high thread or simply simply say hi
and then we say t2 dot set name we'll
say this is hello so we can also set the
thread name you can see of course it
will let's say this is height right
itself and this is hello thread and if I
want this code you can say it is
printing high thread and hello too late
that means you can also set the name for
the thread now why it is important is
because let's say you're working on
application where you have multiple
threads and you don't know which thread
is doing what because sometimes it is
very difficult to manage threads right
so it's always better to name to give a
name to each word so that you can use it
later ok so this is how you can set the
name this another way is when you create
the object of thread it will ask you for
it will ask you for two parameters the
first one is which one we'll be using
now this one so if you can see this
constructor here it is asking you for
the object of enable and it is also
asking for the name again you can also
see we can only pass the enable object
or you can only pass the name but you
can fast both you can
the neighbors object and you can also
pause the name so what we can do here is
if you look at this code this is the
object of the neighbor right and if you
give a comma and you can also mention
the name here of the thread we can say
this is high thread now same thing can
be done here we can say this is hello
thread I mean we can also do that if you
on this code you can see we got high
thread and a load word so that's how you
can give the name for the thread now
what next can be can be get the
priorities so let me remove this name
thing we have done with name we I hope
you've got the concept of name here
remove that let me just make this quote
more simple and let's talk about the
thread pride in our now by default
whenever you create any thread it will
have the default priority let's try to
fetch the default priority first we'll
simply print the brag of the thread will
simply say this is p1 dot get priority
it will give you the current writing
will do it for both 42 dot get variety
so if we got priority for both the what
the objects so you can see for both the
objects we got fine so the priority for
thread 1 is 5 the priority for 22 is
also 5 so by default they both have the
same priority which is 5 so was a range
of priority so the range of priority
goes from 1 to 10 so 1 means least
variety and 10 means highest priority
and 5 is normal priority ok so now can I
change this varieties as we can do that
we can say t1 dot set priority and we
can say this is 1 and here we can say t2
dot set priority and we can say this is
10 so we are changing the priority of
both the things
so what we are setting T 1 1 and we are
setting T 2 as 10 and if you on this
code now you can see we got 1 and 10 so
what is the least priority intends the
highest priority now some time it is
difficult to remember numbers right
because it is not that readable it is
bit confusing that let's say after 5
or two years you're saying this okay we
have said the variety one but what is
what is it least of least or highest
difficulty remembered right so that is
why we can also use some we can also use
some constant so we can say threat dot a
mil priority so it means that it will
give you one and we can say this is
threat dot max priority so this these
are the inbuilt constants available and
threads so if I go to max priority
inside thread class you can say to the
value of max part is ten the minimum
priority is one you can set the normal
priority which is five so even if you
don't set the priority it will give you
five okay so you know that's how you are
doing this that so that's how you set
the priority and if you are this quote
of course it will give you one and ten
okay so let's say I want to know the
priority in the thread itself so after
printing high I want to print it thread
priority so what we can do is we can say
can we use which method to use we can
use this method which is current thread
so we can say this is thread dot current
oh so a dot can I use current thread
here okay let me do that current thread
this is possible yes so you can see it
says current thread dot get name or not
name but we can also sit also print the
priority so it will it will print the
priority of that turns right so you can
see it is printing and I won I won I won
because the priority of that word is one
so if you want to refer to the current
thread in the same thread itself so
inside the thread if you want whether
for the thread way to say current
sweater current which will refer to the
current thread okay so that's about the
name and the priority in threads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
