use a method which is for each to print
all the values of list so what we have
done so far is we have created a list of
values in which I have have assigned 6
values so in order to assign values we
can use two ways either we can create
our object of add aleast
and then we can add values otherwise if
you know the values at the start you can
use a glassful as a DS dot as this
method took to assign all the values
this method in turns give you object of
a de least so once you got the object
with 6 elements to print this values we
can use external iterations that we have
done in the previous video like you can
use a for loop you can use enhanced for
loop or you can use something called as
iterator otherwise you can go with
internal iterations using this for each
method so for each method here gives you
a internal iterations using which you
can fetch one value and print that value
so we are taking the value and printing
it we are not doing any extra things
here now then you will say okay what is
this arrow here so as we have seen in
the last video this arrow means lambda
expression so if you have a interface
with only one method so instead of
creating the object you can directly use
our lambda expression here so when you
talk about this for each method for each
method needs a object of consumer that
we have seen in the last video so what
we'll do is we'll we'll see that method
one more time so we have returned for
each new we can do in this way also we
can say consumer we can create an
anonymous class here and this consumer
we can create or we have to specify the
type of element so we in this consumer
to specify all these values are integers
and cut since consumer is the interface
you can go to this let me just first
embody package so if you go to this
consumer interface now it is written
it's a functional interface notice
functional interface are if you remember
in 1.7 or 1
six if you are using any version before
1.8 interface out of interface without
three types first is normal interface
interface with multiple methods then
these two have marker interface which is
a interface without any method and then
now we have this Sam interface now Sam
stands for it is single abstract method
interface which simply means you have
only one method in that interface in
this scenario in 21.8 all your Sam
interfaces which is single abstract
method interfaces are called as
functional interface so what is
functional interface it's the interface
with only one method declared clear so
you can also define functional interface
with the help of this at functional
interface annotations okay so if you
talk about this consumer interface it
has only one method so we need to define
that method here so it's a public void
accept and the value the type of
parameter it will take is integer I and
we can simply print the value of I right
so if you if you use this thing it will
do the same thing or if you write this
thing it will do a same thing if I come
in this part and if I done this code now
it will still work so if I done this and
you can see the output here it will take
some time so you can see the output is 1
2 3 4 5 6 bits because we have used a
method really which is of for each a for
each method which brings all the values
so if we talk about here for each method
it's only take the object of consumer
interface now if we talk about this
consumer interface it's a functional
interface so Java 1.8 says if you have a
function interface with only one method
so this type of code here is called as
boilerplate code which simply means this
for each method only takes the object of
consumer so why we need to write this
thing so we can remove this part
since since we have removed that cuddly
basis we have to remove this one also
now since that object there which is
consumer has only one method which is
accept so why to right this part right
so the only thing we have to specify
here is only I right which is the
variable name why to specify this type
when you know all the elements are
integers so we can remove this also and
then we can specify our add or say
saying this is a method called as public
void except with takes a parameter end
of integer I and this is the code for
that so indirectly this code represents
public or new consumer public void
except integer I and in bracket you have
this but since you have only one
statement here we do not have to specify
a semicolon and occur devices so you can
simply write this one now in turn if you
write this command this is same like
this one right so if you compare these
two statements you have they are same so
what we can do we can remove the comment
and we can remove this part and still
the output is if I run this the output
is same you can see the output is same
right but that means can I use a lambda
expression for all the interface no
lambda expression only works with
function interfaces so if you have any
interface which is not functional lambda
expression will not work clear so this
is how we had to use lambda expression
so in the next video we'll talk more
about other methods of stream API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
