ready from toys called odd things and
now let's continue with a discussion so
we have talked about the project and how
we can go with that now let's talk about
how to participate so the only way to
participate is to show some seriousness
now how can you show the seriousness
it's very easy see lots of people they
say they want to participate and if I
keep it open that it will be difficult
for me to manage and then there are
people they will show the seriousness
initially but then later on they will
feel ok it's not getting easy and then
of course alright when you build a
project it will be difficult so if you
want interested if you think you can do
it down they participate because you're
wasting also resources other than so
make sure you are you are focus so how
we can do this so the first step is I
will give you a project a small project
for 2 days you have to complete that
project in 2 days I have to submit by
Thursday evening so what you do is you
can see this there's a class here so if
you look at this class you have alien
right now it's not compulsory to build
the entire thing here so what I'm
expecting here is either you should know
the designing part or the Java part
right so you need you need at least one
of this so if you know designing part
let's HTML CSS and JavaScript you can
create you can create a form where you
will a user will enter the alien ID
alien name and the planet from where
alien has come and then the age in of
course in thousands of years right so
you have to take this input you have to
store that input in a JSON object now
you should know adjacent if you know
designing part and you have to create a
JSON array for 5 objects so if a user
enters for 5 times you have to create a
JSON array and you have to print all the
values on the page this is what the
designing assignment is the coding
assignment if you are if you are good
with Java take the same class
I mean create a class from this fields
and then take the interim input from the
user create 5 objects assign 5 values to
that I mean 5 objects will have 5
different values and then save that in
and print all the values of the adding
compute assignment and submit to us that
will be our first task so if you if you
do if you can do that then you are in
the in the you you might be in the group
the second thing is we have made a
Facebook group on Facebook of course so
the group name is that is called live
project just go to Facebook and search
for that is called live project you can
you can request for the access so it's a
closed group so we will accept who is
allowed and who is not allowed so if you
complete this thing then you may you may
get the humility permission to get to
get into the group third since we want
to increase our family I want I want
this to be to reach to H and everyone
because there are people who want to
learn new things who want to implement
the project but they are not my
subscribers they might be of friends
what you can do is you can share the
first and the second video this video on
your Facebook profile with some text why
what is this project is all about and
why you should be a part of this project
and use a hashtag Pallister disco so
that we can we can track so these are
the two things first you have to
complete the project and submit it to us
second share this share this video on
your Facebook profile and also like our
page because all the announcement will
be done so public cannot simply be done
on the page and the private announcement
will be done on that group so make sure
you are part of the group to complete
this project and that's it so that's
that's that's how you will participate
so on Friday we'll be going for the next
video where we'll talk about what next
