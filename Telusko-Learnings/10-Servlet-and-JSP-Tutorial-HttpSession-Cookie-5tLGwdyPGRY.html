aliens my name is Levin ready and let's
continue with the series of servlet and
JSP so what we have done till now is
implicated this page which is index dot
HTML where I'm asking for two values
num1 and num2 when you click on submit
the request goes to add where and we'll
call your add servlet where you are
accepting these two values you are
trying to add them what we also trying
to do here is we are trying to call
another servlet or we are sending a
request which is SQ which is handled by
the sq servlet now there is one thing we
have to remember is we are using
response dot send redirect which means
the ad sublet will send or will it will
respond to a client by sending a signal
by by sending a signal which says hey
just go to the sq servlet now ask you
sahabat will try to find a square of a
number but which number we have to send
this scale right and we have done that
in the earlier video we have we have
talked about this that we can pass the
value by saying sq question mark and
then we can pass a value so the way we
do with the query string but do we have
another option
let's say what if we don't want to use
URL to be writing which we have done in
the earlier video now you want to
thinking what's the drawback and doing
that because it works right what if you
want to pass multiple values what if you
want to use the same value in multiple
servlet not just this servlet maybe you
have add Soviet which calls sq servlet
then excuse of it which call some other
servlet in that scenario if you want to
maintain the data throughout this
session oh that's a good word now
there's a concept of session which means
whenever you go to a web application it
will try to maintain a session for you
and that will be done by your Tomcat of
course how will you use a session here
because session is there throughout the
throughout your visit there right if you
visit one service again solid third
solid it will be there for you
so what if you can put your data into
session so once you put your key into
session here you can use that session
value in the next servlet how do we do
that
as I mentioned session will be given by
Tomcat we just have to get the hold on
it and the way you do that is by using
HTTP session
so actually be session is an interface
we just have to say HTV session session
and as I mentioned the object will be
given by Tomcat itself you simply have
to say request dot get session we just
have to get D hold on it and once we got
a session object with us will simply say
session dot set attribute because
session will be there toward your visit
to the website right if you go to add
solid if you go to sq serve it even if
after some time if you go to some other
page which is the same application this
session will be available for you now
provided you don't close the session
provided you don't remove the value from
this session we can do that by the way
so with secession dot said attribute and
I would say the value is going in a
format of K and the value itself is K so
I'm sending a attribute which is K and
the value is K how do we how do we
access that here how do we fetch the
value now of course we are not sending
data into the quest object we are
sending data energy in the session so
the way you fetch the value now is by
saying so remove that will say session
dot o we have not instant we have not
given the reference for session here we
are not declared it here so I would say
HTTP session I should be session session
equal to the same thing a request dot
get session and once we got and hold on
it once we got the hold on decision
object I would say session dot get
inside ad sublet we have said cell
attribute here we have to say get
attribute it's that simple and here I
would mention I want key ok now there is
one issue when you say attribute it
means it will return you the object we
don't want object what we want is the
ain't format right so we'll simply type
cost it will say int and we are done so
this will give you object and we have to
convert it into and we just simply
typecasting it again we can we can say
integer percent as well we just have to
convert it into string but multiple
steps why it seems simple we see we can
simply type cos it with int now this
should work let's verify I will go back
to my HTML I will say write like run as
the non server so it is opening my
Firefox and here I would say 2 &amp;amp; 3 which
is 5 into 2 which is 25 answer should be
25 and regarded can see that we got the
answer so first which is adding those
two values and then it is much it is
finding a square of a number
quite simple right so we can use session
as well now as I mentioned the data will
be available in this session for you
throughout provided you don't delete
this data from the session can you
really do that yes we can actually we
can delete data from the session so we
can once you've got the hold on it we
can say session dot there are there's a
way you can say is it remove attribute
yes you can say that we have the more
attribute and you can remove key here
now once you remove key of course you
cannot face the value so you can fetch
this value only when you have the value
in the in this session so using this you
can remove it that's how you can use
session normally we can use session to
maintain the login so let's say if you
log in on your website and if you want
to verify if you if a user goes to
another page and if you want to verify
the user is already logged in you can
you can maintain the data in this
session that's what we do but this looks
cool right so session looks cool do we
have some other way in fact we'll be
working on session more in the future
topics once we start with JSP but can we
do something more here and the answer is
yes what we can also do is we can use
cookies as well so the way we have
session we can also use cookies now how
that what works so what I will do is I
will not use session anymore let me
remove session let me remove session
from it everywhere I want to use cookies
here so I would say int K again and it
should I will say 0 how do we do the
same thing with type of cookies let's
get back to add and here I would say I
want to work with cookie now what is
cookie basically so whenever you send a
request to the server and a server will
send you a response now in that response
object so the response object which is
coming from the server will have a
cookie and then when you when you send a
request to ask you serve that you can
send the same cookie again so defense
would be the cookie is coming on the
client side and then you are against an
in the cookie to the server now if you
want to imagine this imagine your going
to a shop to buy something or let's say
if you are going to a restaurant or if
you are going to a restaurant weight
which provides you self-service where
you have to buy the product first you
have to pay the amount and then you will
get the get the dish or whatever you
want to eat so let's say you you want to
buy something which which cost you
around let's say 50 bucks and you are
giving 100 bucks so you don't have a
with you so the the product cost you
around 50 bucks but you have your paying
hundred bucks and the shopkeeper says or
the restaurant person says hey he don't
have a change now of course you don't
even you don't have a change he don't
have a change what you will do he will
say okay wait for some time once I got
the change I will give it to you you go
back to your seat and then after half an
hour you go back to the cashier and say
hey I want a more fifty to fifty bucks
back now will you remember you of course
not right after half an hour he may
forgot who you are
so in the earliest scenario what you
should have done as the moment he says
hey wait for 30 minutes he will give you
a token on that token it will it will
dry he will write 50 which means when
you go back to him after some time you
can show that token which say is 50
that's a cookie when you go for the
first time he will give you a token so
that when you go back to him after some
time you can use a token I hope you
understood something about that example
here I will try to implement that with
the Java code so I would say cookie that
this is how you get a cookie you say
cookie cookie basically belongs to Java
expected Java X dot Java dot HTTP and I
would say cookie equals you how do we
create a cookie it's a class basically
so we can simply say new cookie okay we
got a cookie which asked you for two
parameters the first parameter is the
name of it I will say K and the value of
it which is K as well so I'm how a name
which is K and the value escaped we got
a cookie ass we got about cookie we
cannot simply pass k here it should be
string how do we convert this K into
string we can simply append a double
quotes right so integer obtain double
quotes is string now once we got this
cookie we just have to add this cookie
to the response object so it will go to
the client I would say response dot add
cookie another pass cookie that's done
we are sending this cookie to the client
now this means this add sahabat will
send the response to the client and
client again will send a request to sq
servlet now when a client send a request
to ask use of it again it will send the
cookie as well oh that means we have to
first accept the cookies and the way you
do that is by saying how do we do that
so when a servlet send a response to the
client it is response object right and
next time when a client send a request
to the sq servlet that means the the
cookie
becoming in the request object right so
I will say our EQ dot do we have a get
cookie method so we'll try to get
against that oh we don't have great
cookie we have get cookies that's weird
why get cookies why not get cookie it is
possible that on the client side you
don't have one cookie you have multiple
cookies quite possible right
we don't want okay so it will give you
all the cookies because client even
don't know which cookie you need so
client says hey I will give you all the
cookies you figure it out what which
cookie you want okay so this client is
sending all the cookies I have to use an
array of cookies so I would say cookies
add a equal to let me input the package
as I mentioned we are not getting one
cookie we are getting cookies so that's
why we have an added and from this array
I want to fetch the cookie which I want
how do we know which we which I want for
that I will use an announced for loop I
would say for in fact you know I will
just declare this variable up here so
that I can use it later I would say for
announced announced for the works
something like this I would say cookies
C equal : cookies it will give you it
will run a loop through to all the
cookies and then I would say what how do
we fetch a cookie now so I would say
first of all I want to know which cookie
I want so I would say if the cookie name
so I would say cookie C dot get name is
it D yeah so we have get name if the
name equals K that's what you want to
compare right if name equals K this is
our cookie I would say k equal to C dot
gate value so we don't want all the
values we want only value of that cookie
which has a value which is the name of
with the name with K okay now it says
gate value will give you object ID or
gate when you give you what string we
have to convert that into integer so I
would say integer dot parseint okay so
this is how we can fetch cookies and
let's verify it is working I'm not sure
let's run this code let's verify I would
say restart so here it is asking for two
values I would say eight and six
and if I say submit you can see we got
196 which is this square of one of
scholar 14 so it works so yes you have
multiple options in the last video we
have seen URL rewriting in this video we
have seen how do we use session I know
how do we use cookies to send this data
let me know if you have not understood
the example
of cookie I will try to create a theory
video where I will explain how that
cookie flows from a client to the server
so that's it from this video we have
talked about session we have talked
about cookies I would also recommend you
to practice this code try some different
examples not just additional two numbers
you can also try login username password
you can also try to use how maybe you
can you can do some other operations as
well so try it out let me know in the
comments section if you enjoyed this
video waiting for your comments and do
like the video if you enjoyed it thanks
