print this block which is stars we have
to use a for loop for the four times
right and the basic funder of for loop
is if you want to execute the same set
of statement multiple times we use a
font applied and we are repeating front
of itself and for its of the statement
so don't you think this is one statement
second statement and third statement for
stripping the orders same so what if if
we can put this saying this for loop if
again if we can put this for dope in a
block
so block open and block closed just
ignore the last three four loops let me
remove this three for the to remove the
confusion so if we can put this this for
loop in a block and we'll name this this
block as again a for loop with initial
value let's say instead of I with I I
have one more variable which is J so
this will be a J equal to one this will
be how many times we want to execute the
same formula for four times or J less
than equal to 4 and J plus plus simple
now will it work so what we are doing is
we are me just give some proper
indentation so whenever you whenever you
open a blog you should provide a proper
indentation just to specify inside this
for loop we have this block and inside
this further we have this block okay so
you can see I am repeating the same
omitting repairing this statements for
four times so this type of part moves
are polished nested for-loops
so whenever you have a for loop inside
important is nested for loop and if you
run this code you will get you the same
output which is star block cool so
that's how we have to use a nested for
loop so how basically how it works
so the initial value of J is 1 it will
go till 4 and for every value of j i
will increment four times okay just
imagine this inner for loop is number of
all
so we have 1 a.m. 2 a.m. 3 a.m. 4 a.m.
and then we'll go by directly to to an
a.m. right after effect 24 hours but
after every 24 hours we get a new day so
let's say this is Monday today so
tomorrow it will be Tuesday and every
Tuesday our every day will be having 24
hours so this will execute for 24 times
next day 24 times next day 24 times next
day 24 times right so mind your value
while your J values of 1 I will go from
1 to 4 then your J value increment and
it will make it 2 it will go from 1 to 4
then it will be 3 it will go from 1 to 4
it will be 4 it will go for 1 to 4 so in
total this star will be printed 16 time
right again you have to multiply 4 into
4 you will get 16 stars simple so inner
father will be executed multiple times
depend up on your out of bottle so
that's it that's how you use a nested
for loop in the next video we'll talk
about more patterns so this is one of
the pattern we have printed so maybe in
the next video we'll talk about this
pattern so one of my favorite pattern so
I want to print this pattern so what I
will suggest before starting with the
next video just try to print this
pattern and then watch the next video ok
so thanks for watching and do subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
