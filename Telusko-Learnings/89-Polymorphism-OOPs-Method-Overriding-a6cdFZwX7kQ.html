overriding in polymorphism so what
exactly method overriding is let's say
you have a class called as a as we have
seen in the theory that overriding means
we'll be having same name a method with
the same name and same number of
parameters but the only difference will
be both the method will be from
different plants and those classes will
be linked with our concept of
inheritance so we'll say we have a Class
B which exchange a and now let's say in
this class a we have metabolic show and
this method show prints if we say in
show and show a alright so now since
Class B exchange a so this show will
come to come in this class B and now if
I create object of B so if say B obj
equal to nu B and from here if I say obj
dot show now it will check in B class
then B class we don't have any method
collection so what it was what it will
vary will go is it will jump to this
class a to see if this show method there
and yes we have a show method here it
will call in show a so if I run this
code and the output is in show a right
so that means B class doesn't have show
and that's why it is jumping to a show
but let's say for an idea public void
show now it's something like if you have
something why you will go towards the
parent class so in this class B now we
have show so we when you call show it
will likely jump to the Class B show it
will not go to class issue if I run this
code now the output will be in be in
show B it will call this show yeah so
this is this is the concept of method
overriding when you have two methods
with the same name and same number of
parameters and they both belong to say
two different classes but those classes
are linked with inheritance so here a is
a parent class and visit a class
and the concept here is called as method
over riding in fact this the same
concept is also called as so this is
Method over riding and it is also called
as late binding also called as dynamic
binding and also called as this is
runtime polymorphism polymorphism
extra you okay so this is this is the
concept of method overriding where you
have two methods with the same with the
same name and same number of parameters
in two different class clear so and it's
also called as late binding deny binding
and then time polymorphism so that this
is your method writing and when you
combine these two concept it is
overloading and overriding you get a big
concept called as polymorphism</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
