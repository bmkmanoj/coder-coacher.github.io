for Android programming what you should
know in this video we'll talk about the
prerequisite in Android programming what
should have now before starting with
Android you have to setup your laptop or
desktop so that you can work on Android
programming so depend upon which type of
OS you are working on maybe you're using
Windows OS maybe are using Ubuntu
obviously display well or maybe you're
using Mac for different different OS we
have different different settings but
this office we have to use the same so
when you work with Java because the
Android is based on Java right because
there's a very famous person called Ali
this is in front of a cycle
he claims what is Android take Java take
XML mix it up and you will get Android
right so basically when you work with
Java to compile your Java files we
require JDK to compile your file so the
first thing in your machine you require
this JDK if you're using Windows and Mac
you can use normal JDK if you are using
Ubuntu you require open JDK now once we
have done the setup of the JDK the next
step we require is next the next thing
we require is SDK which is software
development kit which is for Android so
it is Android SDK okay okay is depend
upon which type of for OS you want to
work with maybe for marshmallow for
learning power will be having different
different versions for SDK so you have
to download basic SDK from Google in
fact the amazing thing is when you
install Android studio you will get SDK
with it so you require JDK you require
SDK and to type your code you require an
Android studio which is an IDE for for
Android so initially people used to work
on Eclipse so maybe two to three years
back if you want to work on Android
programming you have to use eclipse so
in eclipse you can have android plug-in
and you can write your code there but a
kiss is not meant for Android it is good
for other frameworks but not for Android
specifically for Android we have Android
studio okay which is powered by
IntelliJ IntelliJ is one of the best IDE
for Java okay so for the Android also we
use IntelliJ power powered software
which is and
studio so two things are required here
first will be JDK then we require SDK
and we required Android studio the
latest version of Android studio which
is stable is 1.5 maybe if you are
watching this video in maybe after 2
months of this video we will be using
2.0 which is again it is in beta version
now you can also use 2.0 Android studio
but since you're learning Android to
make sure you use this table version
which is 1.5 ok so these are the
prerequisites which which should be
there in your machine now there's also a
hardware dependency here when you work
with Android we requite we have also
have a hardware dependency make sure you
have at least 3 or 4 GB of RAM if you
have 2gb of RAM it will work but you
know you should not hate Android after
doing that because once you run your
Android code on 2gb ram it will take it
up like approximately 3 to 4 minutes
just to see the output so don't you
waste your time just update your RAM
till 4 GB of RAM 2 to 4 GB so it
required 4 GB RAM you require at least a
code to do a machine for Android I can
you get will work on p4 but if you love
your life if you love your patience make
sure you use go to do machine and what
next that's it you require all those
things and if you have everything you
are good to go so we'll start with the
implementation or we'll see how to
install all the software's in the next
video and after that we'll start with
the implementation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
