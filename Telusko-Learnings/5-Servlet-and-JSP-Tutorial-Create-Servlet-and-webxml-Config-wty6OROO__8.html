we create a project in Eclipse which is
a web project in this case and we have
also created one page which is index dot
HTML so what we are trying to do here is
we are taking two values the moment you
click on submit we want to call add but
what exactly this add is the purpose
here is just to add this two numbers
that said we can do that with JavaScript
but here I want to use a server-side
technology and we want to use Java and
the only option you have is servlet so
what we will do here is let's create a
servlet but how do we do that it's very
simple actually just right click on your
project and say new here I will select a
class but you might be wondering we are
making a servlet right it should be
something new or not exactly we can
create a simple class and that will
behave like a servlet I know you don't
trust me I will click on class here I
will create a simple class which will
add two numbers so we will call this as
a add salat again you can use any name I
love this name which is ADD solved it
I will go with that and here in the
package I will mention the package name
I would say comm dr. disco you can use
any package name but then you have to
make sure that your package name is
yannick and that's why we always use a
reverse of your domain name because your
domain names are unique so of course
your package name will also be unique
and here I will click on finish a very
simple plus so you can see we have a
very simple class which is doing nothing
now in order to make a servlet you just
need to do one thing the different ways
of creating a servlet we will talk about
the lifecycle of servlet and what are
the completed our key time being just to
make it simple I will use a class name
which is so we just have to extend a
class which is HTTP servlet so you just
need to extend HTTP servlet and your job
is done the moment you extend a Servet
class your class becomes a servlet so
you just have to extend HTTP servlet
okay now this sounds cool the next
problem is when you click on the submit
button it will call add write and we are
expecting when you call add it will paul
add salat
will it be happening automatically
that's different thing we'll talk about
that later
but imagine if this class is working if
you want to perform any operation you
need methods that's what we have learn
in Java if you want to perform if you
want to do anything any task you use
methods now here as well I have to use a
method but which one now servlet says if
you want to use a method name you can
use a service method because servlet is
a server component right and what server
does it provide service so we can use a
method in which service can I use some
other method name the answer is no if
you want to make it working you need to
use a service method name now service is
a method which belongs to a service
lifecycle so of course you have to go
with this method name so with the
service and here I want to accept the
equation on the user I know how to do
some tasks now the question would be how
our user will send out requests I mean
that's okay so let's say if you go to
the quest here how a user will able to
send data and this servlet is able to
receive data as we have seen in the
video the theory video which we have
done whenever you work with service
method or any two server you have to
work with two different object one is
the request object and second is a
response object so you have to pass a
request object here so I will say HTTP
salt request object and req the thing is
you don't have to actually create this
object by yourself this object will be
created by Tomcat you just need to get a
reference of it so you don't have to say
a new keyword I don't think it's
something like that it's simply say ship
we saw a request and you say Riccardi
queue and then it will say observe it
responds so basically we need this two
objects here now using the request
object you can fetch data from the
client and using this false object you
can send response to the client so it's
all about request and response right now
in this method service once I got this
object what I will do is I will try to
get data from the user now are using
sending two values right so I would say
int I where you will have the first
value so I would say are Eq
now this request object will have your
data so I can say get parameter because
when a user is passing values user is
passing parameters and I would say I
want to accept the first value
but what to mention here now as a user
you are sending two values right you are
sending values in num1 and num2
the first value is there is num1 so i
would say i want to fetch value from now
1 okay now there is one simple problem
get parameter will give you a string
what we are expecting here is an integer
so we have to convert that right and the
way you do that is by using percent our
favorite method is percent and this
string will be getting converted into
integer the same thing can be done for
the second variable i would say i mean j
here so this is j into j integer dot
parseint and here I will say num2 now
you can see we got both the values we
got I and regard J the only thing that
to do now is add them and the way you do
that is by saying int k equal to I plus
J a simple codes our concept okay now
the question would be we have done with
addition how do I print it so normally
in code Java what we do is we say system
dot out dot println
and I would say result is and I will
print the value of K so I'm expecting
that this should work now will this work
let's try I will run this application I
will go right to index I will say it one
as run on sawa so you can see we got
this page here and in this page I will I
will say it's 34 and 21 or 12 so the
answer should be 46 let me just click on
submit oh it's not working it says for
not for our favorite error right and
there is one thing which you have to
observe look at the address bar we are
sending our ad request that is perfect
and we are also passing the values so we
are passing the value of num1 and num2
in the address bar so this is called as
a query string so query string is a part
where you can send your data from a
client to a server so let's go back to
the server now the question would be why
you are not able to call this ad servlet
for this obvious reason right if I if I
look at this ad you I mean when you
click on the submit your calling ad
right so you are calling ad and you have
a server time we just add served it
don't you think it will get confused
between this two we have an ad servlet
here
we have adhered to solve this problem
let's try to understand the flow the
moment you click on submit now since you
are using Tomcat Tomcat will say ok you
are requesting for a page the request
will go to Tomcat but Tomcat don't know
that this this is the class you have to
call now it will ask you hey programa
you are users trying to call add servlet
you must have defined the flow right so
whenever a user call add it should call
add servlet where you have configured it
and unfortunately we have not done that
yet so Tomcat will look for this file
which is web dot XML web dot XML is also
called as a deployment descriptor this
is where you will have all the
configurations so if I open this you can
see we don't have any configuration for
this servlet this thing we don't need as
of now I can remove all this stuff that
that was a welcome page what I want here
is I want to configure my servlet so I
want to say whenever I use a request for
add I want to call add servlet and the
way you do that is by putting two tags
here one is a sublet tag and the next
one is servlet mapping tag you just need
to use these two tags that's it a sublet
tag and start mapping tag now in inside
Sabich tag you have two sub tags here so
one is a servlet name and the second one
is servlet class in the sult mapping
again you have to define two tags one is
this servlet name and the next one is
URL pattern now this is unique right we
have a survey class name that makes
sense we have a URL pattern because you
are sending a request right so if you
look at the address bar this is
basically our URL so that makes sense
but why we have servlet name it's
because in your application you might
have multiple servlets may not be one
maybe ten twelve fifty hundred you are
not sure now for every sublet you need
to create a servlet tag and a survey
mapping tag so there will be a confusion
which servlet mapping is linked with
which servlet and that's where we use
this servlet name so these two are
linked so they should have the same name
and I would say the name is ABC again
you can go with any name we time and we
are going for ABC
you have to make sure that if one pad
which is servlet and so it mapping they
should have the same name if you have
another subject you will be having
another pair of this now whatever this
object name or this object class this
server class is the Select class then
you have to mention which is add savage
and the URL pattern is your ad so slash
ad because you are requesting for ad
request so ad will Paul add servlet but
then we have to provide a fully
qualified class name and when I say
fully qualified class name it means with
the package name so the package name is
come dr. disco dot so you have to
mention fully qualified name so a class
name with a package so comdata disco dot
ad solid now everything seems Kerch it
should work now now how do you verify
let's right click on yourself
well I click on your server say you
start go back to your browser let's
refresh this page I will say submit Oh
something has happened you can see there
is no error okay so we have done with
the first ever place we have not getting
any error if I go back to the browser or
the Eclipse you can see we got the
answer but the answer is coming in the
console but why on the console for a
very simple reason you in the code if
you can see we are printing the data on
the console so whenever you say system
dot out dot println
you always plain data on a console I
don't want to print it on a console I
want to print on the page the declined
page you can see that we got a page here
but this page doesn't have the data now
to understand this question arise who is
sending this page it's actually a
servlet sublet is sending that page in
the format of response object now in
order to write the data on response
object you cannot say system dot out dot
println you have to say it is response
dot getwriter dot println so basically
you are taking the object of response
and then you are fetching a writer
object of it and you are saying print
LN I know this looks confusing so what I
will do is I will try to create this
object outside so I will say response
dot getwriter
so if you can observe this get writer
get written or get writer returns an
object of print writer so I will say
print writer this is what it returns I
will say print writer out equal to RS
dot getwriter
we have to input the package for print
right of first of
and here instead of using get response
target right I will say out so what you
are doing is you are printing data on a
response object this is the object which
goes from the client from this hour to
client now it is throwing an exception
it says it might throw an exception so
you can say throws that's one of the
best option you can go for so I would
say add throws declaration hours job is
done and it should work now the data
should be printed on the client machine
I will go back here right-click on the
server and said you start it's doing
something let me just go back to my PE
browser and I will say refresh click on
submit' can see that we got the output
on the client page this is what we
expecting so this is how you create a
simple servlet which will accept two
values and it will add those I will
print it on the web page just to repeat
we have been in the class a simple class
in the in any package you want and you
just need to extend HTTP servlet class
in which you just have to define a
method a service you cannot go for any
other name other than service you cannot
say ABC PQR yes we do have some two
extra methods we can use but time in
let's focus on service it takes two
objects request and response in the same
sequence and then you need to fetch
those two values add those two values
and you can go into it you can you can
do anything you want but this is what we
have done in this example so I hope you
understood how to be how to get a savage
and how to send response so in the next
video we'll try to do something else
with the servlet Maeby's we can create
multiple servlets so that's it everyone
