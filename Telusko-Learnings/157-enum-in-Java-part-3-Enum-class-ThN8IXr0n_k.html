have seen that we can set the price and
we can get the price here right hold on
we have not said we have not said
apprise it because we are getting 0 what
we'll do is we'll just cut this part and
we'll keep it here so that we can use it
later I mean we can refer it later and
now the main concern is how to set the
price now this is one way to set the
prices next I don't want to set the
price as 0 I want to set the price as
something maybe maybe 50 or 100 so what
we can do is we can actually use
constructors because basically when you
talk about enum indirectly enum gets
converted into a class and inside that
class we have multiple objects right so
we have Apple Samsung as to see those
are actually objects and when you talk
about objects something comes to your
mind is constructive right so can we
create a constructor here and the answer
is yes so we can create a constructor
here we can say mobile so that's how we
get a constructor and we can specify
some price here we'll say applies equal
to 80 right so now this price will be
assigned for each and every object right
for Apple Samsung and HTC will be happy
to see it twice now just to prove that
this construct is getting called for
every object
let me just print something here let's
say high or not high let's say
constructor just to have that stuff now
every time if I if I run this code every
time you will be getting 300 means we'll
be getting three objects so for this
three object we'll call this constructor
three time so every time it creates an
object so that simply means the number
of constants defines defines the defines
your console I mean defines the number
of constrictive number of times the
custom will be called right so that's
how you call a constructor here now I
don't want to set the price forward so
if you can see the price for Apple was
80 I didn't want to set the price for
Apple as 80 I want to set the price for
Samsung as a team so that's default
value but for Apple I want the value to
be hundred and 4s to see the value
should be
ID so we can specify the value something
in this way so we can specify the
constant and we can we can give a round
rag and we can specify the value now if
you can convert this into this line this
is actually like specifying hundred here
so we are passing the hundred in the
constructor but hold on to accept that
we need a constructor which can accept
our integer so we can do that we can
create a constructor which takes an
integer value and we'll say this is P
and we can set the price of P right so
this value 190 will be coming here and I
feel um this will be getting 100 but we
got only one constructor is because for
Samsung we are printing the value right
this is the dismal so this will call the
parametrized constructor Samsung will
call the default constructor because we
are not specifying the value there and
for us to see we are specifying this
constructor here right so that's how we
can we can assign constructors to the
class I mean to enum now the awesomeness
oppose about enemies we don't we just
don't have get prize method we also have
some other methods if I say control
space can you see that we have compact
to method we have we'll see why we have
compared to we have get prize we have
equals we have hash code we have ordinal
holder from where all these methods are
coming so the answer is every enum in
Java extends a class called as enum
so every enum extends up last fall as
enum so we have we do have a class for
as enum in Java which belongs to Java
dot line package if you can see it
belongs to Java dot line package and so
we have a class you know which is an
abstract class that means no other class
can I mean we cannot get object of an
object of edom here so we have enum
which implements compatible and it it
implements realizable that means we can
store the state of an object of edom and
this enum has lots of methods to work
with we have ordinal as a method
we have lots of methods to work with
right so we can print the ordinal so we
can print the ordinal so what is ordinal
means ordinal means the order so if I
print the ordinal of Apple it will print
zero because that's the ordinal for
Apple zero Samsung would be one because
that's the next one so it goes in our
sequence so it goes on sequence so if I
print the order for Samsung it will
print one so every all these constants
have a number so this is 0 this is 1 and
this is 2 this is same like creating a
array or the collection so that's an
ordinary
that means if this constants here has an
ordinal that means we can fetch all this
constants together write something in
this way let's say I don't know the way
I do so I know the I know there's
something else mobile enum but I don't
know how many how many constants we have
so what we can do we can fetch all the
constants will be which will become an
array now how do we quickly how do we
fetch the constant we can simply say
mobile dot values so we do have this
method well as values which is which is
getting fetched from it will fetch all
the values from from the enum and it
will store inside this M now how to
print that well we can use an envelope
here for that matter we can say m or we
can say mobile mobile : m and we can
print individual bevarly or we can say
mobile right that's how we can print we
can trade all the constants regards
apples Sam second sec so this values is
a method which will fetch all the
constants now the awesome thing is if I
click on this value can you see that we
cannot click on this value does it
belongs to this mobile mobile enum no we
don't have any ethical has value let's
go to Edom do we have a value method
here let me just type values okay it's
not that it's not directly you can you
see that we don't have any method of all
has values here so this is something so
this is something magical in Java so
values is
our method which is given by your
compiler audio JVM this is not there
inside enum not even that in object
class not even there and this enum
okay and awesome thing is this this enum
class extends the object class so all
the methods from the object class is
coming to actor this enum and from
intimated is coming to this edom okay so
this innum already extends the enum
class now does that mean can we extend
some another class if I create another
class let's say I have a class demo here
can I can I can this enum okay we
already have a demo somewhere so let me
just say demo one can you say enum
extends demo one that's not possible we
cannot use extends keyword here because
extends because this already extends the
enum class right so we cannot extend
demo one also
how about interface if this demo one is
an interface let's try let's say
implements demo one does that work and
that works that means your enum can
implement the interface that is possible
okay so this is some some points you
have to remember so at enum enum can
implement the interface we can we have
seen the values method we have seen the
ordinal methods so that's it from this
video we have talked about a lot of
features we have talked about the
Constructors we have talked about
ordinal method we have talked about
values and yeah that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
