people are watching this so just need to
check everything is working fine here
before continuing with the stuff here so
that you just must this okay
it means verify everything if it's
working fine or not
okay so 18 people are watching and
that's great and we got 13 like lights
as well that's great
get it going so okay so the comments
more videos okay good evening now and so
postponing family yeah hi good evening
everyone
okay so that's the Eco okay so ten
people are watching now so yeah so we
discuss about topic again uh but before
that if you can share this length with
your friends on Facebook that will be
awesome so just let everyone know that
we are doing this live stuff where you
can learn different things I wanted to
update one more thing you just have to
go to my new player make sure that you
subscribe to the new channel as well
because the future life sessions will be
done there okay so as you know I have
also informed that I've also informed
that this this life sessions will be
going but I would not drive it but but
it will be going unlisted in future
since I'm not getting good response in a
public way so maybe I'm going for I will
not be going for a live session in
public so what I'm doing is if the
future life sessions will be implying to
do that do it on the new channel so that
not everyone will be disturbed with this
so what you can do is you can just just
go to go to youtube and search for the
disco Pro and make sure that uses curve
with that channel let us go from here
itself so I will go to I will search for
YouTube and okay so the channel name is
the disco so it's like a disco pro
okay so this is the channel or this one
so make sure that you subscribe this
channel because so all the future will
be all the future sessions will be may
be done on this channel sometime for
that
so to be on safe side just make sure
that you subscribe both the channels the
telesco learning and the disco pro okay
great uh so here we go so okay so YUM
yep
so let's go get back here and are gonna
discuss what
okay so let's discuss what exactly will
be the today's topic so today topic will
be discussing about the code module now
again we are not focusing on design here
we are focusing on the backend part of
it so whatever code I'm writing now that
is focused more on the coding part that
is focus much on what on the coding part
not and design part again I'm planning
to I don't know how I can make designs
better so again my team is working on
design here so let's see how that goes
and there is one more thing let me show
you something so the modules which we
are going to see today is the code
module now as you know that the website
is already there right that we are
trying to really design it with minimum
bugs in fact I have seen that in my
website also I have lots of bugs so we
are trying to remove those bugs now the
thing is I don't get much time to work
on my project because because of the
online training and other stuff so let's
see how I can you know improve this
website so if you can see this website
now again so people who don't know this
stuff what we are doing here so
basically what I what I am doing here is
I mean I'm trying to redesign my website
so that it will be having all the
features which is already there so you
can see we have homepage here and then
we have we have video page and in which
you will see all the videos in fact
maybe the next live session will be
based on this one how can you fetch all
the videos from YouTube this website so
as you can see if I click on this see
tutorials this are coming from I mean
these are coming from my database which
I have created
but then I want this this videos to be
coming from coming from the YouTube
let's see how that goes
in today's module what we are going to
discuss is energies working waste law
okay so this is the model we are going
to discuss today so this is the code
module now why exactly I made this code
module for multiple reason so what you
can just do it do is just go to this
link and just have a look on yourself as
well so I'm pasting that link in the
chat window just go to that link and see
how thing works okay okay so that's
weird I'm getting a call here
cancel that okay so just go to this link
they provide a link in the chat window
and you will get the idea what I'm
talking about so if you go to this link
as you can see we got so why do we need
a code page here so what happens you
know since I have lots of videos on
YouTube sometime you know people want
the code code as it is so that they
don't want to type the code just they
just want to copy and paste the code so
the way you can do that is by go to this
go to this page and this page will be
having all the codes for all the videos
again I don't have all the code sides as
of now but then I need help of you as
well if you can help me in this so watch
my videos and make a code in fact we
have written lots of codes here but then
not everything is available so once the
website is deployed you can just help me
out for all the code after all the
videos you can just if you can just
contribute the codes by typing it okay
so yeah so okay so I can see that there
are lots of new people joining today
because this is the so this session I'm
doing is after maybe 15 days I'm going
live so maybe after 15 days I'm going
live here okay so what we are doing so
this this is the tenth session for a
live project so what we are doing is we
are building a telescope comm project so
that if you can go to the disco comm
which is my own website so we are trying
to redesign it
it is already there but then I want to I
want to do two things the first thing is
I want to redesign it second I want to
teach people how to build a project so
this is the tenth session so we already
covered nine sessions where we have made
lots of lots of modules and in this in
this project we are using high end
frameworks in Java world we are working
on Spring Framework we are working with
hibernate and then we are also deploying
the application on ms on Web Services
and today's today will be disk we'll be
focusing on code module okay so what I
need from code modules so if you can
just see this page so what I want is if
I click on any particular topic example
and clicking on Java now inside Java we
have lots of topics right now one of the
topic is let's say okay let's let's go
for ternary operators because everyone
knows about this if I click on this it
should give me description what exactly
ternary operator is it should give us
the video or so on on the YouTube
channel we have the video as well right
so it should give the video and it will
give you the code as well okay and then
it will give you the output and the
logic so what exactly the main logic for
this code okay so this is what we want
right now the question arise where does
the all the information has I mean where
do we have all this information so this
all information need to be stored in a
database so I have already created data
databases i will show you the database
right now in some time okay so all this
all this code or I mean this description
this video link this code will be coming
from database now as you know that we
are using a post Cruz database here okay
so yeah so we got a question from learn
how what is OK how to send the code so
if you want to contribute what you can
do is make make the codes upload it on
Google Drive or Dropbox or maybe github
and shared us the link so that we can
use it maybe github will be preferable
because it will teach you two things the
first thing is how to use github and
then how do you share projects with
other people so that's one thing we can
do okay so as I as I can see we have 51
people watching this live and 32 only 30
likes so if you if you are enjoy
like this make sure that you click on
the like button right and if you're not
just wait and watch
okay so what I will do now is the next
first first of all let me show you the
database which we are working with so we
are working with Postgres as you know
and inside this four squares we have a
tennis pro database in which I have
created we which database we are working
with so let me just check that so if I
use STS and if I go for database let me
just verify that so I will open SRC here
and this we have web-inf okay so as you
can see for local we are using Postgres
and we are using the disco so indeed in
the Postgres I should be having a code
table which I don't I cannot see here
okay and let me just refresh this and
refresh and okay you can see we got a
table which is code table right so I
want to fetch all the data from this
code table so in this code table what do
we have so if I see columns okay if I
see columns here and you can see we got
CID we got C name description code
output logic PID and video now let's
discuss what exactly this this table
means
now when I say CID CID is basically a
primary key here because every table
needs a primary key to to work with
right so CID will be a primary key here
again this is this is a surrogate key
which okay what is like a surrogate key
is now if you don't know about
difference between natural key and set
of gate key so natural key is something
which means you know okay example if you
have a table in your table if you have
any unique column example email ids or
phone numbers in that case if you are
making that column as a primary key it
becomes it becomes a natural key because
you already have a column and you're
just making that column as a primary key
right the another one other the way is
let's say if you have a table and if you
don't have any unique column so what you
will do is you can make you can create
one more column which will be having all
the unique values and you can do that
with the help of a surrogate key so in
this case if we talked about this CID
we don't need this column because this
is extra column but then we don't have a
choice i we don't have any column here
which is unique so I'm making this CID
as a unique column okay which is a
primary key here then I got C name now C
name will be having the codename exam
capsulation the new operator then you'll
be having description of course right
because when you see a topic you also
want to know the description for that
then we need a code the exact code we
need in fact if you can see in the
earlier module we were having the code
as well but the problem is the code it
doesn't have the line numbers right so I
want I want the line numbers here as
well
okay how to get that that we'll see
later so I want the line numbers here
and okay so I also want our output the
logic div now what is the ID if you look
at this code if you look at this page so
if I click on Java we got all this
topics right so for different topic
example for Java we have all this topic
for JDBC I have the example one our
example two for servlet we have do get
do pose edges off two numbers so if I
click on this code so you can see we got
we got the code as well right now for
that for this code the tid is the is
this one which is addition of two
numbers is it that one you clicked on
yeah at least have two numbers right so
this is this is what we wanted right so
if I click on this so it belongs to
sublet right so serve it becomes your
tid here so different topic will have
different codes so we also need tid
again we have not created the topic
table yet we don't need that for this
example again we will make a topic table
will insert data there I will be doing
that in the back end okay so I'll be
sharing this code on github for you so
maybe after the session in next one our
will be having a project on github okay
so let's let's continue this now let's
see how to how to do this now first of
all I do have this data in the database
let me show you how to press that so
what I can do is I can simply go to my
query tool so I don't know if you are if
you know about
okay so if you know about MySQL up or
squeeze you can use any database here
but I'm using Postgres here and if I
click on query tool so I can say select
or if you can see that font size or the
pH increase the font size here there is
no option there okay ignore that so I
will say select star from from cushion
or not from questions select star from
code right and if I run this query as
you can see we have the entire table
created here so I got approximately 18
codes already built so you can see we
got the topic C name we got description
for that we got the code because okay
what else we have so if I scroll you can
see we got output we got logic we got
tid record video at link as well now
this is basically a video length so this
because of this video length we are
getting that frame the video frame there
and if I play that video it will work so
when statistical go to this player go to
this page and just play our video just
to get a feel that it does work okay so
so we want to build the same thing so
what do we do here is I will go back to
my code I can will not we are not
focusing with design now so if you can
help me with your design just Center
this is design but then what I want to
do here is I don't want to display a
design I just want to fetch this data
that's that's important for me now for
that I will go to my spring okay now
people who don't know this if you are
new to this so we basically we are using
a spring framework here spring and
hibernate together if you are if you
don't know spring and hibernate I would
not recommend you to watch this session
because you would not understand
anything so what the prerequisite for
this sessions is again spring and
hibernate so again I'm saying this
because I can see there are lots of
people they are new to this session okay
so what else we need here so first of
all whenever I use a send a request now
what are the what is a URL we have to
work with so as you can see if I go back
to my Firefox this is the URL which you
want to work with so I will ex I will
call for that is calm but to be specific
to call the code page the URL is co dot
HTM and we have to pass this thing they
have to pass the C name and we have to
pass the topic name as well
now if you can pass that value then it
will work how do you pass this value how
can you pass code name and first of all
we have
provide a link right so I need a
controller here who can accept this
request now if I don't this project let
me just run this project first I will
say right click and say new ok I will
not new I will say run as the non server
the moment I do that and if I click on
if I click on this server here Tomcat if
I click on finish I just hope there's no
background process running so that this
will work let me close my Eclipse which
is running already there ok let me just
run this server once again right click
and run as a non server
okay so summarize running and you can
see let me just take the output window
on here so when I when I seek wish for a
task it will give you the home page what
I want here is if I call a code bar HTM
it should work so as you can see the
code dot HTM link is currently not
working so I am requesting for that I'm
ok so ok let me return this to the
server
I just working I don't know maybe I've
done I've done this before ok so I'm
really retaining the project here
because ok let's try 3 than that and
this is thing you know when you walk on
sir was it takes some time to load okay
by the time it loads you can see this
will not work so we have to create a
controller right now if you know Spring
Framework that's how we work we create a
controller there now how do we create a
controller so what do we do here is in
my controller package which is
condutores code task I will create a new
controller and I will say ok this is a
plus or normal class and this class will
be named as code controller again we
could have done that in industry Excel
but then I'm creating a code controller
here and I will I will I don't I don't
need a main function there so we got a
code controller not in this code
controller what I want is whenever I
send a request for Godot Astrium there
should be something which will work
right okay so when you specify that once
again and
it's running it's running it's running
okay see that we got four not four
because we don't have code dot HTM there
right so we want to make it work so what
we do is I will get a controller now
this controller will have a methyl which
will accept your request now how do we
do that so again I could have I could
type everything but then instead of
wasting much time in typing what I will
do is first of all I will just make this
as a controller so let's a controller
factor eight controller so we got a
controller here and since we are working
with spring MVC which is so we'll also
use enable web MVC okay now I don't know
if you can see the font here let me just
increase the font a bit okay so what I
want here so when I request for quote
dot HTM it should return the value right
now how it will go so instead of typing
everything what I will do is I will just
copy paste this so I already built a
code here and I will copy with the copy
paste that code for you and okay so let
me just copy that code and paste that
here and I will tell you also what
exactly this means so what i'm doing
here is whenever i request for code dot
HTM so whenever i request for quote
ostium what it should do is it should
first of all call this method which is
get code right and it will request for
the cname now see when you send a
request now even if you go to the
earlier website when you send a request
for Quadra stream you have to also pass
the cname right I mean which code you
need right so that's what we are doing
here so we are mentioning hey I am
calling for coded Astrium and then I'm
passing a cname now with that cname you
have to fetch the particular code so
what I'm doing here is
okay so what I'm doing here is I'm
creating a code Dao again why we need up
down there because we want to fetch data
from database right so we're down layer
here and we got a cool class but again I
have not gated this class yet will
advocating that class soon
now once you got all the codes you will
set that those codes in and then in a
least object and then I am passing that
object which will be showed on the next
screen right okay so first of all it
will not give you a list of code it will
give you only one code okay let let's
see how that goes
okay as you can see there are something
missing so let me input the package for
model and view and let me just do that
so okay so if you are asking for the
least which is Java dot util dot list
and now it is not able to find the code
page so what I will do is I will create
a code also not black okay so we need a
code Dao here the first first of all we
need a code ow now how do we create a
code Dao class so in this Dao layer as
you can see I don't have any code now we
do have pushing pushing down we got a
feedback Dao let me also create a code
out so right click here and say hey
create a new class and I will name the
class as code Dao Wow and in this code
now I want to interact with the database
right so again instead of typing that
code I already have a code with me and
if you remember we are working with
hibernate here so somewhere we have to
use session factory now I'm just
assuming that you have seen all my
earlier videos to get the link of it
that's the Pyrrhic wizard right because
I cannot teach you everything from
scratch in the tenth session okay so I'm
just pushing it here so I already on
this code and this code is almost
similar to the code which we have
written before right so we have done
with the question we have done with the
feedback this is the almost the same
code right
so I've pasted the thing here so I will
say this is added component okay let me
just input the package for everything so
we got the package for hibernate query
we got the package for you till we got
the package for transactional we got the
package for session right so we have to
import all the packages and then I'm
using a hibernate query here we are
saying from code where C name is equal
to name again it is one change so
fitting at least what you know what we
can also do is see we are
not reading a list of values wide by
only one value so we could have done
this also so instead of fetching the
entire which we can which we can fetch
only one code so it's a code C equal to
Q dot unique results because whenever
you have only one result we can go for
unique results because it will give you
only one value and then we turn that C
here and instead of occurring are the
entire leads will return one single code
even this will work even this should
work so I'm using one code so just try
to understand this what I'm doing is
when I send a request for coil
controller
the code controller will send a request
down layer and say hey now give me the
code now says okay I will interact with
it in a database and I will fetch that
one eunuch row for you because in one
row we have the description we have a
code everything and that we are
returning here so if I go back to
controller what we are doing here is we
are okay we don't want entire code we
just want one code so timing what do we
do is I will remove this I don't want to
least I want a single code okay in fact
I just I think I should type this in
shelf instead of sure of copy/paste so
now you do is I would say MB so I want I
want to call which page because I have
not created J's here okay so JSP I will
say sect a set view name and I will be
calling up page which is so the page
name would be code dot JSP so page name
would be code brought JSP and the next
thing I want to set is I want to face
that value right now how do you fetch
the value so first of all we need object
of code Dao if you just do that here so
I would say code now again we could have
created or we could have in fact we
should be using the annotation way right
so I will be using so I will copy this
code from somewhere else and that's how
you work on a project right you don't
have to type everything by yourself you
should take help so as you can see the
question controller was using Ottawa had
questions ow the same thing will be done
in code controller so what I will do is
I will say a code cow
we code now then C tau equal to or not
equal to but I want to write under it
Auto odd so that I will get that stuff
so I will skip I will get I will get
this object which is code ow
okay now this seems good now once you've
got this object what you can do is you
can fetch we can actually fetch the data
now okay now how do we do that okay so
once we got the code let's say it will
return the code I will say code C equal
to C Dao dot get code and we'll pass the
name so what about whatever name we have
it is seen him in this case I will pass
that and what what I will get is a code
right so in the MV object I will say add
object and I will pass the object as
code and we are passing C right so we
are passing C and that's it so when you
call this VSP we will get this code
there but then question arise will it
work
okay so sure of calling first ensure
first following JSP I just want to check
if everything is working or not
so what I will do is I will print the
code here itself so it's the system dot
out dot println and I will print it code
as well so that is in the console we'll
get something right so that's the first
issue we have the second issue is in the
code where's the code now or we have not
created the code eh okay so I guess it
is importing the wrong package here as
well
this is importing a wrong package and
that's why you have to be when you focus
on your on your imports right because
inputting my wrong package whatever you
do is have a creative code base as well
so I will right click here I will say
new a class and this class will be a
code class okay by the time I am tapping
all this code you can use the chat
window and let me know if you are
getting something on that thing because
I know that every lot of few people are
new to this session so make sure you
watch the earlier videos as well because
that those videos are very very
important ok so I already have a code
page here already have a code code code
like that's we had write code codes and
since we are using hibernate I am using
identity and I'm using @id okay we could
require our skills it as well
okay I don't even know if everything is
everyone is there I can see 23 people
are watching this and 48 likes I know if
you are really watching this okay so you
got a code here and I will go back to my
code controller and now let's import the
package I was a control shift oh and now
can you see that it is importing the
code so earlier it was inputting a wrong
package so that was our bad right
we got code as well so what I will do is
as you can see we got to string method
as well so instead of getting Jace we
first witness I just want to verify
whether it is everything is working now
sometime you know in spring a Missy
project
you do get some problems the best way is
to clean your project before running
again you can write it on this code but
most of the time it gives you that cache
a problem you know you already have this
project and something is not working so
it's best to you know clean the project
before what before running it okay so
the project is clean now and let me just
go to the browser to just to verify with
everything everything is working on this
one the chrome one okay where is that so
I will say right like because I have
multiple code window open here okay so
as you can see if I lick wish for code
or Astrium now and this time we got an
error
it says onion satisfied dependency
expressed for OCD so see Dao is not able
to find it okay that's weird why it is
not able to find seed out because maybe
on this seed ow
or we still have error here okay
it was still better and that's why it
was giving you the problem now I guess
there's no error
I hope why are you still showing an
error there
okay add or edit go away come again
another - okay where's the arrow mm-hmm
okay look just let me explain this
project once again because this is the
problem you know in Java voice you you
do have others but you don't get others
and we don't have arrows you get the
arrows
okay so I'm cleaning this project now
and let's see how that works
let's make just go back to my plane and
say run I hope it will work this time
oh yeah can see that it worked it is
also asking for the cname okay I failed
to specify seen him there so I'm going
to do is I would say C name a code dot
HTM C name equal to time and I will use
encapsulation because I know that I do
have this data in the database I will
say enter and this time you can see it
is giving you error which is code dot
JSP of course wide we don't we have not
get to that page yet so of course it
will give you the exception it will give
you four not four but what I want to
verify is in the console window
advocating output yes can see that we
got the C name we got the code where you
have this CID as 55 you got the C name
as encapsulation you got the description
as well the only thing which you have to
do now is you have to display this on
the screen on the JSP right oh how can
we do that now first of all we need a JC
page so instead of killing that entire
okay I do have a JC page which is
already created I don't know if their
CSS will work or not because as you know
I'm damn good with HTML and that's the
other knee I don't know HTML bit okay so
what I will do is I will copy this code
in fact I already have a JSP code
available with me which is the design
from the old project so okay so I will
just copy that
let me just do that so I'm copying the
entire JC page which is already lengthy
page I will tell you the important point
and important links from that okay don't
worry if you want this code this project
will be uploaded on github in one or two
hours
so you can you can you can pull the
budget from there okay I better learn
the code or so the JSP which I'm copying
now actually has lots of boilerplate
codes in it so let me just create that
JSP I will say I want to get a coat or
JSP and I'll be doing that well I have
all the JSP so that is in my behind a
file and the page I want to create now
is your JC page and this would be code
the JSP stop typing everything I will
say simply select all and paste as you
can see we already have a DC page here
okay I will do it on the code and okay
which is this code page that's weird I
don't know what what I have pasted here
okay let's run this clip nice run this
let's see what happens I will go back to
microtome and let's say enter again okay
can you see that it was able to find the
code page and you also got the code here
right now this code is actually coming
from database example if I click on
palindrome it says error if I click on
encapsulation it says error so it is not
able to find the code okay the reason
for that is I guess I am using a wrong
link in the code okay let me let me go
through what is happening here okay just
close this one I show that what do we do
is time in let's let's ignore this
design so if you can help me with design
to send me the design here what do we do
is I will use the idea a JSP and here
itself I will print everything now the
way you can print that is by saying we
see ID
colon and with a dollar I want to print
the code a code dot I want to print what
I want to play and a function for our to
I want to have to enable that is real
ignored false yes because I am working
with
il now okay so we say code now so I want
to fetch the CID of the code like then I
want to fetch I want a new line
okay then I want to print the code okay
let's just verify this one if you can
just run if you can work with bears
everything will come for sure and then
we will print a be adhere the last one I
want to print I want to print the maybe
link okay so whatever they will print
video so it's a : and will print video
again you can just be spread out in a
good design even that will work right so
basically I'm working on the backend
part of it and I can this for this
module is actually very very cool very
easy to work with
is it video which I'm working with just
met with Mitch 25 if I go to code yes
it's video so as you can see it's video
so because we are fetching CID we are
fetching the code and we are fetching
the video nothing else I think it should
work it should work just go back to my
go back to my thing here and if I say
enter now ok as you can see it is able
to find everything we got the name it is
not able to find the URL that's we're
just not able to find the video front
for that link okay oh I should be using
iframe for that
oh okay so again the design issues
design issues are there but nothing
wrong with the code so it will work if
you are using iframe if you can't
display that in iframe
because the code which they are which we
have deployed on the server this thing
here is an iframe okay the the video
which is playing here that's where this
is a very old video of mine I guess this
video is this this video made in 2014 I
guess three years back I was happy when
I was having some hairs on my head so if
I say view page source okay and okay so
I'm using iframe there as you can see
I'm using iframe there so if I can't use
the same thing that it will work all
right I think I can do that so let me
just copy this I know will it will it
work with iframe as you know that I'm
very bad with HTML let's try this out
because I'm using an iframe and ensure
this link so this link will be replaced
by dollar symbols I will replace this
and okay that's weird
okay this will be dollar uh this will be
heard bout video I don't know we looked
work or not
let's try now let's go back there not
this one the beach and say Enter
I just don't she's not able to find that
link what's wrong with that
okay let's verify what exactly the link
which is coming there
oh the link is half oh that's the issue
then we are not getting the complete
link here like if there's something
wrong with the data let me just use some
other other thing so shelf using this
link
let me just fetch this one issue of two
numbers of course the disco will work I
want to fetch only this part of this so
it's a copy and let's go back there and
paste the cname ago oh there's something
wrong with the link I can I'll let you
let me figure it out what did problem
with the link again the code will be
uploaded on github there's something
wrong with the link which is which is
which is coming from database maybe I
just have wrong links in it database and
what's going wrong there I'm actually
printing that link in the console so
that I can verify
yeah we are getting link here but what's
wrong there oh it is it is only in you
know it is incomplete link oh there's
something already the database code here
okay so we'll figure it out is there
something wrong with the database
I guess the val-kill which we are using
is not there perfectly okay what I can
do is that's what I mean I can fetch the
video which is playing here so I will
say right like a copy embed code and I
was I will replace that with my actual
code here because if this can be fetched
from database
just have to replace this link with the
tub is vida whistling because there's
something wrong with it they'll be that
is link there and if I go back and if I
say run now again see that it is working
so that there's something wrong with the
link okay so we got we got cname record
CID we got the code I mean the code name
and then we are getting the link of the
video link as well right so that's how
you confess this again this was the
easiest module of all the other things
we are working in the future modules
we'll be working on how can you fetch
all the videos from the from the YouTube
that is bit challenging for me because
it's everything is designed with the
epic JavaScript and the after that will
be we are focusing on login registration
with the elf offspring security now
okay so spring security is an awesome
way of securing your web application
using login credentials so let's see how
that goes
again if you want to learn this I mean
if you want to be part of this live
session in future as well you should

want to be a pro in Java subscribe this
channel so that's it guys that's it from
this from this we have talked about okay
so I'm not sharing my sprin with you
