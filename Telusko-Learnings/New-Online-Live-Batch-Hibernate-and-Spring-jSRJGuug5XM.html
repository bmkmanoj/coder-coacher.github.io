someplace co-learning and finally we are
starting on a new batch again and at
this time we are going for a hybrid
night and string bands which is going to
start from 12:00 Jews it is tomorrow and
the time would be 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.
now why you should learn spring and
hibernate because this is the most
advanced framework or what you say when
you join a new company or when you want
to upgrade your skills this is one of
the technology which is you should know
in fact lots of protect lots of
companies nowadays they are working on
hyper night and spring projects in fact
it's the place where I do training they
ask for spring training they ask for - a
training so they want people who knows
all the things so so in spring basically
we'll be talking about spring food we'll
be talking about spring code which is by
default we had to take it we have spring
MVC AUP
and dress so if you know about lurch is
one of the most important API nowadays
and we can do that interesting as well
so we will see how to you how do you do
this using spring and we're also
learning about hibernate and JPA so you
can see the topic is only one return
here but then in this we have lots of
different topics
ok like we have how to do one tool how
to save theta how to retrieve data how
to provide conditions and all those
things so this is one of the advanced
frameworks which is available and we
doing this code and fee for this course
is ok so if you're going for hibernate
only which is running from tomorrow the
fees is six thousand inr which is six
rupees and if you're playing is for
paying in dollars it will be our two
dollars and for spring code I mean the
spring entire goes because these
transients will be ten thousand rupees
and one fish two dollars again there's a
discount there was a discount but then
it is closed now so there's discount for
student or if you are student you just
have to send your ID college ID as a pic
and you will be getting credible
dissolve the discount was there till 7
June but then since we still have some
seats left
in fact that we have CR to stress left
so what you can do is send a mail
totally squad training and we'll see how
we will provide you 10% discount a free
stop by today itself because the batch
is starting from tomorrow
because we are still going to finalize
the batch so send our meals now question
is how to register it's very easy
there is no point of a payment gateway
just go you
use payment PayPal or you can do bank
transfer if you think PayPal just send
this is the paper ID okay if you are
sending any if you're sending a
transaction make sure you add four
percent there because that was a PayPal
charges you otherwise you can go for
bank transfer but to get your bank
details you have to send a means to
political training at their gmail.com in
fact it's better to send out mailers
returning gmail.com before the situation
because we will help you with the
procedures we will help you with a if
