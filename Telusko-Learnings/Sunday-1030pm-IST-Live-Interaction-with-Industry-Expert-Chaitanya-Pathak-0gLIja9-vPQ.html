ready now if you observe this channel
the base technology for this for this
channel is Java right so whatever we are
talking about some valuated to java
light it may be AWS cloud computing it
may be may be spring framework hibernate
framework o we also have Android related
to Java we also have C programming for
Java right so once you learn C for C
program you can jump to Java so
somewhere the pace is Java now Java
deals with 2a to market one is consumer
market and enterprise market right and
release mostly for the consumer but then
if we talk about Java we have the
enterprise market as well right we have
Spring Framework hibernate framework
then AWS know the thing is when so let's
say if you watch my spring videos what
happens is so we can divide those
viewers or subscribers into three parts
the first part of subscriber is people
who have lots of experience in the
industry and they were working on
different technology now they shifted to
Spring Framework so the project which
they are working on it is on it is based
on spring so they might want to upgrade
their skills the second set of category
is you can say those are people who are
freshest or maybe just join the company
so let's say if you join a company and
then you realize okay now we have to
learn three framework because most of
the projects are based on spring in this
company so what you will do is so
proactively you will learn Spring
Framework the third categories is also
important which is students right so
let's say if you have done your
graduation now or you are doing a
graduation and you want to get into
company
so of course you will think okay what
you should be learning so that it will
be helpful for the interviews it will be
helpful to join a company and maybe it's
for you for that you're learning Spring
Framework now if you talk about the
first category which is people who have
experienced in industry and they're
learning spring the advantage they have
is they are nothing spring and they also
know how to implement it right because
they they can say the implementation I
mean thinking about the other stuff
let's say let's talk about Android
doesn't matter who learns Android you
can make your own application and you
can deploy it on the Play Store anyone
can use it right so you can really you
can really get that feel how to build a
project how to deploy it on the Play
Store and then people will use it what
about the Spring Framework what about
the AWS so to explain have this
advantage because they are working in
the camper
they know what is going to implement
right and they can see the real scenario
different servers our development
servers production servers because when
we use this term since spring training
worker hibernate framework we have dev
servers we have production servers we
also do testing so they know what they
are learning so it is that they have the
advantage if we talk about the freshers
they don't know they cannot take it not
to actually work on the project because
they are just joined the company and no
one will allow them to directly work on
the project right but at least they can
talk to their seniors right and that's
why we say create a good network in the
company so always improve your network
so you can talk to your seniors you can
learn different different things so
let's say if you are loving Spring
Framework you can talk to your seniors
okay and nothing this concept can be
implement do we really use this in our
project they will say yes or no or they
will guide you for the different
different module right what about what
about students now students are the most
confused people for reason one is
because they they are learning stuff
first of all they don't know what to
learn because they have not joined a
company and they don't know which
company they are going to join and then
which technology done even if they
decide ok let's learn Spring Framework
they are learning Spring Framework but
they don't know it's putting is just an
example ok so you can you can talk about
any example or any topic so when you
learn spring technology you're learning
you're only learning it you don't know
how to implement and way to implement
even if you know ok you can use AWS but
then in introduce itself we have so many
modules how would you know which one to
use right so so this this is the this is
the gap between the education system and
the company right
because in your college you don't learn
all those technologies even if you learn
you learn basics you don't learn the
exact implementation so that's why I was
thinking to build that gap of the
college knowledge and the industry
knowledge at least for students so this
series will be mostly for these students
so I am talking to different industry
people so that they can help you right
so the example I'm not a master of Ivy
technology I know every technology a bit
but then I'm not a master of most of the
technologies so what if I can so you can
you can ask your question so normally on
Sundays we could do live sessions so you
should have asking question to an urban
writer you can ask to someone some an
expert in from the industry right so I'm
talking to different people in the
industry if they can help
and luckily we got some awesome people
and they are ready to help you guys
right and thank you so much for these
people they are helping in fact I did
this before as well thanks to ABBA
Sheikh who has talked about database and
data data warehouse concepts thanks to
shut up who talked about Android and
with those videos I got so many comments
on YouTube and Facebook messages that
okay that session was helpful and they
asked some more questions right so to
answer those questions we I am taking
some experience from the industry now
interacting with lots of people so that
they can help me in this in this what
you say in this work and so tomorrow at
10:30 p.m. ist okay normally we go live
and the at 7:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. but
then of the person who is who is
becoming live tomorrow he is busy in the
in the evening time and he was available
after 10:30 so finally we got I got
thumbs some time slot from him and that
is 10:30 p.m. ist we were talking about
different industry things again he said
that the person name is Chaitanya and he
is one of my friend or you can say my my
guru there in one of the company and he
has experience of 15 years in the
industry as a developer he's also he's
also was a technology consultant for
some years and now he's having his own
startup I'm going to have his own
startup for the education sector so even
he believes that these the gap between
college and industry this is a very big
gap so so he will guide you to these
steps and if you have any question
related technology you know the common
question would be or what to learn what
are the famous things industry now and
if you want to choose one technology now
it's a path because that path is very
important let's say if I want to learn I
want to be a data scientist
what is the path if I want to be AI
person hot what should be the path if I
want to be a Android developer what
should be the path so he will guide you
on all those things so if you really
want to enjoy this session just let me
know in the like by clicking on the
video like button there and comment your
what comment your thoughts because
though your comments are very helpful
for me and do share this video with your
friends and we'll see you tomorrow at
10:30 p.m. we will be doing some some
sort of some this type of sessions more
in the future so that's the thank you so
