ready and in this video they started to
understand how can our method return the
instance of an interface I mean this
concept is quite simple but then once
you start working on this in advanced
part of Java or maybe in the collision
framework or JDBC sometimes we find it
difficult to understand in fact when I
was learning this for the first time I
was finding it difficult how can our
method returns an instance of an
interface the code which you can see on
screen these four cords are you might
have seen this in your code which you
write example if you work with JDBC we
use we use this thing
yeah when you work with JDBC we also use
create statement and we so when we work
with collection we work with a traitor
and if you have walked on hibernate
before so we use such in fact we there
so gate connection is a method here and
so this method get connection returns an
instance of connection and that is weird
right because see connect a connection
is the interface right and of course to
instantiate it we need a class and then
draw manager is to the class which
implements cut connections so how can
you create an instance of that same goes
with create statement created user
method and statement is an interface how
can we instantiate interface without the
implementation and of course same goes
for iterator because it right now
returns object of iterator interface and
we got built-in Factory which returns
the instance of such an Factory to
understand this concept what I will do
is I will go back to my code in fact I
have written some code here a playbill
code ok so as you can see we have a code
here of a small snippet where we have a
donna class we have a phone interface
and then we have a class here which is
called as bill computer shop now this is
my total shop by the way so so we are we
dealing computers right so let's let's
this will be quite interesting so maybe
we also sale mobile phones what if I
want to so let's say if you have an
object of bill computer of course right
it's a sharp right so of course we have
an object of that so let's get object of
beer computer shop here so we'll say
beer computer shop obj or maybe be LCS
equal to I would say neo BL computer so
that's some shop we got right now once I
got this object of
computer system by Bo come to shop I
want a beer computer to give me a phone
so I would say hey I want a phone so I
want object of p1 but then phones
interface right how can be LCS which is
object can return you the phone object
maybe I can use a method we just get
phone but unfortunately we don't have
any method in B LCS which returns phone
let's try let's try so what I'm going to
do is I will go back to be LCS and say
hey Bo see us I want a foreign object
this is public phone it returns a phone
object and I will say get phone but then
how can we return an object of phone now
there are multiple ways of doing this
the first way is by a grittier class
which implements phone so the idea here
is now if I go back to my notepad the
idea here is whenever you have a method
which returns the object of a interface
they just want to hide the
implementation because you know we have
this we always create this layer of
abstraction where you are concerned more
about the what it does not on how it
does so it's important what it does then
how it is how it is doing it so you are
trying to hide the implementation so you
are not sure is it by implementing a
class or by some other way but let's do
that let's see what how I can do that in
in the back ends I would say I will get
a class and I will say this class as
Samson and this Samsung implements a
phone because Oh Samson
build a phone right maybe I can say
Samsung s7 or s8 but let's have a
Samsung class and this Samsung class in
fact Samsung Galaxy will make more sense
right
maybe Samsung s7 will make more sense I
will say Samsung s7 implements phone
this Samsung s7 will implement both the
methods now it's compensated right so I
will say public call I will I will try
to point something I will say calling
and then the SMS as well so I would say
public void SMS and here I will say
sending right so we got these two
methods again the logic is not important
the methods what's important is I am
trying to implement the phone interface
now once we got the implementation I can
create an object of Samsung s7 as we
know we can create object of Samsung s7
we can say Samms
s-seven let's say SL itself equals your
new Samsung s7 here I can say s7 so we
can return s7 right so we can return as
seven now you might be thinking we want
object of phone right how can you return
s7 the thing is the Samsung Samsung
class implements phone so if you want a
phone you can actually return s7 a
example if you want to call someone and
if you don't have a phone with you and
your friend has s7 so would you say hey
I want you to seven to pol someone or
when you say give me a phone I want to
call someone of course we'd have four
normal things in a way of phone right
and now you can see it is working so
gate phone method returns an object of
phone this might be a static method or
non static method that's fine because if
you see the thing here this gate
connection is a static method belongs to
damage your class and all other here
they are non static methods right
because we are using objects to call
them so if I go back here so this s7
represents phone so this is one way of
creating the object here and then using
this phone I can call someone I can say
p1 dot call I can say P 1 dot SMS so
what you are concerned you are concerned
only about this stuff which is you have
a four interface and you are able to
call them who is giving you the object
someone else so B LCS is giving me the
phone and I'm just calling it and I'm
sending SMS let me run this code for you
I will say run as java application I'm
waiting for the console to get the
output as you can see we got the output
as calling and sending so this is one
way and again as I mentioned
implementation is not our concern we are
focusing only on phone and BL come to
shop now maybe beer come to shop have a
different way of implementing it maybe
they want to say phone maybe p1 equals
your new phone now you might be thinking
is it possible to instantiate a
interface of course not right we cannot
do that but then we have a concept of
inner classes so what we can also do is
we can define those methods as anonymous
inner class the important stuff here is
you are not concerned about the
implementation because
what we are getting is a interface
object that's it we are not concerned
about the internal implementation so it
might be using anonymous inner class it
might be with the help of separate class
it might be something some other way
right maybe there's a previous class and
they're just they are just sending you
the object of that labeled class which
implements the phone interface so what's
important here is you will be you'll be
coming across lots of things where you
are instantiating an interface with the
alwah methods so this is what is
happening behind the scene so don't
worry there is some class behind the
scene which is implementing your
interface and you are returning that
object of that interface of that object
class so that's what I wanted to convey
