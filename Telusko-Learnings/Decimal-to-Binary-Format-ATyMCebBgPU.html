number into binary format so for doing
that let's take a decimal number first
so let's say we have a number the number
is five okay and we all know the binary
format of 5 is 1 0 1 right now how to
get this 1 0 1 so you have to divide
this number 5 by 2 and every time you
have to get a mender okay so if I
convert this number 5 so I will get 1 0
1 so to achieve the same thing in
programming what we what we need is
first we have to find the remainders
right so we have to divide this number 5
so if we divide this number 5 you will
get a limited as 1 and the question will
be 2 right and then again you have to
divide that number 2 with 2 you will get
zeros of the Mendo this one and then you
have 2 you will get a question which is
1 and then here this asked number is 1
right so that's how you divide a number
so which is 1 to the 1 so here we have
it we have to first find the remainder
then we have to divide that number and
we have to append that right so to
achieve that we can do this with the
help of array then reversing the addi
then I'll be using here something called
a string buffer which will work which
will make our work very easy so I'm
using spring before as equal to new
string buffer and okay so we have to
break this number or divide this number
multiple times right so when I say and
let's say this number somewhere so I
would say so if I say n mod 2 so it will
give me so this number will give me 1
right and then I can I have to say I
have to remove that 5 I mean where would
you write that number by 5 so you have
to say n divided by 2 so I will
the resultant output alpha getting your
the new value of n will be 2 and then
again we have to say n mod 2 I'll be
getting 0 and then we have to repeat
this thing when until we are getting and
as 0 so to do the DP 2 tasks we have to
use a while loop in this value I will be
using a number n and this line while
loop will walk till my number is 0 okay
and every time I find a Finder window I
have to append it in a string and I will
say that number mod 2 ok now this will
just give me the window I have to also
find the question so I will say n equal
to n divided by 2
yeah so that's it that's how we will
getting this string but we also have to
reverse the string so before printing
let's yeah yeah
let's print it but when printing we have
to first reverse it ok and now if I run
this the size 1 0 1 simple right
but let's say the number is 16 so the
binary conversion for 16 is 1 and 4
zeros so if I run this you're emitting 1
and 4 zeros let's try 255 so the binary
for conversion of 2 5 is 8 once so if I
run this I will be getting 8 once simple
right so that's how you convert a
decimal number into binary format so
