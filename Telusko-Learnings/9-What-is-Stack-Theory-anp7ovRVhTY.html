ready and in this video we'll talk about
stack now what stack means now stack is
basically an ADP in data structures and
as you know ATT stands for abstract data
type so when you talk about apps on your
drive we only focus on the features it
provides but not the implementation now
in stack it provides you much more
features when I say features we have a
list of features like we can add an
event and normally when you want to add
element we use a temperance push you can
of you can delete the element using pop
so you can do that with Dell pop pop or
you can you cannot say delayed but you
can take out the element from the from
the stack and then you can also look for
the element so you can find an element
the first element and then you can do
that with help of peak again you will
understand this in detail later so we
can apply a push operation we can say
pop and we can say P stack it supports a
feature color sleeve for which is last
in first out which simply means whatever
element you have inserted last you can
access that first solely for stands for
last in first out so whatever element
you have added last you can access that
first to explain this we will be having
a stack here so the first element you
have inserted is the first you can take
out and in stack you have only one entry
point so you have only one entry and
exit point that means this is the only
entry and this is the only exit so this
one will remain closed you can apply a
lock here so this one will remains
closed the only place where you can
entry you can enter the values is from
one point from here and you can take it
out
so whatever item and you have inserted
last you can access that first but do we
use this on real world and the answer is
yes example let's say if you are working
on a task so let's say if you are
working on our projects of a big project
maybe that project is let's say a and
that project will maybe will take six
days so it will take six days to
complete this project and suddenly the
old project or the old version which is
already deployed in the server it is
giving you an error now you let's say
you got a bug now at that point what do
you think will you complete the entire a
project and then you will think about
the bug or you will try to fix the bug
first and of course write a bug is
something which our user is facing
nowadays so of course you have to face
the fix the bug first and then
have to think about the earlier task so
in this scenario you will try to fix
this bug that means you are keeping your
job
a aside and you're focusing on B now so
you started working on B and you thought
okay in next three to four hours I will
complete this B I will I will fix this
bug so you're keeping this task a aside
and you're working on B now and
certainly that this is your lunchtime
now so you are going for a lunch so
let's say this 1 p.m. and then you want
to have your lunch you're going for the
lunch now so let's say I start C so task
C is your lunch time and now you are
having your lunch so while you are
having your lunch of course you will not
be working on be the same time because
when you're having a lunch you should do
only one thing at a time you should have
your lunch so when you're working on
you're doing your lunch you will not be
working on B that means you have kept B
aside now once you complete your lunch
what do you think which is the first
task you will resume a or b it's B right
because this is a large task you have
left so when you say B this is what you
left last so last in first out so this
is what you will resume and once you
complete B then you will resume with
your a that is last in first out so the
last task which you are working is the
first thing you will you will resume now
do we use this in some other concept yes
example if you have a stack of books so
anyway you have a stack of books what
you do is the first book so you will
keep the first book here then second
book then third book and then fourth
book so once you keep all this book once
I mean once about other the first book
and even access is the last book you
have kept here right so this is how
yours so let's say if you have if you
have kept one more book here then this
is the last book you can access first
now this is the first this is a book you
can access first what about virtual
world so in virtual world as well you
know when you talk about the recent
applications so in Windows we say
alt-tab so when you say all tab it will
show all the applications which you are
working with so when I say all tab here
you can see this is the first applicant
is that this is the last access
application so you can see that first
which is paint then I got this recording
software which I have opened second last
and then I was walking on a notepad
that's the third so that's the third in
the least and before that I have opened
my my computer and before that I went to
Google or Chrome so this is the this is
this tag right so the last
axis element is coming it first here so
yes we use stack a lot of time in real
world and in virtual world as well so
let's try to understand how do we work
with elements so let's say I want to
store this four elements here we got
five we got eight we got three and
regard to so I want to insert this
values in a in a stack so what we do is
we create a stack here and again if you
want to insert the value we we will use
push so using push you can insert the
value using pop you can get the value
the last value and using fine if you
don't want to delete D value from the
stack you just want to see the value we
can use peek question is how do we
implement this in fact you'll be saying
the implementation later but then there
are multiple ways of implementing this
we have the array way so you can
implement that with the help of a D in
fact in a day as well we can go for
fixed length array then we can go for
dynamic length array or then we can also
go for linked list so we have different
implementation so we can go with the
idea implementation using fixed or
dynamic length we can go for a linked
list but doesn't matter what you go for
let's say if you talk about a D so let's
say if I create an array of four
elements here all right so we got in an
array of four elements and this is next
value 0 index value 1 index for a 2
index for 3 now how will you insert the
value so this is the only entry point
and this is the only exit point right so
if you want to enter the values you will
be using a method called as push or the
function call as push in this push you
will pass the value so whatever you are
going to pass let's see if I say I I
will represent 5 or 8 or 3 or 2 whatever
you pass so once you pass a value here
that value will be assigned to 0 so
let's say we got 5 here then when you
say 8 8 will be assigned here now once
you insert it this 2 value or maybe let
let's say add 3 as well so we got 3 here
now which is the last element you can
access so if you have entered 3 this is
the last element you can access but how
do you know which is the last tournament
so you can simply use a variable called
as top not top will have the top will
have an index value of this isn't
element so index money too we have
Elementary this is the top element and
when you start to now it will - will go
here simple right now how about if I say
pop so when you say push everything
going in this tag by say 5 8 3 2 so the
value will go down and then
you say pop it will remove the first
element because when you say you have
inserted two this is where your
representative is representing your top
right is it the top top most element so
this is the element which will remove
first so when you say pop it will remove
it will move this - and let's save after
that if alien setting 12 so let's say
after that you but after saying pop even
inserting 12 so 12 well come here
because that's the last element you can
access so again that will be go back to
- yeah when you delete this element -
before it will go back to 3 okay that
done the top variable will go back to
the index number 2 which is 3 in this
case so this is how you you push and you
pop so the last element which is added
is the first thing you can you have an
axis so when you say pop it will delete
the element it will give you the element
I need to delete the element from the
stack but what if you don't want to
delete the element you can simply use
find and use it to use fine if we
normally use a function named as peek
so when you say peek at this point it
will give you 12 pretty cool right now
let's say once you have inserted all
these values indeed in the stack and the
stack is full right because the size of
this tag was 4 we can make it dynamic we
can use link list but let's see if I'm
using a fixed length array so if you're
using a fixed length added here and if
you have increase if you have cross the
limit of your stack which is 4 in this
case if I try to add one more element
select so at the end here if I try to
add an element which is 1 now the moment
you say 1 if you try to add 1 it will
give you an error and that error is
overflow error because you are trying to
order flow this tag that's one one one
case so if you try to push the value and
if your size is full it will give you
overflow error what if you try to delete
the element if you try to pop and your
stack is empty let's say if you don't
have any element here so if a stack is
empty and if you try to fetch value at
this point it will give you another
error so if your stack is empty and
you're trying to pop it will give you
error which is underflow error so under
flow is when you when you don't have the
value and try to pop the value - from it
so that's how you have overflow and
underflow concept though those are
errors basically and there's one more
thing here with this push pop and peek
we can use some other methods as well as
functions as well example we can get the
size of the size of the stack using size
method you can also check if the stack
is empty with the alpha
is empty function so again you can
implement whatever methods you want but
these are the basic ones for stag I hope
you enjoyed this session in let me know
in the comment section if you have any
question you can do that you can put
that in comment area as well so thanks
so much watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
