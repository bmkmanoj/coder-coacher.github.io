ready from 30 school earthlings and in
this video we are going to talk about
hibernate now when you talk about
hibernate it's a o RM tool which is used
for persistent data
now again just to understand those terms
let me give an example here now we are
living in a world where you make
different software's right and we can
build all these softwares with the help
of a language right one of the language
which me normally use to make
applications is Java right and when you
make a software that software will be
working with data of course now that
data can be a normal variable or it can
be objects so when you say normal
variable I'm talking about primitive
values let's say ain't flow to string
and string but in float a double all
those values are you might be having
your data in the object format and when
I say object format let's say you have a
student object maybe you have an
employee object and every object will
have some data example let's say I have
a class here so I have a class here and
the class name is let's say student and
in this student class I have certain
variables let's say I have a roll number
then we'll be having a name and let's
say we have marks so in this student
class we have these three fields we have
name we have roll number name and marks
now if I create object of student it
will be having three very we will be
having three variables wide which is no
name roll number and marks so that will
be one object so if I create object of
student now it will be having three
values I want to make sure that those
values are getting stored somewhere
because let's say if you talk about your
bank account so when you when you
deposit money in your bank and that data
is stored somewhere right that you have
deposit ten thousand dollars let's say
if one day your bank says hey I don't
know
we lost our database we lost our date we
lost all your data I mean will you you
will not be happy right so of course
whenever you work with data you want to
shoot it somewhere and that somewhere is
your database now this database can be
anything it can be masculine be Oracle
it can be ask your server may be poor
schools may be Adobe
different DBMS to work with right so we
use database so that we can store data
and that concept of storing data is
called as persistence right because by
default when you talk about variables
those are transient which means we
normally don't store data in the inside
database directly so what we do is we
use we create variables we create
objects and those are temporary data if
you want to store that data we need to
use databases right any of this not
anomaly to connect your java application
with database we use a concept of j DB c
which stands for java database
connectivity right so we use JDBC to
connect your java application with
database and the moment you say you are
walking with JDBC and we have a database
so for sure we need to use something
called as SQL language right and not
everyone is comfortable with SQL in fact
people who only learn Java they might
not be comfortable with SQL and and the
moment you say hey you want to work with
database now you need to know SQL so we
wanted a solution where you can store
the data into database but without using
SQL I I mean as a programmer I don't
want to use ask your query does the
first concern the second one is if I
have an object which is let's say if I
have an object which is obj and this obj
object is of student which will have
three values
I mean roll number less row number one
the name let's say Naveen and let's say
marks equal to 80 I want to store this
mass into database right or this this
data into database so to work with SQL I
mean I hope your family of a JDBC what
we normally do is we write an SQL query
of course in JDBC up to four seven steps
and then we have to write SQL query we
have to say insert into student then
values and then we will we'll provide
the values here right so again we have
to write SQL query what if what if in
Java if you have this object obj here if
you can directly store the data inside
database simply by saying hey
hey framework or any framework save my
object that's it the moment you say save
obj your work is done
what if you have a student object and if
you are saying save obj and that data is
getting stored inside database your job
is done right but how it's possible can
be stored an object into database
directly because normally when you say
gee database I'm actually talking about
our DB M s time of databases which is
relational databases where you have rows
and columns how can you convert an
object into table now for that you have
to understand a concept of o R M which
stands for object relational mapping
okay so we will be having an object will
be having we will be having relational
which is your tables and then you have
to map it now how it is possible now if
you talk about the class structure now
this class structure is same as table
structure right example if I create a
table structure here so let us say we
have a table structure here and in this
table what we have is so this this is
your student table and and this will be
having three three columns the first
column is the roll number the second
column is the name and the third column
is the marks right so we have these
three columns so this table this class
so this class represents your table
right and the object let's say we have
the first object as obj1 so this obj one
will be your first row let's say we have
one more object which is obj - now let
me just do that here we'll say obj - and
it will have let's say - then we'll be
having name as let's say Aarthi and
let's say marks is 90 here so that will
be your second row so if you have five
objects you have five rows so one class
is one table so class is the table your
objects is your rows so if you have five
objects will be having five roles right
that means we are trying to create a
relationship between the object-oriented
programming concepts and the relational
database system and that is possible
with the help of Oh
M which is object so that is your Java
concepts relational that is your
database concepts and we have to map it
okay again it doesn't it's not that
simple the way it clips on the paper but
this is what o R M means so the problem
is
o R M is just a concept how can you
implement ORM so to implement ORM we
need to use some tools which is ORM
tools and one of the tool of ORM is your
hibernate again hibernate is not the
only tool we have we have I Bettis then
we have what know we have JPA which is
the standards and then we can also use
one of the tools from or from Oracle
which is toplink
ok so we have I by tens we have toppling
we have hibernate so this are your ORM
tools right so using hibernate what you
can do is you can store your objects
into database directly with the help of
saved method ok
now question arises how do we use a save
method is very simple to use save method
we need to create an object of session
ok so we can say session object which
let's say s so session object is s so we
can say s dot save ok but hold on how do
we create session for that we need to
create object of session factory because
using session factory we can we can
creep we can create sessions and in
session factory you have to provide
those details the complication for your
database example when you work with JDBC
you might remember that we use vu second
steps right we have to provide the
driver name you have to specify the URL
right so you have to configure all those
things with the help of session factory
again there are multiple ways of
configurations we can use XML way of
configuration we can use Java
configuration way by the different ways
we can do that so we can we have XML we
have Java configuration right so we have
to provide your driver name we have to
provide your your database of your
database URL which is the connection
string you have to provide username and
password in
configuration file so that you can load
that inside the session factory object
and once you call session factory object
we can work with session and using
session we can save the object not just
saving we can also use we can also use
get method to fetch the value to fetch
the data right so we have saved we have
get method so we can use all this
concept to implement hibernate and trust
MIT is one of the awesome tool available
which is ORM and again om is not just
you know a technology which is which
which came accidentally it was well
planned so if you want if you are making
an application where you want to pass
this data this is something which you
can actually use okay again in the next
video we'll be talking about the
practical implementation of this how
exactly it works so I hope you have
liked this session make sure you go to
my channel or subscribe the channel and
like this video if you liked it and
that's it that's about hibernate basics
see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
