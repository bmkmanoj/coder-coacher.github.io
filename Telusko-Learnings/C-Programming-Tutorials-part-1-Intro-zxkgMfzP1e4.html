now so before starting with C
programming tutorials we'll see why we
require programming C in this world of
IT all computers there is something
called a software what exactly software
means is it reduces human work when you
say it reduces human work is something
like this let's say if I open a
calculator so let's say you want to add
two numbers so what we can do is we can
take this two numbers we can say 2 plus
or 3 plus 5 is equal to 8 right so if
you want to this calculation which is 3
plus 5 which is 8 so we can use a
calculator now you will say what's a big
deal I can do those operations in my
brain yes you can
but the problem arise when you want to
add two numbers like let's say 365 plus
9 foot 9 for 54 when you can do that
right you can do some it will take some
time for you maybe two or three seconds
to add these two numbers but the problem
goes up when you when you multiply to a
number which is let's say 654 into 652
and this is your number again you will
say we have Vedic maths right but you
cannot do scientific equations now so
let's say we have a scientific
calculator so can you perform all these
operations unfortunately you can but not
on this part it will take some time for
you to calculate and we don't have time
to do that right and that's why software
helps now how to create this off and
let's say you want to create your own
calculator it's a small task but
senate's you want to go to an calculator
what you need you need a programming
using which you can create this GUI and
you have to write some logic the
programming should provide you some
inbuilt features so that you can do all
these operations right and there are
lots of programming language we have see
we have C++ we have Java we have C sharp
now using one of these languages you can
create this create this calculator so
where to start the problem is when you
start with any programming language
let's say it is Java now Java has
lots of features so when you learn a new
programming you have to learn syntax
plus you have to learn semantics Java
has lots of concept to learn it has a
huge amount of theory of oops concept it
has lots of keywords so it's a bit
difficult to start with Java is your
first language so where to start so if
you are new to programming the best way
is to start with C programming again C
is called as mother of all the languages
it's simply because it has almost every
feature and it's simple trust me
C is simple okay so before starting with
Java or any high level programming I
will recommend start with C programming
now those who are watching this video
only to learn C programming this is the
way you have to start so let's close
this calculator and let's try to create
this type of calculator which is this
GUI calculating C programming oh but
hold on hold on we cannot create the
exact Gy in C is because C basically
works with 16-bit computing and I'm
using Windows 7 which uses maybe visual
C++ or this is 64-bit computing so I'm
not saying using C program you can make
this type of kalsye but you can make a
can see which will work in the same way
but not look in the same way it might
look different now when I say it might
look different it might be now this is
GUI C might give you CLI and it will
give you see a line now what exactly CLI
means something in this way so this is
your CLI mode again this is a wide
pattern normally CLI means black one so
if you know if you use normal command
prompt so normally you get a black
background and white text so that means
you have to add two numbers here ok so
you have to create a software for adding
two numbers and you have to use this
screen ok I know you will say when when
we have this calculator why we require
our own code is just for practice
to create big application you have to
start somewhere and that somewhere is
going for small small codes
okay so let's start with the C
programming now to work with C
programming the first software you need
with you is turbo C++ again we have lots
of ideas for this we can use NetBeans
like we have NetBeans we have to go you
have to configure your NetBeans to work
with CEAP a cnc plus plus then we have
turbo c++ then we have this size gene
then we have unix prom if you have lots
of software you can run your C code
basically I'm going for turbo C++
because lots of people are familiar with
this this software unfortunately default
CC application will not work on Windows
8 or Windows 7 it's because that
application is 16-bit and Windows 7 has
stopped the support of 16 become a
16-bit software so what you can do you
can use some modified version of turbo
C++ again there there are lots of bugs
in there in those software's but wait to
manage so let's open the software now
this is the software and this is your
first code okay now what this code means
if you don't know it's okay we'll see
every Chan every thing in detail now so
first step you have to create a new file
so we click on file and say new now once
you click on new file it will create a
blank screen where you can type your
code and then once you typed your code
you have to compile this
so to compile there's a menu here you
can press and compile click on compile
and say compile this will give you this
prompt it will show you some information
most important part is warnings and
errors now as a programmer we don't care
about warnings if you only care about
errors so we don't have any other you
and say enter so no and let's run this
so when you say there's a menu products
run here and you can click on run as you
know as you can see the shortcut for run
is control f9 so we can diagram as a
control f9 so when I click on run and
the output is this this again the
current output is just this last hello
the previous the thing you are saying
here is the previous output why we have
that output that we'll see later but you
got the output called as hello now
those to learn how to start with C
programming or to understand what
exactly c programming means we'll we'll
continue that part in the next tutorial
so do subscribe and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
