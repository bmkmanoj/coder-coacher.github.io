and how exactly we store data of
different types like we have we can
store numbers we can store strings we
can store even when we can have a list
with different type of values but at
example we have that we have done that
here right so when I say 4/6 true and
the way in you can see that is the type
of this is any right we have talked
about the hierarchy what we'll do in
this video is we'll talk about least
again but distrub going for primitive or
the inbuilt type of objects let's have
our own objects for something more calm
more complex objects in list so how to
achieve that so what we'll do is we'll
say well we'll say students so I think I
need at least option now and for that I
need to create a class right because you
can create an object of a student only
when you have a class of it
so normally how do we create a class we
say click case class and then we
mentioned the class name which is let's
say stood and in this stood I will pass
I will pass three three parameters as so
we can also create a constructor here
right so we can see my first value is
roll number and the type of roll number
is let's say int then the next one is
name which should be string and let's
say maths which is again in so we have
this we have this class which has the
name is stood and then we have these
three three types there and now let me
just remove that so just to see the
output is we are getting the class there
once we get that we can go ahead and yes
we've got we got our class now let's
create the object of it so we'll say Val
and we'll simply say students and then
equal to so let's create a list of so at
least and in this list advocate the
first object of student I would say
stood I will pass multiple value since
this is at least right when you have to
specify multiple values some will say
well number one name is let's say Naveen
and the marks I will assign is 40 that's
my first object let's say the next
object is student will say this is two
that's two will say nay
is Buju and then we got marks as let's
say 80 that's - the marks let's go for
one more
we just stood three of Nadeem and we'll
say this is 60 that's it that's our
that's our lease and you can see one
side on this code I mean once I save
this code you can see we got a list of
students here so this list is of type
stood right so we have the three objects
here okay again if you're not getting
this this thing that's okay we will be
doing so we'll do the same thing in Java
once we done with this example so you
will get the complete idea how list
works in in Scala so we have this we
have the desktop student here and now we
can perform such a certain actions right
now before before performing some action
here let me let me see how to do this in
in Java so it may come let me go back to
my java code which is this is Java code
yours and let me create a class here the
same class which we which we were doing
there let's create our student class in
fact we have a student class here let's
do some modification we do have three
that we have we do have three things so
everything is done here I mean we
already have a class let me remove this
thing in fact we have that part right so
now what we'll do is we'll simply say
this is list of with the list of student
that's how you do it in Java right we
have to create a collection
we'll say S on it say students or
students equal to we say new or week and
I agree use add a list oh let's do that
let's say a new analyst and so we got
that record this list object here now
once we caught that let's add some
objects here so we'll say students not
add new student by passing three values
we'll say one the same value which is
Naveen and then we'll say this is 40
that's my first object then we can add
two more objects here we can say this is
2 this is 3 this is Pooja
and this is Nadine now this is 80 and
this is 60 so once we got these three
objects let's run let's print all the
values here so it's the student as :
students that's how you print the values
right using a nice for loop and we can
say as we can simply print the object
itself right if I run this code and you
can see we got the output Oh
unfortunately I don't have to string
method here let me do that let me say
right like so to string I want to print
all the values I hope your family with
two string method and if I run this code
now you can see we got the record all
the values here now if you compile
we have the same values here right we
have the same output there but down the
differences we have tried multiple lines
of code here and we just have one line
of code in Scala okay now once we got
the list of objects what are the what
are the features we can we can achieve
here
so let's say in this in this list if I
want to print only one there are lots of
code you have to write right you have to
use s dot students dot get and you have
to specify the first index number in
Scala what you can't do is you can say
well first equal to students dot so this
is a method Palace header but as soon as
you say not method yeah there's a method
has had as soon as you say head it will
give you the first element because this
is the first element right so when you
say head it will give the first element
any guess if I say if I say students
start tail so we have one more method
which is tail so your guess is right
instead of getting the first one while
getting everything so when you say head
he will get the first one when you say
tail it will give you all the remaining
elements now again if you say we can
also do that we can say tail dot tail so
till dog tail will give you the tail of
the tail so it will give the last value
itself is it working here so we got the
last value we can also achieve
tail dot head which will give you the
tails first object or the first element
which is the second one
right so this is still right this is
tail and head out of it is this one so
we can use this one also
right so we can use this head we can we
can use head and tail as a function as a
method I mean there are lots of methods
we can we can work with now what else we
have we also have some method like let's
say let me get a Val and we say I want
only top world so I want when you say
tapas I mean those people who are
getting marks about 60 or more okay once
I mean about 60 60 and 60 and more 60
and on okay so what we'll do now is I
want to only those people who are about
60 or 60 about 60 what we'll do is this
students list it has unmetabolized
filter okay so when you say filter what
you can do is in this filter you just
have to pass the condition now basically
how do you pass a condition I can simply
say s arrow and we'll say s dot marks
should be greater than equal to 60 some
specific condition here okay again we'll
see this in Java how how this works in
Java so you can see we got we got least
we got 20 I mean we got 80 and we got 60
right so when you say filter based on
the marks you are getting you are
getting these two things we are not
getting the first one which is 40
because it is not satisfying the
condition right if you do the same thing
in Java and this further we have to say
if s dot marks is greater than equal to
60 then only print alright so it will
print on it those objects which are
satisfying the condition the same thing
you can achieve with the help of filter
method so in this filter you have to
pass the object so it will take one one
object and it will sense from the
condition still if you are not happy
with this let me explain this with the
help of Java 8 concept okay let me just
do that here so how this works in Java 8
is we have to say students dot filter so
this abysm first of all there is a
student's dodge dream ok stream dot
filter in fact we have built a in Java
also so it was introduced in Java 1.8 it
was not there earlier okay so in in
Scala we can use filter even in
we can use filter but only in Java 8 it
is not possible before that and ok so
this is one way this is one way which we
have done this is the this is the impair
- type of coding which we can done in
Java 7 also in Java 8 what we can do is
so when you say filter so filter will
ask you so if I go to filter method
which is which launch stream it is
asking you for the object of predicate
so I need to pass object of predicate
right so predicate is basically an
interface so if I go to predicate there
okay if you want the complete
description how that works in simple
step you can go to my I will go to
description area there's a link for the
for how this particular ready to
interface works so just you will get
that idea from there so it has a method
test in this interface so we have to say
new predicate for students and let's
define the class itself here but this is
anonymous class which I'm creating here
let me import the package predicate and
the method name is public boolean test
which accepts is it boolean yes it is
boolean and will say this is test which
accepts the integer value or this this
will accept a string or student value
and we'll check if s dot marks is
greater than equal to or greater than
equal to 60 return true as return false
okay so we got this stream and I can
print all the values of stream by saying
for each and we can pass and we have
done with Follis right so you know how
it works so I can say s :
system dot out dot print oh that's not
right the system dot out dot print Ellen
this is not working here system dot out
dot Ellen and we can pass the value
which is s itself okay so now what I'm
doing is I'm I'm finding this stream out
of it I am filtering out all the
elements based so
we have to pass the object of predicate
again you will find the link in
description area
how exactly predicates works it takes
the method as a definition and you can
print all the values so you can see even
that works the same way so you can see
this output is because of the predicate
now since predicate is a is a function
interface you can see it's a function
interface and if anybody have a function
interface we can use lambda what is
simply means is you don't have to
mention from here to here I'm just
assuming that you know lambda expression
if you don't just go to my channel again
I will fire I will paste the link there
in the description how lambda expression
works and in fact we can show fighting
the eath condition where there we can
simply say even this will work right
return s dot marks greater than equal to
60 okay and since you have only one
statement we don't require return we
don't require these curly brackets if
you have only one statement that you can
write everything in one line but a why
did you have an arrow there so in Java
we use single arrow right so this is the
same thing we are doing it right we are
saying let me just write here so that's
the same thing we are doing so if you on
this code you are getting the same
output so we are filtering and we are
passing the object of I mean which I've
got pass in the lambda expression
so in Java lambda expression is done
with the help of single line I mean -
arrow or - Garrigan sign in scala
videos equal to anger than sign okay so
we can we can use filter in fact we can
also do partition based on this we can
say Val we can say watch how do we do
partition here okay so we can say so
what I want partition is I want people
so person host code below 60 there
should be 1 partition when if you are
scrolling about 60 that should be one
partition
let me add one more object just to give
you more glimpse out of it well say this
is student 4 and this will be let's say
Mohini
and let's it is 70 okay so we got we got
two people with I mean let's
that's a 50 so we got two people below
below 60 and we got two people about 60
right so we can create a partition here
we'll say this is parts equal to student
start partition so we have one more
method which is partition so have to
specify the condition here on which
basis here you want to find the
partition so I can specify the condition
there I can say for student I can if we
can we can use lambda expression and we
can say student dot marks again the same
thing dot 16 now this path will give you
all the values but in a two particular
partition you can see we are getting a
partition of two values because think we
are getting one list comma second list
so the value of the first list is from
here to here that's your first list and
this is your second list so that's how
you create that's how we create a
partition in Scala okay so we can use
partition method which is which is in
build method so there are lots of
inbuilt features available in Scala as
you can see so we are they are working
more on these stuff I mean corrections
in Scala just to give just to get the
power of it so that's it that's it from
this video we have talked about lots of
lots of stuff we have talked about how
to create a list of complex objects how
do we use head how do we use tail how do
we use filter how do this partition so
that's it that's it from this video in
the next video we'll talk about some
advanced stuff so thank you so much for
