we'll talk about the content grammar for
XML so in the earlier video we have
talked about this structure grammar
droid which is your DDD so in this video
we talk about content grammar so you
know how to work with content grammar we
have to create a schema so how to do
that let's create the thing is using
schema you can also write this structure
grammar
so using degree you can only write
structure grammar but using schema you
can write both the structure and the
quantum grammar now how to create our
struck this schema right click on your
project go to others and search for XML
schema file and then here you have to
mention the file link will say the the
file name is a alien schema dot and it's
compulsory to have this extension which
is X SD which stands for XML schema
definition and if I click on finish we
got a xst file here ok and you can see
we have two things we have elements and
we have types so how do you find a type
first so we have to go to source now you
can see this is your XML schema let me
just expand this ok and we'll take
everything on new line so we'll take all
this thing on new line ok so once we got
these three lines let's focus on the
types so any before goes before going
forward let us talk about this XML NS
this n S stands for namespace now when
you were to talk about XML so we have
two things one is you are I and the
prefix for the namespace so we have to
save prefix so what is URI
so let's say your definition is stored
on the internet and you know when you
when you want to fetch something from
the internet we use you are L which is
Uniform Resource locator right but this
time the definition of your tags is
there in the system so we use URI which
is Uniform Resource identifier ok and
then we have prefix which is also let 70
where you want to work with namespace
this is your namespace here to access
this namespace we have to use a prefix
in this case this is TNS which is a the
target namespace okay so this is the
namespace you are using and this is the
namespace you're creating a target
namespace so I will specify namespace
here so instead of saying XML example
dot o-r-g I will take a unique service a
telescope calm and even here we have to
mention it as the just code calm that's
my website and now what next now when I
want to define the rules or the grammars
for the XML we have we have two types of
we have two types one is simple simple
type and then second is complex type so
when you define the element in which you
have an element example in this scenario
we have an element inside that element
we have one more element it is complex
but let's say when you create a single
element it becomes a simple type so
since we have to start with complex so
we say complex type or we can specify
any name here so let's say I am saying
alien type here or aliens type to be to
be specific service aliens type so does
the complex type here we define and then
inside this complex type will be having
different elements right or we have
basically we have one which is alien so
we have to first provide this sequence
tag so it has a child tag for complex
and inside this sequence you can specify
your elements so inside this aliens you
have only one element which is alien
right so we'll say this is element name
and the name of the element is alien I
don't know why I type it T at the end
and then we have to specify the type so
the type here will be string or not
string it will be of type alien it will
be of type agent type right again we
have to define alien type so this alien
type okay so we have to define alien
type first okay then we'll say close now
to make it work so to make it work we
have to create a one more complex type
which will be having alien type so that
was
it was aliens type which is the route
diagonally are defined for alien tag and
inside this alien type we have to
mention or first you have to mention
this sequence so that is this sequence
here and then after the sequence we have
to mention the elements so inside this
alien element we have name and salary
right so here we specify element name
and then you have to mention the name
which is let's say in this case we'll
say it is name itself and the type of
data is string so in turbo course we can
mention string right so that's element
type so that's name type and then the
second one is for salary so we'll say
name equal to salary and the type of
salary here okay let me just remove this
the type of salary here is integer right
so that's so that's integer I guess
there is only error
okay so it type is integer here okay
okay this know watch the issue of salary
type is missing okay so now that's that
salary with integer now once we got this
agent type so this alien type will refer
to this alien type right but is an error
okay let's see what's the error it says
either resolving the component so for
that we have to mention the namespace
prefix that is TNS so this TNS you have
to mention here that means this alien
type is belongs to TR s okay now once we
got that let's go ahead now then the
next thing we have to specify is the
attribute right so once we have
specified the aliens alien then we have
specified name and salary
now let's specify the attribute now to
specify the attribute or to specify the
attribute for the alien so we have to
specify the attribute a ID for this
alien type right so you have to specify
an attribute here so we say attribute
tag and inside this attribute tag you
have to mention the name for
we'll say the name is a ID which is
alien ID and then you have to specify
the type of the ID which is yeah as we
have seen in the DTD
so the type of ID will be ID itself and
then we specify the require so we say
use and we can specify the use as
required optional or prohibited this say
this is required this composite to have
an attribute okay I think that's enough
that's that's all they specify that
those are things we have to mention here
okay so that's that's how you specify
these rules so we are specified the
element it's of type string so the name
will be in type string it it will be in
integer but how to apply this rule C R
because we have we are following the
rules of DT D in this file right so what
we'll do is we'll create 100 files which
will fall the rules for access we will
say others XML file and this time we
will not say finish directly we'll say
this is new alien dot XML and we'll say
next now here we have to select we have
to we want to create a XML file using
the XML schema file we'll click on next
and we'll click on OK here we have to
select the file which is x SD v which is
alien schema will say next and it will
ask you for the root element right
because you want to make sure that your
root element refers to this file and if
you expand it you can see there is no
root element and there's an error though
to tell them it exists since this schema
provides provided has no global elements
that means whenever you want to work
with xsj we have to provide a global
element then question arise how to
create that global element it's very
simple just say element name and we'll
say this is a so this is global alien
that sounds we all right it's global
alien I don't know again either I think
because I got this habit of typing
client client every time because that
client we have the same spelling with
the with T right so we have say global
aliens and then we'll say type equal to
so the type of this aliens is TN s :
Aryan type right so we have to use this
aliens type here and that is the end
okay so you have to we have to create a
global element in this way now if I do
the same steps if I say new XML here you
have to mention this schema file will
say next and will mention this as new
aliens dot XML oh I am creating a scheme
and for a by D so let me create so it is
wrong file will say others XML we have
to create a normal file click on next
my name this as file is new alien dot
XML Oh say alien store XML and will
click on next okay just roll down I just
got some okay so we click on next we
click on schema here will say next and
here we have to select the Aryan schema
sensor click on next you can see the
root element here right and then by
setting the root element just click on
finish it will it will give you the file
which we require here it is a file so
now we can we can specify the ID as
let's say a1 so does the ID or the alien
ID we can specify the name here we can
say the name is Naveen and we have this
salary which is 3000 right and let's
take everything on new line so that's
okay so that's how we create an access
defile that's how you use an exit e-file
so we have a prefix and then you have to
mention those two things so this thing
here this is not our URL this is our you
are I okay now what next can i scan I
create one more alien here since we have
two aliens can I create one more alien
so if I copy this code and if I paste it
here for the second alien if I even if I
mention a to and if I say this is Manoj
but the same salary so you can see the
you are getting error it says invalid
content was found starting okay no child
element is expected this
point O what that means that means it is
not allowing me to write two things now
if you want to go for two two elements
inside alien we have to write one more
restrictions here so how to do that we
have to add more elements why do you
want to add more alien type objects so
you have to specify two more attributes
so you have to say Mac max occurrence
and with the max accurate Mac max
occurrence let's say three and the
minimum number of occurrence will say
min occurrence that is your one so
minimum occurrence is one and maximum is
three if I go back to the XML there is
no error right because we can have
maximum three now so if I just copy this
paste there is no problem so why did we
are changing this to three and if I say
paste again and even if I mention it is
4 you can see we are getting error
because the maximal elements allowed is
only three right so that's the
restriction we have added in this schema
so that's mean like min max or current
occurrence and one on minimum occurrence
right now we can do something else here
yeah so what we can do is we can add
some registration to this value so let's
say this values this salary should not
be less than 10000 so let's say if I
should not be more than 10000 so let's
say if I've set the salary of 150,000 so
there's no error right or not this file
if I make the salary of manoj as let's
say 30,000 there is no error even if i
say by date you can see we don't have
any error I want to I want to make sure
that whenever a salary goes beyond 10
there should be an error to do that we
have to create a simplex type to add the
restrictions we have to add simplex type
so we will say simplex here so we say
simple or not simplex simple type will
name it as my Salle okay which is my
salary just click it up so that's my
salary here and we'll say my salary
close now in the same place we can add
something as restrictions
so this restrictions will have the base
we'll say this is the base type is
integer so we will have all the integer
type of elements here and in this
restrictions you can specify the minimum
minimum value and maximum value so we
can specify the minimum so we'll say
this is we'll say minimum should not be
Miam should be more than 1000 so we'll
say minimum inclusive we can specify
1000 and we can specify max excuse max
inclusive so we say max inclusive just
10 or just 10,000 so your solution
cannot be more than 10,000 right and if
I go back to this file now and if I say
Y date oh no idols right so it's because
we have created this restriction which
is myself by the type of my cell is
still integer right so we have to
mention that as my cell here and this my
cell belongs to TNS so that's Tina's :
my cell so I was good now if I go back
to the XML and we got the other yourself
we cannot be more than 10,000 now so
that's how we can specify the grammar
for the structure and grammar for the
content so that is possibly the f of x
SD file which is XML schema definition
so that is from this video and thanks so
