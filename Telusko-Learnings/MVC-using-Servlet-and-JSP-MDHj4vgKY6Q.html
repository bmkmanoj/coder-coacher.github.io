ready from Toys for landings and in this
video we'll talk about MVC design
pattern using servlet and JSP so the
last video we have seen that whenever
you work with JSP it gets converted into
servlet right so that means even if you
are working with JSP you are actually
working on servlets right so but if you
talk about the coding part if you want
to write a code JSP looks much easier
compared to sublease right
so does that means from today will only
work on JSP and not exactly the problem
is there's one issue with JSP the issue
is whenever you create a JSP and when
you run it when it only for the first
time it will get converted into sub
Detroit and it will take some time to do
that right so for the first time you are
wasting some time so that means subject
works faster than JSP because in some
way to tigers not be subject in JSP have
to connect this JSP to servlet that's
one problem second problem it is
recommended that don't write your
business logic inside JSP never never do
that never write the code the actual
Java code inside JSP so if you want to
plus something always go for servlet so
Saba is something which will process
your information right and then JSP we
should be using only for the view now
when I say be you as a client whatever
you get on the page or on the browser
that's the view right when you go to
google.com what you get a page right
that's a view when you go to
facebook.com what you get is the page
that is view right so JSP is best when
you want to create a view but hold on we
have HTML for that right why to use JSP
when you can use HTML the thing is using
HTML you can only create static pages
and JSP to generate P it means let's say
we have a client here and then we have a
jpg
now this can be a static page or it can
be a 10-8 page if you want to create a
static page you can simply go with HTML
form and you will get it but the moment
if you want a dynamic page you have to
create a spheroid now this JSP page will
be having which will be having some
static content and it will be
bring some dynamic content example let's
say if you go to Facebook right so on
Facebook you can see we have we have
some text there on the on the menu bar
right on then we have some text on right
hands on left hand side so there are
some text on that page which is static
it doesn't matter who launched into
Facebook you will get the same thing
right so you can see hello
I can see hello same thing you can see
settings I can see the same thing
settings but the moment I click on my
newsfeed if I click on the home the
feeds I'll be getting is different from
your feeds that means that kinda is
dynamic so we what we can do is we can
create a layout we can create a layout
using JSP now that page will be only
layout it will be only the design there
will not be any data right so when you
request for a page right you are
expecting this JSP in return so what
we're expecting is the view okay see as
a client we are only concerned about
views we don't know what is happening
behind the scene why when you go to
Amazon you don't know what is happening
behind the scene you simply get a page
right in the same way as a client
so as outlined what you expect from
these server is the view but hold on we
have to add data here right because this
is just a design you want data as well
from where you look at the data to get
the data first of all you have to send
request right so let's say this request
is for get page ok we have any any
requests you can say gate student get
page or maybe get products so you're
requesting you are requesting for this
this data which is get page you are
expecting this page now this request
will go to something called as
controller right now we have a
controller let me not write this is a
controller not see say this is a
controller so whenever you send a
request so in MVC design pattern
whenever the client says the request it
will go to the controller now this
controller will say ok I've got a
request here what is my job is to call
this view so this controller's
responsibility to call this view and
then this will this view will go to the
Conn go to the client but Hold'em is
something which is missing here the
missing thing is controller is calling
view but again you don't have a data
right so what it will do is this
controller will send the data as well so
when a controller calls the view it will
also send a data with it example let's
say you controller want to print
something here example let's say this
view is actually a student profile which
is a student profile ok so we have a
design but we don't have our data that
wide so this controller will send the
student information to this view right
but in which format so that format let's
say it's an object this object will have
student info or student info and we will
call this as a model so when I was a
client sense the request it goes to the
controller controller will call view by
sending the model object so what is
model object it's the object which will
have the data now that model object will
go to your view now we view will replace
all the blank text with the actual data
from the model and then what you will
get is the is the page right now as a
for the client it will look like a
static page because we don't know what
is what happened behind the scene but
that's a dynamic page the page is
created I mean the page is filled with
the module data and that data is
generated by your controller now in
these java technology or summit
technology this controller is normally
created with the help of solids right so
your controller is your servlet your
view is your JSP so normally we create
views with the help of JSP and then your
model are actually normal
pour juice now when I say Pujo I know
it's a very different term right so some
people know about this some people don't
know about this in fact some years back
even I was not knowing about POJO that's
fine Bojo simply stands for plain old
Java object so if you want to send a
data we can send the data in the POJO
format you can create an object of a
student let's say if you can create a
student class - string class can have
roll number marks name age email ID and
you can send all this information in one
object one student object is that simple
right so yeah so when you want to
implement the MVC
in survey technology a client will send
a request to the servlet and that's how
it will be called as a controller that
servlet of all the controller will call
the JSP
but in this JSP needs some data right
and that will be done with the help of a
model object and this model object will
be a POJO
which is plain old Java object and then
we have a view which is your JSP so now
question is where to write the business
logic if you want to do any processing
it should be done on the controller
never write the business logic on the
view technology which is ASP JSP should
be only for the waving things this
controller is for your this is this is
your processing thing and then this will
be this model object will only hold the
data I can never do the never perform
any operation inside model object right
it should each is only for holding theta
but then you know there is also a
something fun as n-tier architecture
know what is that instead of doing all
the processing here because it let's say
let's say let's say we have a database
here ok we have a database and you want
to fetch some data from the database so
if you want to generate this model you
are fetching data from database how it
will work so you have to connect your
controller with the database right you
have to write this reactor ID those
databases steps inside this controller
which is your servlet again that's not
the good way of doing that never process
anything I mean never actually write the
what you say the the operations or the
the functions or methods inside
controller controller is only for
accepting requests and then sending the
response if you want to perform any
operation here what you will be doing is
you will be getting one more class here
right so the controller will call that
class now this class is basically your
service classes again this is a normal
class this is a normal class it's just
that since we are performing some
operations we will do that in a service
method right I will not do that so when
you send a request to the controller
controller will will ask hey service
class it will be having our objects
every class will have some methods and
that service class will give you the
object right so service class inside
this class you have to write the
database
steps make sense right so in future if
an even if you change your database you
do not have to change your controller
right you just have to change the
service but then when you work the
database actually what happens is we
have one more layer here and this is
called as a down layer so you call the
controller controller will take the help
of service and service will take the
help of tau again this thing is not
compulsory in MVC okay MVC is simply
this part we have a client we have a
controller we have a model we have a
view but then if you actually want to
implement something we also use these
two classes service class and dau class
now it is Dao it is data access object
so if you want to interact with database
the best way is using dau classes again
I have a separate video on Dao just go
just search for JDBC Dao then just go on
YouTube you will get my video there ok
so yeah that's how you that's how you
work with MVC this is just a theory of
it will talk about the Platinum element
Asian in the next session
ok you're not say anything else here let
me know your doubts and there's one more
question for you and try to have this
habit of asking questions in fact last
week I started with a quiz online quiz
so this is a question for you and the
question is if you want to make a p--
okay if you want to make a android app
what are the options you have so go to
google and search for different options
for making android application ok
example let me give you one example you
can you can do that with the help of
Android studio you can do that with the
help of some ionic framework let me know
more options so that's it thank you so
much for watching and do subscribe the
channel thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
