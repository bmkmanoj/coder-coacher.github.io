we'll we'll do some operations here now
the first operation unit is so whenever
you click on this button B it will call
this method called as action perform
that means first step is way to fetch
the data from this text field and we'll
store this data in int variable will say
num1 and the second variable is num2
now how to store data in this now what
the data should come from text 21 right
but the problem is the the scope of this
t1 ends in the constructor so the scope
of this t1 in this constructor
unfortunately you cannot use t1 here so
what we can do is we can just expand the
scope and well define all the variables
outside all the all the reference
outside so we say text field T 1 comma T
2 in fact we should define if which we
think we should declare everything
outside so it's a button B and which
should define they well declare they
were also outside so we'll say label so
we don't need to define or declare it
here so we say we'll remove this we're
doing this only to increase the scope
okay so it's a button B and that's it so
say L know what text will go here and we
say now wait to fetch the data from text
field and the name of the textual is t1
so this Stephen is an object it will
have some methods and the method to face
that data is T 1 dot get text so using
get text you can fetch the data but if
you can focus on this get text it
returns you string value and the out or
the the value of expecting here is ain't
right so we took convert that string
into integer with the help of integer
dot parseint method so it is passed end
and we'll pass it here now we need to
pass this t1 dot get text into this
integer dot parseint and we'll use the
same code here
copy/paste so instead of t1 this time it
will come from T
- so now number one has a value D 1 and
number 2 has a value of t2 now once you
got the value let's add these two
numbers we'll say int value is equal to
num 1 plus num2 now your addition comes
in value right now we need to set that
data outside that value in this label so
once you got the output let's set the
label so label name is l dot weight to
set the data or text so it is a method
caller said text and set text ask you
for a string value you can see it takes
to ask you for string value if you pass
key here or if you pass value here
unfortunately it will give you an error
it says it will ask you for a string and
you're passing our integer so we need to
convert this integer into strength by
simply saying plus double quotes because
integer plus string will give you string
and that means the output of this 2 will
be a string simple that's it when you if
I run this code now let's run this so we
got this window here let's some design
thing let's say 5 + 4 wife a click on OK
the output is 9 anybody can change this
value if I say 5 + 9 the answer is 14
right so this is how you can add two
numbers so now here let's make a quick
quick recap so it is d1 which your text
field t2 is a textual bit but B is
button and it's labeled way to add all
those components since by default B is
dumb we need to add this though and that
listener name is action listener and
this method will ask you for the object
of action listener so the way to
implement since we need an object of
action listener we need to say our class
will implement action listener and
indirectly since we are implementing
action is now we need to define a method
called as action perform in this action
perform so whenever you click this
object or
this button it will always call the
method called as action perform so that
we can execute this statements so this
is how we have to add two numbers using
Java swing in the next part we'll talk
about subtraction multiplication using
the same code thank you so much for
