video we'll talk about some of the
important features of class class so we
have a class called as class which is a
class here so this class here has some
problems some important feature so one
of the most important feature is let's
say I have a class here so let's say
class a so we have a class a here so it
is blank now what I to check is I want
to know that this class a so see
whenever you compile a Java file it will
create a file called as a dot class now
a dot plus-- can be a class or a dot
class can be a interface right because
even if you compile interface it will
give you dot class file so you have a
dot class file now you want to know that
that dot that class that dot class file
is it our interface of the class so for
this scenario what we can do is we can
use a class class here so we'll say C
we'll say class dot for name so we have
a method called as for name here and
this foreign images have to mention the
class name which is comm dot now in dot
a so you have to mention the fully
qualified class name with the package so
which is comm dot naveen dot a now once
you got the object of class here so this
class objects see it has a method
so let's print it so it has a method
called as is interface so whenever you
use is interface so if that class
if that a is an interface it will print
true if that is not interface which
means it is a class it will print false
so if you on this application now so if
you say shift f6 it says it's of its
false but what if if I make this class
as interface ok see in that in this
scenario if you run this application it
says it is true so this is interface
will let you
know that the current the file which is
dot class file is it a class or
interface do we have some other feature
so we have one more method here so let
me remove this interface here and let me
write into class
so that's your easy interface right so
we have one more so we have lots of
methods here if you say C dot
so there are list of methods now one of
the important method you can use here we
can we have something called as get
superclass now so if you can see a class
is not extending any class here right
but by default every class in Java
they extends object laws so even if you
don't write extends object by d4 it will
extend object class so if I remove this
and when I say C dot get superclass it
will give you the name of the superclass
which is object class here and now if I
run this it says class java.lang Java
dot light dot object so it will give you
the fully qualified class name but let's
say I have a Class A which extends let's
say ABC and what is ABC ABC is a class
yes and say ABC bracket open close so
nothing is defined there just a blank
class ABC oh it's already there I will
say B and this will exchange Class B
okay so Class A here extends Class B and
now if we run this application so
instead of getting object will get Class
B again only fully qualified which is
comm dot naveen dot B so those are the
two methods you can use of class class
so we have one more methods here like it
was this get declared field it will give
you all the field names get declared
methods it will give you all the method
names and you have lots of methods it
will also give you all the interfaces
modifiers so a lots of things available
when you talk about this class class so
basically we can use it for debugging or
to know the to know much more about your
class so you can use this class class
okay so I hope this video have helped
you so thanks for watching this video
