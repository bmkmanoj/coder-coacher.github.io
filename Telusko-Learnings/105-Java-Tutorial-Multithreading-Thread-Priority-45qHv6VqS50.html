set a name thread and we'll talk about
the priorities of the thread so we start
with the name first so what I do now as
before before doing all this any stuff
if only when starting the thread what we
can do is let's print the name of the
thread so do we have a name for the
thread let's try that let you print T
one dot get name so you can see we have
a name for the thread and if I try to
run this code you can say to spending
the thread zero
let's try to do that if the seconds
right here will say copy-paste and let's
make it as T two and if you're on this
code of course it will print thread one
right so by default when you create the
first write the name will be thread zero
the second thread will be 21 okay can
you change the thread name because I
don't like this thread name so there are
multiple ways you can do this one is you
can can you say a set name yes we can do
that we can say this is simply say hi
and then we say T 2 dot set name we'll
say this is hello so we can also set the
thread name you can see of course it
will let's say this is height right
itself and this is a lot to it and if I
don't this code you can say it is
printing high thread and hello to it
that means you can also set the name for
the thread now why does important is
because let's say you're working on
application where you have multiple
threads and you don't know which thread
is doing what because sometimes it is
very difficult to manage threads right
so it's always better to name to give a
name to attachment so that you can use
it later so this is how you can set the
name this another way is when you create
the object of thread it will ask you for
it will ask you for two parameters the
first one is which one you will be using
now this one so if you can see this
constructor here it is asking you for
the object of enable and it is also
asking for the name I can it you can all
see we can only pass the enable object
or you can only pass the name but you
can pass both you can pass the name of
object and you can also pass the name so
what we can do here is if I look at this
code this is the object of the neighbor
right and if you give a comma
and you can also mention the name here
of the trend we can say this is high
thready
now same thing can be done here we can
say this is hello thread I mean we can
also do that if you on this code you can
see we got high to it and adult word
so that's how you can give the name for
the threader now what next can be can be
get the priorities let me remove this
name thing we have done with named we I
hope you've got the concept of name here
remove that let me just make this quote
more simple and let's talk about the 12
variety nom now by default whenever you
create any thread it will have the
default priority let's try to fetch the
default priority first we'll simply
print the pride of the thread will
simply say this is t1 dot get priority
it will give you the current writing
will do it for both 42 dot get variety
so if we got priority for both the what
the objects so you can see for both the
objects we got 5 so the priority for
thread 1 is 5 the priority for 22 is
also 5 so by default they both have the
same priority which is 5 so what's a
range of varieties so the range of
priority goes from 1 to 10 so 1 means
least priority and 10 means highest
priority and 5 is normal priority so now
can I change this varieties as we can do
that we can say t1 dot set priority and
we can say this is 1 and here we can say
t2 dot said variety and we can say this
is 10 so we are changing the priority of
both the tanks so what we are setting t1
1 and we are setting t2 as 10 and if you
on this code now you can say we got 1
and 10 so what is the least priority in
10 is the highest priority
now some time it is difficult to
remember numbers right because it is not
that readable it is bit confusing that
lets say after five years or two years
you are saying this okay we have set the
priority 1 but what is what is it least
of least or highest difficulty
remembered right so that's why we can
also use some we can also use some
constants so we can say thread dot mil
priority so it means that it will give
you 1 and we can say this is thread dot
max variety so this these are the
inbuilt constants available and threads
so if I go to max variety inside thread
class you can say to the value of max
white is ten the minimum variety is one
you can set the normal priority which is
five so even if you don't set the
priority it will give you five so that's
how you set the priority and if you are
this quote of course it will give you
one and ten
let's say I want to know the priority in
the thread itself so after printing high
I want to print it thread priority so
what we can do is we can say so we can
say this is thread dot so you can see it
says current thread dot get priority it
will print a variety of that turns right
so you can say it is printing and the
high one high one I want because the
priority of that thread is one so if you
want to refer to the current thread in
the same thread itself so inside the
thread if you want whether for the
thread way to say current whether
current right will refer to the current
right okay so that's about the name and
the priority in threads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
