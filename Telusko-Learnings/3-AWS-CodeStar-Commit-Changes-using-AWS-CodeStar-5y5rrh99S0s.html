ready in the last video we have seen how
to create a application on AWS and this
is what we have done right this is our
java spinning application deployed on
AWS this is not created by us but this
is given by the AWS - you sample
application so what we wanted is we
wanted to make some changes right we
want to change these congratulations we
want to change these things how do we
how do we make the changes now of course
as you know of any way you want to make
any change in the code
first of all you need to get the access
to the code so that you can make changes
now this is what this is how your AWS
console look like rightly this is your
code star and you can see we have so
many options but one of the option here
is available which is coder right so
when you click on code this is the tab
it will give you in this tab you can see
we have the width this is this is where
you have your project right so this is
the project which is you which you are
actually getting here so if you go to
this SRC this is so if you are if your
family or what about about Spring
Framework what we do is we create
controllers so inside Java we have comm
inside that we have AWS then the code
star then this R we have a controller
and in this control of what we are doing
is whenever you send a request to the
home page you have to call index dot JSP
again this coefficient done with the
help of spring MVC annotations but how
do you make the changes because if you
want to make a change you have to make
sure that in the project you go to SRC
main web app and in the web iron F of
course there will be views and inside
views there will be index dot JSP
and this is where you have to make the
changes you have to change this code
right instead of having congratulations
we wanted a telescope instead of having
develop design by and Delta Pi in the in
Seattle I want to say by Navi in 20 how
do I do that
so we have to use an IDE right and one
of our favorite IDE is eclipse so I have
Eclipse here how do you connect first of
all will make the changes and cobia we
have to also pull the project here how
do we pull a project so we need to pull
this project in Eclipse so we can do
that simply we can say clone URL and you
can do that manually otherwise you can
use a so let's let's see do we have any
shortcuts the moment I say file and
import where is the
input it's here so that's a import there
should be an option of AWS and
unfortunately we don't have that here is
it that we don't have an option of AWS
now to make it work you need to install
a plug-in fireblaze so just go to help
and there's option of eclipse
marketplace and this is where you have
to search for word so we have to search
for AWS and the moment you do that it
will give you an option so you can see
that we got a double use toolkit for
Eclipse 2.0 let's do that so you have to
click on install here and it will give
you so many options to select of course
you can install have the thing or they
can choose between options so example
let's say I don't want ops work I don't
want lambda I don't want okay let's go
with all the other things now let's
click on confirm and we have to accept
the agreement we don't have a choice
click on finish the moment to do that it
will take some time to install right
till that point let me just pause the
video okay so finally it has done all
the installation all it is installed in
my Eclipse now but to make it work we
have to restart the Eclipse so let's
restart the Eclipse and click on yes so
it is restarting the Eclipse now and it
will take some time of course ok now we
got the bike is back and ok this is
asking for hibernate let's ignore
hibernate for time brain and yes so this
is this is where you got eclipse and now
if you can if you can see the there is
this a small change in the Eclipse IDE
you can see that we got this new symbol
here a new icon and if you can simply
drag I mean drop it down there's an
option of import a the base code start
project and that's the beauty right
you can simply import it from here just
click on that and now it will ask you
for the account name so of course I
guess if you are using this for the
first time it will ask you for the
account name where you have to give your
address username and password right the
account which we have created before so
you have to make sure that you give your
account password I have done that before
it will give your prom something like
this so there will be an option of
changing
name password something here I mean
whatever give you access key and I guess
you can get this access key from the
okay so there should be an option of
getting an access key here so you will
get the option I guess do you will get
the option when you when you build it so
try that so once you get the access key
once you get the login the next thing
every to do is you have to select
account and then you have to select the
region this is very important in fact it
when I was doing this for the first time
it took me more than half an hour to
figure it out why it's not working
because you can see I'm not getting my
projects here the thing is you have to
also remember the the what you say the
origin here right so the origin for me
or the location for me is region for me
is you as East rights you have to make
sure that you select the proper one and
once you do that it will give you the
list of project in your in your
application so you can see we have that
is for demo here and less it selectors
for demo and you have to also give your
get credentials now for my machine I do
I already have a git repository
credentials but you will not have it or
the first instance so you have to click
on create get credentials okay you may
already have created the magazine number
of set of critical issues
okay so I've already cross that limit so
what you have to do is I already have a
copy so when you do it for the first
time you can simply click on to it get
credentials what I will do is I will I
have a CSV file of it I have a copy of
it I will do that here okay so you can
see I only have a good potential CSV
file created I will select that part and
I will click on next
it will edify the information it will
verify the user MnPASS with all these
things and why it is done it will say
next and it will ask you for the project
where you want to save obviously stolen
the gate repository and click on
finished I'm going to do that it will
pull the project from the coach Todd I
just that is it will put it is putting
the project now and you've got where's
that okay so it still happening
okay so it says downloading downloading
it will take some time
yeah
so you've got your project you can see
that we got our telesco demo project
now is it the real project and the
answer is yes it's a real project now
first of all do we our server here I
don't have a service of course I cannot
run it locally so whatever you do is
again you can test it so I just saw her
to your tomcat we eclipse a tomcat
server and you can also run this on
Tomcat so it will work but what I will
do now is I will make some changes I
will die quick deploy it on the server
so to do that we have to go for me in
web app and you can explore the entire
package so once you do that by yourself
please explore all these packages and
files available in this you will get
much more idea so when I expand this web
and if views and index dot JSP this is
the actress source code which is working
there now this is more more of a spring
so we can see we have also have spring
tags here and ok so the important thing
is I want to make some changes so I want
to say this is the disco right and then
I have to make one more changes I will
say design developed and design by I
will say my name
ready simple right and ok this they are
they are also giving you a H ref I don't
want to do that ok just remove that so I
want to say design and develop I never
do that set this is what I want to
changes on this server and it's that
simple but you can so once you tell the
changes right click here say team and
click on commit and I will say okay so
when you say commit you have to of
course you have to enter some data right
you have to commit you have to give a
commit message so I will select this all
files and put it here in fact you don't
have to update everything just update
one file and I will say commit commit
message would be index page updated it
should be a proper message I'm giving a
message here and I will say commit and
push it will take some time to push and
maybe 10 seconds and it is done so once
you push it click on OK now the moment
you do that just go to your page and see
if it is reflected click here and you
can see oh oh
we still got congratulations we got
developed and design with love in
Seattle that's weird where is the quiz
the changes now it is not that fast
of course it will take some time for the
deployment some time for the I mean
building and deployment now if you can
observe in this steps here the moment
you say commit after that it will say ok
it is committed it will build and it
will the application is running but it
is not reflecting here why so it takes
some time to actually do these things
the automatically it will stay there it
will give you an option of building
stuff so you can see the last build was
yesterday Oh 29 today is study yeah so
it was the last build it was just
yesterday so it will take some time to
start with the building so should I wait
or should I click on release changes
ok so let's wait for some time and let's
keep it let's see if it is getting
automated started ok so I waited for one
minute and it just started automatically
have not done any changes and you can
see it says in progress so it will take
some time for so you can see this source
is updated and you can also see your
commit message here it says index page
updated one mate ago so I have not made
a change I've not done it after that so
it took one minute to actually start the
processing so I just doing the efficient
code so when it is doing this thing can
you let's see if this were my website is
up or down so you can see the website is
still not down it's still working right
because normally what happens is when
you deploy the operation on the server
it it your application is not available
for some time maybe one or two minutes
so let's see so in the in the source
code you can see there is no problem on
the on the server now it will take some
time for the source code let's wait for
word so I will pause the video for some
time so that it will go to bed ok so now
it is going in a build phase so in the
build force it will compile all your
files now let's verify is the server
algebra is still up yes it is still up
because it is in building stage now
that's great so let's wait for some time
you can see it took around 7 seconds to
go switch from here to here so let's
pause for some time and let's see ok so
it says our building is done and I guess
application it will start with the
deployment now and the moment you say
building is done their website is still
up and it does not pay the changes it
will take some time for the application
to be deployed
and let's see when when you start
deployment okay
now you can see it is started with the
deployment and white is getting deployed
and okay so can you see that
the web site is deployed and you can see
the changes so you can see hardly it was
off for one or maybe ten or twenty
seconds we have not even realized that
it was off right you can see maybe it
was down for some time so you can see we
caught the changes we got that is co and
we got now in 20 here that's awesome
right so it's so simple to work on a
double server especially with the help
of Coach tile you can simply make the
changes and push it everything will be
handled by AWS so what we did we just
made the changes so what do we change
you want to make maybe you want to get
some more pages I will do that we'll
make some more changes we'll write some
code here to show the contact page to
show all those beard stuff and we'll
push that on the server and it'll be
getting updated automatically don't have
to do the creating a wire file and
deploying it on the server I take
tedious tasks right so that's the beauty
about aw I hope you enjoyed this video
