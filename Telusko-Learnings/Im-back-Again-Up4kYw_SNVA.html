so I don't know what went wrong there
was some Network issue and solace is a
mobile mobile network and it went bad so
I'm going live here but I can't see
anyone watching this I don't know if I'm
life there let me verify once again by
going to the channel is it my video
channel maybe okay that's great so let
me start with the questions again so as
we are going live again so people are
saying I am watching hi or - great your
life is in life please put software
testing content also okay so the thing
is I'm not good with testing I might
take help of someone else who can who
can make videos on testing in fact I
have
I wanted to collab with some people who
are good with testings let's see how
that goes okay can you make a video on
OpenGL and DirectX not not not good in
that so I cannot make a video okay so
just question just went okay so your
specialist school thank you thanks so
much for that it looks closed okay how
to choose your field it is this question
from Tanjore thing okay how to choose a
field now first of all you know you
there are there are different fields are
with a variety and you have to choose
which you like and you have to also
choose something which is the industry
which will be there in the industry from
a long tough for a long time maybe
something main you right okay so that's
a different thing you know don't get to
do this to do something which will be
there for a long time because no one
knows what will be there for a long time
but you have to make sure that you
choose something that will be there at
least for some time so I would say to
the new technologies will be a good
option like like like blockchain data
science AI or a IOT or you can choose
these things otherwise what you can do
is try out different acknowledge which
is available and and you know the moment
you feel her this is something which I
like
are you can continue with that other
till that point just switched keep
switching or keep learning new
technologies in fact one of my friend he
just reads new technologies every every
time maybe
he was working for a company but still
he tried to upgrade himself for
different different technologies so
that's what you can do it to do to
choose which you like so tell me which
language I want Lord first okay I don't
know which language you want to learn
first but I would say go forward see
that's that Python that will be good
option Python or C but is too easy to
learn by the way you can try it out okay
oh how to make any software by java
that's very easy not java language and
think about what you want to build using
how you can build everything you can
build mobile applications like android
using an adapter kit you're using
android platform or you can bury the
southside coding with java with the help
of spring framework or sublet JSP
you can build a cloud service using java
so start so choose one thing which you
want to go for a mobile platform a cloud
platform or enterprise platform and
learn the technology in fact I do have a
video on that book for spring MVC
bigness but that's what I have it's
difficult for me to you know to give you
the you know a book name because every
time you buy a spring book we have a new
version so I do have some spring MVC
books our spring works but then it there
they are the old one it's of no use now
that's what so that's the issue so don't
buy books I would suggest you to go for
online courses video courses all online
tutorials on online you know the text
tutorials the spring also has the
official documentation you will just
just search for Spring Framework ePub
you will get a ePub written by the
official people so you can you can defer
that okay oh please May of course on our
language I'm not good with our language
okay goes on hyper ledger okay so you
can expect hyper ledger in future not
soon but I'm just reading the running
face maybe in future you can expect
hyper ledger cause hyper edge a videos
okay so I can see hundred people are
watching this only two different 21
likes come on guys if you like this
obsession
like within that okay oh okay can you
make can you make a video on coop
entities known as of non on at this
point I may make a video on talker but
not in Co but it is my anytime soon
okay so that was off MCA you will find
that on Google the search possib CX
syllabus
okay but it says no question left on my
side okay - heat
I've seen your messages on my your
comments on my videos thanks for that
okay so we know basics of java then move
to partly yes if you know Java learning
content would be easy task for you
can you play something you please make a
video on Jenkins and GIDA
yes I was I was trying to make no video
on Jenny from a long time I don't know
what's what going wrong with me
Gina I still need to work on Jairam are
gonna make a video on as of now but
Jenkins yes I can try j2ee versus no J's
okay not much into node.js I cannot
comment on that scope of and the scope
of MCA in India the thing is there are
some companies like service miss
companies they prefer people who have
done master's because if you don't if
you just have a degree with which is
let's say please see a VC ID or any
three years degree it is not that
impactful I would say go for it masters
maybe I missed CID on MCA so for the
stem companies just have that's before
I've see people okay
thanks all for lovely courses and videos
thanks for the effort or my pleasure
okay so there are so many videos on the
way you know everyday you can expect one
video now maybe after after one week I'm
still into that I know vacation would
just vacation he's just got over back to
work
it will take some time for me to go to
to be on the same platform another way I
was I was working earlier
okay I'm shifting my office also so so
that what work is also going on shifting
often dual okay
let's see how that goes okay how do okay
just that we should just went up any
series on Python but in a science python
no not from this channel I cannot expect
much as pattern here okay
does see that the problem is there's so
many technologies I want to work on I
cannot do everything in the moment if I
try to do everything I might you know
not do one thing to operate j-unit
videos please yes you can expect J with
generate videos from this channel soon
okay Sonics you can expect videos in
fact I'll be making a separate video but
just to give you a hint you can expect
spring videos the complete playlist
blockchain videos soon or hyper ninja
okay so okay what is what is the opinion
of big dieter a good feel very good feel
you can try it out in future there's so
many in fact not of technologies a lot
of companies they are using big data in
fact F none of companies they have their
own data available they just want to
manage it they want to use it properly
because for a I also need huge amount of
data so you speak it up will be there in
all the companies it's like big it's
like DBMS or no DPM I suppose there with
every company now big data will be there
with every company so ok next question
what is your opinion okay
none of questions on my opinion here ok
so it is the opinion but I can having a
hacking you know at one point every
student 90 they want to be a hacker at
one point you know in fact at one point
when I was doing my graduation I wanted
to be a hacker but even I said no I
don't have that skills you know to hack
into a machine because it name it needs
lot of efforts it did lot of consistency
I'm not that good with hacking so I went
to development but yes I love I I would
love to be a hacker and anyone want to
be hacker you know so try it out if you
liked it there is nothing wrong if
you're learning hacking and if even if
you're not doing
in future okay oh okay cause she just
went up okay will you be our mentor for
smart India hackathons over 18 project
on okay when it anyway it is pretty sure
my just send me a mail about it I don't
know if I'm have enable on territory
first I guess that antenna first I'm
shifting my office so I don't be
everything but to send me a mail I can
just you know I can try some adjustment
that if possible okay so what new you
know a channel to the agent please tell
us something so just for that I'll be
uploading a spirit video you can expect
a lot of things in in the May of in the
month of June okay May or June that will
be golden paid for this channel so what
is a WS Oedipus is basically Amazon Web
Services you can deploy your
applications there it provide our tools
like virtual machines instances
databases you can upload your app there
if we try it out in fact I do have a
video and I do plus we're going to just
watch it so just like crap services or
how you can host your applications there
okay SQL please I do have the entire
patient masks can just search from ask
your drainage Tedesco look at it is
flatter a good option I don't know about
Twitter okay so pradeepsharma81 about a
smart into hackathons I will look into
it please tell these steps will dr. Mike
okay so to learn that doesn't mean the
first step is to learn HTML that's the
basic thing you know you cannot run away
from HTML CSS JavaScript okay so CSS
JavaScript you can love that what you
can so there are things for the front
end for the back end I would say if you
choose Java you can you can just PHP you
can choose Python Ruby the symmetric
terms are believable if you if you want
you this channel I would say learn learn
Java back-end that will be helpful you
can also choose JavaScript backend with
the type of node.js so there are the
first steps you can go for so first of
all you say what technology you want to
go for then you can learn the back end
of it which is best
AWS rjcp I would say
nothing against DCP it's Google's
platform by the way but I love it up
Louis and I feel magazine market is
captured by Amazon ok the beach promise
is the best nowadays I would say Python
the fastest growing language you know
but Java is not going anywhere
enterprise market is still running on
Java ok so I can see pradeep's the same
question arcade you can send me a mail
I'm reading my a mail online courses for
blockchain soon I'll be doing that
ok next five minutes because it's very
late now next five minutes we can spend
here ok I'll be going live multiple
times now since I'm back I'll be going
Lana I will be like lot of time now
maybe in the weekdays as well why to
have Sunday life only we can have in
this life as well
ok how to donate money for this channel
it's very easy it's very easy
ok so you can just go to my website
there's always option of about us or
contact us you can just go there and
there's a link for donations otherwise
you can you can send me PayPal my energy
is now ready to sit at a gmail.com you
can you can send me a bill many other
people as well
make me your doctor yes I'll be doing
that ok just all the questions are going
up very fast so I'll just like it's not
just about coding is not done that
you're for early life or the idea life
is not about coding it's about drama
solving so I am more towards problem
solving things not just about coding
because I think I feel anyone can do
coding much difficult to do problem
solving things something my dad does I
know those things and learning new
technologies someone has to promote
right ok why not or what not I just
thought the question there
autumn is testing was a development
career it's all depend upon you I want
this pretty for development but nothing
against testing it's very important
field by the way so I would say
development you try development first
all you've been
I can't comment on that by the way okay
please make videos on Java effects okay
I'm not going to designing so that's
what I'm skipping that question okay why
you have such a hairstyle it's good it
suits on me I guess okay sir can you
promote my channel
okay below says I don't know why we
child II have a keep okay okay okay
pushes up going up pretty fast now
oh okay where are the questions how do
you improve ramzan skills work solve
some questions daily just go to hacker
rank heckle Earth's just go there and
try some sorts of questions you will get
a good idea here can you teach us
it applies I do happy cousin it applies
if you just go to my channel and search
for a SS videos I do have video of that
okay how to start programming I would
say start with Python that will be a
good start and try to solve some online
questions over there to do programming
like go to hackers right hacker
earthward chef I just give you a good
option so how much one question and we
are good to go
I'll get will join either one not able
to answer all the questions here some
question doesn't want to make sense
let's see okay so is it your good move
to move from Java to Big Data yes it's a
very good move because indicator has
value will be you're working on
different frameworks and you'll be using
Java there so that's it it's very late
now it's almost 11 p.m. so so we'll be
going so that's it that's everyone see
you next week next Sunday I guess yeah
maybe if we try to go live in this week
