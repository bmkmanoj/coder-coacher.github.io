about this keyboard let understand this
keyboard let's create a class here and
we'll name this class as a and let's say
in this a class I have a variable called
as X okay and I have a method which is
public void show which will print the
value of x so let's print it so we'll
say X is and then let's say X now to
print this value first you have to
assign value to X and we have this X
variable as private so the only way to
access this variable X is through some
method right and whenever you say you
want to access a variable to methods
we basically use setters and getters
right so let's say I'm not using data
setter here let me use a constructor to
assign value so I will create a
constructor which is public a which
accepts a number or a value so let's say
this is a variable a and then this
variable a will be assigned to a
variable X so the value of a will be
assigned the value of x or to the
variable X simple right and then to
assign those values first you have to
great object of a that's here and then
and then let's was the error about
something oh so I have a constructor
which takes a parameter so let's pass
six and then I will say obj dot nothing
obj dot show oh we do not show yeah so
now if I say if I run this code you can
see the output of this it should be X is
6 simple right now let's add some twist
what if the value of x or the variable a
becomes variable X and then we have to
say this is X
if you could touch to go back okay so
let's make it a now again so you can see
the color of this a so if you see the
color of a it is black okay the color of
X is green it's because this X here it
will be called as instance variable and
this a here will be called as local
variable so basically we have three
types of variables we have instance
variable we have local variable and we
have class variable so instance is a
variable which which which is in the
class outside a method local is the
variable which is inside the method or
which is declared inside the method and
class variable is something which is
which is defined inside a class but it's
a static variable okay let's let's talk
about local an instance so you can see
the color of local instance is black and
color of instance variable is green so
now if I make this a as X and if I make
this as a as X so you can see this X or
this X is here is your interest variable
which is green and this X is local and
is black but if you focus on this two
variables so this X need to be a
instance variable and this is your local
variable but unfortunately this also
becomes black you can see that this is
also a local variable so we are fetching
a value from a local variable which is
here we assign the same value with local
variable which is X here we are not
assigning that value of this variable
and that's why when you run this code
the value of X will be zero even if you
are assigning a value six because this
value six is assigned to the local
variable itself we are not able to
assign this to instance variable and to
do that we have to mention that this X
is not a local variable this X is the
instance variable in order to use the
instance so we have to use something
called as this now this represents the
current instance so it is a current
instance now just to make you understand
what is current instance so people
normally say this
is the object of a class of course this
is the object of a class but the problem
is if your class has five objects okay
and five instance and every instance
have a different value of x okay so we
cannot say it's just an object is that
current instance so if you have five
instance at a point you'll behave you'll
be focusing on one instance this is that
one instance so let's say you're working
with the fourth instance so this will
represent that fourth instance okay so
this is not just an object it's a
current instance cool so yeah that's how
you work with this keyword so that's it
