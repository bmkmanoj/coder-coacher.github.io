about different the ideas for Java so if
you don't very talk about software
development some people when you learn a
new language you have to always start
with notepad money so we let's say you
when you started with C programming when
you started with C++ or Java so I'm sure
you started with notepad note pad white
or notepad plus plus but when once you
put towards software development so we
have to use some type of ideas because
to work with different frameworks they
may talk about Java
we have starts framework program
development we have spring framework
which is spring MVC for web development
so if you want to implement all this
different concepts we have to of course
we have to use some type of IDE if you
have dotnet fans are for dotnet we have
Microsoft Visual Studio so that's our
IDE for dotnet that does thank you
that's the only choice you have
but if you talk about Java we have lots
of things and that's what make it what
if you were to choose your IDE - develop
if you're working for a enterprise if
you're happy for our company so of
course your company will decide which
idea usually use but let's say you're
working on your own project you are you
have your own startup which IDE to
choose now there are multiple ideas so
we have NetBeans we have Eclipse we have
IntelliJ we have we have JDeveloper we
have JBoss studio we have lots of ideas
right now so let's talk the first one
which is one of my friend which is not
be
so we talked about NetBeans so that this
is an IDE which provides you lots of
features on Java so if you want to learn
Java in NetBeans everything it will give
you everything this like example we have
short codes we have so let's say you're
walking on swing program which is GUI
swing in that you can just drag and drop
your components and menu drag and drop
you will directly get the component you
don't have to create those companies
using new keyboard so that's your
NetBeans now about that means provides
you lots of for support so let's say you
want to create a web application so for
web application to learn that you have
Tomcat you have GlassFish so you can
either use Tomcat you can you can use
GlassFish the advantage of last fish is
GlassFish is also a app server so you
can run what is the EJB projects plus
tom what you say the sublet projects
okay
let NetBeans the next one is Eclipse now
as per industry standards everyone use
Eclipse ok advantage of using eclipses
it is lightweight so when you compare
that means an eclipse eclipses light
well then that means because when you
open it means if you have 2gb RAM your
machine will hang ok you will find you
will find some lags there but if you're
using Eclipse you it will be like normal
it will not like much so as per industry
standards everyone used experts because
the first advantage is just like weight
the second advantage so let's say I am
founder of a new framework so let's say
I have made my own rainbow call this ABC
framework so of course I want to provide
some libraries or some features to
particular IDE now which one I will
choose which is open right so eclipse is
open so I will create those new
framework to support Eclipse - pi all
different Java frameworks works on
Eclipse and I think it doesn't were
selected beans but it works more faster
or most
in eclipse in fact if you know about Red
Hat hat own apps of it is JBoss so now
we have a new version of Eclipse College
JBoss de la Bastille you only fall if
you're not making a app for specifically
for JBoss let's say you're working on
spring framework which is a framework in
Java so if you're working on spring
framework so fall spring framework we
have but what you say the flavor of
Eclipse which is STS which is spring
tools suit so the advantage of accusing
eclipses all different industries that
use eclipse different frameworks they
work on Eclipse in fact when Android was
first launched by developers you can
create your Android apps you that that
time people used to create those those
Android apps in Eclipse before and those
to you so we have NetBeans and we have
Eclipse after that we have something
other junior
JDeveloper which is a commission of
notepad and jdk inbuilt so if you--if
you don't want to use the advanced
feature of NetBeans and Eclipse you can
use junior the perf you're learning
something
oh if you have a machine which with low
lamb and low CPU power of course you
cannot use NetBeans Celica then we also
have blue J we have all this different
IDs I don't think anyone anybody could
have they are using now but the industry
perspective we have NetBeans and Eclipse
most famous electives now we have one
more which is one of the best IDE ever
okay which is IntelliJ Sam no I'm not
sure how many of you use IntelliJ but
it's awesome I know many of you are
working on a project and you have a
concept in your mind you don't have to
focus on syntax just type the concept
people you know time online he will give
you suggestions it will give you lots of
suggestions that's the advantage of
using this one until Eugene when there's
a one tweak here or one catch in tillage
is not free okay so if you are using a
personal use for one one machine use it
is free but if you are buying for
enterprise use of commercial use you
have to buy intelligence you have to pay
a chunk of money ok so if your company
can invest in your
I'd heat that's where that good
otherwise you have to buy in Taneatua by
yourself in fact the one the and one the
Android studio ie
which which is used for other
development it is powered by ETA J so
whenever you open Android studio you can
see this it returns powered by
intelligent ok so one of the best
ideally for Java is IntelliJ but if you
don't want to buy you can use eclipse
and you've gotta learn something new or
is going to if you're learning Java
language you can start with that means
right answer of this video so we'll use
whichever you want and if you have some
more ideas in your mind just do comment
so that I can just get one more video on
that how those things works so I will
suggest use eclipse
so thanks of thanks for watching and do
