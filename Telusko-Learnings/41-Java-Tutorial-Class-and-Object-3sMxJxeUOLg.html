about classes and object so when you
talk about Java so Java basically
follows this concept of oops and in oops
the most important part is class and
object now just imagine we have a
building here at our table now so far
this building to build this building we
require a plan might be required a
blueprint so even if you think you want
to build this the first question is how
to build that so we require a blueprint
right so Billy's building we required a
blue plane now this building is an
object okay just imagine this is an
object to build any object your JVM
needs a structure or a blueprint and
that blueprint will be your class so
this class class defines the structure
of an object it defines the working of
an object so if you can imagine an
object imagine object as a phone so
every phone will have two things a phone
your phone knows something and your
phone does something so when you when
you say your phone knows something the
its the structure of your phone the
color of your phone and then we have a
logo behind if it's an iPhone just
imagine that Apple over there so that's
the structure of a phone right though
how our object looks then what object
does right even if you have an iPhone if
you cannot call someone will you use
that iPhone maybe for show off right but
if you have an object you have to use an
object so every object will have a
behavior so to define what object knows
and what object does we require a
blueprint so in this blueprint we can
define what is the behavior and what is
the values so you can see the class
structure there okay so just beyond the
blueprint so we have a class structure
so using that class we can create this
object so that is object and class in
job so once you know the basic syntax on
how to use different things in Java
like if else for low variables let's
talk about some real power of Java which
is objects because a Java is object
oriented right so if you know the basics
of programming now you can try to jump
to the hoops concept now what oops
everything should be an object in fact
as you've seen the last video where if
you have talked about how do we create
an object what is class how what exactly
we need for that we need a blueprint so
that we can create the instance so once
we know all those terms let's start with
the real thing here so what we do is
we'll create a calculator again normally
when you talk about it working with your
first cut of object we always build a
calculator so let's build a calculator
we'll say will it scale a class because
to create anything new in Java way to
create a class so we'll say this is
Glasgow so when you want to create
object of it it is very simple now we
can simply say calc obj
now this calc obj is called as reference
so this is not the object but this is
just our reference so this obj here is a
reference what we'll do now is let's
create object of it now the only way to
create the object is with the help of
new keyword because new keyword is is
responsible to allocate the memory now
how much memory you need that will be
defined by the constructor again we'll
talk about this thing later once we
start with the topic of constructors we
will try to explore this more so what we
are doing is we are creating a reference
for Cal and then we are saying obj equal
to a new calc this is the object so this
line here the green lines of which I'm
selecting here that is your object and
this obj is just a reference so many
when you write this line it returns you
the object of type calc and that's why
we say calc obj equal to new Cal you can
write this in one line so right two
lines we can write it in one line
something like this we don't have two
ways this two lines this is how you
create a class and this is how you
create an object so you can call class
as the blueprint and object as the real
instance now what we'll do is let's have
some things here because what is object
object no something
so object knows something and object
does something so when you say object
knows something that means in your class
you have some variables let's say we
have int num1 then we have int num2 and
then we have int result so we have these
three values so this is what object
knows right so when you say you have a
calculator you will you will put some
values and then you will be getting the
output of output for that example when
you say 3 into 5 so you got those 3 2
values 3 &amp;amp; 5 and then
you got 15 in result again you have to
perform some operation for that but
that's how you can create a variable
slide so when you say object knows
something we're talking about the data
the variables then what next
object does something so object does
something with the help of methods now
how do you put a method here so we
simply say so the way you create a
method is let's say I want to perform an
operation let's say this is operation
now again it can be any operation or we
say simply perform and when you say we
have a with I mean perform so how it
works we have to say perform that's the
method name we have to provide this
round bracket this is how you define
that you are working with a method and
this is the bracket open back back it
flows so whenever you define a method
you have to make sure that you open the
bracket and you close the bracket now in
this method you can perform some action
but to define a method we have to put
some extra things now those extra things
is the written type this method is not
reading anything so we are writing void
again we'll talk about this later what
are different written types we can use
how to return a value from the method
but time remember we have void perform
and I want to access this from anywhere
so let me write just public again we'll
we have a total is discussion how to
access things later so we have public
void perform remember this thing is a
written type and this is the access
modifier so we have a perform method
here so this is your method name which
is performed and what we can do here is
we can say result equal to num1 plus
num2 so once you've got the values of
num1 and num2 we can actually add those
values here and then we can face the
value of result now question arise how
do you access this variables or these
methods from this main method because
see whenever you execute the code the
first line which will which will get
executed is this line the main function
or the method so this main method is the
first statement which will get executed
and you have to make sure that you are
executing everything step by step so
when you say you're executing this line
that means you have created the object
now once you create the object in the
backend there are lots of stuffs which
get which happens which we'll be talking
about later but remember whenever you
create object it will load lots of stuff
into memory it will load your variables
it will load your methods in the
now what next now once you've got the
object let's assign the value to num1 I
want to assign the value to number 1 as
3 so what I will do is I will simply say
num 1 equal to 3 but that's not the case
here the problem is so num 1 is declared
inside calc and we are using that that
obvi are using that num 1 inside object
demo now can be used directly and the
answer is no now since we have two
different class we cannot directly
access the variable to access this num 1
which is declared here we need to make
sure that we are using obj dot so obj is
a reference right so we have to whenever
you want to refer to a variable made to
use the object reference there in this
case which is obj now what next let's
say assign I want to assign value to
num2 same applies here so we have to say
obj dot num2 let's assign 5 so we got
these two values here now let me just
print the value of result so I will say
obj dot result and now if you can see i
am putting those two values num1 and
num2 3 &amp;amp; 5 and then I am trying to print
the result now by default if we run this
code without performing any action you
can see we are getting the value as 0
it's because by default the value of
result here is 0 now this is not the
case in C programming right in C
programming we get garbage values okay
so in C programming if you don't assign
the mandatory to a variable it gives you
a garbage value but in Java it doesn't
happen that way in Java we get all the
integer values will be getting a value
of 0 now who is responsible to clean
your garbage that we'll see later we
have a separate topic on that and the
topic is follows garbage collection
which we'll see in this chapter itself
when you are trying to bring the result
value which is it is giving you 0 right
because we have not assigned it the
value so what we'll do is we will not
assign the value right we will simply
perform an action will say obj dot
perform now once you say oh we should
perform it will call this method and
this method is adding those two values
normal and num2 which is three and five
which is eight and it is getting
assigned to result and now for in this
code you can see we got the value as 8
so that 8 is the value of result so
that's how you use a class and the
object so first of all you have to get a
class now class can have two things the
variables
the methods so this is variables and
this is methods and the way to access
those it is with the help of object so
in order to use variables and methods we
have to create the object we can assign
the values like this we can call a
method by using the object reference and
then we can print the value as we want
so that's how you create a class and
object in fact we can create multiple
objects here that we'll see in the next
