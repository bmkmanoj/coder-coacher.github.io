thing okay jump off the cliff and build
your wings on the way down now this is
what I believe from a long time in fact
of it I mean I like this position today
I have working on as a corporate trainer
I am a youtuber just because of this
thing jump off the cliff and build your
thing on the way I've never planned
anything in my life you know I was never
sure about what I'm gonna do because
there are lots of people they don't have
up lined with them I mean some people
they do have a plan you know they will
they think ok we have a complete we will
do this we will do that then we'll go
somewhere I was not having a perfect
plan but then I used to believe in this
concept if you want to if you want to be
something in your life you have to grab
the opportunities there are two ways of
grabbing the opportunities the first way
is you have to you know first you have
to prepare yourself get ready for the
opportunity and the moment somebody
knocks on your door and say hey I have
this thing for you if you are prepared
for that you of course you will say yes
right that's how you you get the
opportunity the second way is if someone
says hey I had this thing for you you
might be do you might not be ready at
that point now you have two answers you
can say no I I can't do that or you can
say I can do that the discus if you say
yes if you can do this let's go to the
first scenario if you said no you lost
the apaches right but anyway you are not
profile for that but what if you say yes
in this scenario if you say yes at least
you have a chance to prepare for that
right is it a good thing or a bad thing
let's start discuss about that
you tell me so VI in the comment section
now so I will give you time you tell me
if I'm not really ready for the
opportunity I mean I want to I want to
get that stuff I want to achieve that
thing with the positive which I'm
getting but I'm not ready so what you
think should we go for it or should we
skip it or should we wait for the next
opportunity which we are ready for oh
let's see what you say okay so people
are discussing about other stuff and
waiting for your answer guys so the
hammock says why not Weber says go for
it great
okay so everyone says okay okay but we
got one person who says skip it okay
okay so let's discuss about my thinking
let me tell you my experience there was
a time you know I wanted to be a
corporate winner so I was planning to I
mean not planning but then I wanted to
be a corporate trainer I was at some
point when I was working for a company
we used to have caught between us there
and I used to always get amazed by those
experie of teaching and they'd the way
that I used to talk they used to express
their knowledge I just I wanted to be a
corporate trainer then then once I got
the opportunity I was I should remember
I was it was 7 a.m. in the morning and I
was doing nothing at that day I was free
I got a call from one of the agencies
and they said I mean consultant he said
you know we have a training requirement
for you I say ok that's that was my
first opportunity and but the problem is
I was not ready for that I was not ready
for the training but I think I thought
ok I have I have one week to do that I
mean I might be getting one make one
week off for time to prepare for that
and the guy said hey you have to take
our training today at 10:00 a.m. in the
morning it was 7 a.m. when I got up I
was having 3 hours now I had to choice
that I should I could have said no I
can't do it because how can you prepare
for 3 hours
he said the topic is Java code Java and
I was knowing Java I mean quite a bit I
said yes I went for the training and
that was my first training experience
and it was awesome right since I've
given my first first training I got the
second winning back-to-back and then I
go I'm getting lots of training over
that so that's the first thing I said
yes and that's why I'm a called between
now if I say no I don't know when work
the next up next opportunity would have
knocked my dog right second scenario I
just I you should train on Co Java so I
was I was pretty good on Co Java and I
was good with savage espn's well a
sandwich sublet JSP and saw the JSP as
well and one day I got a call and they
said ok you have to teach at once Java I
said yes I know without thinking I say
he SIDS and they said you know in this
you have to also teach spring hibernate
at that point I was not doing all this
technology so I was like I mean I was
knowing something about it but not
everything stream is lagging stream is
lagging all right ok so yeah so I got a
I mean I was not trying spring and
hibernate completely so what I did I
said yes
I mean dinosaur that's what that's a via
thing you know I I was not doing those
technology I said yes it was a risk for
me I don't know is it a good thing to
reveal this on internet but let's let me
do that it's it's been a long time
actually so I said yes and I was having
approximately 15 days to to prepare
myself for the advance entire course so
in first 10 days I was busy with other
training so I was not able to get enough
time to prepare but it lasts five days I
mean just before the training what I did
I learned spring I learned hybrid night
and in five days I have learned
everything so that I can train there it
wasn't a good training for my site
because I have just learned it and I was
teaching so it was not that helpful for
the for the participants
I cannot say not helpful but then it was
not perfect but then that was start
right I have compared the advanced
entire framework in five days it is
which is almost impossible if you want
to learn an example let's say if I want
to learn about spring and hibernate
today is it possible to finish them in
five days not exactly because I don't
have a deadline now right and what I
will do I will spend to us through it as
soon as a day which will take me around
two to three weeks to complete
everything even if I am giving three
three hours a day but I was not having a
choice right so when you don't have a
choice that's the only choice you have
you have to work hard on you have to
prepare so what I did I jumped I jumped
off the cliff and I built my own things
of it and on the way down so that's how
I learned you know that there's one way
to prepare yourself is to jump off the
cliff and for sure you will you will you
will survive not every time but then 99
percent you will survive okay one person
there's a risk that you will lose
something but that's fine this is the
board this is the time you have to take
risk right so I jumped and then I got to
learn different technologies student do
I do those things not fully I
because I see earlier I was not having
any what you say reputation in the
market now I do have applications I
cannot take much list now but then
initially when you are in your starting
of your career you can do that right
okay so how can we how I implemented
this for training or for teaching others
I so when I give training in corporate I
do this you know I'd I could give them
project and you have to work on it
doesn't matter what how you do it you
have to do it because the moment I say
you have into it they know they don't
have a choice why they will build it I
did the same thing with the classroom
training went once now the most
important is why I wanted time talking
about this today is last two last year
or I mean you had three years back
actually I I was thinking about you know
I wanted my mom to learn YouTube how to
use YouTube because she was watching TVs
and you know write all those TV serials
those are weird stuff so I thought okay
let's let's I mean if she learns how to
use YouTube now she will she will watch
amazing videos on YouTube you know how
to cook different dishes how different
way of you know different tech tips how
to keep I mean different tips why
different you got the point right so I
wanted her to explore YouTube I tried to
teach her YouTube so what I did I bought
a mobile phone okay so I bought a mobile
phone Android phone for her and I was
teaching how to use YouTube how to use
mobile phone and she was like okay she
she she she used that phone for one hour
doing this doing that and she this was
the first time right and it always
difficult to teach your parents how to
use gadgets because they did a way of
working is different than yours right we
we are born in technological world so we
know how to use devices but these people
older people they don't know how to use
devices right so was teaching teaching
her she was like okay good device and
then good features Oh awesome
and then after one hour she kept in
mobile aside and started watching TV I
was like hell you know I bought a phone
just for her so that she can enjoy it
just imagine if I give you a phone now
right now if I give you maybe any any
phone maybe iPhone what will be a
reaction for next two days you will not
leave your iPhone right but what should
after
she kept a mobile aside so I thought
okay the only way to teach her how to
use YouTube is what I did I changed my
TV in any way that the attack TV was
about to you know I was about to die it
was not working properly so I bought a
new TV
but it stopped buying an normal TV I
bought a smart TV without any cable okay
without any cable connection so there is
no cable connection the only way to
watch that TV is internet right and it
was an Android TV it is an Android TV
and in which you have to open the
application you have to use YouTube I
mean if you want to watch if you want to
watch anything you have to open YouTube
and that's how she learned how to use
YouTube right because she was not having
any she was not having any choice right
she has to learn YouTube to watch all
those videos so what she did she used
that pointer and she opened YouTube and
she started searching for videos right
it was pretty difficult for her for
first two days but after that she was
amazing you know because she can watch
any video she can search for the videos
because that that money or that what you
say that remote was also having a
keyboard a QWERTY keyboard right so she
was able to type it she was able to
search all those things and she used to
watch my videos as well and she used to
get excited you know my son is coming on
TV finally it was a dream to watch me in
TV and it was possible so so that's
that's how I taught how to use YouTube
and now I have a spare machine is my
mush at my home you know I have a spare
laptop so I want to teach her how to use
a laptop so that second she can spend
some time with laptop I'm doing this
from a long time you know it's been
announced six to seven months now I'm
teaching her how to use a laptop but the
only problem is the moment I'd try to
teach her laptop she says okay it's good
and then after she goes to the kitchen
she goes to the hall and that's it never
come back for the laptop now the only
the only option I have is to I want to
teach her how to his laptop so the only
option is what I did I started a YouTube
channel okay one by u2 channel because
my mom is an amazing cook okay see the
only the only reason why I eat at home I
don't play polish on foods much
sometimes but then I don't preform much
but when I like before
whenever like some I prefer home for
because my mom is an amazing cooks of my
friends my my interns my employees they
know how good cook she is because
whenever you know whenever I take my
defend they are like wow awesome Tiffani
so she's a good cook so I thought let's
let's explore her you know what you say
her skills on YouTube now there will be
two advantages first now since she is on
YouTube civil she will learn different
dishes different way of making dish
second to upload a video on YouTube you
have to learn how to use computer right
you have you should know how to send a
video of her mobile phone to laptop
second how to use a laptop to to edit
that video and to upload that on YouTube
and for this you have to learn laptop
right so what I'm doing now I just so
what I did I she don't have any choice
now right so you don't have any option
now she has to learn she has to learn
how to use laptop right by the way I
forgot to mention about her channel so
I'm showing the link in the description
area guys just check out the channel if
you like it if you are if you are good
with if you want to learn how to cook
shake it that will be helpful let me
just say that on the in the chat window
so channel name is the risk of kitchen
yeah so the channel name is the disco
kitchen and if you have any session let
us know but the amazing thing is now she
don't have a choice right she has to
learn all this thing so I believe you
know if you want to learn something I
mean there are different ways of
learning there's one way just start with
it I know I mean if you just commit to
anything you want let's say if you want
to learn if you've got a project on
Hadoop and if you if you're if someone
says hey I want to build a project on
head you just say yes
I can do it let's start with it the only
problem is there's one percent chance
that you made those right yeah by the
way I shake the link in the chat window
the the channel name is telescope
kitchen just go there and do subscribe
we'll get motivated so in the telescope
kitchen you know we'll be having
different issues there and yeah so you
will learn different things
oh I can see we got four subscribers
that's great okay so do subscribe the
channel she will get motivated and if
she what gets motivated I will get good
foot to eight more and so okay so yeah
do subscribe our channel so that's
that's one thing I wanted to tell you
today okay so yeah this will start with
Q a now so we start with the Q a session
and finally I will see your questions I
can see there are lots of questions you
know the lots and lots of questions I
have to go up and up and up to city
questions so before starting the
questions make sure that you liked this
video because I can see we have one four
one one four people watching this and we
have only 50 how many likes we have
I'll just hold on
yeah we have 84 likes and come on guys
if you're liking this session token'
call the like button and I've shared the
link with you alright the technical
kitchen you have to subscribe you don't
have a choice right if you want to
support me you have to also support sell
you some kitchen because it's it's all
so we have we have we have multiple
channels now we have the risk or
learnings for this learning purpose we
have the risk or uncut for one purpose
you know if you go to my channel there's
a list there feature channel so we have
that his coin cut for fun we have to
risk our hardware if you want to learn
about hardware if you want to learn how
to repair the laptop because that is not
my cup of tea I cannot repair the laptop
I cannot keep me repair machines so I
asked my brother to help me with this so
he has a hardware shop in Mumbai ok if
you are a Mumbai you can just go to
Pandu pan you can repair your laptop
there with a good discount of course you
got a scope discuss the sky buzz right
yeah so what he is doing is his
departing those laptops and he is
uploading those videos on YouTube so you
can at least even if you don't want to
repair your own laptop you will know
what are the parts are that inside a
laptop and I have seen this you know
that even if your IT world there are
lots of people they don't even know how
to open a laptop how what what other
parts are there inside a laptop so
that's a good thing to know and we have
in some kitchen now where you will learn
about different dishes
right ok so that's about the thing let's
start with the question so the first
question is always the question everyone
saying hi hello thank you thanks for
tutorials that's it thank you so much
salute oh that's great ok how do you how
to find best field in Sears best field
are talking about which I mean which
technology you want to work on droid you
want to be a programmer or a tester so I
believe initially when you are learning
your when you are doing your graduation
you should learn everything oh no you
should be jack of all because if you see
if you decide you want to be a
programmer and if you don't learn
testing you will not even know that you
love testing it may happen that you love
testing more than programming how do you
know that so you in your car in your
college specially if you are learning
for the first time you should be
learning everything start to end
then you will realize what you love at
spend two months on each technology and
then you will realize because the two
men spending two months is not a big
time right in your four years three
years of degree you if you can spend to
two months on one technology that will
be awesome and you will get to know do
you love it or not so I would say I
cannot suggest you any any best
technology because everything is good
programming is good testing is good
hacking is good a designing is good but
then it depends upon your interest right
if I ask you if I say hey you have to be
a programmer and you you know you don't
like programming you will not survive
right so think about it
okay so assalamualaikum waalaikumsalam
Mahmoud shut up I hope I was that top of
what I pronounce it properly
do you know wave maker tool no I don't
have any idea on that wave maker no idea
just live okay okay so I have a pretty
good hand over on Java but I I want to
program Webber with it oh how do you
start it so this question is from Russia
Iqbal so you know Java you want to make
websites right so see when you talk
about apps when you talk about Java it's
only the code part right you know how to
build a kind of pencil based project
when you talk about websites in website
we have a front end and a back end right
so fronting is basically what a client
sees right HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery
and the backend is Java using servlet
and JSP you can do that so if you want
to be only in back-end learn subject and
JSP first that will be that will be
enough for you but then if you want to
build the entire website by yourself the
front end and back end I would suggest
first learn front-end learns HTML CSS
JavaScript I don't want you to be expert
in that but at least knowing those
technology will be helpful so first
learn HTML CSS JavaScript and then go
for serve it and JSP that's how you do
it okay so why both say is great title
sir thank you so much I hope you liked
it
now this is not a mic what actually this
is did you search who is the who quoted
this sentence this statement it's good
to give credits right
and this thing said by who
oh I'm not getting any oh it's very Brad
buddy Oh sounds like right video anyway
so it's a rave right buddy here's the so
he has given this coat awesome coat
anyway so next thing oh okay how I get
Spring Framework cause I don't have the
entire course on Spring Framework now
I'm but I'm still building that with
those that goes actually a bit busy with
other other things as well from from
Monday and going for one of the training
so for which I have to prepare a lot
right so soon the these course will be
out soon for spring framework but if you
think it will take some time okay so
which technology says which technology
you recommend for web development react
adagios angular for all of you Jia's see
everything you have then this then own
advantage and drawback and what are
those advantage drawback i don't know
but i know this thing every all this J's
framework they have their own advantage
now I guess react is backed by Facebook
so again there are lots of people that
using react so if you are confused I
would say go for react that's a good
thing but I'm still not sure you have to
consult someone who work in web
designing field Oh 132 people watching
this that's great so again if you're
liking this session do click on the like
button there guys and I can see only
nine people have subscribed to that is
for kitchen that's really bad so I'm
showing that link once again
in the chat window dueces cabochons you
guys okay so how I okay the next
question is from Aslam how I get
admission in spring badge oh there is no
spring match for next two months the
next match would be on the next one
month so the next batch would be in
September second week of September so
you will get the updates on my website
such as whatever site and you will get
the updates for the next batch okay next
from insane chickie Oh tada go okay so
hello sir this is Thiago lucky you your
new student oh that's great
I'm very lucky - oh there's no question
okay you're on the way lucky to be
learned here to learn here that's great
thank you so much
Mohamed shut up says sir I love you love
you - shut up that's not that sounds
Viet right okay
so David assist learn and that's what I
did with us okay next next next next
next question
Oh aslam says which one is best selenium
or drop drop tractor throw tractor to
learn I don't know
these are testing tools right I heard
about selenium no idea about float like
blow tractor no idea okay
Oh
next question from Moorhead how I learn
spring and hibernate oh they're not soft
videos now I will take ball fall spring
and hibernate at my time they were not
much this was available but now there
are lots of videos in fact if you can
just go to my channel I do have a
hibernate playlist I don't have every
video and hibernate but then you will
get the basics of it at least start with
the basics so watch my playlist on
hibernate and spring so just go to
channel so when you go to channel there
will be a playlist option so go to
playlist and search for hibernate and
spring playlist so there are two
different playlists watch those videos
that's how you will learn spring a
hibernate
okay well that is what I was okay next
question
okay so from new movies songs question
any any video of real time project and
its implement a deployment yeah I've
done that so I do have a playlist on my
channel so just just search for Java
development so it is Java web
development latest so so these are
there's a place called a Java
development and if you follow the entire
playlist I have talked about how to
build a project how to deploy that
project on Amazon web server I do have
that ok so next question
Siddartha Gupta on PC a student what can
I do for future company of this year ok
so the thing is in fact yesterday I made
a video on what I mean how to get a job
so if you're doing your BCA make sure
that you also do some project side by
side projects some freelancing projects
maybe some you up your own projects and
the upload those projects on github
because that's how recruiters will know
that how powerful you are learn about
data structures and algorithms in fact
in one of the one of the comment in the
earlier video was I was not talking
about the inner structures see those
things are actually very important when
you go for the interviews you know that
you have to learn data to design and
data structures and algorithms but the
thing is if you want to go for startups
if you want to go for companies or if
you want to go for companies where they
will check your skill set then data with
data structures you also need to have a
project back up with you I mean some
projects with you that's how you will
prove yourself if you don't have real
time experience there are some companies
they don't hire people who don't have
political project experience maybe a
small project but I'll put some some
project so build some projects 90 -
structures and what else search for the
internship if you can find okay so you
know it's a question from soon on so I
am working in software company in my
company I'm working with JavaScript I
wish to switch my job to Big Data
is it possible to get a job in Big Data
and should I study any online course yes
are you can you can switch to Big Data
anytime
it's a new technology and that lots of
vacancies available so what you can do
is get certified so there is a Hadoop
certification all up artists pass
certification get certified and you will
get a job certification is not
compulsory you can you can go for local
certification also but then having
advantage what you say international
certification will be helpful so yeah so
go for that so that will be better okay
so so why do you stay I stayed on by
okay so which programming language is
required to build an application for K a
eye opening system what's that I
focusing on I talking about kaalia
kaalia operating system maybe Python
Python is good for Linux okay good
evening sir
I want to know about which language
should I learn to get a job in field see
every language is better if you are
learning PHP if you are learning Java if
you're noting c-sharp every language
will give you a job but question arise
what you want to do so if you want to
get into enterprise world go for Java if
you want to get into startups go for
JavaScript I mean the mean stack Joe
asked that go for you go for JavaScript
that is something which everyone needs
now so now in JavaScript if you want to
get into startup okay next question
Amit Gaul says hello saw want to meet me
I mean oh you want to meet I want to
meet you okay so you want to meet me
okay that's possible you are meeting me
live now online but well you ready to
stage or mid okay how to prepare for
ocjp exam okay so first of all you have
to get you have to join a course I
believe you know if you really focusing
on it but on it so see GP exam get a
cause because the problem is if you
prepare by yourself and if you can get
dumps for that that's awesome but if you
don't get it done and if you if you
prepare by yourself the moment you give
the exam if you get failed that's an
issue right you are losing your entire
fees or you're losing that entire cost
so I would say go to join
join kosis maybe online courses offline
courses make sure that you get good
reviews on those courses because there
are lots of freaky to it nowadays they
will take your fees that they will not
train you on anything right so yeah so
make sure that you check the reviews
first and then do it okay next okay
sugar cannot say is that all I'm saying
a I will take over the market and Java
will be of no use is it true okay the
answer is yes let's talk about the first
part a I will take over the market yes
in future everything will be AI but will
it take the job market no because if you
want to build AI system you have to use
some programming language right so Java
will be there don't worry it's just that
yes a I will be in AI will be there in
the future okay I can see 163 people are
watching this is it 163 Oh 127 people
are watching this so if you have joined
the session just now just make sure that
you click on the like button there okay
next question is how cyber security
career it has a good do it it really has
a good career option cyber security
because there lots of companies they
want to make sure that they have some in
build they have the in-house team with
them it has a very good career the only
thing is are you interested if you're
interested go for it okay Vikram say is
about IOT what IOT about what I'm
confused with the career opportunities
as men know how to program in Java CS is
how much I will get from this knowledge
see learning things are different than
implementing so what I want from you is
don't just learn things also implement
it because if you don't implement this
its of no use right so once you have
learned all the technologies HTML CSS
PHP C C++ build something if you build
