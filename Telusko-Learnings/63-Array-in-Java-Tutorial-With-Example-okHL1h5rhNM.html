about array so we have seen the theory
of array and this will talk about the
implementation
now our what we'll do is we'll take five
elements of five integer values so
instead of showing those five values in
two variables we can store those values
in one variable and that one variable
will be an adding so how to get in a day
so we'll say first way to specify the
data type and then you have to mention
the variable names so we are using a as
my array and we have to provide this
bracket now this square bracket defines
that a is not a normal variable
it's an variable which carries some
values not one value it will take some
value and that's why we use this a a
square bracket and the type of this
values will be int now since an is in
Java there are objects because in array
in C is different arrays in Java is
different because arrays in Java is
object so in order to create object we
have we require a new keyword and then
you have to specify which type of array
you need we need an array of int
elements then question arise how much
elements will say we want five elements
so we have created an array of five
elements now in order to assign the
values you're adding has now five values
so it will have five values and the
first value so if I know differentiate
between different values where you
specify some number so every value will
have a different number and that number
will be called as index number so what I
mean by that is let's say you have five
values so let's say five values are let
in comment values are two six eight four
and one so if these are my values my
index value for this will be I need to
assign an individual number to each and
this value so we will say first one is
index zero second is one two three four
so in Java or in any concept your value
will have a index number and the index
number starts with zero so the last
number value will be the size minus one
so if your size is five so the last
value will be four so these are my
values and these are the index number
now if I'm to assign the values it's
very easy you have to say a since I want
to assign the value and to assign the
value - but where - the first location
which is 0 then I had to assign a value
to let's say a sex in this second as the
second value will assign to will assign
to the third value we'll say this is 8
and then we'll say a of T will be this
will be your 4 and then a of for this
value will be your 1 so this is how we
have to assign all these values clear
now once you assign all these values we
can we can print this values now in
order to print all these values we need
to use so we'll use will say us out now
if I say print a the problem is if you
try to print a let's see the output
first so if you are thinking the output
will be 2 6 8 4 1 let's see let's let me
have this file and make some time
alright so the output is this Oh what's
this not now this is not a value this is
a hash code because a day in Java they
are objects right and every of when you
try to print object it will print the
hash code but now you are here I want to
print the values right so in order to
bring the values we need to say we need
to specify the index number if you
specify index number as 0 it will print
the first value so if I run this code
now the output is 2 if I want to print
let's say forthe last element so I have
to specify a of 4 so if I run this file
the output will be 1
yeah but let's say I want to put in all
the values so I'm specifying all
different statements you will see we had
to write this right we have to print 5
statement first will be a of 0 then a of
1 then a of 2 and then this goes on in
start doing that what we can do is we
can use only one statement and we can
run the same statement continuously with
the help of for loop so in folder by to
specify the starting value
which is zero and then I had to end it
at less than 5 which is 4 and I plus
plus any chef and then we can we can
just use the curly braces here but since
we are using only one statement inside
for loop we know what we don't need
curly braces and shoves EDA will say I
so it will print all the values from 0
to index to 4th index so if I run this
code now and these are your values right
so this is how you have to implement the
array so we'll do some more or this more
detail work in this in subsequent
tutorials so thank you so much for
