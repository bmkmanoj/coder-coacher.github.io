instead of using internet splitter let
me use a firefox and now if i don this
code so let's run this code it will it
will open my firefox so you can see when
you learn this code it will give you a
welcome and it will give you a text
field where you can enter your value and
once you enter the value you can click
on add so let me first enter a value
will say five okay and click on add you
can see five is getting here so these
values are coming from list and the size
of your list is one let me add one more
element it says 65 ad you can say 65 you
are saying is it in ascending order now
if you type even one it will one it will
add one to last the size of your list is
three now let's run this with six okay
now you can see we have four elements
what if I remove this I want to remove
this one so just simply type one and
click on oh let me click click on this
one and if I click on remove it will
four it will remove the first occurrence
and in fact if I type sex if I click on
remove it will remove the first
occurrence which is six so now we have
three elements right so even if i
refresh this page
give me either of course even if I the
first this page you will get the same
output that means your list is not
getting clear let me close this let me
run this again provided it will not
clear everything deployment done you can
see the elements are still there that
means this is the street full its
because you are maintaining a state of
or the least so this is how we need to
achieve a state full session bean so the
steps you have to remember first you
have to create a web project in that
first you have to create a remote
interface which because stateful session
bean works with remote interface to
create a remote interface create an
interface and provide an intuitive
annotation which is remote provide some
methods then you have to create a class
which will implement that interface so
simply say implement
study interface name now since we want
to provide a stateful session bean we
have to use our annotation called a
stateful and define all the methods then
in this method you can add or remove or
you can return all the elements and then
to test this we need a client page which
is index dot JSP in index dot JSP first
thing you require is this GSP in it is
because when you run this DC page the
first function it will call is GSP in it
in which I want to create the object of
initial context using which I can search
for the implementation which is least
element using a method called as lookup
which belongs to I see the object of
initial context it will give me the
object of my interface which is least
elements remote now once you got the
object now you can check which button
was clicked
is it a denim or remove numb so if it is
Adam you have to add the element which
is provided by the user on in your text
field if it is remove numb it should
remove the element provided by the user
and then if you want to put in all the
elements you can use a enhance for loop
to print all the elements and then it
will print so this is how we need to
achieve a stateful session bean so I
hope you are clear with your EJB session
so in the first video it was stateless
then the subsequent two subsequent
videos for stateful so this was
stateless and stateful of the session
bean and do subscribe for the further
videos thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
