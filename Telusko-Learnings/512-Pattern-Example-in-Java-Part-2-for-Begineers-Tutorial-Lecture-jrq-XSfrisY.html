tutorial we have talked about a pattern
in which we have zero so we want then 0
1 then 1 0 1 that pattern and this will
move towards this to this this pattern
so which is 1 then 2 2 then 3 3 3 so
earlier we have created this video so if
you have not watched this video of this
pattern so I will recommend to watch the
part 1 of this tutorial since this is
part 2 so this is what we have created
right so to create this what we need is
we need two loops one is outer loops
again is inner loop so outer loop is
responsible to print the number of rows
and inner loop is responsible to print
up number of columns so we are printing
this with the help of this logic and
this what we need to print is we just
need to print the number so I should
hope one of this is 0 0 1 we have 2
plain to do in the third row we have to
print 3 3 3 which is a third row in
photo we have to print 4 force and and
5th we have to print 5 ok so the number
of the number will be the the count will
be the number of rows right so in first
row we have to print 1 1 in second row
we have to print to tools in third row
we have two prints 3 please
so the pattern remains same the value
changes that means the the loop remains
the same the logic changes so in this
logic what we to do is instead of using
any if conditions is straight forward if
you can focus we are actually printing
the row number so if you see this is
first or the second of this third row so
in order to paint the row number what we
can simply print is I with some space so
we'll say I plus a space so what it will
do is have to print the number of rows
okay now if we run this so this is the
pattern you want it right so this is the
part 2 and we got the pattern so we have
to use a for loop which is which this
will count the number of rows this will
call the number of columns and then we
have to print the
the number and that's it from this video
so do subscribe for further videos thank
you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
