tutorial we have talked about single
dimension array and this will talk about
two-dimensional array so it is
two-dimensional so let me use some
comment to specify what I mean by to
damage so let's say I want to save a
value let's say 1 to the 4 5 so instead
of so interest or let's say 4 1 2 4 if
you store these values instead of using
4 different variables what we can do is
we can use one added so let's say I am
using an add a a to save this values now
so let's say I want one more array
called s be in this be at let me store
value 8 9 4 5 ok and I need one more
array which is C in which I will store
values as 1 5 9 6 so I want this 3
eddie's and each other will have 4
elements so what is an added a des is a
collection of elements right so this
array is also collection of elements and
all this elements should be of same type
but let's say what if you combine all
these arrays since we are using a
concept of a day which means instead of
defining 4 different variables with if
they have a same type you can use an
array so if you can focus on this add is
ABC thereof say they are of same type so
what what if we can just combine all
these three add is to form one array as
D this D array will have elements which
is 1 2 3 4 it will have element 8 9 4 5
it will have element 1 5 9 6 so you can
say this is at a a this is at a B and
this is added C so this add ad here is
an array of adding so it's an array of
added so this this a is it's an array of
integers this B is the array of integers
this D here is an array of arrays so
what we can do is we can we can use
something called as two-dimensional is
so we can specify it as 2 damage
but how to use the that we'll see in the
next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
