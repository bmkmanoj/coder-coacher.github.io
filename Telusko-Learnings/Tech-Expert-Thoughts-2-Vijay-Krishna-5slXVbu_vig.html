great so hello everyone
uh I just went to verify my voice there
on YouTube is it properly audible I'm
not sure let me just refresh the YouTube
page just to verify if I'm properly
audible there and it still says I'm not
live what's wrong oh it's very alive
yeah like great and what about the voice
quality is it good okay
the watch is also good great so hello
everyone welcome to the next tech expert
thoughts and this time we have BJ with
us and I'm excited for the second
session where so from the first one the
first experience now we are into a
second session and hoping for the good
sessions so let's hear it from Vijay
here
hello Vijay I know we first of all
thanks for giving me this opportunity to
talk to you talk over here let me just
introduce myself I work as a software of
the big players in the travel domain and
I started working with object-oriented
technologies around four years ago
initially as a test engineer and then
now I work as a dev engineer prior to
being a object-oriented technologies
developer I was a database developer for
like five to six years and on the daily
basis I get to work with the following
technologies on the back end I work with
Java and spring I also get to work with
Big Data technologies like spar and
Hadoop and I also get to do some unit
testing using some unit testing
frameworks like testing gej unit mockito
etc I am NOT an expert on the front end
technologies but I get a tablet in with
with JavaScript and I use Jenkins for
CICE pipeline so those are the
technologies that I get to use on a
daily basis and that's what you do when
you have so many things to say you have
just have to verify you
to file you know multiple things about
this you don't remember things you know
it's you know but that's a huge number
of experience you have great so sure I
can talk a little bit about the
buzzwords that I have been hearing since
I started working with object oriented
technologies in a big company that might
help whoever is trying to break into the
industry like this gives them an idea of
what things they should know so this is
like around four five years ago I you
know we started hearing all about cloud
computing and AWS and stuff so as a test
engineer at that time in a services team
I had to know how to push the suicide
code to ec2 instance in AWS and how to
use chef to you know do configuration
management and that kind of stuff if I
you know come forward to today I have to
know the different AWS offerings as a
dev engineer to be you have meaningful
conversation with your manager or your
architect you need to know what the
different AWS offerings are what the
different databases that are available
in AWS what is the cash available in AWS
photos you know what is a security
authentication framework that is
available in AWS if you know all that
you can have a very meaningful
conversation you can choose your
technologies properly that's where we
are with cloud computing these days and
I guess also a buzzword that is thrown
around a lot is micro services people
talk a lot about you know moving
monolithic big services into micro
services just because here all mostly we
are all working in an agile environment
so that means we want to make changes to
our services debug our code quickly and
get into production as soon as possible
and breaking down big monolithic
services into smaller micro services
helps is helps the team achieve that
goal and another thing another buzzword
that is thrown around a lot these days
is machine learning and artificial
intelligence from my industry itself one
of the one of the use cases that I can
mention is so the if you could talk
about machine learning and artificial
intelligence and if you have a
conversation with yourself you see why
is it why is it important these days so
everybody has services but the point is
if I make this smarter they may try to
make this services cater to the audience
like like for say if somebody is
searching for a flight and they have a
child like an infant with them they're
going to travel with an infant you want
your application to return so only those
results which are which are relevant to
that particular customer you don't want
so it's not all about you know being
relevant to your customer giving what
your customer wants and that way and
that is all these machine learning
algorithms which are continuously
learning from the data that now you are
Big Data technologies of providing so
that is the significance of machine
learning and artificial intelligence
these days so that is some of the buzz
words that I wanted to you know covered
and I wanted you know anybody who's
trying to break into the industry to
know these terms so otherwise if you all
have any questions I'm happy to take
them
okay that's great LBJ in fact before
anyone asked a question I have a
question from my side you know in fact I
this question a lot from different
people you know one of my one of my
passion is to learn new things in fact
whenever I get some time I always try to
learn new things currently I'm learning
some technology and then maybe after one
month if I get something new I will
start learning that it doesn't matter if
it will be helpful for me or not what
let's say you're working as a full-time
and then once you get a new project and
of course in a company you will not get
a chance to work on technology which you
love you have to work on those things
which a company offers in fact you you
if you have also discuss about this
thing right so how do you cope up with
all those things let's say if a company
if your manager says or if your company
says hey which day tomorrow we I mean
next week we are going for a new project
where you may have to work on a new
technology so what will be even approach
at that point knowing that's a great
question and it's very relevant to what
is happening in the industry today just
because I know this because I'm going
through this what I I feel is right now
it we are in a year we are in a scenario
where it is about continuous learning
you can never say I'm done with college
that's it I'm not going to learn
anything right now that is not how it
works
you have to continuously update yourself
with technologies on your own time that
is the only way you can stay relevant
and the good thing about this is in the
market right now you have so many
offerings you have so many online tools
you have so many sites where you can go
and you know you can choose the
technology that that is more relevant to
your career and pick up and done it just
to name a few I don't know if it's OK to
name a few satisfied you can go and
learn you know that is udemy there is
Udacity there is team treehouse
there is lynda.com you know there is all
these sites where you know you can just
create an account for yourself obviously
we'll be paying something on a per month
basis or a yearly basis and you can
choose the technology that you want to
learn and go ahead with it and one of
the drawbacks though with those sites is
that it won't be interactive if you want
an interactive learning experience then
you might you have to choose for
somebody like knowing thankfully
promotion
so yeah if you want to make it more
interactive you can you can attain some
live sessions or maybe some classroom
training okay great so you're that bad
most my backed by my coach and the I
earned a great answer you can multiple
that funds I believe alright the way I
mentioned you have udemy you have
Udacity so it doesn't matter you know
nowadays it's not about college course
if it's not about what others say you
have to learn it's about if you want to
learn something this is how able is just
that how you want to learn exactly yeah
it's all about your hunger it's all
about your you know your desire to do it
that is the only limiting factor these
days yeah okay
thank you for thank you for that answer
that was my question okay and now we
have so many questions here in the chat
window before that I can see we have 127
people matter watching this and 35 likes
that's great so everyone if you enjoyed
the some of sessions look in the like
button because that's what motivates me
and that's what will motivate our
experts here to you know join in future
as well so if you're liking this
obsessions look a like button there that
like is very important and let's get
started with the questions of
participants here and the first question
so Vijay I'm sure with each I shared
with the questions there on the chat
window on hangout at what experience you
move from QA engineer to dev engineer
and what bosses you have followed I was
a test engineer for like a couple of
years and when I was a test engineer I
kept contributing to the dev team and
that is the process that I followed to
become a dev engineer I always knew I
wanted to be a Division II because prior
to being a test engineer with object in
particular into technology that was a
dev engineer database developer so I
knew I enjoyed being a developer so I
always knew I wanted to be a developer
and the process that I followed was do
my test work and then also help the dev
team you know with the dev work and that
way I got recognized
that I could do that work and I you know
got the Deaf designation it's all about
making your team win so that is what's
the year to go oh great
in fact this question was from Sam rod
and just to repeat the question if
people don't know the question it is at
what experience you've moved from QA
engineer to dev engineer and what
process you have followed can you
elaborate more so that was the answer
given by Vijay now which is next
question for you is from Ganesh and the
question is which the question is which
is better framework spring or hi bunny
to learn I think there I mean you have
to learn them in tandem it's not like
you can just know spring and you'll be
your bird or you just know hybrid they
serve two different purposes but they
work together and gentle so you have
hibernate is used so it's a / rm2 so you
have to know hibernate so you can you
know connect to a database and do some
transactions and spring is you know it
does a lot of things makes a lot of
things easier for you as a web developer
you have to know dependency injection
and so it's not like should I learn
spring or should I learn hibernate you
should learn port and I would say you
could learn hibernate before you
actually start learning spring but in
the end if they will work in tandem like
any company these days they did you
spring and hibernate together right -
that we have yeah just try to that we
have also we also have spring or them
that's spring modules so let's say if
you want to walk with it up is you have
to choice either you can use spring
Teddy PC or you can use Plinko are them
and then if you're using or them then do
you not do not have a choice you have to
learn how wouldn't so that's why we just
so we can use that in combination like
that in fact that's what I think that's
what you are using in your company right
data JPA spring boot and stream data
Jake miso oh great and in that case I
burn it what okay so we were the next
question from Narayana and the question
is I do I don't know about the how do
you pronounce that name
qu or tabular BI tools let's give a
short note so any any points on that I'm
not sure about those tools so where I
work at we we don't use we try not to
use at least in my team we try not to
use VI tools because if I have to use
tableau if a company has to use tableau
or click you we have to pay for the
licensing cost for it so we try to build
our own dashboards on top of the data
and we do that using we have done that
in the past using node.js and JavaScript
frameworks so I have not directly used
click you and the reason for that being
to use some BI tools like cube here and
die blue you have to pay for licensing
costs and that is that can get pretty
costly okay great thanks for that and ok
we have a question one more question
which is from Raj so currently what
company are using Java and freshest in
Java should know to work in company yeah
so the question is basically is whatever
companies are using Java and if you're a
fresher
well that technology should know to get
into as a v8 or to the firm big
enterprise uses Java like Java is all
over the place and even if you want to
like I think the next big thing would be
like I think Java is here to stay it's
it's going to be relevant at least for
the next 10 years I guess and the
something that is this is a similar
based on JVM technology Scala I know my
company is trying to top Scala more and
more these days so even and it is
supposed to be a functional and object
oriented you know tech programming
language Java is is trying to move in
the direction but Scala is there
I mean Scala is a functional and object
oriented technology but I would say for
anybody who's trying to break into the
industry it's good to learn Java first
be an expert in one programming language
like Java and then try to branch off to
other languages rather than trying to
your master of multiple languages right
away
oh that's great so I know that's why in
industry it's not Java which is famous
JVM which is famous so everyone loves
Java because it is JVM right as pointed
by BJ
everyone loves JVM and we love Java
because Java runs on JVM and now we have
Scala we have Cortland which also works
on JVM so they will try to take over
some part of these and then yes the
first thing should learn is Java was
because if you know Java jumping to
Scala and Cortland is done I mean not
damn easy but then you can you can go
ahead to that yeah that's true ok ok we
got next question from Apple way by
Perez I think your question is about
should I use my sequel or post widget
yeah yeah yes I guess I lost you for
time man yeah like a night lost you this
yeah
always once asked if it was my sequel or
post 3 for the job before I think it's
trying to build a site and we want you
once you know what kind of database you
should use I guess yeah hey Perez it
totally depends on the size of your
website I mean my sequel can run on your
machine my sequel can run in a clustered
environment in multiple machines and
your application to write to it so it's
not like should I choose my sequel or
should I choose possibly it's about you
know what you're trying to accomplish
what is the load what is the load on the
side that you the new foresee I assume
if you are just writing a small job
portal site or something for your own
you know to learn purposes then my
sequel should be Co data and you can
make it run on your own machine anything
connected from from whatever web
application that you are writing ok
great
you can hear me right VJ yeah I can hear
you okay so there was there was some
this guy to deal with my Wi-Fi so I just
reached back to my original i5 and
another as always and another point on
that question was you might also want to
explore AWS offerings for database and
you I mean AWS has something called our
IDP which is their RDS in the cloud like
nowadays everybody writes applications
and deploys their applications to the
cloud so you might want to you know
check over our DBS way yeah in fact a
good point which is so you know when you
learn something new is done it's I mean
not just learning it it's also
implementation yeah and if you can try
different things if you if you want to
if you really not sure about mask you'll
watch quiz just try it out I mean
whatever switch for you you can go for
that I guess there's no specific rule
that you should always use mask your
approach because I guess sometime it's
also about personal choice yeah yes yes
try it out and then we can go with that
okay nice now we got one more question
here which is okay I guess I missed one
question on the top so what can be the
trending technology next five to ten
years okay that's a very weird question
in the future yes Vijay what's your
thoughts it depends on in what area
because technology right now is a very
general term it could be in like if we
just take our own industry right if you
are working in the front end say there
are so many frameworks jaws 2 frameworks
that have come up in the last couple of
years here is if you know about you
might have heard about angular you might
have heard about react you might have
you know backbone all these new
JavaScript frameworks are just popping
up every every couple of months you hear
about a new framework and that is what
is being adopted so I think
JavaScript is a good language to learn
right now because it can be used as a
full stack language and in the backend
there are so many systems that are being
written in Java
and that will be maintained in Java and
that will be enhanced in Java so Java is
you know this is there to be relevant at
least for the next four five years and
you know they are doing a great job of
you know releasing new features so I
think I was going to stay relevant so on
the back end I would say Java and JVM
based technologies on the front-end
JavaScript and Java no longer is just
relevant to front-end right now making
it a full-stack language so it's a good
time to you know if you don't know the
ask if it's a good time to invest your
time in JavaScript
okay great in fact just to add on that
Gower point now recently Judge Michael
announced that they will give updates
Java updates in every six months thanks
to modular JDK now so they can update
JDK and hopefully a Java we'll be back
with multiple features wait and what
about and also about JavaScript you know
I was thinking about letting job that
was from a long time yeah it's a water
investment but I'm looking for time to
learn to our script awkwardly it's a
good point there you have you got one
more question which is from neat nickel
and the question is how to be expert in
Java as a Java programmer in Java SE and
Java EE so I guess nobody starts out as
an expert so it is a it's all with you
start you have to have you have to be
comfortable with the language and once
you start working with that language on
a daily basis you automatically
organically become an expert or
so-called expert in that language so I
believe that is the way to go oh great
okay next question just to make it fast
we have so many questions popping up and
the moment you answer one question we
get next one ten questions on the chat
so okay so next next question is should
I learn four back in Java or PHP what is
the oscillations I would say Java
because any company which has a decent
amount of visitors they are going to be
using j2ee
so I would say investor time I am
learning j2ee
rather than
HP that's my opinion oh yeah in fact you
know it's very important to put that at
the end it's my opinion you know once I
made a video about it that I I prefer I
prefer Java or over PHP and then in the
entire chat chat box or the entire the
comment section filled with hate you
know if you watch lots of fans of PHP so
nothing bad about PHP you know PHP is a
good language but in ten times market
it's all captured by Java exactly so if
you want to you know be the market then
why learn something just not whites
they've opted in the market you have to
be very diplomatic expenses okay the
next question is from is fun oh it's any
opening in your company
Vijay there are always lots of things in
my company first of all you need a US
visa right okay great
with that we have a next question which
is from nickel and the question is will
there be more than Java
I mean job opportunities for just
Scott's car developers I I don't know
about the scene in India I don't know
how much Scala is being adopted in India
but I think big product companies will
start moving towards Scala the only
thing that I see is like whatever you
can accomplish with like ten lines of
code in Java you can accomplish the same
thing with three or four lines of code
in Scala is it worth it
I mean is it but I see I just it might
be my experience because I'm used to
Java I feel like it's Java is more clear
more you know more intuitive whereas in
Scala you just because you you're
converting three or four lines of code
into one line of code that intuitiveness
that clarity is kind of lost but then
again it depends on what kind of you
know technology or what kind of team
that you're working in or what is your
main job
if you see four if you're going to be
working in a Big Data technologies and
if you're going to be working with spot
it's good to know Scala because it makes
it easy to write big data jobs in Scala
I have done so myself so I'm saying the
sort of experience that yes you might be
working with Big Data technologies learn
Scala if you are primarily going to be
working with web applications learn Java
but for any fresher I would say learn
Java first and then try to learn Scala
rather than the other way around
oh I can you know why is the richer I
can be really yeah I can hear my own
voice phone or come to your side maybe
some delays okay the next question is
from madhuri from Vettes okay from where
should I start to become a data a data
scientist so I am NOT a data scientist
yeah I don't think I can answer that
question well but I think the strong
points of the data scientist would be
mathematics and applied statistics
because they would know all about these
algorithms there are so many algorithms
that data scientists applied to no
separate the noise from the user from
the actual useful data so if that is
something that you enjoy doing then that
is okay great and I in fact now this
question is very bit controversial it's
from a mesh and the question is I want
to put two is two years of experience on
his resume a which tools are mandatory I
mean it's like faking you're faking your
and this is doing that on on on YouTube
[Laughter]
not to you know I mean you can say that
you are comfortable with these
technologies rather
and you know faking with if you are
actually comfortable with them because
anybody who knows about those
technologies can easily find out if you
actually know them or if you have just
added them on your resume
so you know if you want to keep your job
after getting your job then you should
not fake it on your resume but actually
know those technologies and if you want
to you know get a job as a Java
developer obviously you need to know
from so let's enjoy things you need to
know about spring and hibernate and all
those other jobs so okay great I'll just
just to update you Vijay we we also have
coming online watching this session oh
yeah so this question for you or Vijay
okay I get I hope you're not tired of
answering all these questions now I know
I'm fine yeah okay next question is from
other she'd a question is benefits of
getting Oracle satisfies Java grounds of
the case with you so she should it
depends on where you we're at what point
you are in your career I think
certification is important if you are
refresher it gives you credibility gives
credibility to your resume a so people
know that you have a minimum a case you
know this much so that kind of
credibility
it came ski resume but after like four
or five years or three or four years of
working in a technology then going and
certificated certified in that
technology itself is not that relevant
or useful unless of course you're going
to try and switch tracks like like I
tried to do from one database developer
to a Java but at that point I did go and
get certified in Java so like I said it
gives you credibility but it totally
depends on where you are in your career
okay great I will take three for three
to four more questions and then that
should be great because it's been we
aren't saying long a lot of questions
then it's been a long time we had we all
I mean almost half an arn ask so let's
take to this for more questions and then
we can wind up
so next question for you is about money
from someone and the question is okay
this one so mom how much I can earn
after after learning Android develop
development as a fashion in the company
and how to apply it depends on all about
money at the end yeah it depends on
which company it depends on where
because he and you know it all depends
on that I mean there are so many
variables
I would suggest I know this would be a
very idealistic thing to say but don't
focus on the money right now with your
refresher focus on what you like doing
do that and then if you're really good
at it money will come to you so that is
how I think about it just to add that we
have really famous code which is
initially you should work to learn and
later remove that L which is okay great
next question is from someone and the
question is are PHP and no Jay is going
to stop Java when it comes to a
development no Java will won't stop
because there are so many first of all
JavaScript and PHP won't scale in a
scaling is they show it once scaled to
the to the same scale as what Java does
today so they are not going to replace
Java or applications that have written
and j2ee what else was what else were
they asking about no J's no J's yes I
mean you know at least in where I work a
lot of SPS is what they call it single
page applications they are written in
node.js not not people Enterprise you
know web sites they are not written in
node.js so okay this is this is very
common question you know people want to
know about because everyone talks about
no J's nowadays you know why to learn
different languages different things I
mean some things and JavaScript engines
are using mean stack or using the
reactive J's nowadays you can do
thing but then again so there's a lot of
different views on it great great okay
so we'll take last two questions and the
question here is are tell me about
something about Hadoop and big data and
school I mean there's cup of be open
Paquita in future so everybody right now
they want to make their services smart
they want everybody right now everybody
has services but they want analytics on
those services and big data and all
those frameworks let's park and the
llamar as a developer you will work with
those frameworks you know they give you
data so you can make smart decisions and
why why why do we have them now and not
before because you know big data can
give you like it's not a it's not like
data that can be saved in order Latian
in DB it's huge amount of data which if
you intend to save you is probably save
your data warehouse or something like
that and the crunching of those numbers
is possible right now because of these
really fast frameworks like spark there
are in memory frameworks so there is a
big market for it but I think you should
be really good to work with big data you
should be really good with one of those
stadium languages or Python Python is
also a language that people adopt for
Big Data technologies and that's the way
to go yeah
in fact if you if you look at my chat
window on YouTube now in a lots of
questions are based on future what is
the future of PHP or some future of Tata
neighbors our future of big data so they
all imagine your ababa now Vijay okay
so again the question with that was what
what your thoughts on or dotted the I
say I have not worked on the darknet
market much so I cannot comment on
dotnet at least like 10 years ago or
five I would say six seven years ago
rocket was a big rage but right now
still Java is
this is a big player in the market the
trend that I see in at least in the u.s.
is like mid-sized companies they have
applications which are written and
talked net but financial companies and
big companies they still have GTE so
okay great and one last question which
are your thoughts on our blockchain oh I
have not used blockchain I have to learn
blockchain that is something that there
is something that I have to invest my
time on yes oh it is on it work on your
honor to-do list
yes okay and there's some questions
which I want to answer in a quick way
and those questions are why to learn ok
whatever the question allows the
question of what okay question is the
question is why don't some the question
is all something why to learn JSF let
JSP starts to spring and hibernate it's
because is the industry now everyone
bought I mean if you want to make an
application spring is the go-to
framework and if you want to work with
it abased then we either use spring JPA
a spring JDBC if you're using spring JPA
then you should know hibernate so it's
all three requisites to learn spring and
to walk on spring good I went is a
prerequisite starts - is not as a new
new thing in the industry now all the
projects which are based on starts - or
people who who love starts they will
they will then make the string and
starts together but then there's no need
to lunch starts now it's not that trendy
but yes if your job asked you to lunch
starts then do it don't have a choice
but then spring in High Point is it's
something you have to learn and to
understand spring in a basically like if
you want to implement spring MVC then
you need to have a knowledge of solid
and JSP that's why learning all those
things are important ok that one
question and okay so from image I'm
exploiting spring in hibernate and web
services I can I put two to three as
experience I know I believe you should
never succeed you never do that it's not
good for you it's not good for the
employer it's just that initially I
think you should apply the pressure and
that's fine is what the only thing will
be happening is you will get less famous
but if you know all this there's a good
chance that he was ready to prizes just
implement everything in the jobs that
your job
company know that your disability jobs
it's not just about how much you know
it's about how much you show I let them
know about your work and then for sure
you will get a good appraisal in future
I don't just turn don't cheat yeah so
that's that's all the questions and
thank you so much for answering all the
questions BJ your voice forty for
answering all the questions here and
being honest with the technologies it's
a great session with you I hope you
enjoyed your obsessions thank you thank
you Naveen thank you for giving me the
opportunity but we will not leave you
like that you just have to so and it any
thoughts up for the for the newcomers in
the industry or people who have just
joined the company any any motivational
thoughts or a lease on yourself persist
I mean it's not easy so first in
persistent space so keep trying and
things will happen for you that is my
biggest suggestion to anybody who's
trying to you know break into the
industry and you know and it's also
important to work smart and not just
work hard so try to look for experts you
can learn from and so that'll actually
shorten your shorten the time that it
takes to learn a technology rather than
you know trying to do everything by
yourself
so those are my two situations okay
