about post increment and pre increment
now just to start with post and pre
increment let's start an example so
let's say we have int a and the value
for a is 5 okay
why hey let's go for why a let's go for
I and okay what next
so once you have this value which is I
equal to 5 let's apply some operations
let's say I want to go for I equal to I
plus 1 and when you say I equal to I
plus 1 how it will evaluate is so it
will fetch the value of I which is 5 it
will add 1 to 5 which is 6 the value of
I will be 6 right so let's say s out and
let's print the value of I and if I run
this code and the answer is 6 of course
that's what we expecting right now just
to simplify this thing since this is a
line but you're adding on number to
itself so you are adding 1 to itself
right so in Java we have something on a
shorthand for this that we have seen the
last video or in the subsequent large
tutorials so this is a shorthand right
so it simply means I equal to I plus 1
so I should of writing I equal to I plus
1 we are simply saying I plus equal to 1
which means you have to increment I by 1
and any one you want to add only one we
can simply use this thing called as I
plus plus social fusing I plus equal to
1 we can use I plus plus right so now if
I run this the answer is 6 right so it's
the same thing
now what happens you know it's up to
this point it seems perfect but let's
say we have an example let's take int J
and then we are saying J value is I and
when you run this of course the value of
J will be on so you are printing I let's
print J so of course the value of J will
be 5 right because we are signing the
value of I to J but what happens when I
say I plus plus now as it seems this I
plus plus is same as I equal to I plus 1
right so what it should do it's a sign
it should increase an increment the
value of
I from five to six I should assign six
value to J and the output should be six
right that's what we are expecting here
and when you learn this code o we are
again getting a value which is five now
the problem is this thing here this is
called as post increment okay again how
this works we'll discuss it off in some
time let us say we have one more
something about us plus plus I now plus
plus I and I plus plus both will do this
operation but the name is so when you
have I plus plus so when you whenever
you have I plus plus it is called as
post increment and whenever you have
plus plus I this is called as pre
increment okay now since we know this
name let's try to print the value of
this so let's see the output of J and
the output is 6 that means whenever you
use I plus plus you're getting 5 and
whenever you use plus plus I are getting
6 it's because there is something called
as increment and assignment now whenever
you use plus plus I whenever you use
plus plus I it will first increment and
then it will assign and that's what is
called as pre increment so it is pre so
first it will increment and then it will
assign so when you are getting a value
of I as 5 it will first increment the
value since it is plus plus it will make
it 6 and then it was signed the value to
J and that's why the value of J here is
6 but what if we are writing a naught I
plus plus I which let's write I plus
plus in this case we are first assigning
the value and then we are incrementing
it now when you assign the value of I
currently value of I is 5 so J will get
5 and then I will increment now just
should to show the proof let me also
print the value of I okay and now if I
am the if I print the value of I so J is
5 and I is 6 right so we have J and I so
J is 5 because we are first assigning it
and then we
lamenting it so that's how post and pre
increment works but if you think it is
simple let's go for one more example now
let's say we have I equal to I plus plus
now what should be the output of I here
now since we don't have any J variable X
M of J let's focus only on I now it
seems very easy right we have a post
increment okay and then we assign the
value so what will the output so we are
we are guessing even if you assign a
value of I to I which is 5
we are still incrementing it right so
the I value of I should be 6 that's how
that's what we are guessing here so if I
run this the value still 5 why now the
problem is where do I say I plus plus it
will first assign right but you will say
ok what if you are assigning the value
we are still incrementing it right so
the ultimate value for I should be 6
that this is what we have done in the
last example where you have n 2j here
and we are still adding I plus plus when
you print I the value was 6
but in this but this time we are getting
value as 5 it's because using this
statement is same as this so when you
say I is equal to I it's something in
this way so basically you are using a
variable which is int temp the initial
value for temp will be I and then you
are incrementing the value of I okay and
then again you're saying I equal to temp
so this thing is almost same like this
you're doing this thing ok so now if I
comment this part see the output here if
I run this it still says 5 this is what
happening behind the scene I will say
how it is possible is because whether
you use post increment or any type of
increment assign the same value here so
it will first assign the value to I so
to imagine that's as a time bit will not
assign first it will fetch the value for
me here so he is fetching the value as
ensuring in temp then it is incrementing
so your value is getting
here once but the value which is which
you have fetch fetch to here which which
is five right and you are saying the
same value again and that's why wait in
five so this thing here is same as this
thing cool right so that's how you work
with forced and pre-increment so that's
it that's how you work with this so
