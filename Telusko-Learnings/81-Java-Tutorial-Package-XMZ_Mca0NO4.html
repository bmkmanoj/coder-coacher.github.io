welcome back aliens this is not even 20
from political earnings and in this
video we'll talk about packages now in
Java if we talk about in big classes so
they're like approximately thousands of
classes which is in build right so if we
talk about the jay-ar in which you have
lots of in build classes we can also use
third-party classes right example if
you're working with JDBC you're working
with servlet you're working with all
different frameworks we use external
libraries right so what they do we have
different different classes and we
classify those classes depend upon their
they're working depend upon their use so
we will put those classes in one
particular folder example all the IO
package or all the IO classes which is
in portable classes will be inside our
package all the networking classes so
like socket sawa socket this will be
inside dotnet package and then let's say
you're walking with JDBC so it will be
all the classes on interface will be
inside job at our SQL package now what
that means is we have all these classes
classified in a particular format and
they're putting into one particular
folder and that folder in Java the
apalis packages now why we require this
package package concept why not put all
different classes all the files in one
particular folder you know what we do as
humans or as music listeners so what we
do we we have in your computer if you
have a Windows installation so in will
people be having D Drive e Drive right
our C Drive is OS the D Drive will be
multimedia and inside your D Drive what
we'll have we have songs we have movies
we have games and inside songs if we go
to songs there will be new songs old
songs and inside then we'll be having
inside new songs will be having sad
songs motivational songs will be holding
all those stuffs right inside sad songs
will be having ultimate sad songs will
be having mild sad songs so for a
particular song it will be love the one
folder right so let's say you want to
listen to okay any extreme sad song what
you will do you will go to your D Drive
you will go to music you will go to new
songs we will go to sad songs and inside
that you will go to ultimate sad songs
right this is the path you will follow
that means if you want to listen to all
ultimately sad songs you will go to that
particular folder play all so when you
say play on you're talking about
all extremely sad songs let's say you
are very happy now and you want to
listen to any rock music you will go to
a top folding and then you will say
select all and play now you don't want
while playing rock song you want to
listen to our side so of course not
right so while your mood is rocking you
should listen to rock rock songs and
that's why you should classify all these
songs as per that type right in the same
way all your classes and interfaces in
Java they're classified in particular
folder and that folder is called as
package now question is if you are
creating your own package what you
should name it you need to make sure
that whatever package you create should
be unique toward avoid example if you
talk about the i/o package in Java this
Java dot IO which is unique throughout
the world right no one no one has a
package which is Java dot IO now let's
say you want to create your own package
what it should be so if you if you keep
it demo what will happen is other people
will also have this name demo right how
to make it unit so your package name
should be or it must be the middle of
your domain name so let's say if your
domain name is google.com so your
package name should be calmed at Google
makes sense right because if you have a
domain name which is unique toward avoid
example google.com is unique right no
one else has a google.com domain other
than Google so if they have a package
which is comped at Google for sure no
one can replicate that package name now
if I talk about my website so my website
name is Paris for comso package name I'm
using for my project is chrome dot
telescope so I made sure that no one
else in the world will be using the same
package now this is very important when
you when you talk about Android projects
when you talk about maven projects so
because we need a unique package name
there so that's how you have to provide
a package name so you can also put
package inside a package you can say
chrome dot telesco dot test so you all
your test modules will be inside test
package so will be having your classes
will be inside test and then test
package will be inside telescope and
telescope will be inside com
now let's say in the telescope package
we have which is calm and then we have
telescope so in the telescope package we
have lots of classes let's say we have
five classes and inside test we have
four classes I want all four classes of
tests so what we can do is we can say
calm dot telesco dot test dot star so
when you say star it will fetch all the
classes from the test folder now you
want all the classes from telesco so you
can simply say
the risk without star but now you want a
class you want all the classes from test
so can we can we do comm dot the disco
dot star will it fetch all the test
classes and the answer is no because it
will only fetch the classes not the
folder because that is co or test is the
folder right as a package so it will not
go inside the package it will it will
take outside or outside piles which is
inside telescope and outside test so
that's how you should use packages in
your project so once we have seen the
theory of packages let's talk about the
example of it so as you can see in this
example from a long time we are liking
lots of coats right and all these codes
are in different files so we can because
you can see we have worked on inner
classes we have talked about interface
we have talked about operators we have
talked about static keyword so if we
talk about all this files here which is
just maybe tried 1213 files in the real
environment you'll be having maximum
files wide so if you have lots of
examples if you have lots of files which
is always better to put your files
inside a package now how to get the
package so I click on your package name
I mean default or SRC here with a new
package and we can provide a package
name so we can give any package name but
as we seen in the theory that your
package name should be a reverse of your
domain name so I will use my domain name
here which is the nice calm and the
reverse off it is calm dot telescope I
will click on finish and you can see we
got our package here and now from this
package and from this package I can
create some new files I can say class
and I will name this class as let's say
ABC again I can have any class name in
fact I can repeat the class name example
you can see here we have class first in
your demo let's create the same class in
our demo you can say we have two classes
in our demo in our demo which is still
working
the thing is they both are in different
package right and that's what is working
so this inner demo is in this package
and this inner demo is an open file
which is the default package so that's
how you create a package it is always
better to put all your classes different
classes into different packages for the
maintenance so that's about packages
that's how you create a package in the
next video we'll talk about how to
restrict the axis of particular class
methods and variables so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
