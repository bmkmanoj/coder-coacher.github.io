let's move towards metal or deluding so
what exactly method overloading is
there's a demonstrate that let me create
a class and we'll name this class calc
to make it Casio so we have a Casio
calculator right so what I will do in
this case a calculator I have this
method called as public void ad which
takes two values let's say if I pass
into I and in J so if it takes two
values we can simply say system dot out
dot println I'll add those two values I
plus J and the only way to call that is
by clicking your object will say casio
obj equal to new casio now I can say obj
dot add right and if you simply pass two
values when I say four and two it will
print the output as seven so you got the
output as where's the output it's seven
right so we can we can do that right so
we can say add and we can pass two
values but what if I don't want to add
two numbers I want to add three numbers
I can we have done this event way when
we have talked about where args but this
time we'll be very specific I just want
to pass three parameters not five or ten
I just want to pass three parameters is
it possible to pass three parameters
with a method two with two parameters
that's not possible right so we can
create one more method in the same class
as name as ad but this time we'll go see
if you have same name and same
parameters it is giving you error you
cannot have two methods with the same
name and signature when you say
signature it means the number of
parameters and the type of type of
parameters you are working with so if
I'm passing four three five it should
create and we should have one more
method which which takes three
parameters which is I J and K so we got
this first method here which takes two
parameters we got the second method here
which takes three parameters if you are
passing three values here it goes into
this second method and you have to say I
plus J plus K in fact what we can do is
differ on this code you will get out
between seven and 12 but let's say if
I'm calling our new method which takes
two values but it one is 4.5 and second
is 3.8 so if we're passing two values
which are not integer it will not
support here right because the
parameters you're accepting is int so
what we can do we can create one more
method which takes two parameters but
not int but it should be double right
we'll say double I and this is
again double if you can pass to double
values it will be accepted by your add
method which takes two double values can
have multiple methods with the same name
but you have to make sure that those
parameters are different so if you have
two parameters int we can have three
parameters which is int and you can have
two parameters which is double you can
have two parameters which is scared you
can have five parameters which is float
and int combine but you have to make
sure that when you have multiple methods
with the same name this you have the
different parameters so if you have this
concept this type of concept where you
have the same method name but if
different parameters it is called as
method overloading so you can say we
have multiple methods with the same name
but different parameters so method
overloading so that's it that's it about
method overloading
now we know right how to do method of
word loading can we do the same thing
with constructors so what I will do now
is let me create multiple characters so
I will say public can't see you so
that's a first question right can I
create one more constructor so will its
flight so we can have one more concept
up but you can see we are getting an
error because you cannot have two
constructors with the same parameters
but if you write int I so now it is
working right so we can have one more
constructor with the same name so I mean
of course it will have a same name right
so again you caught the other because
that you have same number of parameters
if I can have one more custom with
different parameters so the way we can
do method overloading the same way we
can achieve constructor overloading so
do we do this normally and the answer is
yes we do this I mean if we do this lots
of time so example if I remove all those
stuff and if I remove all this part so
what happens is sometimes you have you
know let's say if this is a class which
are certain variables let's say we have
int num1 and then we have int num2 and
let's say we have also have string
operation and we can have different
variables you right so let's say from
this casio I want to initialize num1 as
0 i want to ensure eyes num2 as 0 i want
to ensure eyes operation let's say
nothing because i have not specified any
operation yet so we'll say nothing okay
that's one let's say in this constructor
i can specify the same thing if i am
passing only one value only num1 will
get the value num2 and operation will
get the same stuff we can have the third
constructor which takes I and which
takes J and now we can have nothing
because we have not passed any comes any
population there we can say copy and
paste so this will be I this will be J
and we can say string off and now so the
operation will become off so the
advantage of doing this is if I create a
constructor with this default
constructor it will call this
constructor here if I pass a value for
so it will call the second constructor
if I pass a value 4 comma 5 it will it
will call the third constit type of pass
a value 4 comma 5 comma and it will call
the last constructor here so that means
the way you create object I mean the the
parameters you pass will decide which
constructor you are going to call
this concept is called as constructor
over loading so yeah that's it about
this video next video we'll talk more
about constructors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
