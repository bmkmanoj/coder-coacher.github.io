different political earnings and in this
video we'll talk about one of the most
important question no you cannot be much
in what's important question but this
question is frequently asked to
introduce so if you're going for jarring
to you also going for any Java rated
technologies maybe Android or maybe for
the technologies they might ask you this
question and the question is how will
you know that how many objects of a
class is created I mean what it means
now so let's say you have you have a
class here and let's say we have a class
and the name of this class is a because
I love this character a and in this in
this class we have a Metroid okay so
let's say we have a meter which is
public voice counter okay
now this quantity responsibly took print
the number of objects created by so if I
create one object of class a okay if I
played only one object of class a this
counter should print one if I create two
of these subclass a this counter should
print two if I've 2500 if I say if I if
I create ten objects of this class a
discounter should print ten right now
normally how we create object so we'll
be having so with this will be also
having a main method right so let's say
in this if you have a main method here
okay and it takes some parameters again
into string arguments right and inside
this mean okay so let's say I paid one
object normally how we create object we
say simply a obj1 equal to new a so
that's one object right if i can add one
more object if i say a obj to equal to
nu e so if i'm creating two methods
right so so it's I'm getting two objects
right so this context should bring - so
how exactly will be doing this but let's
say if I if I create one more object
which is three and if I say new a thing
to does be happening object and you'll
knife I say obj 3 dot dot counter so if
I if I call this method which is counter
okay so that's that matter if I call
this method so it should bring the
number of objects which are created
how to do that so we never say we want
to count so anyway you say count of
course we require a variable wise which
will hold the all of the counts so which
whatever variable it will be writing
here okay so let's let's try it out so
if I say I have a variable which is int
I okay so I have a variable which is int
I here and this I responsible to count
but hold on how would you I know that
you are getting the object it is going
this way every time you create an object
okay so every time you feed an object
you call one method right and that
matter is constructed of course so what
if if you can simply create a
constructor here will that work
if I pay the constructor but what's next
so every time you create an object it
calls the constructor what if in this
constructor I can simply say I plus plus
so what will happen now is every time
you create an object it will increment
this value and the default value for
this I will be 0 right so initially it
will be 0 but the problem is and then
not the problem but let me print the
value of I here
so what will happen now is if I create
the first object okay for this object
will be having a book and which will be
having a variable I and party for the
value of I will be 0 right and then
you're saying I plus plus so it becomes
1 so we got 1 object that's great right
it is counting and then if I if I don't
create this object if I say obj1 dot
counter of course the output will be 1
why they got one object but what if I
create the second object it will again
create a new object and the default
value for I I can do this video because
this is instance variables right and
what is instance variable every instance
will have a copy of it own right so when
you say you have an instance variable
every object will have a copy of it and
then you say copy there are two
different values right so this object
will have a different value this will
have a different value and this will now
become one again
because initial value is 0 and then you
are saying I just does it will make it 1
so you have two objects but still the
counter is 1
I'm going to enjoy discharge line it
will create a new object with the value
which is one again where it is counting
with what we want as a number of this
increases so as a number of objects
increases what we want is we want it to
count but the problem is this is
instance okay so what what if we'll
let's not take instance variable what if
you take class variable what is class
variable now so class variable is a
variable which is shared amongst the
object so if one objects changes the
value it was effect on the second object
if second object is evaluate with a
pictorial third object that means this
that variable does not depend on objects
that depend upon the club I mean they
develop laws that's what is called a
class variable and how to create a class
variable by using a keyboard colors
panting now what will happen is every
time you create object initially the
value of I will be zero of course so
when you create the first object the
value of I will not be will not belongs
to objects now because that's not an
instance variable that's a static
variable so somewhere in your stack
memory okay metal area basically in that
you will be having a video which is I
which belongs to class now and when you
say initial value is zero
you are making I plus plus so it becomes
one now you're getting second object
okay because this only nodes one so
whenever in second object you it will
not load again because we have a
variable there so it will make just make
it two because we didn't press plus for
this object it will make it three right
because it is plus them and then when
you're calling obj any object may be obj
three dots counter it will spring three
even if you're printing or beach a one
dot counter the output will be three
okay so you can just try it out this
example on your laptop maybe text off so
if you are using Eclipse net which
doesn't matter this code will walk
everywhere okay so this is this is
something the major be asking in the
interview so you can just write out and
next time when you go for the interviews
do answer directly okay so yeah that's
it from this video if you want some more
interview questions do come it in the
comment section you can actually submit
some more questions there okay if you
have if you have lots of questions with
you you can just submit those questions
there so I can also
and that's it do subscribe because I
want most of scribes but more views
thank you so much watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
