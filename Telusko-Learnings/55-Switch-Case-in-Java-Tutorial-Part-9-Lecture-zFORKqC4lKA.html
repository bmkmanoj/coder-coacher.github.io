video tutorials in which we'll talk
about a switch case now what exactly
switch case is let's suppose if I have a
variable I in which I'm selling a value
3 and what way to do is we have to check
the value if your value is 3 I will
print the value in its word format which
is your 3 right so if the value is 4 I
will say I will say 4 so it means if
this value changes this value change
right what if this value come from user
so what we can do is we have to check if
your value if your value of you to check
right so whenever you want to check
something we have to apply double equal
to so if your value is 4 you will bring
4 or if your value is if your value is
Phi you will praying 5 ok so if I if
your value is 4 it will be 4 values 5 in
5 but what if I want to check for from 0
to 9 so in this case we have to write 10
if statements so what we can do is
instead of using if we will use
something called as switch case
so what switch help is it will reduce
our code and it's more efficient to work
with so we have we have to pass we have
to use switch n which we have to pass a
variable I and we have to check with
multiple cases so first case is 0 so if
your case is 0 we will print it as 0
next case will go for case one we have
to print one and let's suppose we have
lots of cases in between a last case
will be nine writes okay is nine it's
printing nine like one more middle
between case seven and output should be
sir okay so we have all these multiple
cases now let's suppose if I run this
code and let me put this value as 0 okay
and we start with nine first if I put
this value is nine and if I run this the
output should be output is nine right if
I make it as seven output should be
seven but the output is and turn our
fort hays output is seven and nine it's
because it's it will check the value
with zero is not matching which with the
value with one it's not matching and
take the value with seven it's matching
right so why is it find the match it
will put into all the straightening
below it right so what mate odorous once
you match the value you have to you have
to break this branch so break the branch
we have to say break so some what we
have we have to put break in all cases
it's kind of compulsory and you also
will put big no need because we don't
have a case after that but still it's
better to put breaks okay now I fire on
this it's seven right now what if since
we have only four cases we have zero one
seven and nine what if the value is six
since it will not match any pattern it
will not match any value it will not
print anything right because
or not we are not having a case with six
so what we can do is fall any all these
different case we will use something
else default if any of the case is not
matching will go for default and which
will play in some number I don't know
which number but some number now if I
done this the output is some number
right because it values 6 so this is how
you can work with switch case but the
amazing part with switch case in Java
that it's a poach drink its approach
drinks to the implements playing what
we'll do is we'll take a variable colors
s and which will print will save hi so
if somebody says me hi I will apply it
in hi right so what we'll do is we'll be
used or switch case again this time I
will pass s this is a set amount which
demonstration of a switch with string so
we'll say first case my first case is in
double quotes my first case is hi
in this case I will brain hi and again
we need to use a break right now my
second case is hello in this case I will
print hello okay but this is how you can
work with strings in switch case so
switch case in Java suppose drinks so if
you have any doubts further please
