Java now let's say I have this class
called telesco and in this we have a
main function or main method let me
print something what I will print here
is let's say type in something we have
to write system dot out dot println
which means it will print it will print
on the output device of the system or
this system is a glass and this out is
an object and this printer is a method
right so let's say I find a print hello
world so I will say this hello world so
we need to use this println right so if
we run this code to just restart my
NetBeans okay so if I done this code the
output is the output shown on ok and the
output hello world right but let's say
instead of printing hello world I want
to take two variables we'll say int I
comma J and I could just save the
addition of I and J in K so what I can
do is I can assign the value of I
against and the value of J and then we
will say k equal to I plus G now I want
to print the result so if I if I say K
it will show the output as a number
which is 9 right so 5 plus 4 is 9 but
let's say I want to print in a
particular format that means I want to
print the Edition is and then since it's
a string from here to here it's a string
and this is a variable so we need to say
it's a plus sign now in print Ln this
plus sign means concatenation that means
it will combine this direction is with
the value of K and the output will be
the addition is 9 right but let's say I
want to print in this format now the
addition of 5 and 4 is 9
so in this scenario we have to say the
addition of and then a plus symbol of I
plus then I get a text I and then I get
a plus J then I gain a plus in double
quotes is we have to say plus key so the
addition of five and six or five and
four will be nine so if I run this code
now the output will be the additional
file for is nine right but the problem
is when you want to print a particular
format as you might be knowing in C
programming we use something called a
sprint F now printf there is a print
format so we can even use print format
here instead of using print l n we can
use print format so how to use print
format we'll say a painter function will
say print F n print F I hope your family
with this C syntax which you have to say
the addition of function of defining
this variable I are giving this plus
symbol we can use something called as
person D so the addition of person D and
person D is person D and the first
person day is I the second one is J and
that is K so we can use something called
let's print F to print a format now if
you see here if you go to this println
function now println is a void and print
F is it returns object of print stream
okay so there's a difference between
println and print F so in Java the
interv is supported so normally people
think we don't really have interval in c
or c programming but printf is also deaf
in java programming so it is one printf
so thanks for watching and do some stuff
