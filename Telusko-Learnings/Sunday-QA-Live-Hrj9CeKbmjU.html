I can't see my screen there so I have to
check in my machine if we are live let
me just check that and it says well well
I will find me I'll be live let me just
check if I save you Channel okay I don't
know how many people are watching now
just hold on for a second I'm checking
my status here okay and hey where do I
find if I'm live or not that's really
beer today I can't see anything on my
laptop ok says we are live and 27 people
are watching Oh 42 people are watching
and 12 likes that's great so everything
goes going good and you can see
hey it's live yeah that's great so I
said promised I was supposed to take a
live session today as well and this is
the ending evening or to say eating's
break so here we go everyone so we got
65 people watching so we can start with
your questions in shop wasting any of
any of the time because we the match is
again resuming soon so again everyone
will be going back to watching match no
one will be watching this session let's
make it quick
so everyone say is hi a hi Ruby as a
teesh Kayode and okay ganesh expect how
to pronounce that expect to blur enough
india has great to school yeah a lot of
run to score now okay so question from a
Venkatesh which is better Java versus
Python okay in fact I have answered this
question the last session itself both
are good in their own field so if you
talk about the enterprise world they are
working on Java some of the Backman
scripting of running on Python infects
pythons everywhere the hacking tool
server-side it's everywhere so if you
want to get into enterprise world if you
want to make big eat applications of
course go for Java again you can also
work with big data on Python as well
right so if you have a choice of
learning Java of course go for Java
because Python you can run any time it's
it's very easy to work with but Java is
something you know yeah it takes some
time to learn you should take some time
to understand and it takes some time to
grasp so if you have a choice now go for
Java and paddle you
and Python as well in fact you will
understand which is better so when you
work on it personally I feel Java is
better because that's mine that's my
lookout but there are some people they
like Python more than Java so everyone
have their or their own choice so first
of all learn both start with Java then
learn Python badly or maybe after some
time you will get to know which is
better okay so next oh now I lost all
the questions so whether is that way is
that okay so which laptop do you use
okay which laptop I use okay so I'm
using this one I don't know if you can
see that I'm using a MacBook Pro 2016
model which also has a touch bar if you
can see that it's also a touch bar okay
it was damn costly for me I have spent
my entire corporate training salary on
this so this is this is a gift from me
from I mean gift for myself so once I
completed my training one of the
training where I got tons of amount I
thought about buying a good laptop
because I was not having a good laptop
before I was having a macbook but that
night book macbook was very old one so I
got this new one and the reason why I'm
using this one because I make lots of
videos right and for exporting videos we
need lots of CPU power and that's why
this machine is a beast when it comes to
uh what you say rendering the video and
exporting the video okay but in terms of
programming any any laptop will go right
so you can use normal i3 Moschino as
well that will be good for programming
okay
next from sonship should a facial learn
big data as its heard that they're
they're hiring experienced worker that
does the case if you want to get into
Big Data in fact I hold that I heard
that they are only hiring experience
before with for big big data now the
reason is why they are focusing on
experienced people is because you know
big data is a field where it's not just
about technology it's also about domain
it's also about how to how do you work
with data so if you are a very fresher
if you are a fashion in this IT world
and you not understand how business
works right you what you learn when you
when you are learning idea is how IT
worlds how technology works you don't
know how business works if you want to
get into big data you also you should
also know about business how business
works and
how I mean how you can provide the
solution okay let's just hold on I'm
sharing this video on Facebook so that
people will know that I am live you can
just do it as well if you want you okay
so yeah so to get into Big Data now or
it's not a good thing but you can try
there's no harm in that if you if you
think you are good so see company also
needs solutions if you can provide
solutions they will hire you again not
every company is looking for experienced
people there are some companies that
looking also looking for facials so try
your luck there okay oh okay girl says
how to write code by myself okay okay
now this is a very common question
nowadays you know how to write a code
how to write a software the only thing
you can do is you can like this the more
you practice the more you will
understand how it works okay so you have
to practice a lot in fact you have to
spend lots of time on your on logic you
know it takes some time trust me when I
started my career it took a lot of time
for me to get in to get into that
software thing so it takes time okay
that sounds good next question from okay
so tech we wake says ah so Java is tough
okay please tell how to learn okay Java
is stuff yes compact with the languages
Java is difficult but then it is not
impossible to learn Java in fact that's
why I created all the videos for free in
Factor when I want you to learn Java I
was not able to learn job properly
because of lack of resources because if
you try to read books on Java
I know it's headache again one of the
book which I I preferred is head first
Java but still you are now learning
technology from a book is not a good
thing I feel so I was searching for
different videos on YouTube but and none
of the videos I will to convey convinced
so I thought okay let's let me create my
own videos and that's why I better this
entire playlist so if you think Java is
difficult to tough just do one thing go
to the disco Learning Channel and search
for Java playlist and watch all the
videos and trust me I may not be I may
not be you will understand everything
but you will understand enough to make
to build your own softwares right so
okay so next question from rajashekhar
Reddy hi sir what about future of
Android application developers future of
Android developers it's awesome right
because things things are moving towards
mobile development now in fact now we
have smart AC smart fridge smart cars
and those things also need also needs
some OS oide and being Android open
source you can use it everywhere so I
can see a good future find another
person future but the only thing is and
I know as well the lots of new updates
which is which is happening every year
so the only way to survive in this world
is by updating yourself right so you
know we have these things about survival
of the fittest so you have to update
yourself so that you can survive in the
IT industry so yeah so and it has a big
scope okay what about scope for Kotlin
if you want to get into android and now
if you want to get into I enjoy the best
thing is LUN Cortland and be $100 per
but only thing is learning codling
directly we don't have enough resources
to learn coddling directly example if
you don't know programming I mean none
if you don't know any pocket if you
don't have any program experience and if
you're trying to learn cortland it will
be very difficult because we don't have
good resources to learn coding from
scratch right so what I would suggest is
first learn Java basics don't learn
everything in Java
okay does not require learn basics of
java at least and then jump to Cortland
because in fact if you see my videos as
well I'm comparing Java and continent
together right it's because it is very
easy to learn Cortland if you know Java
so yeah so there's a good big scope for
spottin if you want to be an Android
developer and then how to learn it first
learn basic Java and jump towards
quadlin okay
the tick say is please teach Unix that's
the thing I'm not dad with good with
Unix I do use UNIX terminals but then I
am not that efficient I can use it for
my personal use but then teaching it
requires lots of extra knowledge lots of
comfortness I don't have that now but
maybe in future if I if I know someday
if I dream about UNIX I will surely make
videos on those okay so Mahesh Babu says
is improving skills in C is best or not
of course right I mean C is the mother
of all the languages see the thing is
when
I started programming the first language
I learn is C and since I was knowing C
very good the thing is when I learn C++
it was very easy for me because I know
programming in C the only thing is I
have to learn about object edit program
when I learn Java C and C++ help me
because I know both both of things I
know how to program I know how
OUP's works so I learned Java and
learning C shop for me was very very
easy because C sharp is the exact copy
of Java so it was not difficult for me
to learn C sharp so so learning C is
actually a good thing you can you can be
and what you say embedded developer you
can get into as a vortex right so all
the software's actually uses C
programming great in fact I can see we
have 148 people watching this video even
if we have a match there so that's great
and I can see only 41 likes that's weird
come on guys if you are watching this if
you are enjoying these questions if you
I mean if you like these sessions do
click on the like button okay let me
just check my mobile phone if marriage
started because people will be vanishing
very fast okay so next question is where
do we see IT industry in India okay I
cannot say anything about that but the
only thing is India has a great future
may come in technology because the
entire world knows India is a superpower
now so maybe I don't know how it will be
going in future let's see
ok so best or some marks Jackson mocks
Jackson says best way to start the
course of machine learning ok if you
want to learn machine learning I would
suggest you to go and don't go for any
YouTube video for machine learning
because the machine learning is a very
niche technology so even if you want to
learn it the best thing I would say is
go to Udacity go to go to this website
which is MOOCs right cosine of e we have
Coursera we have Mia G we have Udacity
so just go to this website and you will
find good resources there right ok so he
already says so something about real
time development using WebSphere no idea
about WebSphere so sorry
ok Nitish Sing se is a high-knee - ok
what languages we
you know for interviews okay first of
all you should know at least one
programming language and whenever you go
for the interviews always check what
requirements they have sometimes you
know the acquirement matters more than
more than what you should know so if you
are going for a development job and they
are asking for dotnet development of
course you should know dotnet if they
are asking for PHP development you
should know PHP if they're asking for
Java of course you should know of course
it should know Java right so depend upon
what requirement they have you have to
you should know those technology plus it
doesn't matter what Java file you're
going for you should know SQL you should
know networking and you should know data
structures these three things are very
important data structures networking and
SQL and knowing having the Java
knowledge will be always beneficial for
you right okay so next question so tell
me how to learn Java it seems tough
against think oh you ought the same
person okay I've given the dancers right
okay what does the future of Foos oh no
idea about force watch watch stands for
I can you to check if the match is
getting started now I just taking some
time okay great
okay how do I become a job Adama
for that you have to watch my first
video of my power playlist that's what I
have talked about how can you be a Java
programmer right if you want to reek if
you want me to recap it it's very simple
just go to youtube watch all my job
videos and make a simple application it
may be a chat application it may be a
normal website it may be a digital
application see if you learn something
try to implement that because the moment
you implement something you will get
that confidence and trust me guys
confidence is much better than having
good knowledge because if you have a
contents you can do everything even if
you have a knowledge if you don't have a
continent you can do it you can do
nothing right so you have you should
have that self confidence and make uh
software okay so next oh oh ok where's
the question I guess again the skull is
going up I give this some bug with the
YouTube live you know every time I get
more questions if suddenly everything
goes up I have to again go up to get the
next questions maybe I have to skip some
question now from the top because I
can't see where I'm going for so let me
start from here uh is it necessary to
know type square for angular junior
angular2 okay I mean see I'm not
offended developer I'm more into
back-end and don't go up on angularjs I
don't work on JavaScript and that's why
you can see my website is not that look
good-looking right because I don't focus
on the front-end side I should be but
then my move I mean my focus mole is on
the development side the backend part of
it so so I had no idea about tie script
type script there but then you can use
JavaScript you I guess JavaScript works
easily with angular 2 but still kind
from that okay so next can I join three
tables using hql hibernate yes you can
why not okay but then this is a big
topic that we can only discuss in videos
I cannot do it here in the life sorry
for that okay so now how to get into job
into Google okay okay
so the best way to get into Google is
well just a big company now so in fact
nowadays what is happening is getting a
job at Google is become it's becoming
difficult the easiest one is start your
own company a build awesome product and
ask Google or let Google buy your
company that's the best way to work for
Google now so ok ok so akka says how can
I know about your next QA session before
notification from YouTube oh and that's
why we have this Facebook page right
Akash so I do have a Facebook page which
which is which says telesco learning so
that's the name of the page you can also
add me on Facebook so you can just send
a link and so yeah so you can you can
add me on Facebook or you can we also
have a Facebook group called a that is
called live project and that will be the
best thing okay so that's where you will
get to know about this thing our next
question your glasses is too good so
thank you so much I'm about to change my
glasses now but ok so since you're
saying it's good I will not change it ok
so next question so what about what is
type of flow okay so now just shake our
if you want to spend your life as a
programmer you should know stack
overflow because every programmer I
guess I am sure you know as a programmer
we visit Stack Overflow more than Google
right because whenever you
face any issues that's the first place
we go to in fact if you search for any
problem on Google the first page you
will get or the first ranking page will
get your Stack Overflow
now the Stack Overflow Stack Overflow is
a platform where if you have a question
you can post your question whatever
question technical questions okay if you
have facing some issues with the cobia
if you're facing some issue with the
library's just post your question there
and we have some export there in fact
there are lots of export who want to
contribute right so they will answer
your question okay so there's a 90%
chance that you will get the answer
provided you your question makes sense
because there are some questions which
you can easily Google on you can easily
google it but then if you have questions
very specific you can ask that and so
since it is a good platform Google gives
the top line in fact I also have a
bookmark of Stack Overflow on my on my
browser right so is that important for
you oh okay so yeah for uncle Jeffrey
says Andrew ng is cause yeah that's
that's good one of the best goes for
machine learning and Reeves ng great oh
okay next question next question how to
become a CEO of Google okay dahil okay I
have okay sir I've scored 54 okay that's
a very specific question now let's go
for something else which makes sense
okay nice access any Android project
idea please okay so you want some ideas
for Android project what we do you want
something from Android Play Store okay
how about a lot which I learned when you
alert did we handle I apply it something
else something else something from me in
fact I wanted an app before so the
problem was initially when I wanted to
go live on YouTube there was no feature
of live on YouTube app right so I wanted
to go live so that's why I was using
this Wireshark what which was wife file
while boyfriend or some software was
there and using that south I was going
live on mobile phone but now since we
have that feature on YouTube app so
that's why I'm using that but if you can
create the same thing what if what you
can create an application using
using which I can go live on YouTube and
not just with my mobile phone with two
mobile phones so let's say if we have a
camera here and a camera here so now I
love that thing so going from here going
going there okay I'm just move myself
okay so having two mobile phones and
both should be working in sync so with
just one click this
this mobile phone should I mean stream
me if I click that it's dish mobile
phone just ring me I don't know how it
would work but then you can try it out
or you can go with the simplest one
create a test management system you'll
be having lots of questions and a person
will give a test so whichever you feel
simple go for that in fact you know when
I when people ask me about ideas it's
actually very easy look at around you
whatever whatever problem you're facing
and try to make an application for that
in fact I do face lots of wishes the
only thing is I'm not getting time to
work on applications because I'm already
busy with other projects so okay so what
is XP which is experience of number of
job opening in Bangalore okay I've never
tried in Bangalore okay okay oh okay so
when will be web services complete
course available in that is for
learnings I'm still in questioning
should we go with a disco learning or
should I go with a disco polo because I
was thinking about making telescope low
as my official channel for this videos
but the problem is the Disco flow is not
available in to all the countries it is
only available in India on us it is not
available in Nepal as in the last
session we have discussed about that so
I'm still pint I am string or trying to
plan how where to upload the videos so
let's see how it goes so it will take
some time maybe two weeks or three weeks
but it will be available somewhere maybe
thanks for learning author is Coco okay
so let me say is wow thanks oh great so
question from yes methyl I hire after a
long time so why do corporate work with
Java and start off with Android Oh
generally why the corporates not work on
I mean think about this in the carpet
world what we provide is we provide
enterprise solutions I mean think about
this banking service now so if you think
you are doing online banking do you
think that you can do the entire banking
application on Android that's not that's
not possible right we need a huge
service so
those huge servers or those huge website
or the enterprise software's are built
by cooperatives right
in fact populate also build and row
applications but then compared to
startups there's a very I mean there's a
big gap so startup only focuses on
Android applications and that's the
problem you know startup is focusing
more on the consumer level and corporate
carpet companies are focusing more on
the enterprise level and that's why as a
student see you don't know what is
happening in the industry right that's
the biggest problem as a flash are you
don't know what is happening in the
industry we get carried away with all
these new technologies you say ok
Android is awesome will run Android
let's say Java series option lesson
let's learn JavaScript but you don't
know what is happening in the corporate
world you will you will get carried away
with all these youtubers all this all
these articles on on Google they will
say hey learn Android your life is said
learn PHP your life is certain Java your
up life is said that's not how it works
first of all you have to think what you
want to be it doesn't matter which
technology these famous if I say Java is
best Java is best but the thing is you
have to define what you want to be if
you want to get into Android world don't
think about what prophet uses what start
abuses go for go for Android but if you
think Java is good go for Java and get
into get into cartridge in fact
corporate also works on Android as well
I mean what your thing are this SBI
applications are made by startups no
right they are making they made by big
applications in fact I know about hot
star so hot star the mayor server of the
Hajj hot star is one of is made by one
of the MNCs right so they also work on
Android applications why not
so it's just that the difference you
know the difference is very very big so
in start-up focus on what an Android
Enterprise focus one on the enterprise
software ok so ok last two questions so
first question is is it necessary to
have Scala with spark yes
okay it's not composite' we can also use
Java with spot now so we can use Python
Scala or Java or Python Scala or Java
with with spark but then if you're
working one spark why not use the best
language for spark which is called of
course so much started
and you got the first wicket okay great
anyway so that's a bad thing okay last
question everyone because math started
everyone will be leaving now as you can
see the number is going down and down
and down I guess so
last question oh okay and I lost all the
questions now so whatever the last
question is is there any way to switch
over then faking my okay okay can't see
those questions it's a big question now
which one okay
so currently I'm working in a support
project I would like to switch from
development domain on Java but everyone
is asking for hands-on experience when
trying to give introduce I mean yeah
that's important right if you are
switching to other domain other time if
you are switching to development you
need some hands on experience I don't
know what's the issue with the IT
industry now they are looking for only
experienced people for Java field and
what is happening there if you want to
get into a get into Java you have to use
you should have the hands-on experience
on Java now there are lots of people
they fake their experience and that's
the weird part you know that's a very
very bad thing
the moment you fake your experience and
you will I mean everyone can come to an
example if I'm this video and if I know
that you are coming for the interview
for having two years of experience when
I say you are you're working on Java for
two years it means you have lots of
knowledge and I will ask you questions
based on those experience I will ask you
which particular working on or which
specific you have worked on I will not
check from which company are coming from
what I will check is what project you
have worked on and the questions will be
based on those project right so you
cannot fake it even if you're trying to
fake that that's a bad thing the only
thing is if you want to get into Java
make your own application mega I mean
upload your projects on github
repository any project will do and you
create your dummy projects create I mean
create any project you want and upload
that on github so while going for the
interviews just share that video with
your friends or say that share that
project with you
with interviews not the video okay
that's it guys I know I was not able to
answer all the question today as well I
mean it is getting very difficult now to
answer all the questions because of lack
of time but I tried my best so next time
if you are going like just make sure
that you you like the page on Facebook
and send me a request on Facebook I will
try I will accept your request and be a
part of Facebook group which is there on
a Facebook group which is there on
Facebook which is called as the risk or
like project and you will get a
notification and try to be the first one
to ask questions so that I can answer
your questions so that's it guys so
that's it thank you so much for watching
everyone and see you in the next live
session huh that's it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
