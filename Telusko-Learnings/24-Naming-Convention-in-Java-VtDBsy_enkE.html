ready from Teresa learnings and in this
video we'll talk about naming convention
in Java now you know when we talk about
the good softwood programming so let's
say you are building us often the people
say you should follow some specific
standards to make your code look good
too to make your code more efficient and
you should make your code more readable
right so let's say you're making a
software which is optimized for that you
have to do lots of stuff right to make
your software readable or you have to
code your to make your code readable you
just have to follow some simple rules
and one of these rule is naming
convention so whenever you write any
code make sure you use proper convention
for the names example you know we have
this habit of using variable name as X Y
Z then ABC PQ R we should not do that
unfortunately if you see my tutorials I
have used all those names right X Y but
it should not happen when you build a
software so while building a software
you should follow some naming convention
right so what are these naming
convention so whenever you take a
variable name it should look like a
you're using a variable name right
example if you are storing a name of a
student so it should be s name right it
should represent that you are using
student's name right so let's say if you
are storing a stock market price so you
should mention stock underscore stock
price right you have to mention the
exact variable name not XY let's say
operating a class now your class name
should look like a class named right it
should be like you can a week you can
you can have a class name like string
you can have a class in like integer so
there are classes all right then you can
have a class name like a student you can
have a class name like worker maybe
engineer so you can have all these class
names make sure you are using a perfect
class name then we also have a concept
of interfaces so your interface should
look like an interface in fact if you
see my in fact in these further
tutorials we talked about different
interfaces avoid example of this linear
interface then see risible interface so
it should have a proper name so how it
should be so when you when you talk
about any inter
places your interfaces should be an
adjective example runnable or say
risible so it should represents you are
doing an adjective right so it should be
able at the end not every interface will
have able at the end example remote
interface now we do not have able at the
end right so there are certain
interfaces we do not have able at the
end but there are lots of interfaces
they have able at the end so let's say
if you are creating your own interfaces
or own interface which provides the read
access so you can mention readable right
so use a proper interface name so as you
can see we have these examples here then
we have a class name so your class name
should be noun right so let's say your
class name can this student it can be
person or it can be a computer so you
can have any class name but it should
follow the convention next whenever you
have a variable or let's just our method
first so whenever you have a method it
should be a verb now when you say what
it should provide some action example
actionperformed is a method name then we
have run we have print we have write so
it defines a web action right so that's
methods now if we talk about variables
it should look like a variable again we
have talked about stock price and all
those stuff right bank details although
stuff and the last one let's say if we
talk about constant so your constant
should look like a constant example pi
it's a constant right then if you talk
about the identity so let's say if you
are using if you are creating an
application where you want the densities
should be fixed you can mention a
constant there right again how to create
constant in Java that's a different
topic right so this is the examples of
interfaces now so for interface we can
use capital later so again we have to so
for interface class specifically the
first letter should be capital okay let
me repeat for class and interface the
first letter should be capital for
method variable package name and so for
this we have to use small characters for
the first letter so if you have a first
letter make it picture too small example
if you talk about stock price so s
should be small right and for constant
we need to use everything capital so
let's say if you say a max
max price so you can use all capitals
right so that's the naming convention we
have to use but hold on let us say we
have this name which is my first Java
class now this is the class name right
so in Java any way you define any name
in which you have more than one word so
you can see we have my first Java class
it has four words so whenever you
combine these four words if you have all
of the same all all small you know you
cannot figure it out which word is
changing so it is not that readable so
that is why Java follows camel casing
rule which means whenever you combine
two words we need to have so the second
word first letter should be capital so
here if you see the my first Java class
it is M is capital first F is capital J
J's capital and class is capital right
so having that is how you have to use
camel casing rule so let's say if you're
talking about the variable stock price
so s is small but P is capital right if
we talk about methods let's say action
perform so action a small because it's a
method but P is capital because we are
using camel casing rule so it is
applicable for everything except package
and constant so in packages we use
everything small but in constant we use
everything capital right so how do I
differentiate between two words here so
let's say my my constant is max price
now in this scenario we need to use
underscore in between so max underscore
price okay now some people say it as
this is snake casing rule but that's it
we have to use underst underscore in
between okay
so make sure you use proper naming
convention now the advantages of this so
what is what is the advantage it will
make your code more readable right so
let me see let me see some sample names
here so if I show you this what is ABC
small ABC good this is a variable right
it can be a variable or it can be it can
be a variable right variable can be of
primitive what it can be a reference
variable right what about this one
ABC all in capitals good that's constant
right whenever you have everything
capital that is constant good now we
have um
method okay so is it a method or a
constructor now since we have capital a
it's not a method it's a construct right
because capital a means class and when
you have class in bracket that's our
constructor right but if you have ABC
which is this ABC small and then we have
the a context and method right let me
give one more
this is stretchable right so we have
good this is the interface right because
using number proper naming convention so
that's that's the advantage of knowing
all the naming convention you should
have we should provide the proper names
to your literals so yeah that's it from
this video so that's about naming
convention do watch subsequent Atul to
understand the basic concepts of Java
