ready and once we know the introduction
of Kotlin let's go with the first code
now of course right when you want when
you will start with a new language maybe
C C++ Java C sharp the first code we
always write is for the world and we are
all set to write our first code which is
hello boil in Cortland what question
arise way to write it so you can you can
download the compiler here you can see
we have an option of compiler you can
use any of these IDE or cotton provide
you one more feature which is you can
you can practice code link codes online
again it will be good for beginners but
then once you go in a complex things it
is always better to use some ideas right
but since this is our first code we'll
try this so you can simply click on this
fly on and again you will find this you
just go to kata Lane language this is a
official website of Cortland and if you
just scroll down you will find an option
of try Cortland so if you click on that
try online it will give you a nice
looking interface where you can actually
see your first code and the awesome
thing is it will already give you a code
which is hello world now if you remember
in Java if we want to write the same
code just I mean you can imagine right
we have a we have to get a class first
that we have to mention public static
void main we have to mention the
arguments there and we have to write
system dot out dot println right now
quatrain makes things much easier for
you
you don't have to get a class here that
will be done automatically behind the
scene you just have to create a main
method now in java you should say
methods right in fact the problem is
when in c programming we used to call it
functions in c plus we'll also use to
call it functions in java coitus and
methods but then again when it comes to
pot line it depend upon you what you
need to call it if you just want to
learn Kotlin not from a Java perspective
you can say those are functions example
main here is a function but maybe if you
want to focus on maybe if you if you do
if you want to relate it to Java you can
say it's a method here so if you want to
create a method you can use fu n as a
keyword again it stands for function
because normally everything is function
but then in job is recorded as methods
right so you can simply say function
then or fung then you have to mention
main method name which is me in here now
if you remember in in in SQL normally
we create we I don't know if you know
about SQL here but the NAM in SQL we
create the column name first and then we
mention the type of the data the data
type we are working with in programming
language like C C++ or Java what we do
is we first mention the data type and
then we mentioned the variable name but
again in in modern languages including
swift Scala what we do is we first
define the variable type and then I mean
we first define the variable name and
then we define the type so we are
passing an arguments by defining that
it's an addy now this added resolve will
be of type string this is a type of
generics here again if you know generics
in Java this is genrich's but other than
that if you don't know that's fine this
is an arguments we are taking multiple
parameters in the format of an array all
this value will be coming in a string
format and you simply say print lnu
there is no system there is no out there
is nope there's only println now I do
remember whenever I teach this topic for
the first time to Java programmers I
have to explain them Hey out is an
object which is created inside the
system class but it's not an object of
system class you know it takes lots of
time instead of doing all those things
coddling says hey go with it go ahead
with Wintel engine just mention hello
boys and your job is done now if you
want to run this code as you can see if
you want to run this code you are
running this on JVM so if I run this
code now you will be getting the output
and of course the output expecting
inside a word and as you can see here we
got the output as hello world now this
is your first code right and we did that
and the online compiler of Cortland but
let's say I don't want to go for online
compiler I want to work on any of this
IDE so you can use IntelliJ you can use
Android studio you can use eclipse
whatever what you can do is one of the
best IDE available in the market for for
for Cortland or for Java itself we have
IntelliJ which is the one of the best
IDE available in fact both of them the
same company we will be doing with
Android studio again you must have seen
they understood your website where it is
updated now they have Android 3.0
now for this course let's start with
eclipse first and then we move towards
IntelliJ so what I will do is I will
install eclipse now fortunately I
already have Eclipse in my system so let
me just open that so is the Eclipse
and what so I'm using Eclipse neon three
or you can use any eclipse version maybe
after mass two point mass - it is there
okay so you can save size go for neon if
you don't have neon just install neon
because I'm not sure from which version
it is getting set the quality is getting
supported for the clips so make sure you
download the latest version now the the
workspace I will be using is Cortland
okay so in fact I already created this
works as before
Oh what is that it's close enough so I
open this and you can see it will open
my Eclipse it will take some time so
panel you can also download eclipse you
can download IntelliJ from where you
will get IntelliJ just go to the
official website of IntelliJ and ok you
will not get get this option for the
first time since I've already done the
installation in here I'm getting this
option you don't worry you will not get
this option here ok so what I was saying
is yeah so it is taking some time let me
just pause the video for time being till
now if you want to use cotton lining in
your Eclipse by default eclipse will not
provide you cotton support okay because
eclipse is made for Java right so Java
will be in build because your JDK and
Eclipse get linked automatically but
when it comes to Kotlin you have to
install the plugin for cotton in fact I
have done this just before the video so
it is already there but then how you
find it do you have that quickly in your
system or not so what you do is you have
to go to perspective so you have to it
you can verify that so just go to open
perspective and there should be Kotlin
here as you can see we don't have cotton
in here right so you can see we don't
have that in fact I do have here on this
on the side because I have used quadrant
before in my system for you it will not
be there right so what you have to do is
you have to go to help and you have to
go to excess marketplace where you can
install the plug-in for Kotlin and how
to do that just search for cotton so
it's please like some time ok ok so we
have to search for cotton when you
search for cotton in your system you can
see it will give you option of install
ok in my system already have it so it
was it is saying installed but for you
it will give you option of install again
it is given by JetBrains the company who
have made Cortland
so have to install that installation
process is actually very easy just have
to click on install the
it will ask you for the terms and
conditions you have to say I agree you
don't have a choice and then everything
will be done now once you got caught
Lane it will it will ask you for to
restart your Eclipse just do that and
once when you study the clips you will
get so if you open the perspective you
will get Kotlin here now I'm not getting
coddling there because I already have
that here so if I click on this
perspective you just have to select the
accordion perspective and it will give
you a perspective for Kotlin now how did
we get a project here it's very easy
just right-click and say new now which
project I want to create here of course
not a Java project right because we are
not learning Java here we are learning
Cortland so click on project and you
have to select a coordinate project so
for that you have to search for carlin
now the problem is it was installed it
was not installed properly so what i
will do is i will restart my eclipse
just give me a sec ok so have you
studied my Eclipse here and as you can
see if I right click here if I say no
and now there is option of creative
creating a cotton lean project so you
have to make sure that when you download
a download codling plug-in it is
installed properly because I guess I was
having some issues there so when I click
on contact rain project and it will ask
you for the project name you can give
any project name here as it is my first
project as a demo ok we said you ever
sent us a demo here click on finish it
will create a project for you and if we
expand that now there is one thing you
have to observe you got a cotton is on
time degree because that makes sense you
are creating a Cortland project but then
you can also see we already have a J are
a system library here because when you
can when you compile your code link code
it will get converted into Java code
right so this is your cotton project and
let's write our first code here right
click this send you and we have to
create a cotton link file so any way you
want to write a code link code of course
you have to write Kotlin file right so
just click on this it will ask you for
the package name again we talked about
this packages later let's create a let's
create a file name or Kelly will say
this is agreed ok so we can say greet
and now you can get the extension right
so when you talk about Java we have the
extension table
when it comes to Kotlin the extension is
not cotton because it's a big word they
have the event for Katie
so does Katie so we got great dot Katie
now how do we like a courier it's very
simple the code we have already seen
there so did you find a function of
alight function that we say main and we
simply say I want to accept the
arguments which is of type a D again you
can use any variable in video so I will
say a D and then this array will be of
type string size a string and then here
I will say I want to print something I
want to print hello world so I will say
println oh why hello why's every time we
say hello aliens okay so we say hello
aliens you are aliens I know I hope you
I guess you cannot see the font size 0
let me just increase the font size a bit
okay so as you can see we are adding a
function here and if I run this code and
that's our first output can you see that
we got the output as car lane I mean
hello alien so that's your first
coordinate project I'm increasing font
size here so you can see the output we
are getting here is hello
aliens and that's what we wanted right
so we got the output this is your first
Kotlin code in eclipse right right so in
the next video will be will be saying
how to run this code in IntelliJ because
that is the that is the idea we'll be
using for the entire course right so
we'll see that how to use that in in
IntelliJ because intelligible watchu
lots of features and again those what
those features are we'll see in the next
video thanks so much for watching and to
