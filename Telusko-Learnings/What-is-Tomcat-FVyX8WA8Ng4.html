Wendy and today when we talk about Tom
cat no those are not too different voice
it is one voice Tom cat now if you are
new to job rhyming and if you're new to
this web voice so you might have heard
about donkey but what exactly it means
in fact I've got lots of questions there
you know and when people start learning
kochava from my videos they do ask me
about Tom Kane as well
now first of all it doesn't make sense
when you are learning code Java and
you're learning our tongue kit as well
but after the lingo Java if you want to
go for the enterprise world if you want
to work on websites let's say if you
want to make your own verification using
Java of course we have to work on
tablets now if you watch my stomache
videos I want this therefore that when
you want to run solve it when you want
to learn spring MVC you need a tomcat
but what is Tomcat and why do we need it
now if you are familiar with website or
web voice you must have heard about HTTP
protocol right now if you want to
provide any web service maybe if you
want to provide a static content maybe
using HTML maybe you want to just send
data from server to point you need up
servers right and that server is it HTTP
so first of all even if you want to make
a static website you need a HTTP server
now to make it dynamic we use sublet
right so we use HTTP for only for
fetching data but next if you want to
send a dynamic data then you need to
solve it so what we need is we need a
HTTP server what we need is we need a we
need a container very very will run your
solve let's so when you combine this
HTTP server and when you combine your
sublet or solid container they both
combine to give you one flower which is
Tomcat
again tompa is not the only server
available in the market the other server
as well examples we have Jackie then
okay so we have do two web servers we
have jetty and we have Tomcat we do have
some app servers as well again we'll
talk about apps over in the one of the
video but then in this video we are
focusing on your target so what is
Tomcat it's a server in which okay so
it's actually be server and a servlet
container now some people do mix it up
they say
Tomcat is a servlet server or Tomcat is
HTTP container I don't know why they
make stuff but then Tomcat is a HTTP
server and a sublet container many when
I was confused in my earlier videos what
is that but then okay we can use it
interchangeably okay
some people do therefore Tomcat server
so they are referring it as a HTTP
server when you refer Tomcat as a
container so it's a servlet container
right so again what is Tomcat Tomcat
only support sublet and okay you might
have what about JSP as well so now or do
be you can be used some cash with JSP is
it possible or the thing is Tomcat is a
sublet container right how can we use
one JSP so again Tomcat does support JSP
but then it converts your JSP to subject
to make it work in fact we have
expression language as well and Tomcat
does simple expression language so tom
is basically our which works with
servlets now what else we can do in Tom
Kyte so so Tom text okay so what else we
can we can think about Tom catch the
content is a web server but then we talk
about the server we need some port
number as well right now especially
Tomcat works on HTTP protocol right so
all these servers which runs on adjutant
with the calls they have a port number
80 80 now it doesn't matter if you're
working with PHP where you have exam
server in dotnet we have I is so what's
all this web server which works with
actually quite a call they use 8080 is
the default port number so target by
default when you install Tomcat it will
run on
8080 now in terms of licensed or part
shade is Tomcat is free you don't have
to pay for anything for that it is
available for free so we have so a patch
so Tomcat got a license as apache
license which is version 2 and yeah I
just handled by departure now but then
it also it was made by Sun just to
clarify and ok so that that's about
Apache now question arise if you are
making a server application do we have
the only option or we have adoption as
well we have talked about JT but can
both this to our web servers we also
have our servers now example if you if
you had about GlassFish if you had about
j-bot all this our app server ok now
what a defensive app server and that's
we'll talk about in one of the video so
if you have those questions if you have
a question like difference between the
observer app server what is J box
what is GlassFish why to use J Bosley
not use about Tomcat and why do you
storm cat wine do it why not use J bars
we talked about in one of the video if
you want those videos let me know in the
comment section and yet that's about
some cat and yeah that's it
in fact I also have videos on how to
point figure out how to download Tomcat
so you can just search up inflation
videos or we will try to add that in
description length so let me let us know
if it is not there so that's it that's
the touches from this video guys and I
