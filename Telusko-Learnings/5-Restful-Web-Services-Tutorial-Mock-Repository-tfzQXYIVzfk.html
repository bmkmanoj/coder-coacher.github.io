different ethical learnings and in the
last session we have talked about
resources how do you fetch resources
here right so we have we were returning
the least of aliens right so we create
this to aliens here and at the moment
someone sends you a request for aliens
you will return least of aliens where
you will return these to aliens right
and then we have also discussed I mean
we have talked about this if normally
when you return data of course the data
will be coming from database right what
we are doing here is we are returning
data by ourselves by creating the static
resource and that's not a good practice
now so what we should be doing here is
we should be creating a separate class
which will be dealing with database and
of course we will we have two fresh data
from database but and in fact we can
mock it up right we can create a subpage
class which will return data to us again
we can imagine that - classes connecting
PT debase I mean we don't we don't care
about that we are not concerned about
which database you are working with what
we are concerned is this data should be
coming from database and to mock it up
what I will do is I will create a
separate class now and I will name this
class as okay with this create a class
and we can call this class as something
aliens it will say alien Asian what a
normally if you are coming from web
development we normally therefore our
class name as Dao right so a class which
deals with database is called as down
but then in REST API instead of calling
test Dao we can use a good name called
as repository again you can imagine you
can you can still use Dao that's fine
you can use any class that does not
matter but then the depository sounds
good because you might be fetching data
from database maybe from from some files
may be from network you are fetching it
up from a repository right again having
said that you can use any class name
doesn't matter
now so we are the class name which I am
using here is agent repository and this
agent repository will work with certain
methods now again there is one more
reason why I have taken this name as in
repository will and you will understand
this once we start with spring rest so
after after this jersey will be talking
about spring rest
where we will implement the same thing
that this agent repository will make
more sense right so time in let's say we
have a class semester in repository you
can take any class name with the way you
want okay so we had this class right and
this class will work with the database
now my talk about resource as a user you
can fetch all the resource you can fetch
all the aliens in the database you can
save a new agent maybe you want to add a
new agent object maybe you want to fetch
one particular alien maybe you want to
update one particular alien so you will
do all those operations with this alien
repository right so this inner
repository don't need to have all the
methods right so what I will do is I
will first of all let me create a array
okay I may be at least and I will I will
use that list will be accessed by all
the objects okay now how do I do that so
what I will do is I will simply create a
list of objects here so I will say list
of aliens and I will name this alien as
okay let me just name this as aliens
equal to okay what next now we have to
say new added east we have to get the
audit as well right it's like we can
create this object somewhere else so
let's let's say we are declaring the
object object here now once you have
declared it we need a constructor where
you will create the object of it so I
will say public alien repository where
you will create an object of that so we
say agent repository and now here we
will create an object of aliens right
and that's how you do it that's the one
of the advantage of using constructor so
we can enjoy our variables and then so
we have enjoys our reference variable
now which is aliens in this case now I
want to have some static data okay of
course you can imagine this data is
coming from database but then we don't
really mean we are not really creating a
database see all right so let's mock it
up so what I will do is the thing which
you are doing here these aliens we will
cut this part and let's put it here in
the inner repository right so we already
have two aliens here and let's add these
two aliens in our in our D so it's the
aliens dot add
and let's add a 1 and let's say aliens
dot add we'll say a 2 now what will
happen is if you want to fetch this
aliens of course you will grading these
2 aliens or maybe you want to add some
more aliens you can do that right it is
available for you ok that sounds good
now once you've got this constructor
where you're adding these values now we
need a method which will return all the
aliens so what I will do is I will say
public which will return you the list of
agency in this video we are going to
only talk about the suppository how do I
create all the methods so I will say
aliens dot get aliens which written you
the number of a list of aliens and now
we can we can simply return whatever
alien object you have so we say aliens
return alien right so whenever someone
asks you for gate aliens they will
return this aliens here right is that
simple
then you need a method which will ok so
you need a method now which will return
only ok maybe you want to fetch return
only one object maybe it is possible
right if someone says hey I don't want
all the aliens I want an alien object
with ID 1 0 2 that's possible again it
will be seeing that how do you send our
equation declined ok let me know I mean
just to let you know ok first of all let
me remove this thing here ok so first of
all when you talk about this list here
when you talk about requests so requests
will be for any type right or requests
will be for only aliens which will
return all the aliens maybe in future
will be working on how to return one
object by ID so let's say if I specify
idea 1 0 2 you return that to the object
maybe you want to delete alien so you
will do all those things with your focus
repository
again how to implement that in this
resource that we'll see later but time
in let's focus on this repository so
maybe you want to fetch one particular
object so in that case what you will do
is you will say public again this will
make more sense after some time as you
talk about how do you how do you use
that resource so we'll say public alien
and we'll say this is gate
alien if you want only one alien and the
thing is if you want only one alien how
do you specify which alien you want so
of course in this method you have to
specify a primary key which is ID in
this case I hope it's ID now based on
the in an ID will fetch that
object right how do we do that here how
do we implement that concept here so
whatever you do is I will say I want any
object of alien so it's a alien a 1
equal to but how do I return that
particular alien from the list
okay that's what that's a difficult
thing now let's say body part we'll say
it is null or maybe let's say null and
let's return that a 1 but then how do
you fit that particular object from a
list so what you have to do is you have
to say we have to run a for loop we'll
say a alien a colon and we will refer
this this is this is to the alien list
which is aliens and you will run to the
loop and you will check if if the alien
a dot get ID matches with a is equal to
ID in that case return a right so now
what will happen is it doesn't matter
what we are returning here it's like we
don't even need this thing but here we
have to return some things right we say
new agent we don't want to return null
value because that will generate a null
point exception if you are not able to
find an agent it will return a blank
data for alien but at least you're not
returning null so what we are returning
is yeah so we have four in fact you know
what detain null will be a good thing
because in future we will be looking at
that as well so if you send a particular
ID we will return that ID and we will
check if the ID matches with the ID
which you which is in the list it will
return that particular object otherwise
we return null right this for one ID
this one alien maybe you want to have
some more maybe you want to have methods
like a delete update so you can do you
can write this all those things here so
again will be I will be completing this
and then we will see how to work with
this source but then how do you how do
you work with at least this resource so
what I will do here is I will say let me
create an object of agent resource here
so I will say alien repository not the
resource agent repository and we'll say
this is repo which works the database
and we'll say new in a repository
okay that's why because the object and
then from here instead of saying return
aliens will say therefore dot get aliens
right so now you're fetching data from
database now it feels that you're
fetching from data from database right
so this if you look at this alien
resource now we don't know from where
you will get the data but we are getting
data that's important right now to make
it work what I will do is I will I click
on application I hope there's not a
server running on this this machine
let's just run as a non run on server
now sometime it does happen that I might
be having some other server walking
let's let's see let's say click on
finish and I cannot see any error the
okay everything seems good so let's say
that send a request for web web api and
let's say aliens and you got your data
now trust me this data is coming from
the depository because there is no other
way you can return system this right
so yeah this data is coming from the
depository which is here so again we
will see how do you do other stuff as
well they are producing the resource
because in the next video we'll talk
about how do you produce some more
resources and then how to update delete
all the stuff on the way so if you are
