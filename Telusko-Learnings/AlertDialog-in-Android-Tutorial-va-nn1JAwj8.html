from telesco learnings and in this video
we'll talk about alert dialogue alert
dialogue so what we are what we want to
do in this example is we have a app here
which has which is a banking application
or maybe any banking application so in
this we are providing name account
number and balance so if I click on this
show button it will show the name of the
person if I click on show this second
show button it will show the account
number and if I click on the third show
it will print the balance so if I click
on this show it says Navin if I click on
this show it says the account number and
if I click on this show
the the my balance should not be open in
the public right so if you know by
mistake if I click on this button it
will show my balance right so what I
want if I click on this button it should
it should show me the alert sure you
want to show the balance and if I click
on OK then only it should show the
message right so and you can see if I
click outside of the dialog box vanishes
so we'll do that we'll try to cover that
point also and if I click on this cancel
it should also it vanishes and if I
click on this OK button it shows my
balance so this is what we want to do so
before that we have to understand how
alert dialogue works and we want one
more thing here if I click on this black
back button it should it should show
that you really want to exit and if I
click on this OK button it will exit
otherwise it will not ok and you can see
if I clicking outside also it is not not
getting close right so we'll see how to
do that and if I click on this OK button
the app will close so this is what we
want from this example now how to do
that so I have already created a design
so that we can save the time so have
created this design by providing linear
layout so I have dragged everything on
the screen so we have a text view text
view text view so we have this three
text views here these are your text
views and then we have three buttons and
the name of this text views are so we
have txt name
we have txt account number and then we
have txt balance so that's your three
text field
and then we have three buttons the first
button name is a BTN name then we have B
to an account and then we have BTN
balance right now once we got these
three things let's go back to the Java
file so we have we have created this
three text field we have graters three
button so that I can so that your time
will be saved I don't want you to waste
your time so that have already created
that for you now then the first thing
we'll do is we'll try to show the name
of balance so if I run this code now
because what I have all day in the
emulator was the earlier code so I have
already created the application
I have run the application for you now I
have removed all the coding so we are
running it once again and so this is
this this this app will be like a blank
app with it will not work so even if I
click on show button it will not work
because I have not provided the feature
right so that so if I click on back is
not not asking for exit so that code I
have removed that code now so let me
just try it out so let's add some
actions so we'll say BTN name dot set on
click listener that's how you provide it
is now right so we'll say new on click
listener and this what we'll do is we'll
provide something called a so we said
txt named dot set text as soon as I
click on this button should sprint
naveen then if I say BTN of BTN account
and if I say set on click listener it
says new on click it will print txt what
this is for account number right so
let's say my account number when I
forgot what a take on number I mentioned
that so as I said this is a SBI that's
my bank name so let's say this is SBI
400 that's my account number and we'll
say BTN dot or BTN what it was what it
was
Nino's balance so it's a bit is which
was BTN balance we'll say dot set on
click listener will say new on click
listener here will say a txt balance dot
set text and we'll show
five hundred so let's say yeah five
let's say five thousand so that's my
bank balance right in fact if i
underscore let's see what is it working
so that we can continue so if I lent
this call it will take some time to load
okay it's loading loading it's going on
okay here it is if I click on the show
button it says nothing if I click on
this show I got the account number if I
click on this button it says five
thousand but hold on I don't I don't
want to show the balance right away
right what we want we want to show the
alert so how you have to use alert here
so for that we have to use so to show
the alert we have to create alert dialog
will say this is alert and we'll say
equal to now in order to create object
of alert or basically allow object
creation follows a build up pattern okay
so it's a java concept you should know
about builder pattern first to work to
understand how exactly it works even if
you don't know how builder pattern works
or if you know the basic concept of Java
you will understand what I am doing but
to understand it thoroughly you should
know the Builder design pattern so does
Bill design pattern in Java so just
search for better design pattern in Java
by the disco so that's my channel name
so I have already created a video on
that
just watch that video just pause this
video go back to the Builder pattern
understand how it works so that you will
get the exact point what I am doing here
okay so yeah so let's let's say after
that if you are continue with the
example so in order to create build up
at and what we'll do is so before doing
this let us create object of alert so
let us understand how Builder pattern
works here so builder is so in Android
dialogue also in alert dialog we have or
builder as inner class so we need to
first create object of builder so we'll
say this is a load dialog dot builder
and in this you have to mention for
which file you're working with so we are
working with the main activities so this
Manor
without this okay now once we got the
object of builder I forgot to mention
builder here so our builder so we have
to first create object of builder and to
this builder we have to add some things
so first thing you have to set the
message so we'll say this the first
thing we'll message and the message I
want to print here is let us say are you
sure so that's the message I want to
print okay so that's the first thing the
next is so with the same object we have
to provide again a dot will set this dot
will be for set so we have two things we
have a positive button and then we'll be
having a negative button in the positive
button you have to show the first thing
we have to show the text and the second
thing you have to show the listener so
once you click on the listener what
should happen so for that you have to
say new dialog its dialogue interface so
we have to say dialogue interface is it
there okay so we got dialogue interface
so as soon as I click on this dialogue
interface it has a on click listener so
once I click on this button okay what we
should do is we should show the balance
right so this balance you should be you
should be showing here so that is a
positive message but let's say if you
are not providing a mass positive
message you are clicking on the you are
clicking on not positive but this time
you're clicking on negative so in this
in this scenario if you are clicking on
the negative button what it should do is
it should show the text as cancel dot or
comma or once you click on this or what
you do long back it there so once I
click on cancel what it should do is in
fact nothing we can provide null it
should not do anything okay okay so we
have once we have set these two things
what we can do here is we can say build
up dot create so that is how you create
a alert box and then we can say alert
dot show I think it will work now so we
have created to alert dialog aloud
dialog and then we have to create a
builder and using that builder you have
to get up
have to call a method which is great now
let us see it with walking if I done
this code what's going on it will take
some time
whatever app here if I click on this
show it working it's working and if I
click on this show button it says okay
we got a lot dialogue which is are you
sure if I click on okay we got the
balance right okay but if I again click
on what happens if I click on cancel or
is it canceling let me just let me just
reopen this app okay let's see how it
works so let me just reopen the app here
okay so if I click on this show button
the click on cancel so it's working
right so it's not if we are not able to
see the balance right so that's that is
how you use alert here but we also we
also want alert when you press back
right so what we'll do is we'll try to
so far what what you have to do for back
yeah so anyway you whenever you want to
work with a back button so we have to
override a method which is on back
pressed right this is this is the method
we have to use so this is on back
pressed now in this we have to write at
override so that we can match because we
are auditing the method right okay so
it's on back so the steps are so
whenever you want alert so you have to
say alert dialogue builder a new alert
dialogue builder because we are before
creating the alert object we have to
give it builder object and then we can
say builder dot create and then we can
say show right and here you have to so
what we can do is we can directly create
an object we can say
oh right new and say with the alert
dialogue and then so we can create a
named object or we can also create
anonymous object right so even that that
is possible so okay let me create a
named object itself so we'll say this is
okay first let's start with the alert
itself so we say alert dialogue dot
builder okay and then we'll say this is
burrito equal to in fact we can just
copy with copy paste this code right so
why not let me just copy with this code
here okay and in fact this is called as
code reuse right we never say it is copy
paste we always say this is code reuse
okay so there are certain things we have
to set here not exactly the same thing
but different things because we are
showing a different we also want the
what you say the the title so we'll say
set title we want a title as let us say
really exit okay and then we want a
negative button that's turn we got the
positive button but once you click on
the positive but watch what it should do
is it should finish the activity right
so to finish the activity what we can do
is we can say main activity dot super we
can call the on that's on back so
whatever it's on back press right so we
have to call the on back press of the
superclass so it will exit otherwise it
will not exit it will say simply null I
think that will work now so that's how
we use alert and let's run this let's
see if you are getting the output so let
me run this go back to the output let me
in my new running is loading it will
take some time to load and here it is
and if I click on this show button it's
working it I'm getting I'm getting all
the values and if I click on this bag
button it says are you sure and if I say
okay it's working right it getting exit
so that's how you use a lot here and
let's say if I do not want to close the
example if I done this activity once
again let me just reopen the activity
here it will take okay so if I open the
activity always the activity it is is it
for what which one it was
if I click on this
so once I click on this activity and if
I click on back and if I click anywhere
outside the alert you can see it is
automatically getting closer I do not
want that so we can set one more
property here anywhere because it is a
builder pattern so we can say dot set
cancelable we can say false and if you
set it has a cancelable false and if I
run this code now once again it will
take some time to load the new one okay
let me just pause the video by the time
okay
although a new app if I click on back
you can see if I clicking outside it is
not getting close right so we have to
set on cancelable false to do that ok so
that's how you that's how your alert
dialog works so thank you so much for
watching if you have any doubts just
comment in the comment section and
that's it do subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
