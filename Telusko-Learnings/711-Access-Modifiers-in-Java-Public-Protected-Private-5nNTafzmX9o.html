from telescope learnings and in this
video we talk about access specifiers a
hold on in java we don't have anything
like specifies we have access modifiers
so if you are coming from C++ background
you might be knowing about it specifies
right we have / io 8 we have public they
have predicted but in Java we don't have
specifiers we just have modifiers okay
so if we talk about abstract final
private public protected this all our
modifiers not specified okay now in the
end of the video you will understand why
this course modifiers okay because I
will show you some demo in the example
in that I will mention what is modifiers
and what is what is how to seek that
their modifiers so we'll talk about
modifiers here we'll talk about we have
already talked about final we have all
they talked about the abstract and this
video will talk about public predicted
and private so we start with class okay
I will talk about variables later we
will talk about class first so if we
talk about class the only modifier you
can use with class is final abstract
public and private not even private you
can only use public final abstract and
public you cannot use private you cannot
use predicted class okay okay a few
videos inner class if you have a inner
class then you can use private otherwise
you cannot use private keyword with
class okay so the only thing you can use
is public final abstract and that's it
that's it we can also keep that stuff
blank so you can do if we can remove
public also we can say only class a so
we can have public class a we can we can
also have class a right the difference
is if you like just class a not not
public it will be called as default
class okay because by default the
default is the axis that's - weird right
so now how so what's the impact of this
so let's say we have these two classes
we have class app which is which has a
main function and we have a class a if
this class a is not public okay we are
not mentioning any data right there okay
so will it be private let's try so let's
make it private you cannot do that right
because you cannot make a public or we
cannot make a class private so remove
that let's say we have class
a now in this scenario if you want to
create this object of this class a
inside your app you can simply say a obj
equal to new a now you can see both the
classes belong the same package and
that's why your d-don't you are not
getting any error let's say let me
change the package name of a class so
instead of comm dot ABC let me make it
ABCD
now you can see we started we got the
error on the app which says it is
invisible right it's not visible it's
because if you are not mentioning the
public keyword to your class you cannot
access that class outside the package so
if you want to access a class outside
the package make sure it is public okay
so you can use the default class only in
that particular package not outside it
okay that's why normally classes should
be public so that's done with the class
let us talk about the variables and
methods so you can make your variable
you can make your methods as public you
can make it private you can make it
predicted the difference will be if you
don't pension anything if you don't
mention public private predicted if you
remove all these three things
by default it will be default which
simply means you cannot access this
thing outside the package as you can see
in this example that's why you have to
make it public so that you can access
this outside the package okay so if you
want to use a variable outside the
package make sure it is public but
normally what happens is we are using
this concept of encapsulation very we
say that everything should be private
and in order to be access the variable
you should use methods so method should
be public of course but you can also
make your methods as private so let's
say you have a method in which or so you
have a class inside you have two methods
you want to call the second method from
the first method and the first mother is
public so you can make the second to
that private because you don't want
other to call that method right so you
can make it private so if you make if
you make any variable or method as
private you can access that thing from
the same class not outside the class if
it not outside the class not not even
outside the package right so private is
only specific class default is only
specific package now what about public
from any package doesn't matter any
class and
what about protected so if you make any
variable as predicted it can be used
only in the subsequent classes so let's
say from we have a plot we have Class B
which exchange Class A now Class B can
access that variable sounds good
so that is modifiers ok and you can see
if you if you mention any illegal
modifier there if you make it pop
private class you can see there is an
error which says illegal modifier that
means that public or that private is a
modifier not this specifier okay so
let's it's like this video this is all
about packages in this is all about
specifiers in java so that's it thanks
