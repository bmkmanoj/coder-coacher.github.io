at the start so we have seen how to
insert the element at the end now we'll
see how to add at the element edge start
so what we are going to do here is let's
create another method and we'll name
this method as public void insert and
then we'll say insert at start okay so
we just have to pass a value there so I
would say the value would be inch data
that's the value of y we are going to
pass now let's try to add the value now
how do we add a value so if you think
about this the same thing which we have
drawn before let me just take it take
you there
now I remember this image now I want to
add a element at the start so I would
say a new element and this element will
go at the start so let's say the element
is maybe 25 so I want to add 25 and this
will go at the start now now when you
say start it simply means that you just
need to change your head location from
the current low current object to a new
object so this is the new head location
and the value or the address for this
one would be the idea of the first
element which is 18 so the ID is 22 so I
want this trying to be here so that it
will refer to this element now so now
the new element is at this start so if
the head will become the new element and
it will have the address of the previous
first element so that's tree how do we
implement that the same steps we have to
get an old so I can you know I can
simply copy paste the code now what I
can do is I can say okay the same thing
will remain this this thing will remain
same so we'll copy and paste it to you
again we cannot say copy paste I can say
code reuse so I would say paste here and
once I caught the value the only thing
you have to do now is the node so we
have to say head node is equal to note
the current node okay so when you say
when you say you have to say head equal
to node so the current node will become
the header but even before doing that I
just need to way if I just need to
mention that the next node for this so
this so the current node next node
should be the first node and it is then
in the head right so how does the first
node initially so I would say before I
sign the node to head you will say node
dot next I want to say head so whatever
value was having with the head will be
the next for this one
let's say this node is maybe let's name
it as n6 so this node will have an
address of this node initially this node
was head so we can simply say no dot
next is equal to head is that simple
let's verify this working just to verify
that what I'm going to do is let's go
back to Donna after printing after
adding twelve let's say insert at start
I will say insert at start and the
element I want to insert is 25 so now 25
becomes the first element let's run this
code and you can see we got 25 to start
so this is simple now we can add the
limit has start itself at start what we
are doing is we are creating our node
and just saying that the node next
element would be the previous head node
and now head will be changed to the node
so head will be pointing to the first
node the node which you have created in
test now that is how you insert at start
the next method we are going to do is
insert at any location so I would say
insert at and then we are just missed by
two things the first thing you have to
mention is the index value and then you
specify the actual data now when you
specify index value maybe I want to
insert a data here so I would say least
dot insert and I would say insert at at
position two now index number Norma
starts with zero and we'll say data is
let's say 55 so I want to add 55 at
location two so when I say location to
eat to 0 it is 0 location so this is my
0 object now and this is the first this
is the second one and this is third one
so when I say I want to insert this 55
at okay I want to add 55 object at index
2 which means here so we got a new
object and this will be 55 and this will
have some address so this object is like
a first object we refer to the new
object and the new object will refer to
this one so now this becomes three and
this becomes four in fact we don't have
to number that but then this is how you
push you have to push this one to the
next location
so what you will do is you will just
mention this node will change to this
address and the new node which you have
credit will be will refer to the next
object okay now how do we do that and we
are why we getting why we are getting
error there so I will go back to my
linked list I guess I have not saved it
now
how do you mention that so to achieve
that what you will do is we'll say node
node equal to new node again the same
steps in fact you can have copied it so
it's a paste yeah this thing is for sure
it with every insert now in this case we
have to traverse right because we have
specific index value we have to traverse
from that location to the to the truth
index value and to travel we have to
again start with the node the head node
so I will say n equal to head so
remember whenever you want to traverse
you have to always say and Nordic I mean
node n equal to head and how do we
traverse now since we know the index
values so anybody know the value it's
always better to start with a loop so
with that trace what you have to go to
this point so if your index values 2 you
have to reach till 1 so if in this one
is 2 you have to reach till 1 because in
1 you have to make the changes right so
if I send x value 2
you have to make the changes here I
guess this thing is not properly visible
let me just rewrite again as I'm very
bad with writing and writing so if just
let me do that once again so I got the
first object here so we got the first
object with it is 18 and which is
referring to the next object which is 45
which is referring to the next object
let's say this is 12 and oh we before
that we got 25 right because 25 is the
first element now so 25 fi into 18 8 and
referring to 45 45 fi into this one
now Vanessa say you want to count when I
say index body - it means this is 0 I
have to start with 0 this is 1 and this
is 2 and this is 3
now when you say - that means you have
to get a new node here somewhere here
and let's say the value is 55 so you
have to reach till this node first in
this node you have to change the
location from here to from this a door
to this arrow and from here you have to
effort this one so first you have to
reach till this point
now since the next index 1 is 2 you have
to reach till 1 how do we reach till 1
is by saying let me just go back there
so we'll use a for loop and in here I
would say int I equal to 0 and I would
say I less than equal to index minus 1
and I would say I plus plus in fact not
minus 1 with the index now every time
you Travis you have to say n equal to n
dot next that's how you traverse right
ok now if there is one change when you
say next that means we have to say minus
1
we have to reach here this node by
referring next because next itself is
going for the next node safe to say
minus one you have to come one back once
you reach to this point you just have to
you just need to change the address all
right you have to change the address of
this node with the new node but even
before doing that I will change the
address of this node to the dis node so
this node the new node which have
created that is node so this in this
current situation this is node and this
is n I want to have the value of node
next to the this value now to achieve
that what we will do here is we'll say
no dot next is equal to n dot next so n
is this one so whatever value so
whatever value is there here will go
into this node right because this value
is nothing but the pointer or the
reference with the next node okay we
have done that now we have to update
this value so this this node so the
eighteenth node now will have the
address of this node and to do that we
simply say n dot next is equal to node
and by doing this our job is done let's
verify so I would say insert a - let me
just run this code and you can see we
got 55 at - so 25 18 and 55 is that
simple awesome right so this is how you
add the remaining bit in between but
there's only one twist what if I add
adds up location because for zero
location it is a bit different right so
if we run this code now you can see it
is adding at the first location so it is
not working so for 0 we have to put a
special condition here so we will check
if the index value is equal equal to 0
what we will do is we'll simply call
because see when you say 0 it means you
want to you want to add at start right
so you simply call that method start by
passing this data so in case if the
ninja star is 0 that means your
intention is to start from the first
location so you have to say insert I'd
say insert I'd start so this is how you
add the element at any location which
you want so I hope you got the idea how
to add at start and how to add at any
location in the next video we'll see how
do we delete the element so let me know
into your thoughts in the comment
section if you find it difficult to
understand I will try to make another
video understanding making understanding
this one that's it
