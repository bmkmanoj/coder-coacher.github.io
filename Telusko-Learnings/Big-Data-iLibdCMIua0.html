is nothing 20 and in this series of
tutorials will choose a topic one topic
in one episode and we talk about the
introduction of that topic which talk
about what is the technology why to use
the technology and when implement now if
you see this tutorial it will help you
to increase your knowledge so you make
sure you subscribe the channel and watch
the video and today we will talk about
Big Data now what is Big Data just
imagine this is huge amount of data now
then if you talk about the world we have
huge amount of data now and 90% of this
data is generated in last two years just
imagine you know if it taught if you
talk about big data we have three vzo we
have volume we have velocity and we have
variety now if you focus on these three
things just imagine the volume part what
is volume here you know you use facebook
or you watch that you use YouTube on
YouTube we upload 12 hours of YouTube
footage every minute just imagine if
this is terabytes of data in a second
you know if you talk about 1990 200 GB
of data used to created in one year in
one year that's the second one 1990 9700
GB of data integrated in one day and now
if we talk about 2050 not 16 we generate
approximately 50 or 40 thousand
gigabytes a second okay that is the
speed of data we're generating
so we are generating huge amount of data
plus with these rapid speed so we have
huge volume we have huge velocity or
very fast velocity the next thing is
variety only of used to get a structured
way of data so let me imagine your table
structure so you can access any data
with the help of SQL so the problem is
now with the generate data which is not
a structure what we generate images
which generate videos you know whenever
you go to a picnic or maybe for a food
why are we good for a tool why do why we
enjoy on this places earlier we used to
this places now we go to that place
those places only to take pics and we
don't take one photo we take thousands
of photo for one trip and each photo
will cost you around 3 MB so just
imagine GBS of data is created for one
trip when you were to wash them you take
selfies each selfies each selfie will
take three and B and you don't take one
self you take five selfies in one
washroom and a one if you wash your face
you will take five selfies 15 MB at a
time and you don't upload that data at
one place you upload that data at
multiple immanuel places like Facebook
whatsapp on minista Nam you're
generating 45 MB of data for one face
wash just imagine in this world we have
3 billion people using internet now and
if everyone started the same thing we
are generating some very very huge
amount of data approximately 2.5
Quintilian bytes of data is generated
every year now if you don't know is
quite alien it's simply 1 and 18 zeros
of bytes ok it's very huge now then
question is how to process those huge
amount of data but you will say why to
process those information once you've
got the information save it somewhere
but hold on guys
now we have this companies like we have
zero ops we have IBM we have Apple we
have all these companies and even if you
talk about banks they generate huge
amount of data forth and this data is
not best things for them these aren't
valuable resources so they want to use
this data but then question is how will
they process this data because they want
to take decisions depend upon this data
so we have to make sure as maybe
software engineer or as the what you say
data people we need to process those
data and we need to provide those stats
now how to process those data we require
a technology which can process that data
so we have big data here and we need to
process that data with some tool and
that tool now is hadoo okay and two we
can use this head you have to work with
those data so earlier Google
it's own technological has MapReduce and
now MapReduce is now Hadoop from a
different community
now why Hadoop is so powerful is because
you can run head you on commodities
hardware so you can buy your own servers
you can have your own laptop to process
those huge amount of data and that's why
big data is so important as for this as
per this survey in here till the year
2018 will be getting approximately lakhs
of millions of job vacancies only for
big data it's a huge huge in demand now
so what I will suggest if you if you are
searching for technology where you want
to master Big Data is one of the
technology ok so yeah that's it from
this video so you make sure you
subscribe to channel so that you can
watch the further series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
