network is perfect
hi everyone and so let me start let me
start with my own way so welcome back
aliens my name is Ivan ready and record
Shradha appear who is an anti dollar
pole so I would I would request Rada to
continue with the stuff I want other to
Italy itself hello guys what's up I'm
shadow of shake here
I'm Android developer and knowing think
I can spired and fresher Android
developer to make make an app so I'm
here to motivate you guys maybe after
this session you will be able to make
your first app that's great shut up
okay so I have some questions for you
because this is the first time we are
doing it right and in fact I have done
this type of session before with with
one of my friend Abby shake and now
you're the second one yeah so I'm trying
to do this type of sessions more and
more because they're different how
people some people want to go for the
big data some people want to go for iOS
I'm trying to search best people for
best domain and I got you as the best
eye developer as I know I have seen all
your hard work working as I mean as a
student then as learning different
technologies I have seen your updates on
Facebook on on your apps so what exactly
now you are doing so what is your
current plan and what you're thinking
about what you go to and doing future
right now I have just started my own
come
but it's company have no plan no name in
this there is one company is there we
gonna invent F hold a nightmare just
thinking about ideas to build an app to
do something different to change the
world instead of building Empire for
someone else we are trying to build
Empire for us that's a good thing in
fact I have seen I have seen lots of
people nowadays they want to do
something but the only problem is they
don't know what to do it of all they
don't they are not aware of the
technologies available and even if their
technologies they're not sure how can he
go forward but that's what this session
will be helpful today and oh there's
okay so let me just verify if everything
is perfect okay great ha so question for
you the next question for you shut up
when you started all this thing when i
was when i was in mca that time i had a
dream that i would just want to see my
app on play store I just had a dream
it's oh it's all started from my dream
so I just wanted to make app which I can
search on play store and able to
download and save my f name on my phone
but I didn't know how to make it and I
was not a great developer that time even
right now I'm not I'm still a big nerd
oh so that time I need a motive I needed
motivation like here many pressure
related motivation so I came to know
there is the I was very inspired from M
indicator developer I was inspired from
that app but and some somewhere I read
that I am indicator developer on 15
lakhs a month and when I searched about
it research about it that app is freely
available everywhere then how he earned
money from that so I I came to know in
Mumbai video TI college he is coming
after few days for a speech so me and my
train decided let's go there we'll ask
this question in public how do you earn
money from that and how it's and from
where did you get motivation to make
that tap so we went to listen that
speech then we'll ask this question that
how did you earn how do you earn money
from that so it's obvious no one share
their business the one share their
reveal their earning method so he said
all depends upon earning I can say that
is what I will say one word you have to
research about it that is this is called
Adsense and AdMob go research when I
came out of that room I saw there was a
festival going on in BJT I call it I saw
that there is worth event was going on
learn how to make an app within a day so
I said maybe it's destiny let's join its
cost of the event was founded only so me
and fire my friend joined that event and
within a 1 R I made my first app without
coding so there is one website by using
that you can make an app so from that
like I get motivation there without
doing without knowing coding you can
make an app and I went back to home I
research about Adsense AdMob yeah there
is advertisement company and you you can
earn by clicks and sessions so I started
building my own apps my first app which
was billionaire Coates I always had I
always have a dream to become a
billionaire so three would be higher
because if your dream is not that much
higher that you feel uncomfortable to
tell others so it's not big tree slow
yeah so my first app was billionaire
codes which are published on 7 January
2015 15 yeah and after a few days I got
my first download first three downloads
actually and so I was very excited then
after one week I owned my first dollar
or in one think you've got your first
dollar our first dollar so like channel
me around I guess 15 days to get that
spike of 0.5 sense it is and as much
gives you a good thing did yeah I you
know here do this quite difficult dude
not for money even it wasn't for money I
just had a dream to see my PAP but then
it turned into business I saw my first
was dollar in in a week then after
second week I started realizing I'm
getting one dollar every day so now it
was $30 a month so I knew after three
months I'm gonna get first hundred
dollar so I started building more apps
that I have to raise to at least $4 a
day then I'll start only $100 a month
then I started building more apps I
started searching the moves more
searchable keyword on the Play Store I
had a different state strategy so then I
will to started building technical apps
on hacking programming then after a
month I started earning $10 a day it
$300 a month first early my first
earning was $200 after three months it
was huge imagine as a student
second-year student you are getting to
12,000 to 12,000 every month so even
attending while attending college I'm
eating I'm traveling I am sleeping I am
getting paid for it that's an awesome
feeling actually
yeah that's an awesome feeling so
everyone I used to get 340 $300 and it
was keep on increasing $400 every month
then next minutes come in find $8.00
so I started taking then I one day I
realize I have to take this business
seriously then my exams came I wasn't
able to concentrate but even while
giving exam I was getting paid I
used to get fined $1 a month then I
started doing internship for terribly
till you should know about it
so then after now I have completed my
internship so now I'm giving full-time
to my app development because now I can
see I have on thousand dollars from my
apps in the month so I can see if I'll
get if well if I'm going to do a job
somewhere so I'm I'm getting salary of
40,000 50,000 and I have to work hold a
night for my company and I won't get
anything only forty to fifty thousand
and here without doing anything from my
old labs I am getting seventy do it it
house it so it's different feeling
better than working for somewhere else I
am working for myself but maybe maybe
them money is not the main motivation
here is not the motivation you are
working on something which you like
you're your own boss here alright you
are trying to change the world by
building those apps right that's great
in fact that's that's the one thing I
always liked about you you know the
updates you give on Facebook about your
apps and then the number of downloads in
fact I've seen some of your apps and
they were awesome ok may not be I can't
say that it can compete with the betta
apps well then as an individual when you
make an application it can complete
those all right I saw okay so I have one
more question for you shut up oh so
let's say there's a person and he want
to start off before that have one more
question what do you actually have
actually on page because this thing we
should have sent me has multiple apps
you know I thought okay you can tile
every day you make one app maybe yeah
how many have how many apps are there
actually if any fresher will start
making a table by one console when they
can publish their app so people publish
three to four apps but I have more than
ten console ten Play Store server where
every console have 30 to 40 apps it
means I have more than 100
ABB's on play store which is downloaded
all around the world
okay and I guess some of your labs also
has some of food outlets yeah one of my
dev is going to cross million downloads
and there are many apps who have already
crossed one leg downloads oh wait that's
awesome so what are tips you will give
to a new person let's say if I want to
start into development in fact there are
lots of people they maybe not maybe not
may not become money but let's say they
want you let's say they want to learn
under development if they want to make
an own app so what do you think how can
we how can they start building this okay
okay if you are fresher so you will have
a dream to make an app like what self
Facebook but if you will start from big
you will never be able to make that app
so start from small go step by step then
you will be able to build something
suppose if you want to make an food
delivery app so you have to think
logically behind it what modules they
have it looks hard but it's it's not
hard because in in a food deliveries
suppose so my tow app it's not me I
think they have normal static data when
you deliver when you can you select when
you place the order you just click on
the button from their main functions
start executing from that or from their
order goes to server and then from
server it goes to the hotel machine that
said you have to write that much code
and your first I will be ready so start
from small break your model into pieces
and it's very important to know you
don't need to you don't know need to
know great programming to start making
an app even without knowing programming
you can build an app if you have that
much dedication if you know how to use
Google and YouTube you just have to
search how to make an app or a socket it
is okay
everything's okay now it hurts okay now
the second question for you is you know
there are lots of there are lots of ways
of making applications right now when I
proposed idea development
I'd go for Java now they have a new
language part and the other I've -
optional as well so what what option you
tricked and why do you think it is
better I can it's it will be your choice
again what do you think which you prefer
I prefer Android studio dual Android
studio and Java language because there
are there are many ways to build an app
there is easiest way to build an app by
using some website there are many
website who provide the facility to
build an app but there you won't be able
to give provide some great functionality
because websites have some limitations
and there is another way to build an app
is PhoneGap in which you can build an
app we can write a code results and you
can you cannot publish in iOS Android
Blackberry everywhere you have to just
write code once but they're in PhoneGap
there is one problem you will face
performance you know the performance
will be very low and in Android studio
I prefer Android studio Java because
it's pure native programming for Android
development and it gives all type of
permissions functionality modules to add
in your app and it gives great
performance okay that's great and and
what you right now Kotlin is a new
language now people will move from Java
to cotton so what is your plan I guess
it's not very it's not important from
where where we are moving it's important
to become a good developer you should
know if you know how to learn
programming language how to debug you
can learn to any programming language
you can you can move to any programming
language of the word because it will
keep
changing every year because ever
angularjs few years ago now react.js now
there is a wave dot J's so it's keeps on
changing and so if you are it doesn't
matter whether it's a new technology new
language if you are if you know how to
debug your code you can start any
language from today if you face any
other just you have to learn how to
solve that error from by using Stack
Overflow that's it then you know the
whole length language of the word oh
that's great
and what do you think which is the best
and best website to learn stuff because
of course there are classes available
you can join the classes ok so what do
you think I mean you have launched
although all the technologies yeah so
it's coincident in my BSC iti headed I I
wanted to make a project so whole class
yeah the first the first and main
important tip for the B word is to
always go for hard never go for easy
language because PhoneGap is easy every
network making website from website is
easy so how is difficult that's why I
have to see Dawa Android studio and in
in my dears Eid I had to make project
the whole class was making project in
dotnet because it was easy drag-and-drop
functionality no one was ready to make
project in Java so I already that time
also I already had a client who wanted
me to make project in south dotnet so I
thought I already know about dotnet I
don't want to repeat the same project I
wanted to build something I don't know
by learning Java so that time I started
searching on YouTube how to be project
in Java Java for beginners that time
there was one person who was teaching
Android sorry Java programming on
YouTube this name was now been ready I
started watching your videos I start
learn from you that how dot all
programming you should teach circulate
swings
all those how to build an website in
Java so I started learning from you and
build my first Java probably and my
friend was making out of 120 118 people
build project in dotnet and me and my
friend bill in Java so he got first rank
and my I got second ring and so then
from there I started and in Android here
also I am I'm choosing the toughest one
native stuff so I am going for tough
because easy is easy don't get settle
for easy so when whatever I have to
learn I search on YouTube how to build
this and there are hundreds of videos
thousands of videos we can watch and
learn ok so was this so specific channel
guides again you can just go to yeah
yeah you don't need to join any class
everything is available on YouTube you
just need to learn how to use YouTube
whatever you want to learn whatever
function you want to build you just have
to type you will get the solution yeah
in fact I even I suggestions you know
there are lots of people they want to
learn the only thing is they are
searching for the perfect solution I
mean they're searching for the classes
they are searching for all these things
the thing is YouTube there in fact
that's Mexico as well where you can
learn everything for free I can pay for
something is not a bad thing you know I
do think that investing in from
investing learnings are technology
that's not a bad thing but then if you
can't get the better thing of the why
not to go for that are the only thing is
there are some people they only learn
they don't implement so one of the
reason why I kept this session is
because I found out that you are the one
who have not just learned but also
implemented and I guess that's what has
taken you from nowhere to everywhere
because the main thing what you did is
implementation and that's what you mean
agenda for today's session is not don't
just learn try to implement stuff that's
in that is more important right right oh
that's great saga in fact awesome
experience now let's take some questions
because I can see there are lots of
questions coming here okay so let me
take out one
but this is not rated time go ID desert
it machine check for questions here hey
guys we open for questions
oh okay but where is a lecture okay so
you're not able to find the lectures on
PhoneGap I guess YouTube has lots of
sessions on there is a few websites from
where you can learn that is called EDX
EDX be nice not to watch it right just
in section 3 DX dot oh okay EDX dot o RG
so there's a comment section ah Coursera
and that is one more website udemy
udemy.com there you can get professional
lectures directly from Howard University
campus University and it available free
of course that's right yeah ok next
question for you suburb is very
interesting question and the question is
what's your age now I'm 24 years old and
I just completed mca right yeah I just
completed my post graduation in master's
in computer application oh great next
question is ok a question is is far this
good for sour
oh it's firebase good all having your
own server are you five days yeah it's
good because because it's provided by
Google so instead of using something
it's not provided by Google you will say
some problem so the firebase give many
inbuilt functionality so try to use
those functionality so it will be used
easy for you oh great so firebase is
good that's what your point is right
okay great
Oh next question I want to be okay so
there's a person who says I want to be a
game developer I enjoy it so any any
exception for that shut up how to be
again to the Android app development and
game development both are two different
world because in the app development you
to learn Java you have to use Android
studio as a tool and a game development
it's totally different world you have to
you have to learn graphics 3d animation
and all this different thing and you
have to use udemy I heard that udemy
tool you can use udemy and even in that
your fall before that you have to learn
Java language so it's two different but
very interesting great you can get a
course about udemy on EDX it's available
free of course okay we're talking about
a unity or udemy because I'm not sure
you ramiz a website right would I be the
website and unity is to me ok great you
got a question for you oh if you suggest
a language for someone is will it be
okay so just a language for now will it
be Catalan or Java let's say facial is
there no you asked him to learn Catalan
or Java and like I would okay you you
answer yourself and then I will also try
to answer that question I'll suggest
Java because it will never gonna flop it
will never gonna flop because billions
of devices turns on Java there can Dirk
there is a possibility that there can be
there is possibility of get the whole
language can get flop after a few years
and new technologies can come but Java
the Java will be always core of
everything and it's the first one so you
have to learn Java if you know Java then
you can learn any language of the world
oh great so the solution would be start
with Java because the two don't have a
choice even if you are changing your
career floor maybe I don't know point to
a web developer you can shape some java
to java with specific - I mean courses
money I'm mostly used in Android now
maybe in future it will also be used for
web development because there are some
people they do prefer 14 as well so I
would suggest you to go for job first
and then you can go for dotnet that will
be a good thing or go for court then
that will be a good thing okay next
question
okay Duke for learning Android do we
need to know I don't want Java no I can
I'm not gonna need that okay we don't
need that and yeah I forgive me I love
my disunity right that that's yeah I you
ready okay great and what's question can
you make okay so we have a question can
you make a career as a phone gap dollop
oh yeah
there is a huge requirement for phone
gap developer because it's in company no
one is making apps in Android studio
entry by using Java because if there is
a start-up and they wants to make an app
for their company so they have to hire
the whole team of iOS developer and
Android developer so and if if if their
budget is low then they will hire only
one group of phone web developer they
will write code once and they will
publish into iOS and Android both so
there is huge demand for phone web
developer in market more than Java
people okay that's a contact that now
that's a controversial point yeah great
next question is that yeah how how does
this ad work okay how does app
monetization works okay that's an
interesting question
yeah so yes so that how more doesn't
work
okay I guess we lost so much what are
you there okay so I guess I love is not
desert by the time you joined I will try
to answer your question up okay my next
works okay so if you're backing a
website we use Adsense for that and for
Android we use AdMob so AdMob is a
platform where you can get ads on your
mobile phone or you need I count on
AdMob and you have to connect your
application with AdMob so there's an API
you have to just connect that and
whenever you need ads in the position
you can you know you can put those ads
there and the moment you put your ads it
will be will come up and and depend upon
impressions you know there's an ad
impression depend upon your depend upon
impressions depend upon the number of
clicks okay and shut up is disconnected
honey I'm getting a call on his okay so
okay I can see we lost we lost short out
there yeah so make sure that so the
clicks will give you that hardening and
it will also give you the clicks will
give you and the ad impression so this
by these two things you will earn money
using apps but again I don't work to on
okay do if you're if you are new to
programming if you're new to I
development don't learn to I mean don't
make application to earn make
applications to learn first
so Shabab is adding because that's what
you say a bi-product off is hard work so
first try to implement stuff try to
learn stuff so that you can it will be
helpful for your future in fact I love
this quote initially you should work to
learn and later remove that L okay so
that's it guys because we lost shut up
here and again will do D some obsessions
more if you have some questions on this
topic just comment in the comment
section I will ask
shut up to answer your questions in fact
I will make a video on that as well
so I'm waiting for Shraddha back again I
don't know what happened he left maybe
because of the network problem or
something there is always some sort of
issues
let me just ask and what happened yeah
so I hope you enjoyed this session with
I don't know how how I mean how helpful
was the session for you let me know in
the comment section
I let me know the chat window as well
okay so I can see that some questions
are coming here
how about developing apps for IOT system
in fact IOT is a future right start
making apps for that time being we don't
have much system which can use your app
but future in future for sure
IOT will talk right so yeah that's how
things can I mean how come you don't
want to become a millenia knowing that
words okay
money is not the main thing for me in
fact see I want to earn I want to earn
that much that I can survive in the
world I can buy good gadgets so that I
can make awesome videos and I'm
investing on these mobile phones I'm
investing in this gadgets in fact
yesterday I bought a new machine because
I want to do consisting I want to export
all those few videos so the thing is I
don't want to earn much the important
thing is I want to give some I want to
give something back to the community I
want to find good professionals in India
I want to I mean the entire world not
just India so I want to teach everyone
that's my main aim so that's why I
learned so I learned more so that I can
teach more so every day I work hard to
learn new things so that I can take so
money money is not the important thing
but maybe if I become a Melania that
will be a good thing that's a good ok so
next question is I mean how do you feel
when you when your student like Shraddha
makes name for himself I mean it's an
awesome feeling you know not just tada
we have I have lots of students who have
they won't start up now and I also want
to help them in their startup but I
don't know how can I help them back then
the thing is there are lots of people
they are working hard they are my
students in some other way other way
in fact I'm not saying that I want to
take their credits but then they are
working very hard and
I always feel good you know I said as a
trainer as as a professional I always
feel good when I see some people working
hard to make that impression and a brief
lot of shut up other guys as well let me
take some names that mess at Paul and
then I have a bitch eight so they are
working really hard to in order to get
their name so great yeah that's it guys
so that is not here again we'll be doing
live sessions so mostly tomorrow also I
will be doing a live session but this
time I will be doing live session only
by myself we talked about different
stuff this was purely on Android in
future in the next session in which is
on Sunday mostly I will talk about your
general stuff so last week I think I
know live session from for which there
are lots of questions are remaining so I
will try to take those questions so
that's it guys thank you so much for
