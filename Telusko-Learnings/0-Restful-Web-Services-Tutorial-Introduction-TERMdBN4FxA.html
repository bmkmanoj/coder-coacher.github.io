different ethical earnings and last week
we have talked about REST API which is
also restful Web Services and it is
booming everywhere so what exactly we
are going to start with I mean what type
of example they are going to start again
will be going for a complex example once
you go ahead but initially we'll be
talking about aliens so if you want to
understand REST API to understand the
overall picture let's talk about REST
API with an example which is one of my
favorite example called as aliens I mean
see we all are aliens right of course
you can treat yourself as human in this
case so we never say alien you can
imagine yourself as human so this alien
it is someone who who belong to this
software world or the virtual world what
you say and everyone in this virtual
world maybe they are way technically in
one of the field
maybe database field or programming
field or maybe testing field or the
hacking field so all these are the
aliens right and every field so let's
say if I'm a programmer if I'm a Java
programmer so I'll be having some points
in that example when I start with Java
as a fresher I'll be having maybe two or
three points the moment I get experience
I get ten points with T points maybe as
experience of six years now I can say
I'm 70 I've got 60 points out of hundred
in Java
maybe you might be having more or less
doesn't matter so we all are aliens so
we have a name we have an ID and we have
points so if you want to create a class
of this this is how your class will look
like right you'll be hung a class a
simple class but it's alien in which
you'll be having three variables I L an
ID then you have a name and a points
right so if I create a object of the
first alien let's say the first alien
name is mommy itself I will say then
idea once in a one or name naveen and
then the points would be like say 60 so
that's my value let's say if you have
one more object so now you have two or
three objects right now if you want to
send this data on the client side you
have to convert this data into XML or
JSON
I can how will you do that that's a
different thing will be will be saying
in the practical session but I want to
send this data in XML format
even before sending this data we have to
accept the request right and to accept
the request first you have to get the
application now question arise how will
you create an application for West a P I
again to the prerequisite for this would
be you have to understand Madden because
using mavin you will be building this
project and luckily I have a I have a
video on that as well on YouTube so
first you have to understand how mavin
works a second we have to create a
jersey project now why Jersey it's
because the rest is just a concept right
and to implement that we need some
implementation you can use Jersey or we
can use spring as we discussed in the
earlier video so you can use one of this
now if you are using Jersey of course
you have to use Jersey life it is you
have to create a project structure which
will be working with Jersey now you
might be thinking ok we have to create
that structure
huh don't worry we have a map in video
right and in the indian oven what you
can do is you can ask mavin hey mavin
can you just give me a jersey project
now he will say okay are you going to
justify chick - so don't have to worry
about the Taji creation it will be taken
care by a mavin now once you got your
project there will be some project
structure there will be some
dependencies which you have to add now
you don't have to add any dependencies
right because Josie will be given by
maven and but then we have to create
some resources right as we have
discussed in rushed API we have to
create a resource a lien is already
source right but then it is simply a
POJO class right I mean what is pojo
it's a plain old java object so this is
a plain old java object what we want is
when you send a request there should be
someone there who will respond who will
send your response now how would you do
that again if you're thinking in servlet
technology in socket we have to use we
have to get a class then we have to
extend our class with the help of a to
be sublet do we have to do that here not
exactly we don't have to do all those
things here in fact I believe that REST
API is much simpler than sliding server
technology and you might be knowing
about serving technology but if you
don't touch ok because anyway learning
rest is easier than learning sublet so
if you know the REST API think there so
using REST API we can send a request and
you will get the response so there
should be someone who will request it
will accept a request and it will send
your response ok now how to do that that
we'll see in the black key limitation so
I hope you are excited for this thing so
