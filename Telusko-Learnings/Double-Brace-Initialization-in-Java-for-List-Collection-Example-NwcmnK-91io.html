about some tricks using collection now
this is not exactly tricks but these are
hidden features most of you don't know
about it
so what's that let me create a list here
so let's define a list with say integers
and we say value is equal to new array
list and will say again integer since of
after Java 1.7 you do not specify the
type of gender expire instantiation but
for this example I need that so we'll go
for it now once you got the list the
only way or the way you can add list
elements is we can say values dot add
and we can specify let's say 56 we can
say values dot add we can specify lit 67
and values start add we can use 90 so
this is one way of instantiating your
adding a value store your list so in
order to print we can use multiple
things we can use a iterator you can use
enhanced for-loop
just to make it simple we'll use and ask
for loop here and we'll say values and
here let me print the values we'll say I
and now if I run this the output is 56 6
7 and 90 but let's say I know the values
so why to use this ad Co if I know the
value so what I can do is I can just
comment this part I think in the in
instantiation itself we can assign the
values so in order to do that we can
simply say it is ad is dot as list and
we can specify those values here 56
comma 67 dot comma 90 so this is one way
of instantiation of your list by adding
values itself so while creating the
object you are assigned the values
because this as list will give you the
object of ArrayList with this values
alright so this out there are multiple
ways of creating a list and adding
values but this is only applicable when
you know the values but what if you
don't know the values so in that
scenario let's go back to our previous
thing which is new add a list let me
just show
the output of this just to make it sure
it's working so let's save let's run
this if I run this out the output is
saved right now from this let's get back
to the new ArrayList and we'll say again
integer now so if you know the values in
the if you know if you want to add
elements while creating the object
itself so you can use a new trick and
that trick is something called as double
braces so this is called as double
braces instantiation now in this what is
how it works is this part here this part
is called as anonymous inner class so if
you don't know what is anonymous inner
class you can check out my previous
video you can search for anonymous in
tournaments in your class in maybe in
interface or I have a different playlist
for that so just search for inner
classes so when when you when you create
an object and if you provide this thing
here this this is called as anonymous
inner class and this part this curly
braces here from this to this this is
called as instantiation initializers so
in this what we can do is we can simply
say add 56 no way to specify the
variable name of course it is values add
67 and we can say add 90 so this is
another way of adding elements and if I
run this now the output is still same so
this this two things here this is double
braces this is these are new things so
this outer bracket here this is your
inner class anonymous inner class and
this inner bracket here this is your
instantiation heat risers so every time
you can hit an object it will call this
instantiation initializer blocks
so this is newly introduced concept in
job I don't know which version but it is
newly introduced and now if you run this
output will be same which is 56 and all
those values clear so this is new trick
in Java so that is from this video so if
you like this video do do thumbs up then
and do subscribe for the further videos
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
