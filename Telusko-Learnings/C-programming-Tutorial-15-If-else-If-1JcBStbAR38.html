okay if else if now to do that for that
let me go with different example let's
say we have three values one is a B and
C so we have three variables and I want
to check so if these three variables
have a specific value so let's say a is
6 B is 3 and C is 4 so I want to check
which is the greatest value here so if a
is the greatest value which is 6 I want
to print 6 if there is the greatest
value I want to print 3 if 4 is the
letters whether I want to print 4 so how
to check so we have to apply a if
condition so how to verify so first we
have to compare a with B and a with C so
we'll check if a is greater than B then
we have to apply a is greater than C
since we have two conditions so we have
to use a logical operator which is
ampersand ampersand if this is the case
of for sure the greatest number is if we
see person D is greater and we'll print
the value of a simple otherwise if that
is not the case I can use else right but
hold on else so what is it B or C so we
again we have to check so in else we
have to again apply f in which we have
to say if B is greater than C if this is
the case we'll say B is greater but hold
on you will say when in this we are
check we are applying two conditions we
are comparing a with B and C and here we
are just comparing B with C why not with
a because if this statement is getting
music executed so for sure if is false
and when you say this is false so a is
smaller than B or C so for sure a is not
the greater greatest one so it's either
B or C so we don't have to check B with
a again so we say print F
and we can say person D is greater and
will print B otherwise if if both this
are false
if if and else both are false we'll go
forth as spot and this will print print
F why it's going
if we say printf and double quotes will
write person D is greater and we'll say
C simple so that's how that's how we
have to compare three numbers and if
either on this code it says 6 is greater
so for that so got the idea so this is
if else if and else so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
