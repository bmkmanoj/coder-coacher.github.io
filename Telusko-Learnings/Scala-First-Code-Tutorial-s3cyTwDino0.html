it is here now what I need is let's
let's write some code and we all are
excited for the first code in Scala
right in fact I am excited to tell you
that so what we'll do is now if you if
you are from Java background you know
how to create a new class and how to
write hello world right and we cannot
live without hello world it doesn't
matter which language you learn maybe C
C++ Java the first code you write is
always hello world but in Scala what
we'll do is I mean will write hello
world don't worry okay will write hello
world but will not write see if we write
I love watching c-- programming what you
have to do we have to type hold on what
we have to type we have to type a hash
include' we have to mention be with me
okay so when you say in C programming
the way you write you write your you
write your code is we have to write hash
include then you have to say STD IO dot
H right and then we have to mention a
main function then with the main
function you can write print F and in
print f you can print hello world just
imagine how many lines of code we
writing here you see that we are writing
hello world how many lines of code we
have we have that now when it comes to
Java what we do we create a class we
could it not be let's name the let's say
the class name is demo without public
static void main right and then we say
string a then what we do next we say
system we say system dot out dot print
and then we say hello would see the only
thing I mean just to playing hello ball
we have to write so many lines of code
right so when it comes to C programming
we have to write five lines of
coordinate comes to Java we have to
write again six lines of code is it six
yeah maybe so six times of code right
now just imagine if I do this in Scala
why to write this stuff this much of
code right because this is a boilerplate
code now what happens is when somebody
says okay let's say I'm going to my
native place next month and then let's
say in my native place I have my
cousin's there let's say they're from
different field and they say hey Naveen
what'd you do I will say okay I'm a
trainer what do you teach I teach Java
so if they ask me can can you can you
explain me one example in Java I will
say okay fine of course I will start
with low worldwide so
- I will tell them okay we first we have
to create a class demo
what is class we'll see we'll see later
then we have to write public static hold
on this - things are busy later then
we'll win then we write void main that
we'll see later why we have to do that
then we have to create a string
arguments that we'll see later why we do
that we'll talk about system dot out dot
println we'll do that later and that's
how you print hello world I mean just
imagine just to print hello world we are
skipping all this thing we are not
talking about all this stuff right so
trust me as a Java programmer as a Java
train especially it I find it very
difficult to guide the first code it's
very easy once you know the first four
it is very easy to learn Java but just
imagine that instance of teaching this
part to a pressure or to the person who
don't know Java
so what Staller says is why to write all
this code when you can do it very easily
so in Scala Scala provides you can to
teach someone Scala don't go for all
this stuff what you can do is you can
create a worksheet now how to get a
worksheet right click on your saucy send
you there is an option of scalar
worksheet now worksheet let name it
anything we'll say this is demo finish
and your worksheet will have this
exchange and SC at the end now this is
your work should looks like again just
ignore this part will not use this as
I'm as I mentioned we will not talk
about any anything now your Scala
provides you something called as our EPL
okay okay again forward the full form of
that let me just check it the full form
of repl repl stands for it is read eval
yes I just read eval print loop so it is
it is something where you just have to
type the line so because it is normally
used for interactive top level languages
example if you type a like if you type a
line it will give you the output
instantly okay so let me talk let me
just go back to my Eclipse now how to
achieve that for that we have to use
again we can do that here there's no
harm in that what we can do is we can
just go to window show view we have an
option of Scala interpreter so if I
click on Scala in Tepito they can see it
is asking you for the project okay I'm
working with first project look on okay
this thing here is a Scala interpreter
okay I will not use the box ship which
is provided let me use the interpreter
now how do we use it to use Scala
interpreter I just have to click on this
area so this area is your typing area
where you will type your code and how to
increase the font size of this let me
just increase the font size a bit you
alright that's very you know this is the
only thing which I hate about Eclipse we
have to just to edit the font size you
have to do lots of stuff okay we got the
same size I don't know how to increase
the font size of this that's weird I
just hope you can see this font here
let's let's I am assuming that you can
see the font so what we do now is let's
create or let's print hello world or
let's create a variable which means at a
world so how do we do that in Scala we
simply say okay let's make this print
hello world we say hello world and once
you go once you have type it just say
control enter can you see that just
write hello world
you got your output here you just have
to type the type distr stuff here and
say control enter it will give you the
output we got our first code of hello
world it is that simple in Scala just
write hello world in double quotes you
will get your thing if you like the
hello world in single quote will it work
let's try you can see it is giving you
other so the only way to write hello
world is by using double quotes and as a
Java programmer we all know how to put
string right that's our first code can
you believe it
we don't calculate any code
which you write in Java I mean all this
thing sorry for those words but you
don't have to write any of this
boilerplate code here right
so that's the awesomeness about about
Scala here and how do we create
variables in Scala now so to create a
variable normally when it comes to Java
world how do we create variables in Java
so okay by no mean okay for specially
for Java people by no mean I'm saying
Java is not good come on I am a Java
developer myself I'm a Java trainer
I love Java the only thing is Scala has
lots of features it's just that I am
showing you the importance of Scala so
that you will get motivated okay by no
mean I'm saying Java is bad okay I love
Java so let me just come back to here
come back to this so how do we create
variable since in Java we say int I
equal to 9 that's how we could a
variable right and that's how we assign
a value now when it when it comes to
this I variable you can see the first
thing you're saying is eight you're not
saying I you see that the first thing
which we are saying is ain't not I that
means data type is more important than
variable name that is in school that is
in Java right in Scala what it says
first you have to mention bad and then
mention the variable name and simply
assign the value you don't have to
specify the type it is okay we do if you
don't specify the type if you Center you
can see it will automatically detect the
type of the variable which is n so you
can see we got nine here we got int okay
you don't have to specify the data type
to work with it but it's a good practice
to specify data type right because Java
is strongly typed language or type safe
language we want Scala to beat strongly
safe I wouldn't say strongly typed
language so what we can do that is let's
say let me get one more variable we say
bad j now how do we specify the time
let's say num how do we specify the type
here will say :
so I have to specify the bad keyword
then you have to specify the variable
name then we have to provide a colon
which will specify we specify the type
of the variable which is Inc and then
we'll say seven now again you might find
it bit difficult to initially but trust
me once you once you write two or three
quotes you will be very comfortable with
this for this syntax because Scala
believes that variable name is more
important than than G datatype Java data
type is more important than variable
name in Scala variable name is more
important than the data right that's why
we write it to type on the right side
and variable name on the left side and
to execute this simply say
Rolle enter you get your output so this
is the statement and that's your output
so we got numb ain't seven now how do
you perform actions here okay let's see
how to perform action so what we can
simply do is now we have two variables
right we have AI and dump so we can say
AI + num so when I say I + num and
control enter you can see it is it is
added both the elements so we got 9 plus
7 which is 16 okay this is this is repl
okay this is you can write statement by
statement we'll give you the output like
an interpreted language okay but later
on we'll see how to create classes
because see somewhere in your mind we
have the concept of classes object
variables we'll come back to that but I
want to show you some advanced thing
that's why I'm showing all this all this
stuff to you that's how you that's how
you create that's how you add two values
okay we can perform multiple operations
here we can also say I into num it will
give you the multiplication of it how to
print control enter record the
multiplication which is 63 what else we
can do here well that's how we can
perform the operation now we can also
create a string variable let's say I
want to create a string variable as my
name so we'll say bad name equal to
Naveen ready okay we can also specify
the type of it so we can say after name
we can specify string and so that's how
you specify the data type will say
control enter so you can see we got a
string which is now a 20 here again if
you can't if you cannot see the font
size here that's okay after this after
this video will type all the all our
code in the worksheet about okay so yeah
that's how you do you assign the you
assign the value to a variable so that's
how you create a variable okay and yeah
that's how that's your second video
where we are I mean second coding video
where we talked about how to how to use
box shape how to create variables or to
perform action in the next video we'll
try to explore some more features in
Scala like constants and all those stuff
so that's it that that's from this video
make sure you like the video if you
liked it let me know if I'm able to
teach you Scala properly and give me
your feedback on this so that's it thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
