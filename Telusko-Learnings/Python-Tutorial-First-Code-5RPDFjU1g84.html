today we are going to start with the
simple hello world program using Python
to do programming using Python we need
Python you can go to google ok and then
simply search for pie thunder now you
can you will get of a link called Python
dot o-- r-- g-- go to that link and from
there just navigate to downloads link in
downloads you can see there are two
downloads options available one is three
point five point one another one is two
point seven point two one one so why
these two options are available
available because there are many
applications which are still running on
two point seven point one one and they
provide support on those versions also
that's why it is there it's not
deprecated yet but if you want to learn
new things then you should go with the
test release that is three point five
point one two down just click down click
the download link and it will be
downloaded at your side and after
download just do some next after two or
three next you will be installed to your
python so to start with python
programming we have two ways go to
search go to start search for python and
you will get Python 3.4 command line so
go to command line this is a command
line here you can write and execute your
Python codes so as discussed we are
going to start with a simple hello world
program
so I will write simple hello world
program using Python so the syntax to
write hello Bertram is print in
parentheses hello that's it no comma no
brackets nothing and that says your
that's your output hello Paul this is
Python this power of Python you can
write and you can execute directly
without compiling and you the thing is
very important in Python is ending
addition that we'll do later on so this
is one way of writing Python programs
using console Python also provide you
something called as IDE idla which is a
GU eyes so if you want that go to Python
search for Python ideally you'll get
this Python self here also you can write
simple programs like pipe print then
hello youtubers
okay go to end say enter we got the
output this this is two way of writing
Python programs now the third way is if
you want to use any editors I suppose
you have notepad installed in your
Microsoft Windows or any machine you are
using if you want to write code here and
you want to execute that on python cell
how do we do simply the say print hello
okay now save it so the important thing
while saving is we have to save it by
with the dot pi py extension that is
very important so i would say by any
name like you can use any name so first
dot t-- you just saying you cannot save
that on this location okay go to desktop
then I will go to desktop and here I
will save that Python dy okay now we
want to execute power Python dot py so
how do we do we have two options first
is console so just close this go to run
type CMD go to desktop and now here here
we have something called as first dot pi
so let's see python space first dot pi
and click then say enter now you got the
output Python dot py what we were
supposed to print hello you
now I will change it I will say hello
world and again I even save this now I
will say Python space first dot p1 him
hello world that's it this is this is
beauty of Python it is very interactive
and very amazing to learn very easy to
learn this is the simple hello world
program using Python also if you want
that if you want to exclude this first
dot Python in your ideally so go here
from in file click on open now go to
desktop first dot py open you know you
got this now if you want to run go to
run run model is fi the shortcut for
that click where fine you got the output
that's it the output will be coming on
this cell only so if you are see this is
myself okay here if I change it to
something
hello Mumbai okay save this okay against
a run and it will print it here okay so
that's all that's all hello Bert program
using Python if you like this video
kinda like subscribe and share thanks
