ready from Dallas for learnings and in
this video we'll talk about packages now
in Java if we talk about in big classes
so they're like approximately lots of
classes so we have approached their
behalf thousands of classes which is in
build right so if we talk about the JRE
in which you have lots of in build
classes we can also use third-party
classes right example if you're working
with JDBC you're working with some that
you are working with all different
frameworks we use external libraries
right so what we do we have different
different classes and we we classify
those classes depend upon their they're
working depend upon their use so we will
put those classes in one particular
folder example all the i/o package or
all the i/o classes which is in
particular classes will be inside auto
package all all the networking classes
like example sockets and all the stuff
it will be inside so like socket server
socket this will be inside dotnet
package which is java.net package and
then let's say you're walking with JDBC
so it will be all the all the classes
will be inside all the classes on
interface will be inside Java to the SQL
package now what that means is we have
all these classes classified in a
particular format and they are putting
into one particular folder and that
folder in Java therefore s packages ok
now why we require this package package
concept why not put all different
classes all the files in one particular
folder you know what we do as humans or
as music listeners so what we do we we
have in your computer if you have a
Windows installation so in will be will
be having D Drive e Drive right so D
Drive we have let's say our C Drive is
OS the D Drive will be multimedia and
inside your D Drive what we'll have we
have songs we have movies we have games
and inside songs if we go to songs there
will be new songs old songs and inside
then we'll be having inside new songs
will be having sad songs will be having
a DJ songs which will be will be having
motivational songs will be holding all
those stuff right inside sad songs will
be having ultimate sad songs will be
having mild sad songs for
in a song it will below the one folder
right so let's say you want to listen to
any extreme sad songs okay any extreme
sad song what you will do you will go to
your D Drive you will go to music you
will go to new songs we will go into
ODEs old those are you sad songs and
inside that you will go to ultimate sad
songs right this is the path you will
follow that means if you want to listen
to all ultimately sad songs you will go
to that particular folder play all so
when you say play all you're talking
about all extremely sad songs let's say
you are very happy now and you want to
listen to any rock music you will go to
adopt folder and then you will say
select all and play now you don't want
while playing rock song you want to
listen to a side so of course not right
so while your mood is rocking you should
listen to rock rock songs and that's why
you should classify all these songs as
per that type right in the same way all
your classes and interfaces in Java they
are classified in particular folder and
that folder is called as package now
personalize if you are creating your own
package what you should name it you need
to make sure that whatever package you
create should be unique throught d'void
example if you talk about the i/o
package in Java this Java dot IO which
is unique throughout the world right no
one no one has a package which is Java
dot IO of course now let's say you want
to create your own package what it
should be so if you if you keep it demo
what will happen is other people will
also have this name demo right how would
you how to make it unit so your package
name should be or it must be the the
middle of your domain name so let's say
if your domain name is google.com so
your package name should be com dot
Google makes sense right because if you
have a domain name which is unique
toward avoid example google.com is
unique right
no one else has a google.com domain
other than Google so if they have a
package which is comped at Google for
sure no one can replicate that package
name now if I talk about my website so
my website name is Paris for comso
package name I am using for my project
is chrome telesco so I made sure that no
one else in the world will be using the
same package now this is very important
when you when talk about Android
projects when you talk about mavin
projects so because we need a unique
package name there so that's how you
have to provide a package name so you
can also put PAC
in a package you can say calm telesco
dot test so you all your test modules
will be inside test package so we'll be
having so your classes will be inside
test and then test package will be
inside telesco and telescope will be
inside calm right now let's say in in
the test so in the telescope package we
have which is calm and then they have
telescope so in the technical package we
have lots of classes let's say we have
five classes and inside test we have
four classes I want all four classes of
test so what we can do is begin say calm
dot telesco dot test dot star so when
you say start it will fetch all the
classes from the disco from the test
folder now you want all the classes from
telesco so you can simply say conduct a
risk or dot star but now you want a
class you want all the classes from test
so can we can we do khan dot the risk or
dot star will it fetch all the test
classes and the answer is no because it
will only fetch the classes not the
folder because that is co or test is the
folder write as a package so it will not
go inside the package it will take
outside or outside files which is inside
the discovered outside test okay so
that's how you should use packages in
your project now since we have done with
the packages let's talk about yeah so in
the next video we'll talk about axis
specifies in fact I have a practical
video on package also so after this we
will be watching those that video and if
you haven't subscribed to my channel do
that so that you can watch other videos
and there is one request if you can
submit so in you can see in the in the
video below the video you have
description area right so you can donate
the description so if you find any video
without description so you what you can
do is you can type out yourself that the
help you can give it to me so type in
description so that I will paste that
description in my on my YouTube video
and I will make sure that I will tag you
there so thank you so much for watching
and do subscribe for the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
