talk about how Java works so let's
imagine you want to make a software
maybe a basic software a calculator so
to work with that calculator first you
have to create a source file ok now
that's so small you have to compile it
create a byte code so just imagine you
have a source file and then you have to
come we have to convert that source file
into a byte code for that we require a
compiler ok so we have a source file
which will be compiled using this
compiler and you will be getting this
bytecode but then question arise what
we'll do with this byte code now to run
a byte code since Java is platform
independent we require a platform where
you can run this software ok or to run
this bytecode and that platform at all
that software is also connects a virtual
machine but that virtual machine which
is here will will only convert or will
only work with bytecode so you have to
take a byte code which is here and then
you have to put that bytecode into the
virtual machine but that will only work
with Java right and that's why that JVM
or that virtual machine is also called
as JVM which is java virtual machine so
once again have you have a source file
here and then you have to cut put that
source file into bytecode using a
compiler so that's here and then you
have to run that byte code into or on
the JVM is Java Virtual Machine and once
you've got that JVM you will get your
object and then you can run your code so
that is a Java works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
