ready and in this video we'll talk about
structures in C to understand structures
let's take an example now let's say I
want to store a data about a laptop now
when you say a laptop maybe you have
multiple laptops we have five laptops
and you want to store data about those
laptops and then what each laptop will
have a detail like laptop ID so let's
say if you have five laptops how will
you differentiate them so we normally
have laptop ids and then we have a
different model right so every laptop
let's say when if you talk about one
brand let's talk about Dell in fact Dell
has multiple laptops right they have
experience it easy I have Inspiron
series so we can take the model number
and then every laptop will have a
different price so if you want to have
five laptops and each laptop will have
this part and if you want to store them
in a variable so we have to create
approximately fifteen variables because
we have five laptops and each laptop has
three variables so we can say int first
or we can say first laptop and we can
say first laptop ID right and then we
can create one more which is second
laptop ID and then likewise we have to
create third laptop ID then the first
laptop model
second laptop model third laptop model
so you have to create fifteen variables
right instead of that what we can do is
we can group those elements together so
when you talk about one laptop one
laptop has three value or three
properties right so we can glue together
and we can keep it at one place so that
you just you to create five different
variables for laptops now when I say
five different variables we can simply
say I want to have a laptop which is
laptop l1 then I have l2 then have
l3 so we can create three laptops like
this we can create four or five laptops
so you don't have to create 15 variables
you're creating only three or four
variables or five variable but then what
is this laptop because your machine
don't know what laptop means in that
scenario you need to create your own
type because we don't have a type of
laptop we have a in type right we can
say int maybe a B C so that's our
variable right we can say float we can
say care so we can say care XYZ that's
our variable but we have not defined
this laptop yet so to define this laptop
we have to say a keyword or struct so we
have to use a struct keyword and stroke
will have a name cause laptop now we are
defining our own type it's laptop
now this laptop will have three things
it will have a name so we'll say int or
it will have an ID first we'll have int
ID the next thing we need here is we
want to have a model number so when you
say a model number it will be a
character array so we'll say model and
adding size will be Ted 20 so we don't
have a model name which which goes
beyond 20 right and then let's say we
have also a prize so we have these three
details of a laptop so we have ID
collect the name and when you say my
name model number and you can you also
have a prize there so we are grouping
together those three please choose
variable together so that when you use
that it will be one big variable so this
l1 normally has those three variables
now once we have this laptop what I will
do is I will ask the data from the user
or you can ask data from the user or you
can assign the values by yourself let me
just ask the value from the user I want
to have two laptops not more than that
in fact I would use a good name for that
table so let's say I have two series one
is XPS series and another one is
Inspiron series
so basically Dell has two series
experience there might be different
series but then my two favorite is this
to one and I want to fetch I want to ask
value from the user I would say first I
would say printf again we can use a loop
here which runs two times and we can ask
whether for each one but I want to say
printf and I would say enter first
laptop details and then we can fetch the
value so we'll ask for the first thing
we'll say printf I would say enter ID
and that ID will be assigned to the XPS
laptop since we have two laptops we
cannot simply say scanf because if I say
scan of I found to assign the value to
the ID of course I will reuse person D
here but then if I simply say ID the
first problem is we don't have this
variable ID in this cope if you can see
inside main we don't have this ID
variable it is that in the laptop
structure the second problem is even if
you can access that which laptop we are
talking about we have two laptops wide
we have xx PS and Inspiron so I can say
ok I have XPS so if you have to use XP s
dot ID that's how you refer that so you
have to say XP s so again if I type XP s
dot ID so we have assigned the ID now
it's time for the model so I was a copy
here and pay
so I will say enter model and I would
say to take a model of course we have to
use percent s and here instead of saying
ID I would say model and then we are
missing one important thing here we have
to use ampersand symbol which I'm
missing so I would say ampersand &amp;amp;
ampersand because when you say scanf we
have to specify the ampersand address
and then we have to say this once more
now this is this time it for it is for
price
luckily the the placeholder remains same
which is percentage D and here I would
say price so we have taken all this
detail but how do we print it so I want
to print the first dab laptop details or
we can we can fetch both and then we
can't win two ones but let's do that one
by one so I would say print F I want to
print it data so I will say first laptop
and here I would say person D in fact I
would say equal to I would say percent
the percent s and percent D again and
let me just give a colon in between so
that we can separate that data in
efficient way now how do we print it we
can simply say I D and then all those
things but we thought it will not work
obviously right we have to say XPS dot
ID we have to mention which laptop we
are talking about so I'm talking about
XPS dot re XPS dot model and XPS dot
price it's that simple
now let me verify if it is walking I
don't know let's try so I would say
build this application or you can use
any compiler you want I'm using a code
blocks here that's how you build the
code but this code is giving me an error
you can see it is not able to find you
the type of laptop oh we forgot to
mention that hey this is this laptop is
my own type so to define your own type
we use a keyword here as well which is
structures so this X this laptop is not
a normal object sites it's a structure
that's what we're doing here let's build
this once again and I guess have not got
any error thanksfully so we will run
this code where is that let's run this
code and you can see it is asking for
the ID I forgot to enter the slash it at
the end let me just do that quickly I
would say slash in everywhere so that
will get the output on the new line
it's a slash n okay let me just build
and run this once again now you can see
it is saying enter ID I would say enter
ID 1 0 1 that's my first
laptop and then the model number is age
9000 that's my model number is asking
for the price I would say 1,500 price of
$15 and the moment I say enter it is
giving you and error that's weird
what's wrong with the code okay if I
debug this application here okay so I
guess we have seen the error so the
error is because of this ampersand I
forgot to mention ampersand here
my bad and recognition on this code once
again after building it so I will run
this code and you can see asking for the
value of XA once you go one I would say
model number a 9000 and the price is
1500 and the moment I say enter you can
see we got recorded data now the again
the advantage of using a structure is
you can group your values or the or the
variables together so when you talk
about laptop it has certain properties
you can group them together so likewise
you can create multiple laptops as you
can see I have second laptop so I would
just copy this code and say enter we'll
say ok I will just paste it here itself
so that we can train both the laptop one
by one so this is printing the first
laptop so I would say this is second
laptop details so and I can say this is
instead of saying XPS this time we'll
say Inspiron so I'm talking about
Inspiron now and this time also I will
say is Inspiron and ok this is also
Inspiron cool and then here I will point
the second laptop I which the second
laptop is this one which is in speed on
in this case I would say honest and I
honest so everything will be replaced by
I and s now it's it sounds cool let's
let's see if it is walking let me just
build the application of here first you
have to close the previous one previous
output letting us run this code once
again so let's insert data now and I
will say this is 1 0 1 again and then
model is a 9000 and the price is let's
say thousand dollars and if for the
second object now we got 1 0 2 the model
number is let's say Q 70 and then I got
deploys as 1500 so we got this two
models here one is XP
second is in speed on and you can see
the output in the output you can see we
got the first laptop here and then we
got the second laptop I forgot to put a
slash in there as usual and you can see
the output here so this is what you
wanted right so every laptop so in fact
we can create two laptops and then every
laptop will have a different data and
that's the benefits of using a structure
so install we use a struct keyword
actually it is a structure concept in C
