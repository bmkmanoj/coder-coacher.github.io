video we have we have drawn our arc here
now what next we want is we just have to
move this arc now now to move this arc
we have to create multiple arcs right so
when you have multiple arcs which are
drawn in a particular interval you will
see a motion to draw a multiple ass what
we'll do is we'll take a for loop and
this one will have a variable I and this
I will start with zero and then it will
go till will say it will go till 50 and
I plus plus and then here now another
when I run out on this code you will see
some some moment unfortunately what you
will get is oh I made a mistake I made a
mistake okay not to move this thing what
we have to do is we have to increase the
starting angle and you have to increase
the ending and ending angle right so
what if I say 0 + I + 90 + I it will do
some it will just move my arc from
starting angle from 0 92 till 50 more
points now in this code okay something
is extra light you can see some 50
pixels or extra but the problem is we
have not we are not able to see the
motion it's because it's damn fast we
it's which is you cannot as I as a human
eye you cannot detect the demotion so
what we do is we have to specify some
delays what we can do is we can specify
our dealer here we'll say a delay of 50
milliseconds and since we are working
with delay function we have to import
one more we have to include one more
header file which is das dot H now if I
run this code
I can see you can see something is
happening that something is moving but
what I want if my Ark is of 90 degrees
it should move the ending part should
also be 90 degree right it should not be
90 plus 50 which is 140 so the starting
was 90 the ending was 140 that means
whenever you draw our arc
we have to clear it we have to clear it
what it means before drawing anything we
just have to clear the previous screen
and for that you have to use a function
called as clear you clear device now
what this clear device will do is it
will clear this screen and you can see
some arc and now you can see your arc is
moving there is some some motion is
there but since we are working on spiral
we don't want this clear device because
in spiral we want the whole arc to be
drawn and the draw the draw should not
be a 50 it should be more than maybe
2000 but the problem is what if I want
to stop it in middle for that what I
will say is I will check for one more
condition either the maximum I should go
till thousand-odd until when I hit a
keyboard so once I hit a key but you
have to come out and that's why I have
to say not keep it KB heat which means
Kb heat is keyboard hit so if I say not
it will run until I hit a keyboard okay
now if I down this code now you can see
and just let me just reduce this delay
so that you can see animation in very
fast way and more ten thousand four than
this code now you can see this paddle is
going you can see the spiral is going
but I hope it has drawn this circle what
we wanted is we wanted to go for the
spiral that means after every draw of
our I need to increase the radius what
do you if I say you have to let's go
forward edges as 50 all what we can say
is with what if we can move
make my radius variable I that means
after every draw that it is with
increase now for than this code oh it's
real it's weird now you can see
something we have we have an arc which
is drawn very big it's because the
radius size is damn big what we have to
reduce it what we can say is what if I
say divided by 10 if I say they just
divided by 10 it will draw some small
radius okay still going good still going
good we are getting an arc which is
divided by 10 I still yeah so you can
see we have a spiral here now what if
you want to get some colors if you if
you want to implement some colors here
what you do is you have to add some
color styles you have to set the color
and for that that will put that part
we'll do in my next video thank you so
much for watching this video do
