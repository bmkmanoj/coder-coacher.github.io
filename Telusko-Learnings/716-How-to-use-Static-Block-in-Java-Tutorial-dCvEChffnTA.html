about static block so I will start with
a question here now what if I want to
print something you so I have a main
method and I want to print let's say
hello world so the only way to print
hello world in a java application or a
standalone machine is you have to use
main function so you have to write
something there if when you feel like
reading a new class in that class if you
have a method which prints something you
need to call that method using static
using your main function right so let's
say you have a class here in that class
or method called a show in this show if
I am writing something like print to
print something that says out and this
if I print something let's say hi so
even if you call this thing even if you
want to print hi here you need to call
this show for that you need to create
object of class but let's say I want to
I don't want to go for that let me print
something directly here so I will say
sout we'll say in mean so in order to
we'll say simply hello world so this
might be a question you want to put in
hello world so in order to print hello
world what we need to be the main
function right our main method here so I
fell on this code now so you can see the
output is Hello void now what if my
condition is I don't want to write
anything in this main method so I don't
want to write something here but still I
want to print hello world so you will
Sergei create a class get a method but
still going to create the object here
right I don't want to write anything
literally anything in the main method
but still the output should be hello
world so in that scenario you can use
something called a static block now in a
static block it's a block which is
executed when when your class is loaded
into a JVM that means before you want
creating this calling this main method
it will call static block and if you
write anything in static block let's say
hello world
if we write anything here it will
execute this static first that means it
will execute all the statement then only
it will move towards your main method
just to run a lot just to demonstrate
let me run this and you can see the
output is hello world so we are not
writing anything in this main method
writing everything in this static so
this block here is called a static block
and when you write something here it
will execute first so if you have idea
about static variable static class and
static methods you might be knowing this
thing these static things with you
static variable static class and static
methods they don't belongs to any it
belongs to object they are common to all
the objects because they are static if
you have non static members like non
static variables non static methods or
non static class they are accessible
using instance but here this static
block this is bit different because this
will get loaded out this will get called
as soon as your class is loaded into JVM
then you will say ok we are getting this
hello world here what if I print
something in main method if I say in
main and will say hello world in static
okay so I feel define this so what will
the first output as we know the first
method which is executed by your JVM is
main right so it should print first in
main but static block gets called when
the class is loaded that means it will
call before this main method so if I run
this the output should be hello world in
static and in mean so static method
static block always get executed first
and then main method it's a sequence
matter what if I create one more static
is it possible to get one more static
method or static block yes it's possible
so we can create one more static here
and this time we'll say by in static -
so this is study one so we have two
blocks I think one Sorek two and then
main method so technically as per my as
per the concept here it should first
call all the static blocks in sequence
and then it should go for main okay so
let's run this so of course it is
spending hello world in static one it's
by in static two and then in mean so
that means is respective of your so if
you have multiple static it will always
go in sequence okay so it will print
first this static and then this static
and then we
go for main because static blocks always
get called when the class is loaded now
what is the actual use of static see
this is not the actual user ID we don't
want to print anything before main
method so the actual use here is let's
say if you have a variable which is a
static variable here so let's say if I
say static if I say static here and let
me create a variable as static string s
and the initial value for this static is
blank so you don't have any value here
okay so we have static string s and the
value is blank and in main I want to
print so we'll say the value for s so
we'll say a colon here just to
demonstrate space I will say plus the
value of plus this s so if you print
this s now so of course the output you
will be getting is blanks the value for
s is blank right so in order to assign
the value to s we can use static block C
you cannot you you can you cannot use
constructors because constructor only
works on instance variables and this is
static variables so in order to
initialize your static variables we need
to use static block so we'll say this is
hello world okay so now the output will
be the value for s is : hello world it's
because it will execute the static block
first and then it will spring so the
value for s is hello world so this is
how way to use a static block so a point
to remember static block always gets
called when the class is loaded into JVM
before main method so does form static
block so if you like this video do like
