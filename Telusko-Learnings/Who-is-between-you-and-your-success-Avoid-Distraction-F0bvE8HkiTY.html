from those color things and in this
video we'll talk about what is that one
thing which comes between you and your
success and the answer is distraction so
we are so easily distracted by the
things around you example when you are
watching this video there might be some
sound coming from your backside and you
are getting you're getting distracted
you are watching this video and maybe
you will get a message just you the
message will pop up on your mobile phone
and you will get distracted right so
whenever you want to achieve success you
do lots of work for that white maybe you
are learning something you are working
on the project you are working on the
assignments and you are doing something
very important which is very important
which is very necessary for your success
but then what happens if you are working
on something and you get a call what you
do you pick up the call right we if you
get a message what you will do you will
reply to a message if you get an email
what you do you reply to the email now
what's wrong with that the thing is when
you are working on something you know it
takes some time to reach to that level
you know a continuity with your project
so let's say if you so just now you feel
added to the project you will start the
project and suddenly I mean time by time
your focus will be increased your you
will reach that focus on the project and
it is going on it is going on suddenly
when you get a call what happens that
focus come down because you are
distracted now and again you have to go
back on the same level it will take some
time and trust me you're wasting lots of
time with that and what about Facebook
if you if you if you get a message on
Facebook you will go to Facebook and you
will not just reply to that message you
will also see other people post because
that is really addiction that addictive
right because you know why Facebook is
so famous is because it doesn't matter
what is happening in your life what
matters is what is happening in other
people life and we humans are like that
right we want to know what is happening
in other people life right so don't get
distracted try to avoid the distraction
now question arises how will you avoid
it it's very easy just keep your phone
aside okay
keep your phone somewhere that you will
not get any message any call and even if
you are getting those calls or messages
it you will not see that but then you
will feel that your loved ones they will
feel bad about this because you are not
picking up their phone what
if you can just inform then you feel
you're working on something very
important you are learning something
very something very important book for
next two hours
don't disturb and then we'll at this
time trust me if they love you they will
they will understand about this but then
let's say if you are working for eight
hours now you cannot keep your phone
aside for eight hours right why don't
you take a break you know after every
two hours take a break and then you can
call anyone what you I mean if you can
call anyone you can you can check your
facebook messages right all the best one
is let's think about this keep your
mobile phone just next to you and don't
get distracted is it possible and the
answer is yes the thing is let's say I
don't know how many of you watch cricket
but let's say if you watch if you're
watching a cricket and that's a World
Cup a final match okay maybe football
match or cricket match or any other
tournament maybe a cuppa tea match if
you're watching that and that's a finale
and your favorite team is almost on the
winning edge right or maybe they are
they're playing that game and then if
you get a call what you will do will you
when you pick up the call or with you
will you watch the entire entire match
of course right you will watch the
entire match because that is very
important so that means your focus is
fully towards that thing not to your
phone but while you are working your
focus is partially I mean divided into
two parts your phone and that work so
what if you can just increase your focus
because if you want to achieve something
you have to increase your focus right
have that thing in your mind that I want
to do this example let's say if you want
to learn head you just keep this make
your mind that you want to learn Hadoop
and everywhere just apply that poster I
am a Hydra developer I am a developer
even if you are not a Hadoop developer
just I mean make a stream make a note
and stick it somewhere that I want on a
Mahadev developer it will make your Amit
will it will it will stick to your mind
in such a way that if you are getting
distracted if you're getting a call and
just see just see that per sticker there
you will not pick up that phone okay so
stay focused that's how you can achieve
something in life because success is not
easy it needs lots of effort to get
there so that's it all the best for your
future and thanks so much for watching
