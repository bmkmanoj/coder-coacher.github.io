imagine you have five variables okay so
let's say oh by what five let's go over
forwardable so let's say we have four
variables we have a comma B comma C
comma D so we are going for four
variables here and in each video you
envy each variable you will be having
some values so let's say in a you have
one and B you have two in C we have
three and indeed we have four so we have
four variables and four values so
imagine this each variable as a cup or a
cup of tea so this is your cup and this
is your T so this is a cob this is our
tea so every cup will have its own T so
this that's a cup of tea now so instead
of having four cups and to ensure of
carrying those four cups in your
forefinger we can use a single tray
right or you can carry your what you say
you can carry a single tray in which
will be having four values or four cups
so how to create a single tray so we can
simply specify int and will say this we
have something else Z so that is a
variable so in a you can have one
variable in B you can have one one value
in C you can have one value but instead
if you if you specify only Z it will
only have one value but if you give a
square bracket now this Z can have
multiple values okay with how many
values so let's say if I if I want to
assign four values in this Z so we can
specify for here if you want ten values
you can specify ten here if you want
only two values you can specify two here
so this Z is an array because it has
multiple values so what is array array
is collection of elements okay so this
one two three four these are elements so
it is collection of elements but hold on
oh can we have different types of values
in an array the answer is no because we
have we have to specify some data type a
right we've is mentioning end so this
array will have all int variables or int
values so you have to specify it's a
collection of similar type of element
okay so what is added is a collection of
similar type of elements so we need an
array of four elements so we'll set Z of
0 4 so this Z variable will have or this
set a table have four elements now to
specify these values there so I want to
assign one two three four in Z so to
specify we have to say is Z equal to one
but hold on that is not a variable it's
a array right is an array variable so I
have to specify the location where you
want to assign the values so imagine we
have Z so this is there now so this Z
will have four values so what one two
three four so in to assign these values
there so each location so this is one
position this is second position this is
third position this is fourth position
but in a day the position number starts
with zero so this is zero position this
is one position this is true this is
three so any way you want to access this
second value you have to mention it as
one when you want to walk with the
fourth value we have to say it is three
so it starts with zero so it will be one
less all right
so I want to assign one to the first
position which means I have to assign it
to zero location 0 then we have 0 1
which is to 0 of 2 which is 3 and Z of 3
which is equal to 4 now once you assign
the values you will be getting a Z array
with four values now sit composite to
assign this values we can have any
values we can say 24 we can say 72 we
can say maybe 1.4 we can assign any
value here which whichever int form in
value you want okay but just for the
example you are going for one two three
four just to demonstrate in a proper way
so I am going for these four values
since we have an adding I don't require
these variables okay but sure that will
will make will make it as a comment now
what next
so instead of having four values we are
going for one added to have those four
values now what we'll do is we'll try to
print this values so to print this
values we can simply say
f person D since they are int values we
have to say person D comma Z will it
work if I assign us Z value there let's
try if I done this
oh it says and it says there's an error
it's it is printing something very weird
some real value so what we'll do is we
don't know we don't have to print the
complete array once at one time we can
print one value so we just specify way
to print the first value of an array by
specifying Z of 0 and if I done this you
will be getting value which is 1 again I
want to print on new line okay let's run
this so waiting a value which is 1 I
want to print the second value so I will
say 1 0 point I will be I will be 18
second value which is to devise a set of
3 I will be getting the third value
which is 4 I sorry 0 of 3 is fourth
value right so I'll be getting 4 so
that's how you have to print the values
but hold on I want to print all the
values right so how to print all the
values so this is one way we can specify
number of person D here person D and % D
and for this we have to specify Z of 0
comma 0 F 1 that's one way will not go
for this type of things what we'll do is
we'll say Z of 0 again we'll use only
one person D since we want to print on
multiple lines so if we can just copy
this line and we can just copy this line
paste it make it set of one paste set of
two days out of three so we have will be
having 4 printf statements so whenever
you have repetitive statements we can
use loop as we know now in this loop
what we'll do is we'll specify as we'll
specify the variable which will count
the values of the loop which is I so
from which point wait to start so if can
I say I equal to 1 a problem is your
array starts with 0 so you're going to
specify one year you should specify 0
now where to where to end is it for no
it's three right because we are starting
with 0 so we have to end 1 less than 4
which is 3 and then we have
say I plus plus when to give curly
brackets and then instead of specifying
the top zero which says at off one right
because every time you are zero which
your I valuable increment and it will
change the value of zero there are so
from zero zero two zero three and we run
this you will be getting all those four
values one two three four simple so
that's all we can use and a day which is
integer type of added in C so what is
added is a collection of collection of
elements so thanks for watching and do
