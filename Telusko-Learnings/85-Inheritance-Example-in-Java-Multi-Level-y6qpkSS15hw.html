single level inheritance and this we'll
talk about the next one which is
multi-level not exactly multi-level is
let's say we have a class one more class
in which I need three features we'll say
add sub and mul with for multiplication
so this class should have three features
addition subtraction multiplication so
we can simply say extra it exchange and
since I need all the features so what I
can do is I can say add sub mul extends
it is add sub now so we have already
using the feature of add sub in which I
have two features or two methods public
and sub here we can define the third one
which is public void multi which is for
multiplication and here the result
should be result equal to num 1 into
them to clear so if you have a class
which extends a class which is already a
sub class so this type of inheritance we
call it as multi-level inheritance
simple so we have this single
inheritance and then we have this
multi-level because add sub mul extends
add sub and add sub exchange add now
here this add class is called as this is
called as parent class it is also called
as superclass and there is also called
as base class now this add sub here with
respect to add will be called as child
class wave so if you say this is parent
it becomes child if you say this is
super this becomes sub and if you say
this is base this will become derived
okay so with respect to add this add sub
is a charge nurse or you can say a
subclass or you can say a derived class
but what about add sub bulk add sub mul
with respect to add sub will be again
our child class or a sub class or divide
derived class and adds up with respect
to
add sub Mull will be a parentless closet
via creating the hierarchy of
grandfather father and child so this is
multi-level okay but let's say then we
have one more thing called as multiple
now what is multiple it is so let's say
we have a class and this class is for a
scalp buy in this count I need all the
features so we want features from ad so
what we can do is we can say extends add
a comma and let's say we have another
class called as division but aren't far
let's get a class for the division to
just show the demonstration and just
imagine this Divas division class has a
methodology Dave but still you can see
there's an arrow it says you cannot have
you cannot extends to class now why we
cannot do that so we have another video
on that why we cannot have multiple
inheritances Java but you can say
practically we are getting an error so
in Java we cannot use multiple
inheritance all you can say Java doesn't
support multiple inheritance directly
but you can do it with the help of
interface again you can jump to my
interface video to see the demonstration
clear so we cannot go for multiple so we
can use single or we can use multi level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
