talk about for each method in Java 8 so
again we are seeing all the new features
in Java 8 so we have done with the
default method in interface so in this
video we'll see how to use for each
method now why we even require for this
method for that let's discuss one thing
so let's say we have a list of values
here and then we have 5 values which is
4 5 6 7 8 and I want to print all this
values so there are multiple ways to
print this values right we can fetch we
can we can fetch each element at a time
using values get and we can provide the
index number so we can specify index
number at 0 you will get 4 index number
1 we get 5 so depend upon index number
you will get the values right the other
ways you can use for loops so we can use
normal for loop we can say I equal to 0
I less than equal to the size of delay
so we can say less than a values dot
size and then I plus plus and then we
can print in this way we can simply say
values dot get and we can past I right
and if I learn this code let me on this
code now so you can see we got the we
got the output as 4 5 6 7 8 right so
that's one way the other ways let me
just comment this part so the other ways
in Java one point in the in the previous
versions of Java we had one more way
which is called as enhanced for loop
using which you just need to mention the
variable name and you have to mention
the added least name which is value 0 so
this I will fetch values from the values
of course and then it will print so it
will print in this way if I just print I
and if I run this code you'll be getting
the same output right that is that is
enhanced for loop which was there in
Java earlier but in Java 1.8 we have
something called as for each method so
why will you quite a for these methods
because when you talk about the fetching
the value from the at least we do it
with loops right we use this two types
of loops basically now
type of loops are called as external
external loops it's because this loop is
outside the collection and then from
outside we are fetching the value right
so it's something like you have you have
a box of values and then you're putting
your hand inside the box and then you
are fetching the values that's how
that's why it is called as external for
loops or external loops in Java 1.8 we
have something called as internal loops
so we enjoy 1.8 we have internal loops
so this is on the in Java H so how it
works we can simply say we have values
dot for each we can specify the value I
and then we can say sis out I hope it
works
I guess it's out and then we can pass I
okay and if I run this code you can see
we got the same output again how it
works that doesn't matter okay time
being it doesn't matter how it works the
the thing is you are getting the output
right so somewhere you are getting you
are fetching all the values from the
values collection and then you are
trying to print it right now the
advantage of using forage since this is
the internal part of collection so for
the each is the internal part of
collection so it will be much faster
than the external for loops so let's say
if you are working on huge amount of
data if you are working with huge amount
of huge collection of data to process
all those data or to fetch all those
data instead of working with external
for loops we can work with internal for
loop which is for each loop or for each
method here sounds good right now this
thing again is new feature in Java which
is lambda expression so how this part
works that we'll discuss in the next
video time bin just remember we have
something but as for each method which
is which is used for internal iterations
and this part here which is the internal
part of forage that we'll discuss in the
next video so stay tuned and do
