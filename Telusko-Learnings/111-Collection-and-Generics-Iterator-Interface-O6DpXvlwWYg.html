so once we have seen the theory of
collection let's talk about the
implementation of it
what is collection so collection is
basically collection of elements right
so it can be of it it can be a
collection of objects which is of type
integer it can be of type float it can
be of type your you own type like
student so let's try to create a
collection here so basically my talk
about collection we have three
collections wide we have in fact we have
seen that in theory we have collection
as an interface we have collections as a
class and then we have a collection
which is with small say as a concept so
we start with the interface here so in
order to create a collection we have to
use an interface which is collection
right so it is collection I will say
this is values equal to we are getting
at here it because we have to input the
package which is Java dot util so if you
can see so collection is the interface
belongs to each Java dot util package
now the question arise how to mean how
do you create object of interface
because the collection itself the
interface right so if I go to collection
here it's an interface how do we create
the object of it so we have to search
for the classes which implements
collection now as you know that
collection is an API so when you see
when you say it's an API that means it
has certain classes and interfaces
inbuilt so just we just have to use it I
mean we don't have to pay double own
collection if we just have to use those
collection classes so the class which
implements collection is added East so
in order to use that we have to say
array list so address is the class which
implements collection and you can create
the reference of collect you can create
a reference of interface and you can
create the object of a class here now it
gives you an error again you have to
import the package what I will do is I
will simply say ctrl shift o which will
input all the pack all the classes which
we need so once we got the collection
object here now how do we add values
adding value is very simple here we just
have to say value start and and in this
you can add any value you want let's say
I want to add 4 and then we can say
values dot add or not at all but add and
we can say this is 6 then we can say
values dot add
yeah we'll send nine so I'm adding three
values here right now how do you print
all these values I can be have multiple
ways to do that we'll go for the
simplest way if you want to print all
the values we can simply say system dot
out dot println and we can say values so
what it will do is it will print all the
values which we need so find this code
job application and you can see we got
four six and nine so we are adding the
values into the collection by using a
add method which is there inside a
collection interface and we can simply
print all the values so if you take a
closer look at the collection interface
so if I go inside this interface and it
itself extends it tribal so if I go to
the collection interface it has certain
method like size and basically it was
introduced in 1.2 so before 1.2 you know
not having collection before that if you
go to vector so vector was introduced in
1.0 so vector was there before
collection for people who are first who
started programming I mean who started
Java before 1.2 were working with
vectors so if you talk about connection
here's the connection has a method
called size if you wish to touch the
size of the collection then we have we
can we have contains method which which
verifies a weekly checks the given
element is then inside a collection or
not it returns a boolean value true or
false I will talk about your trait a bit
later then we have yeah so we can also
convert a collection into array
important methods is we have had and
important to notice is add returns a
boolean value which means if you're
adding an element if that element is not
getting added it returns a false value
then we have the move we can also use
the move method and we can add all we
can remove all ok those are the methods
we have in collection here so if you
have those methods we we are printing
all the values but it's I don't want to
print all the values it is printing all
the values right all I want to print all
the values but not in one line I want to
point 4 6 9 in different lines the
problem is you are printing all the
values here right that's why it is
printing in a one line if you want to
print individual values how to do that
in a day what we do is in array we use
index numbers so we can specify I want
the first element so I will specify 0
which will give me 4
if I specify index number as one it will
give me six if I specify index number
two it will give me nine right so adding
works with index numbers what about
collection
now unfortunately collection doesn't
work with index numbers example if I say
values dog cage we don't have a with us
get we don't have any method in
connection which takes our index number
because collection doesn't support index
number I mean when I say collation
talking about the this interface so this
interface collection doesn't support
index numbers that means we cannot fetch
values with index numbers there was a
different way the another way of
fetching the values is since we don't
have index the minds connection so if
you don't have the index number in
connection what we can do is this is a
special there's a special interface
kalus iterator so if I go to iterator
you can see it's an interface which is
responsible to fetch the value from the
collection so you can say and it rato
iterate over a collection that means you
can fetch one one value from the
collection using iterator because it
created has certain methods like hasnext
which will verify do we have the next
element it has the mythical as next
which will actually fetch the value for
you so if I go to the iterator now and
let me name it as it and then we can say
values dot so how do you fetch so we
have to fetch all the values from the
collection into iterator so that we can
we can print all the values so we can
say values dot iterate iterator so it's
a method which will return the object of
iterator and I know that's weird we have
the same method name so method name is
iterator and the interface name is also
iterator the difference differences the
method name starts with small I because
that's a naming convention for methods
right and this is capital I because I
interface now once we got all the
elements when I say all the elements I'm
talking about four six and nine so these
three elements are there in iterator now
now week what we can do is we can print
the values how do we print the values we
can simply say I can say system dot out
dot println I can say IT dot next now
every time you say I need out next it
will print the next element so if I say
run you can say we got four because we
are doing it is only for once if I copy
this if I paste it once again if I say
IT dot next run this code you can see it
says four
six if I do this one more time if I sit
on this code it says four six and nine
because every time you send next it will
fetch the next value for you the problem
starts when you when you do it one more
time when you say I t dot next fourth
time if we run this code you can see it
gives you some bad words it says no such
element exception because you don't have
any element after that so that's a big
problem right how do we know how many
elements we have for that what we can do
is we can run a while loop and you
should have instead of printing it three
times we'll print only once because we
are doing that inside of a loop and in
this while loop we'll we'll do this till
we have we have the element and how do
you verify do we have element we have
has next so I T dot has next to the
method which we use to check do we have
the next element there okay and if we
run this code you can say we got four
six and nine so that's how you fetch the
values from the iterator and you print
it so conditions are interface here you
can create the object using at least you
can add the values using add method and
then you can use iterator to create
between the elements I know that that
doesn't looks good right because you are
coming from arrays where we can use and
as for though where we can use index
numbers it doesn't it's not a dead in
collection right so hold your breath in
the next video we'll see how do we use
how do we use index number with the
connection framework okay not with the
collation interface but we have
something else we can do that we will
see in the next video how to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
