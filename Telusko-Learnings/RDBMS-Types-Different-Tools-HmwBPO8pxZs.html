20 from those two lodgings and today
we'll talk about relational databases
okay which is our DBMS so there are
different DBMS available right in fact
different tools are available so I'm
getting lots of questions on Facebook
and YouTube which DBMS to work with you
know we have different deployments
available right so specially if you had
a college student elf you if you are
working on a software we get confused
which one to choose in fact when I was
in college when I was making my first
project I was confused which which DBMS
to work with right so this video will
help you I mean it will try to help you
to select which DBMS to work with since
this is jann and normally you have to
submit your project by April of me so
you might be thinking about DBMS so
let's start with it so that different if
it was available right so as you can see
in the list here we have all this DBMS
available so we have mass qlv have
Postgres we have SQL server we have
Oracle and the list goes on we also have
db2 then question arise out of this list
which one to choose okay now there are
multiple parameters to choose which DBMS
you want to work with okay so before
starting with those parameters let's
talk about some of the DBMS which which
are available or which are famous in
fact so so there are lots of DBMS right
so if you go to Wikipedia there's a huge
list of DBMS available I have choose
this this numbers because these are
quite famous right they start the first
one which is which is ms SQL okay so we
have MS SQL server which is from
Microsoft so if you so yeah so ms SQL
server is provided by Microsoft so
normally whenever you work with dotnet
technologies of course the first choice
we have is ms SQL server right the next
one is ms axis so let's say if you are
making a small applications of course
you should go for ms axis the next one
is my ask you all right which is by
Oracle so in fact my ask you was created
by other company then Sun Microsystems
bought that company and now Oracle
bought Sun so MySQL belongs to Sun right
the next one is Oracle itself so rattle
is one of the biggest biggest DBMS
well the next one is Postgres right
which is B OST dat of people have not
heard about it because it is there so we
have we do have posters there we also
have DB - so DB - belongs to IBM so if
you are if you are walking on mainframe
servers if you are working with IBM
servers you need to use db2 in that okay
so these are the DBMS available right
let's go for which one to choose let's
talk about the first parameter the first
parameter which we are talking about
here is let's say you want to build a
simple web application or small web
application okay
now when you say small what it means
let's say you want to build your own
e-commerce website not the biggest
e-commerce website this small e-commerce
website or you want to build a app using
which you can you know you can interact
with people you can chat you can create
a social website so if you are building
this type of projects are the best thing
is go for MySQL because when you say you
are building a web application or they
defer the de facto standard all the
language we'll be using is PHP right I
am NOT there lots of developers they
organ then also people specially
students they follow PHP or they use PHP
easy to learn easy to implement is it -
host right
so if you are working with PHP of course
you will be using MySQL reason PHP works
on some servers like we have samsara and
exam server this MySQL in build which is
your so it is X a and that M is my skill
right so if you're using PHP of course
of course you will be going going for
MySQL in fact if you are working with
Java you will be going with my ask ul
because both this technologies belongs
to same company which is Oracle right in
fact I use masculine on my projects okay
that's the first thing next thing let's
say if you are building a dotnet
application some Microsoft based
application you have to choice on it's
like we have three choice either you can
go with ms SQL server you can go with ms
axis you can go with oracle so if you
want to build a small application which
has limited features which you need of
course you will go for ms axis if you
want more features like if you want to
interact
you feel warned transactions and if you
want a security you will go for ms SQL
Server or if you want to store huge
amount of data when I say huge I'm
talking about zettabytes of course no
one no one does that right so let's say
if you want to do if you want to make an
application where you want to store
zettabyte of information you will go for
ms SQL Oracle for that matter ms SQL
Server or directly the next one is let's
say if you are making a open source
project and you want open source
database again you can go with MySQL you
cannot go with Oracle you cannot go with
SQL Server because those are not open
source but let's say if you want to go
for open source one of the best tool
available is Postgres
okay so postman's is something with
using which you can it also supports
object oriented databases which is Ord
BMS if you want to use it so you can
also use posters for that which is open
source the next one is db2 saga fit of
course if you are working with IBM
databases on IBM OS which is os/2 you
will be using db2 okay now there are
some there are some features which is
not dead in my ask you which is there in
Oracle example you know Michael we have
bad cat - in Maskull we don't have that
we just have bad cat in Oracle we use
check constraint in Maskull we don't
have that then okay what else so let's
say if you if you want to make a
distributed DBMS of course you will go
with DBMS which supports this
distributed things so it is not just you
know choosing a database is like I I
want this because I like that name ms
SQL so I will use that know exactly
that's not that's not how you choose
DBMS you have to check all this
constrain or all these parameters to
choose whether if you if you say you
want to work with clusters if you want
to work with cloud servers you have to
choose a database with that thing okay
so I hope I have classified some of this
