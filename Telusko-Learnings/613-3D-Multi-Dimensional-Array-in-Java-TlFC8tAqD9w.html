what is 3d a day so we have already done
with one dimensional array two
dimensional array and this is third
dimension now so if we talk about this
added so let's say we have int a which
is an added here so if I say five so
this this added here this is one
dimensional added because we are
focusing only on the number of columns
or number of values now if I say B with
two brackets this will be two
dimensional array because you are
focusing in two dimensions so let's say
if I say four and four so in total this
will have 16 values right so which is
fall into four now if we talk about
three dimensional so we have to use C
bracket bracket I mean you have to use
three back edge just to represent this
is our three dimensional array and then
we can specify size which is 4 4 &amp;amp; 4 so
in total it will be 4 into 4 into 4
which is I guess 64 is it so it's yeah
so it's 64 so you can have 64 elements 0
so that's three dimensional adding so
how to set the values so we can say C of
0 on 0 of 0 so we can specify value
which is 7 so the the first element of
your three dimensional they will have a
value which is 7 cool right so how to
assign the number of values so since we
have three dimensional array we have to
use three loops so if you remember when
we started with one dimensional array we
have to use one loop when you use two
dimensional array we have to use nested
loop so you'll be having 4 inside of 4
for this we have to use a nested for
loop in total we have these 3 4 3 loops
here so let's say for the first loop
will be 4 maybe this will be so let's
assign some value so let's say it's I
it's I equal to 0 and then I less then
or I less than 4 and then I plus plus so
that's this this for loop we'll talk
about this back it here we require one
more for them for the second bracket so
we
to say int J equal to zero and J less
than four and then J plus plus so this J
will responsible for this number
discounting I'm in the middle square
counting and then we require one more
low which will be K which will be 0 and
then K less then for which K plus plus
and then we can assign the value so we
can say C of I comma J comma K and we'll
say this is equal to I plus J plus skin
it doesn't matter what was the value so
whatever the value is just we are
printing some values here so once you
assign the value so this array will be
full of values now let's print this now
how to prints up for printing also we
have to use those three loops so what we
can simply do is we can just reuse the
code and paste it here so instead of
assigning the value let's print the
value so as a CS out will not will use a
space plus the value of C of I J and K
simple and now if I run this you will be
getting all the values in the laced
format so you can see these are your
values in total this will be 64 values
from here qu to the end cool right so
that's how you assign the value to
three-dimensional array and that's how
it prints so if you want to imagine how
it looks just imagine a Rubik's Cube
okay that's Rubik cube with your
three-dimensional array now so can I use
enhanced for-loop here let's try so each
of this if I try to use enhanced
for-loop so this will be so it will be
something with paint the value the
variable M will be I in C but when I
talk about C so C is three-dimensional
so we cannot use one element here we
have to use two dimensions because in
one time you will get two dimension
here we have to say it is inch J from I
but J will not be one-dimensional sorry
when J will not be a value it will be
one-dimensional array
and here it will be int K in jae seok a
will be value which will fetch value
from J which is one dimensional array
and show up in ting C let's just print
value of K so this will give you the
same output which we have got in the
earlier example or earlier loop simple
so that's how we have to use enhanced
for loop with this 3d added so that's it
from this video so we'll in the next
video we'll talk about we'll talk about
Jagd arrays in 3d so thanks for watching
