the use because you'll be getting
questions from this server and it will
be getting a page where you can actually
see all the questions right so in fact
we'll be talking a little big thing only
five portions so when you when you say
hey I want to give a test it will give
you five questions and then again as a
beaver you will or you will answer those
five questions right and at the end when
you submit those questions we'll be
going to this cell wall for the
verification
now what I do now is let's let's run
this code once again let's see if it is
working or not
I was simply click on write like one as
one server I will be have a tomcat
server installed so it will run locally
and run finish it will take some time to
run of course we want to give stage
twice and that's why we have created
this thing which is called as test dot
HTM so when I request what $10 tiem or
what I will get is okay I'm requesting
potential asymmetries taking some time
and in fact I should be I should be
using this on a browser right because
experts in builds all is not that good
so other use external browser obviously
for Safari here because I'm already
using Chrome for something else
oh that's great and then will request
request for test dot HTM so this is what
we have done last time so as you can see
we are getting a question and then we
are also getting options now which are
the four basic features of folks I know
the answer this is polymorphism oh this
is okay any answer will do let's go for
next Java is designed by James Gosling
next how many types of Adel oh sweet
observables compile time logical error
and run time I draw it go for next I
don't know what's the answer pop EBP
this is just demo questions right and
java application runs on JVM when you
click on n text so what should happen
when you click on any test it should
fall a page which is result dot result
or JSP again we have not returned now
how do you process these questions as
you can see when you send a request
look at the address bar we have created
this address bar something like this so
when you send a request to the server
you have to send Co 91 so for push re 1
the answer walls I mean the answer you
have given is 3 for canary - the answer
you have give 1 is 1 4 I'm Dakota for
the next question you have given some
answer so everything is there in the
address bar ok so if I want to show you
this address so let me just copy this
code let me go back to STS which I just
use it's here and in this STS what I
will do is I will just comment this
section and let's put it here so this is
the request you are sending the
important part of about this request is
you are sending the question ID you are
sending I mean you are consenting all
the question areas with the answers
right so as you can see because
co-sharing 1 because we are given the
answer which is free for crocheting - we
have given the answer 1 and then so on
what I will do now is I want to verify
all this answers on the server now how
do you verify it's actually very easy
first of all I have made one more
changes in the table so in the last last
time we have created with database as
well right now I just made some change
here now if you remember I don't know if
you remember or not if we talk about a
database which we are using so we were
using Porsche quiz database again you
can use math skills or you can use that
skill server your choice right but then
here I'm using a polar now inside this
pause quiz as you can see the last
column is let's cover the first one the
first column is position ID which is
which will have the question number then
you will be having the actual question
then you will be having the options
first option second option third option
and then so on the fourth option then we
have answer so answer initiative was the
text which means let's say for this
question for this for your question the
answer is james gosling so this one in
the answer section you will be having
james gosling but then i made a change
and I made it integer so that we can we
can save the number there so if your
answer is first answer you will say what
if you want a second also you will say -
and that's how I define this answer
column okay now the point is how do you
verify all the console so this is what
you are sending from from declined
machine to server machine right
now all the requests will be coming to
this verifies of this GM I remember if
you see the address bar is that if you
see the address bar we are actually
calling verify dot STL now when you call
this ready for any part of the stream
I'm passing all these parameters as you
can see we are passing qid 1 yep I think
you re 2 we are passing on the one we
are watching also do so what we can do
here is we can accept all those values
here now if you remember in spring or in
spring MVC we have to use at the rate
controller or we have to use Internet
request request parameters white or the
quest pattern so when we use request
parameter just imagine you're sending 10
variables of course it will not be a
good idea to tend to send those 10
variables right the good thing would be
what if you can create a class here
which will have this 10 variable so we
just take that class I will say in the
entity package obviously the class name
would be quest because question is
always white so let me create a class
class quest now this quest class will
have ten variables five question areas
and Phi one source okay so how many
variables I want I want ten variables I
got Q ID 1 and so on
32 1 4 2 and then this goes on so you
can see we have 10 variables here and
for those 10 variables of course we have
we have getters and setters and at the
end we also have to string whether if
you want to print or in case if you want
to print somewhere ok once we got this
class what next see all the questions
which is coming I mean all the question
IDs and the answer is coming from the
clients file I want to assign those
values here right again we could have
used request param and you could have
returned 10 variables there but the best
way to do here would be to use a model
attribute so we'll say a model attribute
or that's good actually attribute so
regard model attribute and let's create
an object of quest is a quest a quest so
I got an object of quest so all these
values okay all these values which is
coming some declined size will be
assigned to quest now we have to import
the package for that let me just import
the package for quest so all the values
which coming from the client request
which is qie 131 will be assigned to
this
now what next what you will do with this
it's actually very simple once you got
this first we will verify this quest but
then how how to verify this so what we
do is I will ask someone else to verify
so after verification what I want I want
this code example let's say if I if I
give a test for five questions and out
of out of those five questions three or
two questions were right in that
scenario you have to give this code
right so it's three questions was right
you have to print these if two questions
were lied you have to pay it you have to
make the answer is two so I use the
expecting a result from you so if I if
you ask for three questions or maybe you
so ask upon five questions out of five
question it forward right you have two
prints for so that you will so that you
use even know that you are printing or
you are giving you views of God for
point now how do you verify so first of
all I'm expecting a score right so I
will say I will say that for assault
I want someone else to do this job for
me so I already have a quotient down now
if you remember we have created this
class bonus question Dow and in this
question Dow as you can see we have a
crossbars pushing down here and in this
class we have certain methods now in
indict one of the method I want is
verify so what I will do here is I will
say Q Dow that is the object of question
doll which we have already created and
again don't worry there once the session
gets over maybe by tomorrow I will be
uploading this project on github so you
can just you know clone this project on
github for you
okay so regard Q tau which is Q Dow and
then here we say Q tau dot very fine
okay so of course 25 you have to pass
those parameters I mean I wanted to
verify so what about what if we want to
verify we want to verify this first
object so all these values which is
coming from the client side is stored
inside this quest
I just want to verify I just want to
verify if those those questions or
answers was right so I am passing that
here and I'm saying verify but it's all
of us we have not defined a verify yet
okay we have not defined the better
verify here
how do we do that how do you how do you
verify a thing so what you can do is you
can go to your question down and let's
define that method here so which matter
we want we want a method which is public
the method returns our interview and
we'll name this method as verified self
which takes up quest object so we say
quest course so we got a method which
takes which is a verify which takes a
quest object and of course it will
interact with the database so we'll make
it ad transactional as it will have been
dragging to interacting with each other
so I would say a transactional ok now
what our do here is I will say ain't
code but this is the variable when I
have all the values and we'll return
school ok that mean if you'd underscored
of course it will give you 0 that's not
what what we want right I mean no one
expect to get a answer which is 0 all
right so I mean a result as a 0 so what
we have to do is I'm sending this quest
right I'm sending this quest and it will
return me the int value which is result
I just want to print that result now how
do you how do you provide a verification
step here now again this is bit this is
bit tricky to understand ok so just be
with me let's try to understand how do
you verify if the answer was right or
wrong
not normally when you want to verify
something one of the best way is to use
a select query I mean of course wise if
you were to join me database you have to
pair a select query to find the Select
query we have to create such an object
right so first of all we need this
object so I need a session object
I need a query object as well in fact we
have seen this a zero why we need this
to object so we need session object so
that you can use the current session
since we are working with hibernate here
of course you can do the same project in
in gdb C as well but then using
hibernate the whites you are in concepts
and we were trying to implement new
technologies here so we have worked on a
to do a to s we have worked on a spring
we have well-known hypotenuse so you are
you are basing that are learning all new
technologies so maybe if you're going
for the interviews in future you give a
bit confident or after after watching
all this videos right ok so yep so the
garden a do for you
regard the session but then this is not
the query which I want I want to defend
wedding so let me just listeners define
that query here now what we I want now
this query is actually very important
because this query will define how to
check if our answer is right or wrong so
the quality I'll be using here is either
say select star I'm using SQL query okay
I'm not using SQL query here is because
I mean you can use SQL but then I'm
keeping it that to you how do you
provide how do you how do you make this
as hql query but let's let me just use
SQL query here so the select star from
question another table we have where
where qid is equal to 1 i mean let me
just give a static values here and unser
is equal to maybe to see if this works
if you execute this query is that if
this query returns you of column or if
this query don't you the data
it means the answer is right let's just
go with this if you fire this query okay
why don't we just try this okay well
let's try this in pose with itself so
just go to force quit as you can see
recorded data here let me just go back
here and say tools ok tools and query
tools
oh so copies doesn't work here so it's a
select star from question oh where where
your question ID so which is your cue ID
is equal to 1 and your answer is equal
to 1 again I'm not sure if the also is
right so as you can see part of this
code there is an error because unser is
in string format unfortunately have made
it string it should be integer I know so
as you can see the question number one
answer is not one and that's why it's
not working
okay but then if I change the answer to
two I get downsized - let's try now the
other is not - the answer is three
because I have to check that answer we
can also verify the answers wise we have
that answer here so question number one
has the answer is three as you can see
for this query now you can see the god
data that means when you get data the
answer is white when you're going when
you don't get a greater the answer is no
is that simple right so we are when you
fire this query if you are getting some
data that means your answer is right if
you don't get detailed as I saw we can
implement the same concept in spring
again the normal way would be a fetch
all the questions from the database
switch all the answers and then check
each and every one what happens is when
you fetch all the questions from
databases it is when you send it to an
application if we take a lots of time
right
you are wasting lots of time if you say
if you want to verify this answers by
Java code it's always better to verify
because verify the answer using SQL
query because it will not take much time
come back to Java code okay so this is
the query I want file so I will replace
this thing with a SQL query here which
is SQL but then we have one issue see
I'm not getting one and two thumb
declines right I am getting five
questions as five answers how do you how
do you make this work so timely let's go
with this one statement and later will
replace this thing with multiple for you
so the question is one answer is three
now what's next if I fire this query
what should happen it should return you
the question column very should feature
is written you the question object and
it will return only one object will not
return multiple objects also unique
results because unique result will give
you one the one go and we are not
expecting multiple Ozio it will return
you only one row now wait to stone at
object so when you said you know
freezers I don't know how many of you
are device your hibernate concepts fear
but then when you say unique results it
will give you only one row and you can
show that in a question so let's let's a
question Q equal to unit result and then
let's print the this question let me
just print that question so now I don't
know what will happen next one is code
let's see what happens to run this code
of course I will restart the server I
will go back to my Safari to see the
output and okay let me talk you say
enter here because I already have
answered all the questions right it
take some time they treat for that time
and it's working it's working it's
working it's working stick sticking some
time come on give me the answer oh we
got and we got a head oh that's weird
okay we got an error because I've just
made a mistake here this should be 3
should be enclosed in single code right
so let's let's run this once again let's
go back to our browser and let's say
enter and ok as you can see the gods
result page but then we have not got
this code there's a different thing
right let's go back to our code and
let's see what is there so if you see
this Oh weary sigh is not called or is
it called or it is called can you see
that we got a question here so we are
printing the question ID so that means
when you print queue here it is actually
printing the the entire question but in
what if you give the wrong answer let's
say if the answer you have given is 2 so
the cautionary one the answer which you
are giving is is 2 now what will happen
which one is code just to understand
what is happening lateness resetting
server ok let's enter now once again and
as you can see it is working and ok we
got the output but the output this time
is null that means when your answer is
right it will give you the object of
questions when your answer is wrong it
will give you a null and that's our
benchmark right that's we got a logic
here so what we can do is you can check
actually you can maintain a school so
whenever your question I mean of course
you have to verify five questions right
not one question we have to first do
that now how do you run this 5 times
it's very easy when you will say you
need to do something repeatedly the best
thing we could Vic is used here is a for
loop so we can use a for loop we can say
int I equal to 0 and then we say int
less than 5 and I plus plus okay so we
are running a code here so this will be
run 5 times and every time you run this
code
oh yes Gautam I am doing this from
scratch
okay so we got a question there so we've
got question Q equal to query dot unique
results now how do you verify so what we
do okay first of all I just need to I
cannot write one good right I have to
mention the question ID oh that's a
difficult part now how can I get potion
ideas from quest that's one of the
issues oh how can we do that
so the problem here is just I just try
to understand this because all the
question IDs and the answer in size
quest wise which is an object how can
you pass those things inside the query
because I want to execute this query
five times of different values so I
don't know there are different ways of
doing this if you have some other but
better way just let me know one of the
way which I can do here is I can create
a queue ID array which is which is a
static array for me and this edible has
all the questions I will say again shove
this in sure
typing this code I have order it in this
corner finish copy that so let me create
two ns here one for questions and one
for answers okay and let me just paste
that here
okay quite a point frog okay so you can
see I've got all the question ideas and
all the answers so this question ID
array will have all the questions from
one to five and this answer will have
all the others which are users user
giver so if I think those questions
using question anyone so shiny - and
then it goes all right again you can
sequence see this couldn't even
understand what is what I'm doing now
once I got everything in this question
IDs and answers what I can do here is I
can just verify how can you verify I can
depress this q ID well oh there is no
Java code right so we have to put Q ID I
just hope you are good with a
concatenation because I am doing
compilation catenation here and then
this answer will be having so sure this
- I have to write an answer of I now I
got this query and then I was running
this query how many times five times
right and every time it will give you a
question object some time it will give
you another
video on signs wrong it will give you it
will give you dull if you'll see
something wrong if you it will give you
object of question if you answer is
white so I will just check if question
is not equal to null in that scenario
increment the value of score because the
default value for sport is zero
I will just increment the value of
school if your question is not null and
that's it at the end I will return the
score I don't want to print this object
every time so as you can see if my
question sponsor is white it will
increment this quota that's what we want
like we wanted to score so this verify
is returning you of int value let's go
back to question controller and Here I
am accepting that end now I have to add
that end in MV object so I will say MV
dot add object I want to set this course
right so I will say an object or what is
MBM is down here so let's say MV dot add
object and in this add object I will say
I want to send a result and this result
will be would be stored in result itself
so the caption would be result and the
values also result okay so so regards we
got the result here wise and then in the
result our JSP I want to print icing so
I was educated is this is our JSP again
design is not that good as you can see
we have already seen the design page
these dull pages not - courage but then
that's not the important stuff for me at
least now so I want to print a result
here and then also want to print this
percentage example if you score one out
of five this percentage is 20 if you
score two out of five the percentage is
40 so in that case I want to send one
more thing I want to also send the
percentage of the person so I will say
MV dot add object I will set the
percentage as percent and I will be
sending a percentage now how do you for
Calcutta percentages vary is in this
case I will simply say result into 20 so
if you score 1 the percentage will be
like a 20 the so for the best
let's say enter and here we go can you
see why she got 5
that means all the answers which have
ticked us right that's weird
let me stick this online for now that
was really weird how can I get all right
answers let us go for long horses now
this litany should go for one wide
answer I don't know about other horses
ears okay so that we have recalled a
different value now because I once said
only one right answer so this thing is
working so if you have we have asked for
five questions and then do we have
verified that and it is working right so
Cheers
the the code is working the test is
working the god result page now what I
want from you as a health I am asking
you from a long time I don't know when
you will support for support the see
this should be a two-way process why
this if you are getting something from
this set of sessions I want something
from you as well so I'm expecting a good
design for this page of course no one
will like this type of design right so
please provide me a good design for this
you know what to do right you have to
quit as well page in which you you have
this you just have to provide it in fact
I will be showing this code on github
annual just you can just pull this
project on github and make the changes
on the design page and send it to us
okay so that's what we'll be doing here
so yeah that's it we have we have worked
on result page today in the stos as you
can see again we are done decoding here
and let me just show you the DAO page
which is this so instead now this is the
code we have written okay so this is our
agenda for today now next time next
session would be maybe in extra to two
to three days to get the update you have
to be a part of Facebook group so if you
don't you cannot down the Facebook group
just make sure you request or you
requested I mean send a joint request on
facebook group also on Facebook search
for the Riskalyze project and it just
makes make sure that you you add
yourself there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
