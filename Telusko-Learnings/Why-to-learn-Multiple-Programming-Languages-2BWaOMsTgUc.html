ready from Tarascon landings and in this
video we'll talk about why to learn
multiple languages you know we have so
many languages we have see we have C++
we have Java we have V B we have Scala Y
to learn all these languages in fact I'm
not saying you have to learn all the
languages because there are
approximately 10,000 languages can you
believe that we have approximately
10,000 languages available to use I mean
you can just go to google and search for
the number of languages available it
will give you a count around 10,000 I
mean who creates all this language is
big I mean you know there are people who
want to have a specific problem with
other languages so they try to modify
one language and they create a new
language right example of Facebook has
their own language called as hack which
is based on PHP then we have we have Jay
sharp from Microsoft we have F sharp is
functional programming so there are lots
of languages right so there are ten for
the languages or do me to learn all I'm
not exactly because only 300 languages
are famous right so do we to learn three
languages or not exactly so what I would
suggest is every language is based on
something example if we talk about C
programming it is based on procedures
right C++ is partially procedure and
partially object-oriented right and then
Java is object oriented and then we have
Haskell which is which is functional
programming so there are lots of
languages which are based on different
paradigms right so we have functional
programming we have procedural
programming we have object-oriented
programming we have even doing
programming if you on VB vb.net so it is
based on event-driven right so it works
with events so when you press a button
it will do something so there are lots
of different of per diem so what I would
suggest is learn one language from one
per diem let's say don't see because you
want to know about procedures learn C++
because you want to know how procedures
and object is it work learn Java it will
teach you how objects it works learn
Scala it will teach you how to think in
functional because I guess that's the
future now right because the world is
changing we are I mean I'm not saying it
will be only functional programming but
because of the huge demand in object
in these wisdom and in big data we need
to process lots of data right so Scylla
is something I think you should learn
because it will teach you a function is
baccarat me you can go for also go for
Haskell which is also functional
programming so so search for different
palladiums of like pop object-oriented
functional programming event-driven and
learn one language are too long without
operate and trust me one you so even if
you don't want to become expert in seed
if you don't want to be expert in any
other like Scala learn that you know
even if you're a Java programmer it will
teach you how to think in functional way
because Java 8 itself is functional
programming now so what you can do is
learn Scala learn Java 8 learn C
programming so even if you are a dotnet
expert or vb.net if we walk on VB
Doulton it will teach you how to think
in object way right when you learn Java
so having knowledge of multiple language
always helps right so even if you know
one language it is better to learn other
language also so that's it
learn different languages but be expert
of one you know you should be jack of
all the languages and master of one
language so that's it thank you so much
