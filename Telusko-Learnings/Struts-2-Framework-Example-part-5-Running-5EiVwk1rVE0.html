now let's try two on this code so if it
on this code you have to learn this
index dot JSP
so what you can see is you will see a
property there the property name is
message and the value by default will be
guessed this is because this
hello starts is directly mapped with a
class which is hello starts here so this
message is mapped with a field which is
a message here so if you can see there
so this message is linked with that
since we have not called this hello
starts by default this message will be
blank now since it is blank it will it
will assign a value which is guest okay
and then you will see our text filter
and a button so once you click on a
button it will send a request oh hello
starts hello starts will call call a
method which is execute in this execute
we are assigning the value to message
which is hello and if the data which is
entered in the field if we can observe
we are not using any method called as
get parameter from the request object it
this variable here or this name here
user name is directly getting mapped
with this with this variable name which
is username and this is done with the
help of interceptors okay so let's run
this run this app so if we run this code
it will take some time for if you're
running the code for the first time for
me I have already done that so it will
no it will not take much of a time so
you can see by default the values
guessed is because the message is empty
but what if I enter a name here so if I
say let's say Rahul and if I click on
submit there you can see we have hello
Rahul
so how it's working so you are you know
you're clicking on this button which is
submit the questions going to web drives
ml from that it which is going to store
exam l and from strata XML you are
fetching this result which is success
and it is calling the same page which is
index dot JSP so this is how way to work
out with the first application of starch
to so I hope you got a base
the idea about those two example or
demonstration so thank you so much for
watching and do subscribe for the
further videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
