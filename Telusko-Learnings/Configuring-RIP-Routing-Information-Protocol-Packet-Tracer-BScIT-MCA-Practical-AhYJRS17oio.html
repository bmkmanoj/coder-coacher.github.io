we'll talk about our IP configuration
using Cisco packet tracer so for this
let me design our network we'll take one
machine here and second machine let's
place this here now to connect these two
machines again this these two machines
will also do it to different network so
this machine belongs to a network called
as one ninety two dot one sixty eight
dot one dot zero and this machine
belongs to a network one ninety two dot
one sixty eight dot 2.0 so what I need
is I need to connect this to machine so
let me take a switch here so that I can
in future I can connect multiple
machines so let me take a switch here
and I will take one more switch at this
point now to connect this I need to go
out so let me take a generic router here
and this genrika out of its genre grout
here so what I have is I have this
network as 1.0 this network as 2.0 so
let me just mention this
so this network is one ninety two dot
one sixty eight dot one dot zero and
this network one ninety two dot one
sixty eight dot 2.0
now to connect this we need wires on
this machine to this machine and from
from this machine to this machine okay
and to connect now from this machine to
this switch and yeah here we go now I
need to connect these two routers also
right so we have to connect this two
routers now what I need is I need to
configure this network for this valve
this router for this network and this
router for this network right now
whenever you configure this you have to
configure your machines first right I
can we are not going for any dynamic IP
we will be using some static IP only so
index top go to IP configuration and
here the Machine IP will be 180 2016 1.2
this is your mask and Gateway is 1 e 2
dot one sixty eight dot one dot one now
close this machine you can do the same
configuration for this machine in
desktop IP configuration and we need to
do at one sixty eight dot 1000 us 1.1
it's not 2.2 and Gateway is 182 201
ninety two dot one sixty eight dot one
its 2.1 okay now now we have to
configure this point and this point so
go to this outer configuration and in
fast ethernet you have to provide it
default gateway right so it's funny to
do dot one sixty eight dot one dot one
and this is your mask and on and this is
the outer you can do the same thing
configuration fast ethernet your
gateways money to do dot one sixty eight
dot 12.1
you have to say on now the routers are
configured right again we have to
configure this link also
now this is one network this is second
network and between two routers I have
one more network and this network let me
define it as o 10.0.0.0 this is my
network here okay so this point will
give as 10.10 dot dot - this is 10.10
dajatol or three so go to this router
and with your serial port because he
again you have when you configure come
to this wire you can see this is your
clock and we don't have a clock here so
this is your DC e and this is your DTE
so go to this router when you set your
serial 2/0 you have to concentrate we
have a clock there right so let me set a
clock as 64,000 so you can take any
number so let me give an IPS one at n
dot 10.0 r2 and this is your mask and on
now this port is on now you have two on
this port so come here and not wash it
on you see see the serial port again in
this side we don't have a clock so we
have to set it as not set and then dot
ten dot zero dot
at that side we have to this side we
have three and then you have to say on
now your routers are totally configured
right now what we need is when I when I
pick a packet from this router so from
this machine to router it's working
right it's because this router knows
about this machine all we can say this
machine knows about this router what if
if I take my packet from this machine to
this machine
it gives me field it's because this
machine knows about this router or this
router knows about this router but this
router don't know anything about this
machine or this network so we have to
teach we have to teach this router how
to get to that machine and for this we
can either use static routing or we can
use our IP again for static I have have
already have a video on youtube on my
channel so if you want to go for static
now this time we are going for
an IEP okay so our IP is the outing
information protocol in which you just
have to mention you just have to mention
the number of network this is out the
nose so this router knows about this
network and this network so just shall
you type here the network ID so it's 192
dot one sixty eight dot one dot zero are
going to do this we have we have our
commands the commands are the outer are
the IP again you can do it using
conjugation more Adjei a CLI mode so
with configuration mode its router our
IP and in that we have to mention the
network address so add and we need one
move we know one more network is
10.0.0.0 and then we have to say add ok
now this is this router is we have
mentioned the our IP protocol here again
next thing is so you have to go to the
configuration and in setting you just
have to save this in NVRAM okay so nvm
is non-volatile a plan in which you can
save your configuration and you have to
say close now I have to do the same
thing for this router so you can use a
config or you can use a lie so this time
will will will be UCLA you have to come
to the global configuration mode this is
your configuration mode and this the
command is router our IP and now you
have to mention the network address so
this router knows about 180 toward one
sixty eight dot 2.0 and network it knows
about when it works so 10.0.0.0 and
that's it and to save go to
configuration settings and save okay and
this is also configure this is also we
have done the protocol for this router
also now to check if it is working or
not pick up packet from this machine to
this machine it comes failed you have to
wait for 10 seconds against which will
take some time louder will take some
time again we are back working with our
IP which updates it table after every 25
seconds ok so till then we can check for
this router this should be connected
because obviously
we are dying to contain them what our
focus is my focus is to drop a packet
from this machine to this machine and
it's working right again you can check
the same thing using simulation so using
simulation what we to do is pick a
packet from this so this machine to this
machine and you can run capture forward
so capture forward capture forward and
capture forward capture forward and
alright so this is how you have to work
with your are IP and I hope you learn
something from it now if you have any
doubts please comment also that I can
solve your doubts and do subscribe for
