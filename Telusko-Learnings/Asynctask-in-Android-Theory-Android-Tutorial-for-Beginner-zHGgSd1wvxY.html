Teresa lightnings and in this video
we'll talk about async tasks now as you
know Java this Android is inspired by
Java right so everything you do in
Android is inspired by Java so when we
like Android code so in that we have to
add XML code and Java code right so we
have to design your page with their
graphics ml and you write the code or
you perform the actions with the help of
Java right now what happens when you
when you work with Java so by default
you have one thread so I hope you know
the concept of threads right because to
understand what is async tasks you
should usually have some knowledge about
threads so when you talk about Java we
by default you work with a main thread
right so one thing is running which is
main Twitter now if you don't know that
that we have a main thread try out any
exceptions let's say you are you are
dividing a number by 0 so you will get
automatically ception so this statement
will be exception in thread main so by
default in Java in basically in code
Java we have a main thread right in the
same way if we talk about Android we
have something called as you I thread
now it is this UI try this is user
interface thread so what it means so
let's say using any app so let's say you
are using Amazon app thought you are
using my app which is there is core app
on Android so what happens so let's say
you're going to a code section so in my
app you can see you can find different
of features we have codes we have videos
so let's say you go to code section
where you will get all the codes about a
code Java and when you click on a button
let's say you want a code for
encapsulation maybe your your code a
code for may be multiple threading in
that scenario when you when you browse
something when you click on a button or
when you when you when you drag you are
walking with UI thread so every actions
which are performed is done with the
help of UI so what happens when you when
you click on a button so let's say you
are using my app and suddenly your
request for a page so my app is
basically a web-based app so everything
is saved on the server ok which is open
ship server for me
so website name is telescope calm so we
have telescope calm which is deployed on
the server and this server runs on
OpenShift server from from that so we
have this server here
and we have an app right so this is your
app here so this is a mobile phone in
which you are running an app now let's
say you are yo you open my app and then
you are browsing for the codes right so
your request you have the question for
the code and then your browsing the code
here
right so we have the code for in
capsulation then we have let's say again
multi-threading now as soon as you click
on up code let's say you want a code for
palindromes so we have a palindrome code
here now when you click on the
palindrome code it will show you the new
activity right the next activity so
again again I know in fact you know that
how to how to start an activity right so
we have to use intent there so let's say
before point the next activity we want
data right so from here but from
valuable Kelty data because data is not
stored inside the mobile phone it is
stored on the server so your app will
request to the server for the code right
so you have to request for the code here
now with your request for app code it
will take some time right maybe 2 or 3
seconds on much right let's say you are
using a good internet connection it will
take at least one second to get the
response now your request goes to server
and then you will be getting the
response now by the time your UI thread
so you have this UI thread which is busy
with the request right so your UI 3 is
waiting for the response till that time
you cannot you cannot do anything in on
your app light because your UI thread
this thread is busy with the request
right and you think it's ok right for 1
or 2 seconds your app will not work but
hold on we are humans of 21st generation
we are living in 2016 and we don't have
patience you know you go to Facebook you
go to all this all these websites and if
when you click on a button if there
doesn't work what we do we are in click
it right we don't have patience now can
you wait for 1 or 2 seconds of course
the answer is no right no one waits for
one or two seconds so what we can do
here is instead of your UI thread sends
a request we have to create one more
thread so what we'll do is so this UI
thread is busy with your app itself so
this this UI thread is here it's working
with your app and as soon as you send
the request so for sending the request
we have to use
and new thread okay so we can say that
this t1 so this T one is busy with the
request okay you eye is still there with
you so let's say t1 is sending the
request and you are getting the response
by the time you can access your app so
you can scroll up scroll down because of
you have UI thread with you okay so in
total we are working with two threads
now question arise how to achieve this
t1 and to achieve t1 we have to use a
concept called as pacing task okay so
what is async idiot it is a synchronous
task using which you can achieve this a
multiple threading a pre web application
or web application but an application
okay so that's icing task for you
but then question let's say you want to
implement this now how to implement this
so you have to create a class inside
your app so you have basically you have
to create a inner class which will
provide you a async task feature so you
have to get a cloth so let's say I have
in my app I have to create a class okay
so let's say I have a class here so we
have a class let me let's say that class
is a and we have to extends okay so we
have to extend that class with the help
of async task
okay so we have exchange async task here
so do we have T here yes we have capital
T right so that's that's the capital T
there so we have async task right and
then in this class we have so we have to
use four methods
okay so anybody work with async task we
have to we have to use four methods and
we have to use three parameters or three
type 3 type Co which is a generic type
and I hope you know the generic type set
so again you should know about generics
before this so for this we have to
mention three things here okay three
parameters the first one second one
third one so we have to mention the type
of those parameters so the first one
will be your atoms so the number of
parameters you pass example the URL and
all those stuff the second one is the
progress okay which will update your
progress and the third one the third one
is
result so you have to mention three
things the first one is parents which is
parameters the second one is progress
and the third one is result okay so
let's say your parent type is integer or
string you have to mention string here
if you are progress type is integer you
have to mention integer here and if you
have result type as string so after
mention string if it is integer you have
to mention integer there now if you
don't want to mention anything here you
can mention void void and void which
means you are not passing any parameters
okay
so we have this we have to create a
class which extends async tasks but when
you work with async tasks it it will ask
you for four methods the first method is
let me write that method here so we have
to write those methods so the first
method as on pre execute so that's the
first method okay the second method is a
method the second method is due in
background okay in fact this is small G
I had this habit of using canvassing
rules the third one is what the third
one it is on progress update and the
fourth one s it is on post execute okay
so we have this four methods we have the
first one as on pre execute then we have
doing background we have on progress
update and then we have on post execute
so we have this four methods so what
this method will do so first thing first
we will talk about the parameters so
whenever you work with doing background
you have to pass this parameters here so
you have this parameters pattern so you
have to pass this parameters here so if
you have to pass patterns okay so we
have to use this this of this type in
doing by round the second one is
progress right so of course where you
have to mention that we have to mention
that here which is progress okay and the
third one is the result and that you
have to mention and so that's your
result you have to mention that in in on
post execute so what will happen now so
when you want to achieve this async task
so before sending the request you have
to achieve some you have to do some
extra work right so before execute the
async task before sending the request
you have to do some pre requisites so
that's your pre on pre execute and this
method will be done by your UI thread
itself so this UI thread will take care
of on to execute after that once you
send a request what should happen in the
background so let's say you are using
you have click on a button so you are
still using UI so what should happen is
on the async thread so that you have to
mention on doing background so let's say
you want to send a request or you want
to do anything those tasks doesn't done
in the on doing background now let's say
you have sent a request and you are
trying to download soft files so you are
downloading let's say five files and you
want to show the show to the user that
something is going on so let's say you
are doing for your sending equation
which will take 3 to 4 seconds now you
have to inform your user that it will
take some time
how will you inform so you have to show
some progress bar it's happening it's
happening 25% 50% 75% and then hundred
hundred percent right how can you inform
that 50 persons done so what you can do
is you can mention on progress update so
let's say if you are going to do the
first file 25 percent done second file
50 percent done so that's that possibly
with the help of on progress update the
fourth one is on post execute so let's
say everything is done you have sent a
request
you got the response now what now you
want that result to be processed right
and that thing you can do or in inside
on post execute sounds simple right so
we have to use these four methods how
exactly to implement this that will see
once we start with the practical
implementation so I had a choice to
start with practical itself but you know
sometimes it be difficult to understand
when you diagnose try with the practical
so this is the theory of that ok so make
sure you understand what are the
terminology we have the actual work will
be done inside on the practical itself
ok so this is a theory for that got the
idea so we have to use all these things
so once again we have async task which
is used for multi-threading so let's say
you want to achieve you want to send
requestor server we have to use async
task so by default you have UI thread we
require one more thread here which is a
sync thread which will send a request to
the server and which on the server you
will be getting the response okay and
then you want to you have to touch it
that you have to create a class which
extends async task and you have to
provide the generic there so you have to
pass three genrich's the first one is
the parents the first second one is the
progress and the third one is result and
in this you have to use four methods
it's not compositor use all the four
methods but it recommends to use those
four methods the first one is on Plex
Acutes
unplug the cute so if you want to do
something with before something that you
request we can use on to execute once
you have send request something is going
on what is that something you have to
mention that in doing background then we
have so let's say you are doing some
tasks it will take lots of time so you
have to use on poll on progress update
and then we have on post execute for the
results okay
then question arise so it is one of the
best thing right so from today whenever
you want to wait for some time maybe
five to six seconds we will be using
async task right that's not the case
whenever you have a small duration gap
maybe two to three seconds or maximum
five seconds go for a sync task but if
it takes a lot of time maybe 10 seconds
20 seconds don't use async task in that
scenario you can use executors again
what is executors it's a multi-threading
multi-threading concepts in Java so you
have to use that when you work for a
longer duration okay but for a shorter
duration for sending a request to the
server there getting these spawns this
is one of the best way to do it okay so
that's it your that spot your async task
is so thanks for watching and do
