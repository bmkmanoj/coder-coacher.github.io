create our own annotation now in this
video we'll talk about how to use it so
we have created the annotation here and
then we have mentioned at smartphone but
how can we use that so what we do here
is let me create a variable here I mean
let me create two variables one is
string model name and what else what
else what else
let let me have a inch screen size or
size
okay B let's have these two variables
here and we can specifically can assign
the value to it with the help of a
constructor so let me use the Eclipse
feature to take the constructor there
okay Souls and was the constructor it's
here and let's assign both the values
click one okay you've got your
constructor there now what we'll do is
once we assigned once we have assigned
the constructor we can create the object
of it right so we can create Nokia a
series it's your and we'll say obj equal
to new Nokia a series and we can assign
the model number let's say the model
name is fire
I mean file is taken by Amazon I now but
let's say we have fire and that's a spin
sizes five so that's five inch okay so
we can print the values of values of the
Nokia object right so you can simply say
o dot model we can print the value one
on this code you can see it says fire
but I want I don't want to print the
values of Nokia I want to print is it a
smart phone or not all is if it is a
smart phone which version of Android it
uses right now how to how to see that I
what I want is I want to know the
annotation value for this class to fetch
that we need to create object of smart
phone because if you can create the
object of smart phone you will get the
data that's let's name it s but hold on
we don't want to directly an object of
smart phone I want the value from this
obj so to print this value of OS and
we need a smartphone object so to do
that we have to follow some steps to
remove this so the first step is you
have to create a class object will say
class C equal to obj dot gate class so
basically we have to use reflection API
here to fetch the values of the
annotation so reflection API is
basically a new API introduced in Java
these using which you can get the values
of the object or the features of the
object so we can say class C equal to
obj get class and then we can create the
object of annotation so annotation
basically belongs to a + annotation it
belongs to a package annotation you can
see that and all the annotation so
whenever you create annotation which is
subclass of annotation so if you create
annotation like this it's as a + of
annotation so annotation is an interface
not a class it is an interface and it
was introduced in 1.5 so basically this
concept of annotation was introduced in
1.5 so with sanitation a and equal to
now how do we get annotation so we have
to say C dot get annotation of which
class because one class can have
multiple annotations as we have to
specify which annotation you are talking
about so I am talking about smart phone
onto annotation so once we got the
annotation let's create the object of
smart phone now we'll say smart phone as
equal to a n because that's that's an
annotation here we just have to type car
straight with smart phone ok so from
this annotation we have we got our smart
phone now once we got the smart phone we
can print the values of it we can say s
dot o s it will print the value of hours
and that is your okay we got null point
exception is not able to fetch the value
have a missed something
okay I don't think so
I guess I'm missing something here we
got the annotation we got other thing
seems good oh we have we have we forgot
to specify some values here so anyway
you create our own annotation we have to
specify certain values now those values
are first we can specify that the target
till what point I mean where it where
this annotation will be used so this
hydration will be used on the class so
for that we have to mention element type
dot type so if you say type it will be
assigned at the class level first you
have to input the package done okay when
it does it working now we are still
getting an error was this error is about
we have created the smartphone object we
got the annotation okay we have to
specify one more addition which is add
basically we have for metadata
annotation which we have to use again
we'll talk about that in some time so we
have to specify the retention policy
till what point you want your annotation
to work so we'll say I want this to go
till runtime and here we go so we have
to specify this two so this two are
called as meta annotations now why we
use this because whenever you want to
create your own annotation you have to
specify this annotation so this the
first annotation which is at target so
we have to specify on what level we'll
be using this annotation on on class
level on method level on field level
because if you mention method here so
this will work on method level now you
can also specify constructor I guess you
can specify constructor so it will work
on consider level you can also mention
field level field level so it will work
on field level but we want to use it on
class or interface we can use type we
can specify the retention time so till
what point you want this annotation so
if you specify
so so this will be available only till
source it will not be available in the
class in the sole in the compiled file
if you specify what other policies we
have if you specify class it will be
available in dot class dot class file
also and if you specify run time it will
be there at one time also so this is one
if you want to introduce your annotation
and the in the documentation itself
because let's say after creating the
software if you want to create the
documentation of it you can introduce
the annotation in document also by using
act documented annotation we have one
more which is at inherited so let's say
if you if you provide the annotation so
if you are using a forward is spinning
or watch yeah so if you are using this
smartphone annotation on Nokia series
and in future if you are getting a new
class let's say Windows series or maybe
maybe some new series and a series phone
something in that way and this class
extends Nokia series okay so if you want
that this on education should be
available for this class as well we have
to use at in so we have to specify at
inherited that's one of the addition we
have to use so that's it about
annotation if you have so if you like
