Wendy from police car learnings and in
this video we'll talk about list view
now question is what is list view in
Android so you know when you open you
when you go to settings in your mobile
phone this is how it or how it looks
like so in this in this image you can
see the elements in the least format
right so we have at least the first
element then the second element the
third element right and to achieve this
what we have to do so Oh will will not
build the same thing but will try to
build a simple list here so this is the
list we want here we want a list of
languages so we have C C++ and all those
stuff now in order to create this list
view we have to first create an array
okay
so this is this is your ladder here so
we have we have C C++ Java and all those
languages in the array format so we had
to put this array inside this list but
the problem is in this list view object
we don't have anything called as array
or which it will not accept adding to do
that we have to use something called as
array adapter now if you're not familiar
with add adapter you can just go to my
channel search for adapter design
pattern and have a look on that and then
you understand what I said after so
let's say you know about adapter so to
work with ListView and the array we
require adding adapter here so this
adapter will take the input as the array
and then you can assign the values to
the ListView
so ListView uses an adapter and an
adapter uses the array and if it on this
code you will get this array adapter or
if you will get this ListView
okay but hold on if you see the original
image where you have these settings we
have two things we have the texts of
each element will have a text and the
image right so let's say if we have a
battery so bad she will have an image
how to do that so we'll try to create
text example in which you will try to
implement this and don't worry in the
next two in the next two videos we'll
talk about the practical of it okay so
we'll see how to implement each of this
so we have a new activity or new layout
here and they
you have an adding but this in each
element you have two times the image so
you can see one two three those are the
images and then we have a text and you
can see images repeating right so we
have one two three nine one two three
because I was running out of the images
so I've took these three images and
repeated those three images twelve times
right all we have 20 meters in total so
we have two other images and twelve
texts not to work with this we require
an array okay we required to add is the
first array which will have the list of
string and the second array will have
the list of images okay so we can say we
have to add is there but the problem is
if you want to work if you don't save
this to arrays inside this ListView it
will not directly happen with the help
of an adapter because an adapter works
with one type of thing right so in this
each in this list each element is of
type so you can see that activity there
so we have a text and image right so we
had to repeat this text image 12 times
for that you have to create your own or
you have to create a custom adapter
which will try to fetch these elements
from the addy and will put into a
ListView but hold on when you talk about
adapters it needs some specific features
right or it needs some common features
so what we can do is stop bleating the
adapter by yourself throughout you can
you can create a class and after class
which will extends the adapter so that
we can use the existing feature and
whenever you exchange an adapter you
have to work with two things the first
one you have to create a constructor in
your class which we'll call the super
constructor the second will be the
getview method because every time we try
to render it it will require that
getview method there now once we got the
adapter so we have to get a customer up
topic these two things constructor and
get view method which will use this to
Ares right now once we got this adapter
you just have to use the ListView object
and set the adapter with the ListView
okay so we will try to implement the
same thing in the next two videos in
which you have the first video we'll
talk about the simple ListView
and the second video will talk about the
ListView with image and text okay so
that is from this video thanks for
watching and do subscribe for further
