in this video we are going to discuss
about types of joints the first one
being the inner joint inner join always
returns only the matched records from
both the tables so suppose we want to
display that names of employee along
with their location the query would be
select a name comma location from EMP
comma department where EMP dot
Department number is equals to
Department dot Department number this
query we have already done in a previous
tutorial this is nothing but a simplest
example of inner join only where we but
in this query we specified the tables
using a Cartesian product so we specify
two tables tables gets multiplied and
then we filter on the basis of employee
number the same query can be rewritten
in a way such that select employee name
comma location from employee inner join
department on employee dot department
numbers is equals to Department dot
Department number
so this query will also return us the
same result but what we have done over
here is we have specified the inner join
clause in which we specify the columns
on which these two tables needs to be
inner join so inner join it returns on
the match records from both tables next
type of join we will going to study is
outer join so as the name suggests outer
join will return us the matched records
as well as the unmatched records from
the tables so if you have seen over here
in this table only first five records
will have some department so they are
matching with some department number and
from Department number there is no
employee who is working in department
number forty so over here in department
fourth record is unmatched and in
employee the sixth record is unmatched
so outer join is of three types left
outer join right outer join and full
outer join
left outer join it returns match records
as well as only unmatched records from
the left table right outer join match
records along with unmatched records
from right table and full outer join
will return match records along with
unmatched records with both the tables
so in outer join whenever
unmatched records are returned the other
value is displayed as null shall see one
example so if we want to select same
employee name comma department name from
employee left outer join dept on EMP dot
Department number is equals to
department dot department number so this
is essentially the similar query that we
have written in previous example just in
place of inner join we have specified it
as left outer join so for first five
records you will have some department
numbers so their department name will be
displayed plus since you have specified
the left outer join any unmatched record
from the left table that is the employee
table will be also displayed so this
fire records plus the unmatched record
that is the six record which do not have
any department number so that it does
not have any department name so the
value will be displayed as mug
you see that yes so we get five records
with their precipice or specific
department name and the last record gets
the value as none in place of left if we
specify right outer join
what will going to happen is this first
five match records will be displayed but
instead of unmatched from fifth of 30
the first table we will see this
production department and since in that
department no employees working so we
will have a name as null and department
name as production yes so once again
left outer join and router right outer
join are used when you want to display
some unmatched records from either a
left table as well as or the right table
and if we use it as full outer join then
up to this view are getting only six
records now we get the seven records
first five unmatched sorry first five
records that are matched then the sixth
record that is unmatched from employee
and the last record that will be
unmatched from department
okay so we will see the next type of
join self join okay self join is used
when a table is joined to itself so
we'll save an example in this employ
table we have written a call up that is
manager but we haven't used it yet what
this manager column indicates that the
manager of employee number one is
employee number two that means the
manager of a AAA is BBB the manager of
BBB is si si si si si si there is no
manager ID so no manager for si si si
for employee number four the manager is
five so this one so what if I wanted to
display the name of employee along with
the name of their manager so if the
employee name is AAA I should get its
manager named as BBB so now in this case
we will assume that these are virtually
two different tables okay so you make a
Cartesian product on these two tables so
we'll have 6 into 6 36 records and we
will filter the records on the basis of
employee number and manager number in
previous or join examples what we were
having a condition on two different
tables so one column was primary key
another column was a foreign key so here
Department number is a foreign and
department number over here is a primary
key but in self-join both primary key as
well as foreign key we are there enough
one single table itself so here employee
number is my primary key whereas manager
is our foreign key so let's take a look
at the example select
let us say I have employee as e dot e
name and manager as m dot in M from
employee we will give it a lies name as
E and the manager information will also
come from the same table EMP but will
allies it as M there so our condition is
where employees manager ID and managers
employee ID are equal so if we are
considering E as one different table and
M as another table so the manager of e 2
has to match the employee number of
manager so where condition is e dot MGR
is equals to m dot e number and we will
also use the Paloma lysis so e dot e
name will display it as employee name
and m dot in M will display it as
manager
okay so for employee number a the
manager is BBB and so on next example
next point to discuss whenever we are
going to self join it is important that
we must specify a table level allies for
a table because if we do not then there
is no way to distinguish which employ
table we are referring to so here there
are virtually two instances of employee
table and we mention it by e dot and M
so we will see the last type of joint
that is the natural join so suppose I
gave the same example we want to display
the employee name along with their
department name so in normal inner join
we would have written a query like that
select a name comma D name from EMP for
my department there
EMP dot dat number is equals to TP c dot
d PT number or even if using inner join
we would have written EMP inner join on
employer department number is equals to
department or department number what
happens in case of natural join is that
we need not specify any where clause on
which condition as the name suggests it
automatically identifies the primary key
and foreign key of two tables and it
matches it so when we are going to is
natural join the only thing that we need
to specify is select a name comma D name
from EMP natural join Department
so we need not need to specify that on
which column we want to filter the
records so whenever we specify a natural
join records are automatically filtered
on the basis of primary key and foreign
key so in order to use natural join it
is must that while creating our table we
must have defined the columns as primary
key and foreign key so even this query
is going to return me the same result
yes we get this fire records along with
their department name so that is all for
the types of joints thanks for watching
and happy learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
