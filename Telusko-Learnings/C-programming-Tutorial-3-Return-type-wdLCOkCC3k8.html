to add two numbers now from the first
code we are saying there's a triangle
sign here which gives you a warning
so anyone whenever you type any code in
programming or C programming or Java or
C++ you will result it will either give
you the output all it will show the
warnings all others so you will be
getting multiple things right now
what is others so if you make any
syntactical mistakes so you will get an
error okay but if you make a mistake
which is not exactly a problem for your
output but it's not a right way to do it
so it will give you the warning example
if I if I declare a variable and if I'm
not using that variable in the code
example if I say I have int a equal to 8
and so we have we are using this
variable we are declaring this variable
and not we are not using it so it will
say unused variable so that is those are
called as warnings this is not a
technical problem is just you're doing
something which is bit wrong so here
when you talk about this mean it says
type specify a missing default to end
that means every function returns
something
ok so function is something which will
do a task and it will return something
so example if I want a pen so if I ask
you to bring me a pen you will ask for
money right and that's here so you will
ask me let's let's say this is you and
I'm asking you to bring a pen for me so
you will ask me money so whenever you
take money you will take in these
parameters that you will take this money
in a bracket the same way we talked
about printf you're asking printer to do
something it will say ok what I to do so
you have to you have to pass something
in the bracket this is what you have to
do so main will take money or you will
take money and you will give me either
pen so you will return me a pen so if
you are returning a pen
so I will write pen so you returns a pen
so you are mean you take money and you
can return me up you give you will give
me a pen all you will give me my money
back if you don't have a pen you will
give my money back right all you will
you will give nothing
so that is void so if you're not
providing anything back so
voil simple so when you talk about main
in C it always returns something if you
don't want to return anything we have to
mention it as void simple okay so we
have to mention void but when we talk
about c programming it will execute on
your compiler right or your cpu now CPU
says instead of returning void give me
our interval you if your program
succeeds to return or succeeds to
perform you return me a value which is 1
otherwise you can return any error code
ok so I thought you can return 0 or you
can return 1 so heater is a keyword
using which we will return the value
back so let's say you you are calling
main so your you want some values so you
can return a value with this one week
you can return any integer value because
you're writing it here it has int so
this ain't here this is called as data
type and this int here when you will
write a method whenever you write a
variable also if anybody write a type
before a function it is called as return
type it's also our data type of
specifically it is called as return type
so this thing here is called as return
type and this is your data type simple
so in the further tutorials we'll be
using this line for sure so every time
you will be having int and every time
will be have a return one and now I feel
on this and see the change here since
you are returning one it writ it says
the exit code is one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
