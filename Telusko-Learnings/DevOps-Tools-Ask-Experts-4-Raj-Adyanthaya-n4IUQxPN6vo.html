on hangout so hello everyone I hope my
body will there that's my thing
okay so just we need to just verify if
everything is working okay so my voice
is also there so I can hear my own voice
that's perfect that means we are on
YouTube life and the Father we are to be
a rehab came to this whole session of
tech experts and then if you have any
questions you can answer and the topic
for today is DevOps okay you can ask any
question but then mostly we'll be
focusing on devups
and today we have a large with us and
let me just share you know there's no
banana psycho oh there's a echo I guess
is something wrong with my with my phone
a second camera it's playing good now
judge
yeah how about not H is it good that's
better
yeah okay perfect so let me just focus
so I'm shifting my focus from from a me
to Raj and so we have large here either
take this vote for DevOps and so he will
be trying to answer all your questions
on DevOps and now question is which
question we are going to answer first so
so I have shared the link to ask
questions so these are this a form which
you were supposed to fill to ask
questions and that form was shared on on
the video link and then the perform was
also available on Facebook so we have a
Facebook page we have a Facebook group
so if you want to get future forms so
that you can sub video questions I just
go to Facebook and the likely page I
make sure that you are in the group so
that you can ask questions still if you
want I want to ask question you can
there's a link in the description area
just go there and get asked the question
okay
so let me just shift the focus to Raja
audio swatch
Thanks thanks guys uh thanks everyone
for joining this session that's not mean
introduced my name is Roger didn't eeeh
can you guys hear me
yes I guess everyone can hear you yeah
so my name is Raj and India I've been on
95 for almost 15 years you know in order
15 years around 11 years of us
experience so currently I'm working for
Visa Inc based out of California Bay
Area I'm working as a lead system
analyst analyst holding corporate
application that being said you know
they also was something new which we
introduced in our organization I won't
say it's new probably I would say that
it's it's new for our team
it's been that for almost four five
years now yeah so so I absolutely you
know so I'm also pretty new today what
but you know I have done a lot of work
so on and so I think I can give you some
starting point for all the guys who plan
to start but that can lead India Bob's
know oh yes that's about it so yeah so
should we straight away jump into a
question order so you can introduce
something of what DevOps and then
because the I can see most of the
questions the first question is what is
DevOps because some people they know it
because they are working on in the
company and some people they don't even
know what they are up means they know
development they know operations but
then they are not aware of that so we
can start with that or what exactly they
wops means and then but then they can we
can jump towards questions so you know
first of all you know DevOps is not just
you know don't think as as like a
programming language or a tool you need
to know in order watch this mostly it's
a culture okay it's a culture which all
the new organization have to adopt if
they want to survive in the new fast
pace world period you know you know
people have been doing this waterfall
the software development from waterfall
they came to a child and now it's DevOps
is the leaner more effective more
efficient way of getting things out to
the production environment you know the
key feature of the offices your customer
feedback customer experience it also
drives from there you know how fast you
can deliver your code to production how
fast you can fix your code in production
with a more efficient way okay and so
that's the baseline you know your key
for DevOps is customer experience
customer feedback and you know just
keeping customer happy so with that
being said there offs you know earlier
people used to work in silos I lost what
silos missus like you have a development
team me away QA team you have an
operation production support team you
have infrastructure team you have you
know project management team all
different teams you know there is
development developers to develop their
code push it to QA and then the QA team
will support and they push it back to
production operation team will take that
code you know support that code for as
long as it will be in production and you
know they will manage all the incident
which comes into production and this was
the old methodology say for example you
got a new requirement in the prior world
order or in the old world a requirement
is to take roughly around you know say
say I got a requirement I will say that
it will take roughly three to four
months to get that into production but
you know no longer that is acceptable
you know so that comes today off model
you know where you get things in you get
things as quick as to production and you
you work as a team you know or to get
that to production your QA developer
operation infrastructure everybody works
as one team okay and you know the key
offices you know people talk about
what's the feature of the office you
know
and nobody knows what's gonna come in
future right but as of now DevOps gives
you the you know platform to to survive
in the in the fast-paced world I know
right now all the top organization you
know you start from Amazon Google
Facebook Netflix in the doors are
tip-top I would say top IT company you
know they are implemented they officer
almost like four I would say five six
years back Amazon is very head of all of
them you know did they had any metrics
on each of this company apparently
Amazon releases 22,000 code a day that's
thing that's the metric so currently
yeah and let me let me pull up that
table I'm gonna put that on your own
desk learned back as well okay so yeah
so that's they're up so you know they're
up gives me a platform to develop things
as fast as possible push it to
production as fast as possible fix all
the code in production as fast as
possible and then what thing what is
what is driving all this to get better
customer feedback better customer
experience you know now now since Mobile
is the future
you don't expect things to push to
production probably a year from now
right you see Apple they keep releasing
new version of their OS you know every
other month imagine that in the in the
past you know even those comes up with a
version then it will take probably four
or five years to come with a new version
of voice that is not applicable going
forward yeah so that's the baseline for
you all you all you guys in on DevOps oh
it's what in some way and I would really
advise people you know start you know so
they obviously it's not like one
language to pick up you know it's like a
culture you try to understand what is
DevOps you try to pick up one two tools
in your Reno area like if you're a
developer you prick you want to told if
you're the QA you pick one to two
and try to understand the old aspect of
the office I know it's a support for a
programmer I would say that you know if
you really want to start getting the of
you know they would say start start
understanding the concept start picking
up onto tools yeah yeah you just break
it down and keep it as simple as
possible okay great so large you want me
to share the strategy things which you
have so let me share my screen and so so
that's that's the basic rights in fact
we can also talk about these tools Lodge
which I which always shining now and I
guess I'm sharing it okay just hold on
it's ready fire so yes I'm shutting it
on the on on YouTube now everyone can
see this and you can elaborate on this
if you if you want sure we know so no I
mean what I have done instant you know I
created you know there are just a lot of
information online on day off so you
know so I applied you know cut cut
through it and put something so that in
people who are fresh out to DevOps then
you just refer this slide and if they
want to pick up one to two lingo they
can just go through this line and just
start working on each of those two sure
right so so low mean you know if we if
we go down you know before that I just
want to show them that and this image I
don't know if there is a way to blow it
up can you is this fee yeah if I can
expand it yeah in fact this is the
maximum I can stretch it amongst okay is
it visible I hope yeah I think we can
read it can other guys see I can scroll
right I can store
what's that yeah so here's lunch okay
okay so you know I'm so I got the slide
from one of the presentation out there
online and I thought it was a good good
interpretation of the old a option right
now within the Java environment
I also shared the link up for the demo
on this line so you can definitely go
through it on your free time you know
that guy talks about talks about the old
project probably gives you a live demo
of the whole process of it ended day off
so using all of this tool so what
exactly if this so let me know okay so
you know DevOps done a couple of concept
which you need to understand in their
offs I know the main concept is change
management okay what is change
management change management is that you
keep track of everything which goes into
production you know every small things
which goes into production and the tool
which you use right now the more you
know different will being used by all
over the company's jia jia a cell there
is a company called alt asean they are
bunch of bunch of tools out there but
this is one of the important tools what
it does is you know JIRA is basically
you get requirement from business you
put that as a request in JIRA and all
your development starts from geo you
know you didn't associate your get up
everything progeria and you know so it
starts from JIRA it ends from 0 ok so
the first pipeline which is their
pipeline you know so there so get up as
everybody's familiar with get up right
there was we doing guys right so get up
is basically whether you it said it said
the best repository so you're gay
Persian you know you put all your code
out there okay and so so you so you know
I'm just gonna walk you through a quick
they're on their own developer process
what happens in their whole business
open certificate in Geelong so you go
through JIRA you prioritize based on
what is needed as of now you start
working on one request and jairam you're
the moment you pull pull that request in
JIRA it gets tied up to your guitar
proportionally okay you pull of a
repulsion of your keep tap code though
you pull the court on later you start
the looping cone the moment you change
the standards are for your code in jesus
saying that it's done it gets
continuously integrated okay just
remember this dumb CI it's get
continually con you know continuously
integrated using Jenkins okay and then
you know within Jenkins they know that a
couple of tools being used many when it
will build your maven is basically used
to build all your java application you
know it will build each our file all the
build code is being developed using
maven and then J unit is you know it's
basically automated tool to do all your
unit testing and then sonar QP now I'm
not familiar with this tool but you know
it's again the automated tool to do
quality check on your code okay in fact
most of the companies are doing this
right right so static code check is
basically you know you you just review
your code without actually running the
process
so what you are trying to do with this
old devil moralist you know try to they
are doing a shift left approach what a
shift left you know earlier we used to
wait till QA guys come in to do that
testing even and you know for unit
testing but now they are putting the
emphasize more on the developer you know
try to get as much as tested before it
goes to QA or before it goes to
production you know so that's when you
see so much emphasis in dev pipeline for
testing okay you have J you need yes on
our car okay and then Tom Carter since
it's a job is application day it we have
supplied to Tom Kahn and then selenium
is again another tool to do all the
functional testing and then there is
another performance testing you know
performance testing used to never happen
in dev in the old world but now see the
importance they are giving to
performance testing so once everything
is tested it's good to go
it gets deployed to it you know
automatically deployed using Jenkins to
a QA pipeline so what is Q a pipeline is
basically you know you are moving from
their mode took you a mode where you
know your QA testing you a key
everything will be done before it gets
to production so this whole pipeline
right it shows you what all different
tools are being used within each of the
face and right now and the old flow
before it goes to production okay so
QA by planta and we have yeah okay so
the key is you know for devops you know
you build your infrastructure
automatically you know everything the
queue you know your dev environment is
built automatically your QA environment
is built automatically your push to you
it you eighty or the only way the
environment is below romantically you
know all configuration are all you know
scripted within the tools you know main
tool to of the mean tool socket Jenkins
and Gator rest of the tools are either
for testing it or creating the
infrastructure behind this thing so the
key is automation okay everything has to
be automated you know and you know yes
it's like this is a great slide to
understand the entire pipeline here like
I've seen this ignition for the first
time I can recall out everything all the
tall the things which I have learnt
about DevOps great that looks like so
that's with a gate point yes we also
have a tableau a sphere which is for
deployment and then docker image here so
a lot of things available here so what
they are saying you know that all this
is being done on the fly okay at the
moment the continuous deployment that's
so what does continuous deployment means
you know you're pushing the code to
production with you know continuously
without taking a specific down you know
downtime or you know going to change it
you know it's being pushed up production
and once you push the production that is
a ticket management system by operation
for any production related issue in
again goes back to day of pipeline okay
okay great
so with those think all those things in
mind focus on you again Raj you don't
have to eat so it can you just lean back
Raj because we can't see you properly
for lacing you're there okay great so
with those things we can pick up the
questions now because everyone know the
basics of DevOps so they have seen the
entire pipeline here which is with an
also introduction so let's take a
question now Raj in fact let me ask you
questions let's make it more
you type of questions yeah so we have
these questions on the on the form which
is submitted by the people and let's
show you the first question so I'll set
watch
so here okay so first question is
difference between build and release
engineer and they end the ops so I know
those are all branding by a child okay
but technically I'm neighborhood sir you
know maybe you're maybe in core systems
they might be having all those role but
the main difference is you know the bill
geist Building Code and the release guys
is to responsible to push it to
production and manage the old illness
with respect to you know the
functionality if it is meeting what was
the exact requirement so the bill kind
does not even need to know the
acquirement and we will just make sure
the code is built it's been tested and
spin it's been ready to be deployed and
the release guys or the release engineer
but you know in the real organization
those both role fall on that same person
okay building genuine to unless engineer
just a marketing strategy may be correct
okay great
okay so before going for the next
question this is why everyone if you'd
really enjoy peace of obsessions do let
us know by thing comes like button
because you know I cannot see because I
have seen many people I mean most people
watching test but then I can see less
likes so if you enjoyed some obsessions
looking right button
that's what motivate us that's what that
will motivate me and Raja to answer all
your questions so make sure that you
like that button and you can still
course submit your questions on the
Google the YouTube chat all the forum ok
so first of all they are finishing it
with this forum so let's go for the next
question Raj and the question is okay so
the question is is divorce is really
needed or only frameworks is sufficient
you know
answer that question it's Apple sign all
and you know their offices more of a
culture free framework case he was by
developer right but their offices bigger
than that you know their web says the
internal organization they off so the
when you say framework whoever is asking
this question does he meant by you know
DP is or the framework used by a
programming language
so yes frameworks is sufficient
framework is going to be be used for the
developer but day off is a methodology
you playmon within your software
development process to get things out to
production as fast as possible and to
get fixes to production as fast as
possible okay great so let's jump to the
next question again the people are
asking where to ask questions again you
can use a chat window in the YouTube or
the forum okay so first of all we are
finishing with the forum because I've
submitted the forum on Wednesday okay so
you had four to three to four days to
submit your questions so let's try to
finish those questions first and then we
move towards the YouTube questions all
right so let's go for the next question
for you again is the question okay so
which question you want me to pick we
can go with the next question right I
say fresher okay okay okay
so the question is as a pressure how can
I start learning the ops it's a way to
learn and to get a job I mean the
syllabus and the procedure and the
intake of pressures as they were VL
opposing the company specialized about
so you want to know about the steps to
be are they what I mean to do get into
divorce right so a couple of things
which you you really need to know I know
first is you know you need to be a
developer what that means is that you
need to know a programming language you
need to be comfortable working in UNIX
or Linux OS so you know Windows is also
there but Linux and UNIX are the two men
was being used to
smaller looking so I said programming
language pick any of the programming
language and Java is the best the reason
being that you know it gives you the
flat phone to understand any new
technology or any new long languages in
future and then you know you need to be
comfortable with one of the scripting
languages the reason why I'm emphasizing
on they're often not on the tool is that
you know at the end you know tools you
can learn you know it's just a matter of
a couple of session you can understand
your functionality of tool but we end
the scene you know their office requires
lot of automation and you need to know
some programming language or some
scripting language to write those
automation if if we wanna start doesn't
die offs engineer write in a scripting
language could be you know you could
pick pick on Python if you're on Windows
you can use PowerShell for Linux or UNIX
again your shell or a shell script in
your bash with backflipping okay so
those four descripting skills with
respect to tools I would say understand
JIRA understand janking right and then
understand gate and get up
just make sure these three tools you're
comfortable or you know the basing of
these three tools and then the rest you
know then dress that is a bunch of tool
for infrastructure configuration bunch
of tool for testing right but this three
will be the core of every day off mode
yeah so so what I understood is just you
have to make sure that to get into
develop you have to learn gen kids get
and using a machine kit and get up and
depend upon technology it might change
so example for Java we have also we also
AM Evan we have Tomcat dependable
technology it will change oh it's right
right
but yeah they call the end and the end
it is enough comfortable with one of the
programming scale a programming language
and comfortable with one of the
scripting scale language
again just can you just pull yarders my
team this one at the camera down yeah
okay yeah that's fine
okay great so let's go for the next
question Raj you have so many questions
to answer
okay okay what's the time there now Taj
is it 6 a.m. it's 6:20 year 6 1980 so we
are spoiling your Sunday morning that's
ok ok mister should we pick next
question that happened of question we
put your name now Amy no I mean those
are more of programming like how to
remember algorithms I will be answering
this question of video so the question
is how to remember algorithms and I am
planning to make videos on data
structures and algorithms in next one or
two week so our answer that question in
the video itself how do you remember
algorithms ok next one is I want to
answer this question the question is
that know me know this one watch or this
one that is you can pick up large and
let me know ok
for the question I guess I can see how
so let's let's talk about the stats so
lots of people are watching this and
again let's number of likes today maybe
people are not people are not up on the
on the YouTube now I don't know where
are they okay so and you do also if you
have so many questions so by the time
you change you pick up those questions
rush I have let me just pick up some
questions on the YouTube as well and the
question is how to do my program with
what's that I don't understand you
so I don't know what your question alone
okay it says inaudible that's great
and what does you devops we have talked
about it I was getting a job where they
are draining on see a a peon tool Oh
any idea on eight CAPM truth c AP my
question I was looking at one question
where it says I'm actually a developer
and learning docker and say well gate
will master window up or it's it's
understanding day off functionality to
understand so yeah so I think if I
understand it correctly probably is
trying to say that is easy already a
developer trying to is learning and Oh
code and all this tool and now he wants
to know the day of functionality you
know so I would recommend that you know
that I'd like to book so what I would
say guess one book which you know every
every DevOps engineer should read it
it's called you know the book name I
also listed the book name on that deck
it's called Phoenix project it gives you
a real understanding you know basically
that books book is about you know about
a one-off a company which was so going
down and they implemented this old
DevOps and it gives you a real insight
of what and thing why the implement in
the ops and what happened after
implementing the house so I would highly
recommend read that book yeah forgot the
author name but the title is Phoenix
project okay yeah Phoenix project right
yes yeah so this comes
to that question where this is that is
understanding their functionality better
yeah you know it's good to know why
you're doing it right you know it will
definitely help you for in your
interview right you know tools are fine
but people will ask more of a particular
function question and want what why you
introduce the herbs right you could have
come from various background right you
were in waterfall model you went to
agile and now you want to be in the ops
or your organization needed you know it
could it could drive down to you know
survival as well to to be fairly honest
there in the in the new world the wave
features are being isn't what expected
from all this IT companies great okay so
I got a question from you or for you Raj
and this question is I'm picking this
question from YouTube and the question
is what is the scope just go between
between or by the well-known suan dok or
covenants or covenant is also Q but you
know in a few buttons it came out of
Google and I know that those guys are
using it heavily but docker is you know
industry standard people are really
using docker container for 400 so I
would say you know if you really want to
start I would say just pick up docker
for now understand now the controller
ization virtualization gets done through
docker there are a lot of good tutorials
on youtube so i would recommend order
for now okay right so before going for
combat is of docker will be a good
option okay great yeah so you can pick
up
question Raj from here from YouTube drag
the sorry I'm switching time in fact you
can pick up from here as well on the
deforms oh ok so one question see what
is the impact of job developer after
launch so Naveen I will do so let me
answer that question till the fight by
the time you you get the next question
so the question is we ought to raise the
question what's it what is the impact of
a job offer after launching Java 9 in
fact it would be a huge thing you know
the thing is everyone blames job I don't
know why people hate Java especially
people who are new to industry now see
all the I mean all the people who are
working on you know working from last 10
20 years they all love Java because they
don't don't have a choice because every
technology may be mobile development a
Hadoop development all these big data
even big data we use Java there and now
thanks to pythons actually for languages
everyone says Java is going to die and
Java is not eating updated till we don't
have good features in Java but then we
got Java online now and Oracle promises
that they will launch the new version 4
I mean they would update Java every six
months so they have changed the way they
have changed the way jedikiah was that
they change the way Java works
thanks to modularity and so of course
Java will have lots of features and you
will start enjoying Java soon ok people
who love Java great it will be a good
front for them but people who don't like
Java for several reasons you will start
learning Java now back talk Java 9 in
the industry yes watch to you ok so then
next next question is from sunny 97 B
and G it says so want to know the
advantages of their offs with respect or
technical and business perspective so I
think we we talked about both point
earlier but you know I will reiterate
business perspective so you know it
drives down to customer experience
customer feedback right you know so how
soon you can get your code to production
also
you can fix things in production so
customer being one pillar of delay or
second s you know earlier model s you
know everybody used to work in silo
right you know developer used to work in
its own world operation is to work in a
different team but with this new
methodology everybody works as a team
you know and the end goal is to make
sure things go smooth production your
customer experience is the end goal make
sure that experience is maintained as
smooth as possible without much much
disruption okay next question is a
full-fledged want to become software
developer or engineer please don't say
code and code this is from soo bum you
know you know so um you know I I'm sorry
to say that but you know yeah it's it's
the language you really need to be a
good coder to be a good developer a good
development to be a good engineer right
yeah so yeah you need to be comfortable
with at least one of the programming
language of that you start from there
you know you start developing coders you
start starting as you started your
career you will pick all this tool you
know in once you start working for the
corporate if you have like unread or you
know and it's off tool being used but
it's all you will you will learn that on
job you know but to get to a job you
really need to understand the old
programming you know the old thing
behind the programming language like you
know you need to be good in algorithm
you need to be good in language you knew
you know functional functional skills
are also there but it's not required
right you know if you can understand
algorithms I think it's good good start
so just to add that to that point photo
ROG so of course when you say you want
to be a good engineer there's so many
things but then again coding you cannot
skip that you know you cannot go away
from coding right so that's why I draw
is the right nation to be a good
engineer I should be able to Aleppo and
took a good elevation if you should be a
bit coder and that you need to work with
multiple tools as he mentioned but again
those tools you will learn once you
start so once you join a company
and depend upon your company because
every company have a different tool to
work so if I say tool X is better maybe
the company which you joined will be
using tool Y so we cannot say to Lexus
better it's all depend upon the company
requirement they have a different
contract with Inter consultancy so so
the tools will be we will be using and
you'll be learning on on the go but the
most important thing is start the base
data structures database concepts one
programming language you don't have to
be you don't have to learn ten languages
okay one language is enough but make
sure that you are good in that so there
just to add the point to the a to Raj
there the next question is we need to
learn junk in software or it's a flat
form to learn it's a software or it's a
doula from Ellison huh so there are
couple of first artist starter videos on
V YouTube so yeah I would recommend to
to to just get an understanding of that
to like it was a big platform you can
not ever think that there's no any
variable that you need to get to the
right video next question is currently
I'm working in M and C as I beam get my
switching company unit and I let me get
out the question okay so how currently
I'm working in MNC as I used to focus on
my yeah so I'm currently working in MNC
as a IBM and Q administrator having two
years of IT experience my question is
while switching company can I tell that
I have worked on Java will it be
acceptable as I'm now learning Java okay
so see when you go for the is what you
want to answer this no mean my don't you
yeah definitely yeah you know I I mean
yes and no right you know the moment you
say yes you need to you know they will
start asking a question on your projects
right so you have to be comfortable in
comfortable in explaining all those
things right but if you say no and you
go as a fresher then they know that you
are a fresher then they will ask more of
ramming skills so so yeah it's up to you
guys you know or do you want to put it
on your resume I would say that you know
if if you really worked on it put it if
you are not worked on it don't put it
you know yeah just try to be as clean as
possible right you know people
understand you know not everybody comes
with ten years or 20 years of experience
right if they need a fresher they will
definitely take you up right but but but
you can definitely say that okay though
that you you know there are two question
to that right the next part is you know
after learning Java can I put them off
stool yes you can definitely say that
you know you learn the stool then you
understand toast rule it will be a good
good added thing yes okay great and so
as the arch mentioned if you have
already worked on that then you can put
what you put if you if you are putting
that you are the one tell Jo Dilip or
they will ask you about the position
tell and trust me the questions will say
they will ask and if you cannot answer
they will know that you have not work on
the project interiors are waste Martin
nowadays and not nowadays the apps but
that's what from the start right okay so
now I guess we can pick up question from
YouTube as well yeah so let me pick up
one just to help you there okay the
question the question the question
question is how to get how to get DevOps
opportunity how do you get the
opportunity in abroad so this is
specifically for you Raj since you are
in u.s. now so you can also do how to
get the opportunity in u.s. or in
everybody anywhere okay off support
Rankine approach you know so I will love
you know let's forget that abroad thing
you know it's everything is you know it
doesn't matter where you're right you
know how do you get into a day off right
so so the way I would recommend now is
you know I think I already might have to
be repeated repeating myself try to be a
good developer pick a couple of tools
right
I mean I can't hear you no be not using
something you can give me that yeah okay
yeah that YouTube like or Google I buy
something so I'm saying that you know
our strengths just be a good developer
pick up a bunch of tool which is needed
for developer be comfortable with gate
and get up okay that's like you need to
know it be ID you know it's being used
everywhere so yeah it taken comes back
to you know being a good developer
picking up a bunch of tool and then you
know start applying for draw for photos
portion okay great so next question
which one is fine okay so okay so
they're I think they're talking about
themselves be people to chat okay what
are some of the do okay so tools so they
again the question is for to have the
engines they are discuss about tools
right watch
yeah yeah I have listed all those tools
you know so now the key is you know just
pick up couple of tools start exploring
those tool you know you send it to or
the deck somewhere current yeah yes so I
prepared a trip I put it on the Google
sheet so what I will do I will take that
and put it on his client and I will send
it to you after this session sure I'll
be showing that on on so I'm saying that
on the Facebook group because that's
where we have so many people so that you
can you can get the access to this sheet
and the Facebook routes so if you're not
on the case to make sure that you join
it just go to Facebook and search for
telesco this the types of group and make
sure that you join in so that you will
get the updates so we'll change that
link there okay so for you next question
okay so yeah you going on YouTube
like chat right now yes
yes okay so question next question is
from abyss shake and the question is
Gina is for each to resolving is it Gina
is for if you dissolving as well as for
you know starting any requirement right
how do you put then you recover the
moment you get a new requirement you
create a whole whole thing in JIRA and
you track it through zero right now
nowadays you know business so in Atlas
in our our company we have given that
feature available to businesses so if
they have any requirement they have to
first log that true Jill and then it
drives down everything after that okay
so next one next one next one okay the
same question about the dog-cart and
Coburn it is we obviously have discussed
the next one is oh now this is this is
this is awesome question so it is a
ambiguous question so question is how do
you know you are producing a quality
code okay
so how do you know that you're working
on a good Accord accordance do we have a
very tested in demos right there are
like a bunch of processors which has
been introduced in their pipeline to
make sure you're trying to catch the
book as early as possible right yes that
agree the jjwi testing your functional
testing and your performance testing oh
so so that doesn't mean that your code
is you know you know if the things are
working does not means that your code is
quality but I think static review will
be able to determine if you are meeting
all the standards set by your employer
or your team as part of the development
right they know they will give you the
whole framework like okay we expect this
to be in this model or this coding or
this comment and all those part so yeah
static static review will definitely
catch all the quality of your code
okay great so so there are so that as I
mentioned have some tools available
right in like these we also have so not
cube then we can also do testing using a
selenium so they have all those tools to
take your code quality right drink or
maybe a pair programming so you can talk
to your friends or you can talk to your
colleague and ask him to see your code
and they will help you to you know
sometimes we don't find our own mistakes
but people other people they will find
our mistakes very easily so that's how
you check the code quality right that's
what I do I show my code to my my
colleagues and then they say okay this
this is not good this is not good so
that's how I work
great okay now okay so this is again for
the question on so for different country
again so the question Raj is this
compliment says so I got a job offer
from Sweden and it's it's it's fine to
accept that if they are asking me to
sign a four year bond and I think no
ship I'm not sure if I won't answer that
question in it okay so just to be
diplomatic here promote other thing is
different country has a different way of
working I'm in India I know about
Indians working at Rajas in the US now
he knows about us working but we don't
we both are not sure about Sweden how
they work there and it's also about the
company some companies are good some
ponies are not that good when he says
bond they will give you any job which
you have to work on one of the example
you know some people they get into
company and company promises that they
will you will get a job of a jeweler or
the engineer but they put them into a
support job mister would like just I'm
not saying support is not a good job but
then if you don't like it and if you if
you if they put you in that zone then
you don't have a choice you are signing
up bond of four years alright so think
about it talk to your company talk to
other people who are working in that
company if you have some friends there
talk to them so that's that's how you do
it right why don't you just talk to the
employer right and why do you want to
get into pound you know to be honest if
I were you I would never do in
get into this signing the bond and all
those right you know ID is such a
fast-moving world where things are
changing every other minute right you
don't want to be stuck with four year if
you don't like you ask them like right
yeah
so that's a good option you know talk to
your employer bond is like of course not
a good thing to be signed to be signing
in fact four years is a very big very
big time great okay what's next
okay now question come again Abbey shake
and the question is can I practice
Jenkins at home how do you how do you
practice Jenkins at home because it's a
just retool like I try to so I think so
Jen keen is owned by a company called
Alison and I think they provide you a
free version or twere limited a free
trial version you can definitely use
that and you can have your own pipeline
now build okay so they get I do give you
the free version right you can try it
out correct correct
great and someone is complimenting you
that you're handsome that's great okay
next person from responsible I mean
which programming language to learn
before I becomes all fitted upper all
engineer is it C C++ really needed or
need to learn some nothing more so to be
$1 per engineer should we learn C++ or
something more that's the question ROG
yeah I would just work for Java right
you know because that's been my my
programming language yeah but you know
if you really want to understand I think
I mean I don't know if you agree but I
think C seeing gives you the old you
know it will open up your whole world
right I mean the whole programming
language and everything else yeah so I
would say C yeah but then it's very
personable personal question right you
know okay great so just to update you
with so again just to add to that
in fact I get this question a lot when I
go for training because most of the
people they are company are they're
coming from non-native background and
they do have this question you know is
it okay to be with C C++ or should we go
with Java or some other languages so I
would say you know start with start with
C or start with C++ so that's that's so
that's a base that's a base thing
because it will give you foundation you
know C and C++ also called as mother of
all the languages so if you know C and
C++ it is good to go with I mean if you
want to switch to C plus C sharp or Java
in future go for it so that would that
will be helpful and otherwise you can
also learn Python because fighting is
everywhere now it's what you say it's of
a general purpose language now you can
use Python everywhere for mobile
applications for is it a good choice to
go for mobile that's not the case but
then begins so you think Python you can
learn you can do anything so you have
try that oh but yeah doesn't done see
you in C this was first and then jump to
Java because again Java is used
everywhere so you can try it so again
that's a personal choice as well as
mentioned yes watch and let's go for so
let's spend two more minutes and let's
take one more question and then you can
have we can have a closing session for
this so you know so many questions right
yeah yeah I liked all share masks ocean
I own it that's not should I go for okay
so I was getting bored without sure why
this is not yard or do you say a
favorite topics to be which we are
discussing here okay so as I mentioned
in the title itself the topic is DevOps
is not about something fancy it's more
specifically industry standard so of
course you are getting bored
maybe next Sunday we will have a topic
which love which you love let me know
the chat window which you love we will
talk about hacking next time so okay so
let's pick up one more question and then
we are good to go
and this question again repeated
question but then we can talk about this
we call so I guess you have answer this
but yeah we can take it out large and
the question is from Shri Chaudhary a
question is which field is best
soft-eyed allotment or testing see ya so
with so bit day ups
everything is gonna be one one one right
you know you need to be good developer
you also need to understand the basic of
testing right they know they're gone are
the days when you could not be working
as purely tester
I mean tester tester dog will still be
around but I'm saying that now things
are going so fast they expect developer
to be a better tester yeah so developer
is always going to be there you know if
you have the stink kills it's it's added
advantage okay so now you have to learn
both then you need to be a pretty engine
you have to be a good caliper a tester
of your own code first right that's
great so great we have answered so many
questions I know we will be not able to
answer all the questions here because
that's not right really possible so next
week as well we'll be doing a live
session with some other topic today we
have talked about the orbs and I hope we
have answered lots of your question yeah
now the thing is if you have more
questions maybe next time we'll talk
about something else again I'll be
making a Google Form and you can ask
your question there now how do you get
how do you get the questions how will
you get the form again it will be
uploaded so the link will be available
on Facebook maybe on the the Facebook
page and all the Facebook group so you
can you can like or you can join the
group your choice and yeah so that's
about the update and now Raj anything
motivation from your side if you want to
so let's say if you have a pressure in
front of you and then you want to
motivate them or you want to give your
tips of flowers working in industry from
last how many I don't know forward
number of years you are walking in the
Sheena yeah almost 15 years no yeah
Oh 15 years okay that's a very big
number so so any any feedback or any any
tips for the subscriber here it's before
the session I would say you know be a
good core
understand the you know so you know let
me just fix it on Java i no understand
core java has no in keep stressing on it
you know you need to understand the
basic of languages right you know being
good in languages being good in
algorithms you know those are the two
main things and as you understood as
you're comfortable with those two things
you know it's easy to get into and
understand all rest of the tool ancho
you know you will get you know enough
opportunity to learn on job you know
that's the new model people and player
organizations are implementing you know
they want to first pick up a good
developer they will make you go through
we know lot of strenuous process right
the interview processes nowadays are
getting sort of foreign tougher they
expect you to you know know so much
things but then you know everything
drives down to how good your programming
skills are how cold your concepts are if
those two things are solid I don't think
that is any issue in getting into a
developer or engineer job okay great and
I hope that you enjoyed today's session
answering all those questions I don't
know how you felt but then we really
enjoyed all this topic and I have
learned something about the option okay
I was knowing about something about the
walks but then so then that image was
very very helpful for me and should ask
some of the questions on the subscriber
