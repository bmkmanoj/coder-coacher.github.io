today's live session is is how to be a
Android programmer you know what happens
when you complete your graduation when
you complete your masters let's say
you're doing diplom diploma you want to
do something in your life right of
course when you're when you're
completing your IT degree maybe you like
programming you like testing or any
other field so let's say if you love
programming then what next what are the
other option you have there are lots of
options available right if you love
programming you can go for open-source
programming you can go for what you can
go for closed proprietary software and
and all those stuff right so then what
to choose I mean people will choose open
source thing maybe people will choose
proprietary thing so if you're choosing
open source there lots of again there
lots of options right you can go for
Python you can go for Java you can go
for Android now why to go for Android
then you know world is changing
initially it was Java which was in boom
and now it's mobile market right if we
talk about mobile if we talk about
computer now people use mobile devices
at their computer like you said my
screen a bit it's not properly
okay so I'm not using my additional
tripod here I'm just using a mini tripod
I don't know if it is working or not
properly okay so so being Android
developers you know if we talk about the
computer so nowadays a mobile phone
becomes a computer right so if you if
you have a good mobile phone of course
you have a computer right you can type
an email you can or you can play games
you know initially people used to buy
laptops to play games right now
they use their phones I mean they use
their they use their phones to do
everything stuff all this stuff like
they play games they type email and all
the stuff so computer you know mobile
phone is a new computer now so if you
talk about mobile mobile market eighty
three percent of mobile market is
captured by Android right so if you are
an Android developer you're actually
targeting huge amount of people so what
you can do is you can you can learn
Android programming I mean it's not that
difficult it's very easy right as Hajus
ready saying here it's damn easy right
so being an Android developer is damn
easy it's just that some people find it
easy some people find it difficult
because they don't know how to start
with it right they I'm not saying it's a
rocket science you have to I mean you
have to follow some steps and all the
stuff it is it's just you have to follow
some steps some little little steps to
be a good Android developer and if you
if you just open a you know if you open
the Play Store in your mobile phone in
Android so there are billions of apps
right there are lots of apps the thing
is all these apps are created by
programmers right of course I know
developers some apps are famous some are
not famous
to make an act famous we don't need a
good programmer to make an app famous we
need a good idea right example if we
talk about Angry Birds it's a game right
there are lots of games which is better
than angry angry bird which has more it
more fun to play but Angry Birds was
having a good concept right where you
have Angry Birds and then we have pigs
and bugs attacking pigs and in fact we
have a movie now on that I guessing in
next year we'll be having a movie which
is on Angry Birds the thing is the first
thing we require is idea right you your
idea should be perfect so if you're
making a I know applique
you need a good idea with you again you
can make a torch in fact if you if you
search for different applications
maximum apps you will find on an Play
Store is for torch right maybe some 3d
torch some colorful torch I don't know
different types of torch I will label
right so you need a good idea to make an
app so let's say you got an idea now
what next now you need to build that
idea in a very efficient way so when you
say you want to build in a very
efficient way that means you have to
follow some guidelines you have to
follow some design patterns you need to
follow some UI label you have to make
your app very very very easy to easy to
use example no one has taught you how to
use whatsapp light you learnt what sir
by yourself so you when you make an
application make sure your your your you
know your the users will like it they
will they will find it very easy to use
so make sure you make an application
which is very easy to use so designing
an app is not just about interfaces is
also about the experience user gets from
your application example if you open
apps like Amazon you know you will
navigate here and there you enjoy those
products and all the stuff in fact I
feel flipkart app is much better than
Amazon app right you get lots of options
there so you have to provide that
experience to your user right so now you
know you you have you need to get an
idea a good idea I can you can have
multiple ideas with you you can make it
on the calculator you can build a torch
but those are ways small applications
right you can think about something big
so you can make you can have a big idea
maybe a smaller idea doesn't matter it
should be unique the next thing we
require is is the design patterns you I
think so those are things we require now
what next let's say you have a good
designing with you now you have designed
everything on a paper so you took a
paper and design the concept you want
you have so you got the paper you have
designed everything now what next can
you can you design an app on a paper and
you can upload it on Play Store of
course not right you have to make that
app and for that you need to use some
ideas of course you can you'll be using
Android studio for that so initially if
I
in two years back if you want to me if
you want to be an Android other / of
course you will be using Eclipse right
but now we use Android studio so you
need under studio and now how to use
Android studio how to make an app now
it's not that it's not that easy just
you will drag those components and you
will make the app light you have to you
have to code right because designing an
app is easy you can just do drag and
drop all those stuff I'm not saying I
bring everything in designing is easy
but most of them is easy right you can
do it just drag and drop there are some
designing where you need some specific
coding you need some styling all those
stuff but designing is very easy problem
starts when you want to develop it right
you have to you need to learn a
programming language for that so one of
the best programming language to learn
for Android is in fact you have the one
you have only one choice now which is
Java so Java is not the only option to
work with but if we talk about native
API so in Android we have two things one
is a native apps and then hybrid apps so
if you you can also build an Android app
using JavaScript so if you are if you
are good with JavaScript you can
actually build an app right so you can
build an app using javascript or but it
will work on different frameworks
example you might you have to use for
PhoneGap maybe ionic framework so using
ionic framework you can make an android
app not just Android app you can if you
make an app using ionic free ion extreme
work it will work on any platform I mean
you can make a a p' okay using ionic
framework which will work on Android
which will work on Windows and it will
also work on iOS it doesn't matter which
OS you use it will work on everything
it's because you are using a JavaScript
based application you're not building a
which is a platform dependent
application but if you build a native
applications example if you want to use
the GPS if you want to use if you want
to you know specialize some features in
your application you need to build
native apps and for that of course the
only option you have is Java
okay so you should be very thorough with
kochava concepts I'm not saying you have
to learn about advanced parts of the J's
the other stuff not mean we don't need
that what we need is Java coding basic
code job I know if we talked about for
loop while loop all those stuff
exception handling threads for you know
small amount of threads you can also you
should also learn collections those are
those those things are important in fact
you can actually go to my playlist we
cannot actually go to my channel you can
find a page is there for Java you can
watch till threads if you know the
concept till threats that's okay you're
perfect I know you can not like this
start with Android now because what is
Android it is basically take Java and
XML mix it up you will get Android white
so it's not it's not that difficult so
you need to also learn XML okay if you
go to my channel again there is there is
a there is a playlist for XML of only I
guess two two three three videos watch
those XML videos watch Java videos and
you're good to go
then you can watch my playlist on
Android you can just watch one by one I
guess I have uploaded around 29 videos
if I'm not wrong so if you watch that
you can actually build a small
application I'm not saying I have done
everything in that you can actually make
a small application I'm just trying to
build more more videos on that so that
you will make an Android application
okay now what next so let's say you have
you have taught and taught about a
concept you can make you can you have an
idea with you
you've got the designing part of it on
the paper now you have learned XML and
Java you can learn HTML and java then
that's done what next now building an
application it's also about I mean do
you building is done right you have made
everything now the next step is you have
to deploy that app on Play Store for
deploying that app on Play Store you
have to create a developer account on
Google for that you have to pay one time
in that's not one-time investment on
Google you have to pay $25 okay which
comes out to be in Indian rupees you
have to multiply 25 into 65 or 66 I
don't know the current current rate and
then you have to just pay 25 dollars
that
and you're good to go you can deploy
your app on Play Store Google will take
at least I guess they say 40 48 asked to
verify your app but I guess in two to
three hours your app will be deployed
and once it is deploy you can share with
your friends then why to make Android
apps again later your question now
you're not joining a company now so you
are into first year second year of your
your-your-your degree now why to build
angel application is just because we all
need fame right you want to be famous
think about for what's our founder John
calm he's very famous right he's rich
plus he's famous so he can be you can
you can get that fame if you build an
app and your application you know just
making it make the app deploy don't
place to tell your friends that I have
an app there and you're good to go
right it's just I'm getting some since
I'm talking about what's up I'm getting
some message on whatsapp actually I'm
using my phone to record this video I
can see those chat window there okay so
see some I've got two messages one out
one of them is wrong Janardan ready oh
I'm getting lots of South Indian friends
here so I got shoddy sturdy I got
Jonathan Jonathan Wendy that's that's
awesome
which is not the natural film has a
birth
okay that's good anyway so you have to
deploy your app on Play Store so you can
everyone can see your app they can you
know they can actually download it they
can use it so you will get confidence
you will get Fame and you can also earn
right if you if you just put ads in your
in your app and people if people are
clicking on your ads you can actually
earn right so that's a good thing
yeah hi aliens just see skillet skeleton
yeah hello aliens so you can actually
well you can actually deploy the app you
can act you can earn you can get famous
and all the stuff but most important
thing is you will get a confidence you
know when you when you when you when
you're doing some course and if you are
making some actual apps you are doing
something in your life okay so make sure
you make the app deploy it on the Play
Store okay because if we talk about
other fields let's say if your friend is
from physics if your friend is from
chemistry they need a lab to do some
experiments right but what for you for
IT professionals we just be the laptop
and that's your lab right use a laptop
do whatever you want and you're good to
go right so so that's how you can be an
Android developer in fact I am there you
can ask me question on if you if you're
stuck somewhere I have my channel you
can just post your hammer placed on
Android you can just post your doubts in
the comment section or you can just
personally message me I'm there on
Facebook you can connect me on Facebook
also right so if you have any doubts on
that about Android you can actually come
in there so yeah that's how you can be I
know developer so now it's time for some
questions okay so so let's show you the
first question since this is also a QA
session right okay so let's start with
the first one it is from Jonathan Wendy
you are great at Java how to learn Java
like you okay but that's that's good
I'm going to beat Java okay I know that
how to be a good programmer like me good
question for that you know in fact I
have have told this in my earlier videos
before that if you like this if you have
if you liked this video if you if you
like this streaming I guess this is the
first time I'm not facing any lag in
doing live streaming because I'm doing
it mad at my home and I love my home
internet connectivity so if you like
this video just there is a like button
there click on the like button so that I
will know that you like this video okay
so that I will make more of both of this
videos otherwise I I think I have to
search for some other other way of
communicating it not life but offline
stuff for so anyway yeah so how to be a
good programmer so what how I became so
good at programming and not dad good but
somewhere language so you know when I
was in my college in my BSC idea is to
participate in lots of competitions let
me show you something let me show you
something you know since I'm talking
about my competition so I used to I used
to participate in lots of competitions
and let me show you something I hope
everything will good you see that okay
so those are my prize is you know sigh
when I when I when I was my BSC IT so I
used to participate in lots of
competitions so the the advantage is I
used to win prizes that's not the big
issue but the thing is since I used to
get prizes I used to practice a lot
because not every college not every
event I used to participate I used to
win right so there were there was some
events where I used to win there was
some events I was I was I was not
winning right so I used to practice a
lot you know I used to stay I used to
stay up for 3 3 a.m. at the night and I
used to I used to do all those stuff I
used to practice C programming I used to
practice Java a lots of stuff you know
using YouTube to learn lots of things
using the different website should learn
lots of things and used to I used to
practice a lot and with that my
programming skills
improved and patently I used to make
applications
you know normally in colleges what
people do is they buy software so every
college they have to submit projects
right at the end of their graduation so
people used to buy people used to buy
Sophos there is to ask someone else to
build software's but I used to build
software for myself so I should do
everything from myself I used to build
my own softwares so when you build your
own software automatically your
programming skills improves ok so yeah
the dots have you can be a good
programmer like me and do practice
programming every day since I teach I
learned twice you know I'm teaching in
corporate I'm teaching online also take
classes so you know so I'm since I'm
teaching I learned a lot something lot
of things from there so that's your code
that's your answer Jonathan I hope you
are happy with that next question is
from Arjun hmm I'm looking forward for
your Android videos and make an app oh I
have my videos on Android you can just
go to the playlist you can go to your
channel and go to playlist page there
they will find an android android
playlist you can just watch those places
I have a plotter I guess let me check
how many videos I have uploaded there ok
again it should be around 29 videos if
I'm not wrong let me check
it's the
Android Android Android ways that yeah
so I have 21 videos okay I have to do
one because I enjoyed you can watch this
videos you can actually learn basics
from them they are the basics not the
extreme part the next is can you have a
video on WebSocket Oh deep this one the
pub sure the pug I will try to do that
WebSocket let me just note it down on my
laptop the next video I have to make is
on WebSockets okay was that just create
a new file WebSockets surely will do
that I will make a video on WebSocket a
deeper I will try to make it soon okay
next is it okay to learn different
object when programming the same time I
mean you're talking about the languages
right learning Java C sharp and all the
object of a programming and the answer
is yes you can learn different language
at the same time there is no harm in
that
oh it's just I would suggest first
complete one language because see the
problem is different languages has
different way of implementing it example
if we talk about C++ in C++ we don't
have multiple inheritance in Java we
have write so I will such as complete
one one programming language at one time
and then you can go for the second one
whether you can do it no there's no harm
in that but doing it in sequence will
will help you
okay next is it okay okay oh if you want
Arjuna let me share my playlist link in
the chat window that should help
oh I'm not allowed to do that I'm not
allowed to share the link on the chat
window that's that's rude I know this is
my chat I want to point it that
something there oh now I can I can I can
so here you see that I've shared the
link of Arjen you can just have a look
there
okay next question is from hey guys you
can actually ask questions if you are if
you're watching 18 people are watching
but it's other oh sorry sorry here for
sorry for that it's Aden I just read it
wrong yeah I got anyway so next question
is from watch strong Mohammed is it okay
to learn oh that was my moment okay so
the next question is from again Mohammed
is it flexible to learn to different oh
yes I have acid that right next one is
from Puneet will you also upload some
more videos on advanced java topics I'm
getting these questions a lot nowadays
of when you will upload advanced java
topics I do have advanced our topics the
only thing is you know there are lots of
videos available for advanced java
another kochava was something where i
can actually contribute advanced java is
full of this this is channel on youtube
called as java brains you know you can
just search for java brain sees from
Kaushik i'm a big fan of Kaushik so
search for java brains on youtube he has
advanced topics I guess yeah so you can
learn sublet JSP frameworks to
frameworks like spring hibernate all
those stuff so but still I will try to
make some topics because
okay
so I'm back sorry for that I just lost
the connection with my internet so I
guess I can seminar
yes I'm back okay sorry for that I was
just raised my internet connectivity and
then you can see that lag okay
just give me a sec guys
okay so everything is set up
okay awesome so now let's go for the
next question I don't know from a til
what point you got my stream I'm not
sure about that but
okay so this question is from a Surya
shall we expect bigger lightening video
in your future and the answer is no
because I don't know this bigger up
Surya I've never heard about bigger
learning ever so sorry for that we can
just die at least you can let me know in
the comment section what is bigger
actually means so 22 people are watching
that's great not 21 anyway next question
is from Mohammed how to be good at
Android studio you can be good at under
studio by making apps use Android studio
daily you know there are lots of tools
available under studio you can debug
your application you can you know you
can monitor your application all the
stuff so make start walking on under
studio okay as soon as you work more you
will get a lot of thing to know okay so
start using under studio make apps and
that's how you become good at honest you
okay next is from Eisner is it okay to
have a specialization in just another
development or okay that's a good
question should you stick to Android yes
if you love mobile development stick to
Android
the thing is in future we are talking
about IOT which is Internet of Things
right so everything at your home your TV
your fridge your AC your maybe air
cooler your your and everything in fact
this this is the mosquito jacket you
know so everything will be internet
enabled in future so so if you if you if
everything becomes Internet enabled so
we have to use some type of OS right so
maybe in your fridge you will be having
an OS and what is the best option for
embedded software embedded OS that will
be Android white so all these devices
will be based on Android I mean that's
the that's the that's the assumption we
can do so all these devices will be
working on Android so if you are an your
developer now in future you can build
apps for all this stuff okay so
that's one thing so stick to Android if
you if you don't like programming
Android programming then you can think
about or something else but if you like
programming specially Android stick to
it there's lots of scope in that okay
next is there is any video on regular
expression in your playlist button as of
now no I don't have any video on the
regular expression is just I am not that
comfortable with it okay so what we were
doing good we'll be doing it soon let me
just write it in my to-do list okay so
how it to do this to you just I will
just mention I have to make a video on
reg ax which is regular expression okay
what next so next question is from
Karthik I have an idea for a wonderful
app I want to develop on my own I am a
Hadoop developer I have a good put it on
Co Java but that's good Karthik you can
actually if you if you have if you have
an idea start them and a while you're
waiting if you're good at Co Java you
just need some some noise of XML and of
course you've been doing that right so
start making app start making the app
you can watch my playlist you can learn
Android there and make the app and once
it is developed share with me okay you
can just share with me on share the link
with me I will just download it I will
just check what is that okay next is
from Aaron again when you will be doing
live videos like some or the problem is
I cannot follow a particular schedule is
because you know I have my own sessions
I have some other work I will I will try
to do online sessions on Monday as well
on Sunday ok or maybe some day in the
week so Sunday is for sure example I
have did I did it last
last Sunday bit but the problem was with
the internet connectivity so I I deleted
those deleted that video so this video
will be uploaded soon ok once it is over
yeah so there's nobody was scheduled but
sunday is more preferable for me I guess
so Sunday I will I will let you know 2
to 3 hours back I will post on faith
just try to
we know join me on Facebook you can send
me a facebook request so you can search
for now in Wendy on Facebook send me a
friend request I will accept your
request and then as soon as I have a
live session I will update on Facebook
ok so you can at least you will know
that I am doing our live streaming ok
suggestions Karthik suggestions from my
side would be before building your idea
analyze what you want to build I'm in
visit I mean is it going beyond your
limit because it should be a compact
right there should not be it should not
expand the limit so build your limits
what you want to build specify the
boundaries then build small small
modules break down your project in small
parts and small build small products
example let's say if you want to build a
ecommerce application build a what you
say a part ok this shopping cart as one
project build online payment as one
project will take
showing the products to the user as one
project and later try to merge it owner
- with so if you are doing for the first
time do this ok it is very helpful
because if you try to build everything
from scratch at the same time if you
make you you will get some you will
stuck somewhere ok so that's the problem
so will small small small parts
okay next question is where can you
upload some tutorials for Android
annotation oh so you want Android
annotation yeah sure sure let me just
take it my in my to-do list it is
Android annotation if I can make this
video I will sure to do that because I
have not made any Android application
using annotations yet I guess you can
also use spring framework with Android
and that in that you actually use
annotations we'll try to do that
next is form can use okay you can see
now okay Puneet you said yes but I lost
your question what was your question
earlier
yeah so there so you say yeah okay yes
mama
it is Java brains rings yes I do I do
love Android apps that's great so stick
a shot ice now stick with stick with
Android okay there's a huge scope there
Karthik good effort keep going
thank you mate I will do that are you
basic requirements should an understood
your minimum RAM size I guess the moon
rises 2 GB you can run another studio on
2gb RAM but God will help you for the
hunter because running 2 GB I mean
having 2 GB of RAM for Android it's not
good ok it's not not good at least 4 GB
of 4 GB of RAM will be better I guess so
having a dual core machine not dual quad
having a 3 with 4 GB RAM will be basic
requirement I feel because the problem
is if you have a small if you have a
slow machine the problem would be when
you run the emulator ok it will take
lots of time to load which will waste
your time so as a developer we don't
want to waste our time right because we
have ideas you know in our mind we want
to make it work and if your image is
taking lots of time it may frustrate you
so make sure you have at least 4gb of
RAM I 3 machine that's a minimum ok if
you have Wi-Fi machines that will be
great I'm using a MacBook I am doing
android apps it still runs slow ok
because of emulators you can also use a
mobile phones that you may later let's
say if you have a low ram don't use
emulator use your mobile phones the
emulator so if you have an Android phone
connect an Android phone to the laptop
ok and there will be up up there will be
an option in your phone as the other
post option you can you can use that ok
and then you can actually make apps so
ho GB of RAM and I 3 machine next is
from Tech Master I am building a gaming
java however I'm not good at testing
process to test my methods as a build am
i would suggest use g-unit ok
we can also use test buses that not a
bad that's not the bad choice but I
would suggest junior it is well tested
unit case
go for there that will be good yeah
going to do is not enough you have to go
for i3 or I 5 in fact I'm using a i5
machine I'm using an iPhone machine with
8gb of RAM you know and that too it is
1600 megahertz not 1300 may cause it is
1600 megahertz and I'm using I fight
with SSD and still it runs low ok so for
Android studio go for 4 GB RAM and I
three ok next is from Raj is it
necessary to learn a similar language my
eye development no there's no composite
to learn SME language because I don't
know assembly ok still I make an elapsed
so that's ok how to learn data structure
and algorithm can you suggest any book
to learn these say our videos ok let me
check if I have a book there I have lots
of books in my shelf do have a book on
data structures yes I do have oh oh
that's hold on
oh can you see that yeah I do have a
book from this one connect good I don't
know if it's a good book because I have
not read it yet okay so this is the book
again you can use to learn data
structures but I don't believe in I
don't believe in Indian authors you can
actually use some foreign others book
but if you don't have a choice this is
one of the which is good because just
one connect cut is a good person and he
write a good app I mean you can do this
book that there's no harm in that
okay just shy okay so we are streaming
for 10 more minutes okay if we have a
question just comment it fast okay for
four videos so I don't have videos on it
or structures but there are the lots of
channel they provide good videos I don't
know I don't know the channel names you
can just join YouTube whatever pops up
first
what's that okay so just Jessie it says
thank you for all your hard work this
video is really helping me or that's
awesome if it is it is helping you
that's awesome you know that's why I'm
making even so in fact today I took a
session for 8 hours so I was teaching
Java for 8 hours and then I am taking
this online session because I like it ok
I like to talk to you people
ok other you want my facebook profile ok
that's weird
let me show you my profile in the
comment section
so that's so now just I have just
commented my facebook profile okay you
can just click on the link send me a
friend request okay so that when next
time I will distribute
let you know that would you recommend
any book 400 development it no I don't
recommend any book mine development the
problem is Android is changing every
month you know every month we are
getting something new so what you can do
is instead of buying a book you can
refer the online tutorials you can just
go to a Google search for development at
android.com that's an official website
for Android it is development
android.com
there are lots of resources available
there so if you want to learn something
read from there so I will suggest we use
the tutorial they're not d okay next
this is this is about the next version
is from ice now this is from this is
about internship if done what if if once
done in this startup should I go for
start up again or big companies I would
suggest to start up nowadays right
because you will you will learn a lot in
startups
the thing is in startup you everything
you have to do it by yourself so you
become a full stack developer you start
to end
designing development deployment
maintenance everything is you okay so I
will just go for starter but the only
thing is startup a startup company is
paying less than big companies but money
is not the issue for you go for shut ups
again there is one more risk there are
lots of startup they start and they shut
it down so your job is in to this but
but you know you can
it's your choice again but I would such
as go for start-up okay so neck last
question I guess this is the last
question for this session if you have
any more questions you can actually what
you can do you can come into the
comments section of this video once it
is once this video is uploaded on
YouTube make sure you comment okay if
you have any questions so that I will I
will try to cover in the next video
okay so I'm going for the last question
from Mohammed I want to be a mobile app
developer and I'm currently pursuing
diploma oh okay okay I show talking
about I should talking about internship
or go for shut up okay yeah done with
the startup right try-try big company
then there's no harm in that
try big company you have done we start
up right go home be company you will get
to experience then one working for
start-up one working for B company then
you can actually analyze in future okay
so now Mohammed I want to be a mobile
app developer and want to currently
pursue diploma which degree should I
pursue okay PR if you are in India I
will suggest go for BSC IT or you can
also go for B e the or BTech which all
depend upon you buddy if you want to
complete the if you have to spend three
or three years before BSC ITP talking
about two years go for four years ago
you can go Paul it be so I don't know
which degree you want to go for okay
next last okay okay then one last
question for my use I am in placing TCS
before joining it I want to do the
ossification if you have already placed
in TCS don't give exam now since you
have placed already once you join a
company because the thing is if you want
to do if you want to do certification by
yourself the problem is you have to pay
ten thousand rupees right for the exam
in sure of that you can join TCS TCS
will pay for your exam right so because
it will get reimbursed right so if you
are giving the exam if you're getting
cleared you will be getting
reimbursement from the city from TCS so
I'm not sure about this but normally
companies do that so I would suggest go
for that okay go for joining a Casillas
and then but if you if you have learned
Java make sure you learn complete you
can learn everything in fact if you want
to learn people who is staying in Mumbai
especially if you want to learn Java
I've just started a batch inbound OOP
okay if you to join you can join my
batch life I mean not this life but in
the classroom session so that's it
there's no more questions so so it will
end it a today but make sure you learn
something every day okay today learn
something so after this session also
learn something the thing you love
example if you love Java learn one
percent of Java today if you love
Android learn one percent of Android
today okay because one percent are days
seven percent a week 365 percent a year
okay so make sure to do that so that's
it thanks for watching do subscribe the
channel
