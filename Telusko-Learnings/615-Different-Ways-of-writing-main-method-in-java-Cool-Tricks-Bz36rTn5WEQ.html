video we'll see what are the different
ways of writing our main method in Java
class so as you know to to run any Java
code on your JVM we need a main function
right so this is what we need we need
public static void main and we have to
pass a constructor arguments so one of
the way to write a main method is this
way so let me spin something here so let
me say hello and if I want to run this
so I can simply say shift f6 so this is
the output view okay that's hello but is
it the only way to write a main method
change which can be changed the format
now a one of the way you know when you
talk about method overloading what if I
change this to integer so it will it
work so there is no error right so if
you even if you write integer here if it
is off string and if you run this so it
will straight ever give you an error
which simply says does not have a main
method so we cannot change this to
integer because the type of mean which
which your JVM expect is of type string
how about giving it an object so if I
write with object and run this again it
will give you error so we can only write
here string right now there is one more
way you know there is something called
as where arc so if you have seen my
video on varrick's so you might be
remind be doing what i mean by that
relax so instead of writing a added
symbol there we can simply say three
dots now this 3 dot defines that this
arcs is a adding okay so it's not
compensating to have the signature which
is string a square bracket and arcs you
can also use this signature to run your
code and the output is hello cool so
this is also work right so institution
of writing those square brackets we can
write dot dot dot then we can you know
this static and this public both are
modifiers so we can no no exchange their
position so we can actually write static
public void main' and then your string
arguments
but you know a globalized standard says
we have to first write public and then
we can go for static but this is this is
also supported we can so we can go over
static public void mean because if we
have different ways of writing main
methods so first way is public static
void main in which you can pass a string
array the second way is you can pass a
variable args and the third way is you
like you can write static public so it's
not a great thing to do with Java but if
you know this thing you know you can
make your you know it didn't have a cool
tricks off Java what you can do in your
college in your class so that's one this
video and but for more videos do
