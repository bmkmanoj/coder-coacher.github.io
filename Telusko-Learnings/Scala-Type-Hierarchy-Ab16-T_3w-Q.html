we'll talk more about lists so in the
last few videos we have talked about
least a lot right we can add elements in
that and we can perform some operations
so this is syntactic syntactic sugar
which we have the syntax where you can
mention the method name without the dot
operators right we have this object here
we are saying drop without using dot
operators that's fascinating for a Java
programmers because we don't do that in
Java right so what what else we can do
here so let's so let's say we have this
list of list of values right when you
have all integers I mean is it possible
to put some values and a different type
of value example true so now true is not
it's not what you say it's not number
right so fourth and sixth are integers
but two is not an integer then how it
will work so if you're on this code you
can see okay there's something wrong I
mean there's lots of bugs here but
remove this stuff okay yeah so you can
see we are getting a least because if I
mention a list of numbers if I only use
a list of numbers it will return you a
list which is aimed right so you're
detecting that you have all this four
six five there are numbers so it will
return you the list of n but as soon as
you add one more value here which is
true now that's a boolean type right so
we have integer integer boolean so it
creates an array of any value now what
exactly it means because when it comes
to Java what we normally do in Java is
let's say if I create an array when you
say at is start as list you can be you
have to be very specific here I mean you
can have an array of numbers or you can
have at you're gonna have an add in
let's say if I say 4 comma 5 comma 8 it
will work right because it is integer
but as much I tried or true here now
there's something wrong because it
returns you so it returns you the object
I mean it returns you the list of
objects you cannot put it integer here
so you have to put it object right
that's what we have learned and in Java
in fact if you put five point
five here dad send double right so this
is this is integer this is integer this
is double so instead of having object we
can also write I guess we can also write
number because yeah so because integer
and double they both they both are the
subclass of number class right so this
isn't a hierarchy right so if you if we
look at the hierarchy here so this is
the Java hierarchy so we have data types
so on the top we have object and then we
have primitive we have non primitive the
way it comes to string array those are
non primitive right and all these
classes they actually extend an object
class the same goes for boolean
character integer floating point in fact
we use double class there so these are a
per classes for you and then we have so
normally not like this is not the exact
class names it is a different thing but
we have classes which exchange object
right I hope you you're getting what I'm
trying to convey here example when it
comes to integer class and double class
both extends number right so if I go to
integer class so if I go to integer and
if I jump to integer you can see it
extends a number class it's simple for
doubles right so that's the hierarchy
for Java but when it comes a rocky path
Scala we have the topmost hierarchy as
any so we don't have object there we
have any so any has two things any Val
or any reference so if you talk about
primitive types or or the classes where
you can store data like boolean care
integer all the stuff they belongs to
any Val I mean when you have collections
classes when you have your own object
that's a part of any rev okay so this
this is something different in in Scala
compared to Java or not very different
but it is something which is new ok so
that's how you specify the hierarchy
here so when you specify a number and a
Budhan value it will return you the
value which is which is any value but
how about if I put a string here so
let's say if with this true I'm also
putting a string like Naveen now what
will happen is we have numbers we have
boolean and we also have a string so it
returns you any because as per the
hierarchy you can see we have a number
we have a boolean type and we also have
a class object which is string so it
returns any because it is you have to
specify you have to be I mean what you
say you have to be you have to line up
everything right so it is any so that's
how you can work with the Scala type
header okey so that's it from this video
we have talked about the type hierarchy
with list of elements so thank you so
much for watching and make sure you
subscribe the channel because more
videos on the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
