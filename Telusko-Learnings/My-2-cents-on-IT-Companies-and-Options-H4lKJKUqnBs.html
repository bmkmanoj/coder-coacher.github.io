from Therese color things and the
today's topic is how IT company
internally works so you know in this
from last week I got some requests on
our video how so they wanted to know how
IT company works so here it is so this
is my observation of IT companies is not
I have led some somewhere it is my
observation when I go to different
companies and I have seen how the
internal structure works that's what I'm
explaining now so basically there are
three three different types of companies
ok so let's say if you are working for a
company as a programmer so there are two
different companies you can work for so
the first company you can work a work
for is called as product based companies
the second one is this service based
company and the third one is the company
where the domain is something different
but they have their own IT department
example their domain can be oils the
domain can be banking the domain can be
some other thing maybe shipping so in
that company there will be one
department as IT department so let's say
if you are working for a bank let's say
Bank of America or maybe sgfc so they
will be having their own IT department
so he can work there also so if you you
might be working for a product based
company so with the service based
company or some domain specific
companies so when you are working for
product based companies what your main
job is again there are different if you
talk about all this company they have
their own I mean different different
streams so you can be a developer you
can be a tester you can be into tech
support you can be into database you can
be into Sauer management you can be a
network administrator so there are lots
of fields available on the in the
company so let's say if you are walking
for a printable product based company so
they will hire you based on your skills
so let's say if you are good with dotnet
so they will hire you as a tour tech
professional so when you join a company
a particular company your job is to work
on dot tech ok your job is to make
applications now this applications can
be example let's say if you talk about
ridiculous companies take an example of
or icon so reichal they have their own
products maybe you can work for ICP you
can work for Apple so it's a particular
company right so you have to make
products now the idea of the product can
be your idea it can be a company's ideas
are normally company have their own idea
they try to implement that idea you will
with with their phone some software's so
they make a software based on the ideas
so your job is to work on that software
as a developer but let's say you're a
tester so your job would be to test it
now again testing can be a different
thing it can be a manual tester ultimate
automation tester now again for manual
testing we have different tools for
automation testing we have different
different tools available so in the
particulars companies you have to do
those stuff which are your specialized
in and maybe you are you also have to
provide support for your perfect example
if you are making an application it is
your job to also support it ok let's say
after 2 months your project is done
maybe after 2 years of budget is done
and now initially you have to provide
support for that project maybe for 6
months but that's how it progressed
company works the next one is let's say
service based company so what happens is
every Swiss company is for service based
companies you are just a resource now
they will hire you now it doesn't matter
what you know which technology are
working with so even if you know dotnet
perfectly they might you they might put
you in Java you know Java they might put
you in PHP so it's depend upon the
requirement so they will not they will
not listen to you what you want and what
you know so they will give you what they
want you to do and so for them you are
just resource so the same person what
who is developer for last 2 years
now he can work as a support engineer
the same person who is doing support
they may get a development project so so
the service based companies work with
the services it doesn't matter who you
are you have to work on those things
which come to your company wants then
you can also work for a different type
of company like example a bank so if you
are working for a bank you have to so
there is their projects are internal
projects example if you talk about
service based companies like Infosys so
Infosys make projects for other
companies
example let's say if I
if I'm go today I want I want to build a
system or the software for my company so
I will ask inputs is to build a software
for me
so Infosys will give you give I mean
they built a software they will build a
complete solution they will give it to
me okay but what about banks so they
create their own software so they write
their own software so you will be
working for a come bank and your
software your project or your product
will be used by your bank itself so
you're not outsourcing the project so
yeah that's how internally it works so
when you join as a pressure you have to
work on those things which company wants
but once you get a hold on the
technology then you can you know you can
master in that technology and you can be
expert optical technology the only thing
which I would suggest is whenever you
join any company doesn't matter it is
visit product based companies or service
based company keep improving yourself
because the only way to you know to go
up the ladder is by improve improving
yourself so you can improve yourself by
learning new skills by learning how to
network with people by learning how to
do proper communication and again I'm
reaping the same thing communication
doesn't means English it means how you
communicate with people how you talk to
people how can you convey your message
to other other people so that is
communication okay so learn that learn
how to do networking and that's how you
go up the ladder now what else that's it
that's that's how internet works so if
you have some more questions let me know
