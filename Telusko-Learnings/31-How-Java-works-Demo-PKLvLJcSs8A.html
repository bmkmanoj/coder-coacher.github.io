tutorial we'll see how exactly Java
works now let's suppose if I create a
file let me create let me let me create
one more failure so let me say this time
I will say demo walk dot Java let me
save this and then this will do some
very basic thing like demo work and
we'll say public static oh it's void
main and back edge will say string it's
a lots of typos so now and this what we
can do is we can just play in the system
dot system dot out dot print again and I
will do very basic thing called as hello
void right it's very simple now we will
see how how exactly it works so that
when I save this file I have I'm saving
this file in a folder in a food item
useful study we have Java to switch over
to Java tools and this I have a file
called as a demo work right so I have
one file called as demo demo work so you
can see I have only one five on the demo
work here and when I go back now this
time let me just compile this so when I
say Java C demo work when I say Enter
once you get the compiled file and then
you will get a class file out of it now
this class file is a it's actually your
bytecode so now if you remember the
first video in which I have in which in
which I have already inform you that
whenever you create a dodge our file you
have to write your code here then when
you compile this file you will get a dot
class file now this dot class file is so
secure when you open it also with some
with some readable applications you can
see you will get something which is
encrypted wave so you should we will not
able to see exactly what this means but
it's a content this is a bytecode in
which you will be having all these bytes
you know all these binary formats and
when you run when you run it by on this
if I say demo work now this thing will
run this dot class file that's the enter
it's working right so there's nothing to
do with this your file name when you
running the application when you compile
your application dot Java file matters
when you run your application dot class
file matters all right it's very simple
now there is there is a myth you know
that it's they say your class name
should be same as your file name right
in fact I told you earlier that it
should be same but it's a myth your
class names it's not compulsion to be
same as your file name so let's suppose
if I make it as demo walk one so it
should not work right so should not work
so when I say let me let me just remove
this file let me just delete this
classifier now because I will recreate
this file again student
yes Knifer kampala so compile is Java C
you check if it's working it's working
country is working now so Jawa see and
we say demo work dot java and enter now
it is getting compiled okay now this
time we'll see when you run this
application you have to use at the last
name and class name is not demo work it
is demo work one and you're getting the
output right so it's not compulsion to
have a class name same as file name but
what is it twist what if your class is
public you can have your class as public
which says you can access this class
from anyway in this case in this clay is
in this case now if I compile this now
if I say demo work dot Java this time it
will give me an error it says class demo
work one is up is public should be
declaring a file named demo work one dot
Java it means any public class should
have a same class with same name as
finally now if I make it as demo work it
will work
that's working and to run this we'll say
Java is not demagogue Strava dimmable
now why we are getting output for this
because we have already created a dot
class file if I delete this file and if
I run this it will not work right demo
demo work will work right since its name
is work it will book about you but this
is your put right so this is how you
implement this of your Java normally
works one thing it's very important here
let's suppose if I want to add some
comments if I neither comment like this
is my main function
it should not be compiled you know when
you talk about comments this is that
statement should not be compiled by your
compiler and to add comments it's it
supports multi-line comment in this way
you might be knowing about C language
this is for as much design comment in
which you can have multiple comment
statements right but what if you want to
go for only if you know go for one line
comment so for that one line comment
what we can do is we can just use double
slash let me say main method right now
this statement will not be executed or
will not be compiled by your Java C so
when you compile this when you when you
when you when you on this there is no
problem with this line so this is how
you add comments so that's it for this
week from this video for the milling
