programming knowledge do subscribe and
click on the bell icon to stay updated
today I am very excited because we will
be deploying the applications whatever
we have done till now on Amazon's web
service and it will be available in such
a way that anyone can access it so
anyone can addict feedback anyone can
use that URL and that will be a public
thing okay so I am very excited for this
because this is the first time we are
undoing something lives like this
deploying something online there might
be some issues that we may get some
adults but that's fine right that's a
part of the process so let's see how it
goes now first of all I want to thank a
Catholic I've got a design from Karthik
and Karthik we love your design so let
me just open the design the home page
which Karthik has created or made so let
me just open that design and this is a
design submitted by carpet so it's full
name is Karthik
Lorenzo and you can see I mean the most
important thing which our light here is
this one are playing the video while we
can see a page it's awesome design this
is and okay so what else what else
okay so I loved it this design okay and
this images will be will be replaced by
the images which so we retain his design
you debate images so we'll replace this
images with the new images so thank you
so much Karthik for design although
spelling mistake yeah I mean spelling
mistake will remove that if you inside
the content will be changed soon okay
but where is the where is the spelling
mistake all right check it out but
that's fine that's fine
oh you're still working on the page it
is not complete page yet he still
walking it may take two or three days
more for the completion I guess Karthik
right okay but you are so you other
people you can also help with with
certain designed to zero if your thing
this can be modified it's getting
modified let me know maybe those will do
those changes okay so let us close this
so this so this is the decision design
will be used
so I thought now this design will be
using for for the homepage so let me
just close this and so okay in the now
station what we have done is we have
been to this project right so like this
run this project locally so that we see
what is happening okay so what do we do
now is our Guiding on this project i
would say run as the non server I also
have a dongle in my machine let's see
what is it working or not so that will
continue oh yes starting for your
setting server okay so as you can see
this is what we have done and when you
say a feedback page so when you request
for a feedback page feels like a HTM it
will ask you for the page but you can
give the feedback I was doing some
experiment with the project I hope it
does not get in an issue you can see we
got a feedback here as well right
very big create it is so you can see
this is our feedback page again designed
in the matter we are focusing more on
the of the coding parts first and again
I want health before design from your
side right so again the design will be
change in future okay so what we are
going to do now is let's create one more
a little bit one more link where you can
actually get all the feedbacks you know
I want to also check what are the
feedbacks I've been able so I will say
get feedback dot HTM so when I say get
feedback on stream I want all the
feedbacks now unfortunately we don't
have a feedback he okay you can see we
have not created anything for this for
this thing wait so now what we do is
let's create a controller now I hope you
remember this spring MVC because I am
assuming that till you have reached till
this point of course we should know
about something about spring MVC right
so what will we do now is we'll add one
more controller only for fetching the
cause as you can see we have created the
controller called as add feedback here
okay we gotta call feedback so when you
say feedback HTM it will return feedback
dot JSP and when you when you fall for
add feedback it will add the feedback in
your database this is what they are
times at our session right so if I open
the database now if I okay which
database you're working with so basic
till now we are working with master so I
will open my hostel workbench and I was
using the nursery's connection here so
in the next week in the next to me I
have a machine here in which I have a
database and if I say use the disco if I
select stars long feedback I mean I just
connected I will say use the disco and
as you can see that text that and if i
underscore let's say connect staff saw
feedback and I will run this code okay
so these are the feedback we have added
in the last session right so I want to
fetch all this feedback and I were to
show that those throw those feedback on
the page so what we do now is let's go
back here and let's have as no
controller so we'll give the controller
name as Adelaide the clapping get
feedback now instead of typing the code
I will simply copy paste equal to the
Sawadee or they've done that before so
instead of wasting lots of time what I
am doing now is I am writing the code
three hands so that I will be simply
copying pasting it so I will just
convert this and you can see I got so
whenever you fall for request mapping
okay so whenever you say when you send a
request from get feedback so next year
because this is the feedback I want to
fetch right so I will go here on my
stream on my okay using Facebook we are
using Firefox white so let us say get
feedback silicium I want to make it work
now as you can see this is not working
because we have we have provided get
feedback for Astrium right but we have
not mentioned what so we have mentioned
that we want to call feedback store JSP
now unfortunately you can see we don't
have a view name which is called as read
by garage dot JSP so let's clear that
feedbags or JSP hours will disappear
here and we'll name this page as
feedback dot JSP
and what we do here is I will simply
print the feedback but let's do that
later
I bought the feedback page and in here
I'll mention I have mentioned the
feedback page and let's return the
object of mV now if you are wondering
what is MV or basically we talk about
spring MVC in spring
whenever you make a website you have two
things here first you have to return the
data and you have to also mention the
view name right
so this feedback dot JSP is your view
name and you also you also want to send
a data so what you can do is you can
create object of model and view which
can hold both it can hold data and view
name boat it is not compress I to use
this we can also use model object but
then you think this will be much more
efficient to work with right so we'll
use this and we'll say MV dot I want to
add data now I want to send all the
feedbacks right so I will mention this
feedback our feedback and I will give a
detail now we have to send the data as
well right now the data will be coming
from the database so all the feedbacks
need to be coming from the database so
of course we have to say s now because
now what is down here which isn't our
object like I am just assuming that you
have been all the earlier sessions here
ok you have to make sure that you are
watching you have seen all the earlier
sessions and we say get a feedbacks but
then unfortunately I don't have this
method for this get feedbacks so what I
will do here is I would say ok why I'm
doing all this things ok you are waiting
for the edge of this right but then to
make it work
I also want to have one more request
right you think that you can stretch the
feedback so what I'm doing that now and
in this I want one more method which
using which you can actually fetch the
feedback from the database so I will use
some I have already returned that object
other return that string here so let me
just work with that so you can see I've
got a method of get feedback so that
this method is already created so where
does the get feedback I am getting all
this obsession now since I want to fetch
all records I am using of SQL here so
this thing is actually h ql
now when you work with the SQL to use
SQL queries wise we have we all know how
it scales body works but then in
hibernate it provides you of features of
edge
ul now if you don't know hql you can
just go to my playlist I have a
hibernate video do watch those videos to
get the complete understanding of SQL
okay so yeah so we got we got some
feedback when you are fetching a
feedback you are getting all this
feedback here so in this list I have all
the feedbacks which is coming from the
table and then I will simply print those
and I will also return the feedback so
whatever I am getting from the database
I am reading that in a least format so
that least format will be going to index
controller and in this feedback label
you'll be having all those things now
what we have to do now is in your
feedback store GSP will simply use a
dollar symbol and we'll mention
feedbacks now it is possible that your
PL is not working ok let's do that later
so this you shot yourself let's write
like this and obviously restart the
server now let's see if your get get
feedback is working let's go back there
or not all the others let's go to
Firefox let's say enter and string lots
of time you know again you see that we
got feedback but unfortunately we got
dollar feedback this is not what we want
right but you can see the console of STS
we got all the feedbacks so it is
stretching the feedback from the
database but then there is only one
issue e L is not working here now if you
are not familiar with e le l stands for
expression language which is the part of
jst and you can actually take a notebook
with you ok so when we are doing it
session just take our notebook and a pen
with you whatever things you don't
understand just write those things and
go to my channel and search for the
videos on that 90% chances are that I do
have a video on the outside concept it
may happen that I don't have a concept
let me know whatever concept you don't
understand I will make a video on that
ok so I will say is PL ignored equal to
false because sometimes your e l is
getting ignored so let's try to remove
that let's go back let your shuttle
server ok so we started done let's go
back and say enter and ok can you see
lightly gone
the feedback to you and that's awesome
we got this method which is get feedback
so HTM which will return me all the
feedbacks now once we are done with this
let's go to Amazon Web service how to
deploy this application on AWS so I'm
really excited for this now and let's do
that so step one now first of all there
are lots of people they might be
wondering last time we have worked on
Google App Engine and now I'm moving to
Amazon Web service there are multiple
reasons for this the first reason is I
always wanted to go for Amazon Web
service but the problem was you know I
was facing some issues but now there is
all the issues are resolved and now we
can work on Amazon and one working one I
mean that's very much easier compared to
Google App Engine right and Amazon Web
service is a market leader in cloud
services ok so given a choice or if you
can go forward Amazon's web service or
you can go for App Engine I will also go
for Amazon Web Store ok so let's go to
Amazon Web service ok so what do we do
now is let me just go to Amazon websites
websites I would say aws.amazon.com does
the official website of Amazon's web
service this is the page you have to go
to ok so you can see the bottom is on
web service and I already have an
account so if you don't have an account
you just have to click on create account
and getting account is actually easier
than creating a Facebook account here
the only thing is you have to enter your
credit card information and ok so it
does have a great card ten bad for you
but then it is free for one year ok at
least one year you can enjoy and they'll
ask some waited tears don't click on
that whenever you select anything here
make sure that you're using a free
version ok so I will go to Amazon
management console Amazon Web Store is
nice and console or did you have an
account it will ask ask me for be using
impossible I guess I hope you go answer
that ok so I already have an account
here so I will say Java boy that's the
account I'm using now so Java boy and I
mean decorate gmail.com and the password
is star star star star star star star
star okay this is the part that you have
to use so we got a login into the
console
so you have to make sure that you have
an Amazon account with you guys before
doing all the things now first let me
explain you all the volumes here so we
got ec2 easy to stands for the Amazon it
is elastic cloud computing so any way
you want to deploy your application
since the place you can deploy the
applications in which will be using
elastic beam stack because this is used
only for web application ec2 can be used
for applications for virtual servers we
don't want to use virtual servers vo so
we'll be going for only web application
right so we'll be using elastic beam
stack in fact it provides a lots of
features is also provide extra service
if you are if you are if you are you
know if you are injured like you just
the part so we have f3 for storage we
have ideas for database so we'll be
using RDS we are populating the database
so two things we need here the first
thing we need is elastic beam stack
where you will deploy your application
and you need RDS where you can where you
will put your database so okay which one
to go for first
I mean you can go for anything right you
can go for elastic beam or you can also
go for audios let's start with elastic
beam okay and you're saying some time so
elastic beam is for deploying your
application you can see I already having
a bit did he have an application here if
you want to get an application okay why
I've done this oddly because it takes
lots of time enough I sometime I feel
Amazon web servers are slower than my
machine so it takes lots of time to
create an application to create a
database to add a table so I have
already done that already so if you want
to do it by yourselves
they can't be create new application
with you it will ask you for the
application name I will say a task I
will not just up will say Naveen a
picture name you can add a description
if you want and click on create so it
will create application for you you can
see this is the application and here you
have to create then to go for create new
one it can ask you for which one you
have to go for I will select web server
environments then click on select now
once I do that it will create an
application for you but
before that you have to mention which
server you want to go for so I'm going
for Tomcat right now okay so if you're
working on node.js you can go for that
you feel working on PHP it also provides
PHP feature like Titan that will be
there going for Tomcat with electron
cash here and in fact if you are family
of like doctor you can also use docker
here okay but then I will be using
contact
now once we've got a tomcat I want to
upload my application again see we have
to click on upload your code and you can
upload the code yourself but you can
actually skip this okay but this for
this you need a bad file that's a tricky
part right but before doing all the
things we will click to simply click on
today's environment at least you will be
getting an environment where you can get
saw the application right okay there is
no event is because we have not added
the vas file but I will be not using
this one I will be using something which
is my own so I have already created this
one which is sample which is the name is
demo I'll be deploying the application
using this upload and deploy thing we
just have to click on upload and deploy
and you can deploy your application it
is that easy and the awesome part is
your your Amazon Web service actually
supposed Java 8 so your Amazon Web
service actually supposed Java 8 and
that's what I love about it so you can
use all the Java features here ok and
you can see to use SMS on the next
machine so that will be easier to work
with
okay but before you want deploying the
application we have to make sure that we
are using so you want before deploying
the application how to first clear
database right so also let's create a
database so for that I will open again I
will open a SS ok let's go for ideas so
we have we have latest assignment here
so we'll be doing up we'll be using this
after some time but we have to create a
database first so we'll go here and I
will click on Amazon management console
ok and if you want to create database of
course right when you deploy an
application we also have databases right
in fact up before deploying I was using
this other machine DBMS which is
masculine and now I have to use Amazon
Web Services I will be using AA D S
which stands for relational database
service
okay so let's become this okay okay so
once you got this page now you can see
it okay first of all it will look
difficult for you because they are doing
for the first time but trust me once you
know this it will be very easy to work
with the future okay so I will click on
launch DB instance we click on this
launch DB instance and okay now the
different instance is suppose so amazon
has its own DBMS which is auto da I will
not use that will go for MySQL Oh give
it into FAMAS field or you can go for
Mali IDB you can go for force group the
thing is if you are going for the Amazon
oh and DBMS ah if not three actually
yeah it will you will be getting charged
for this and we love free things right
so will be going from ask ul or four
scales now I am facing some problem with
my skull workbench on my system so I'll
be using forged with SQL I guess I'll be
using Postgres here okay and it go to
select of 70 click on select it will ask
you for whatever pin want you are going
to go for again this is the paid version
okay this is the free version okay we'll
go for this one oh this is intense for
use outside of lotion or under the
audience we use the steel okay so we
will be using three one let's go to next
step
first of all okay when you go for RDS
you have to make sure that you select
only those things which are free ok see
mind you for to create Amazon account it
will ask you for the appraiser
information right so if you are doing
something think and to it okay
unnecessary it will charge you and that
will not be a small amount okay
so make sure you select this one with a
texture RDF split here so we'll select
we'll take this
and now here we have two so when you
select this one it will give you all
default options we will go for default
option since we are doing before this
for the first time right so the other
improper default one if you if you can
get the default one working you can try
different things okay you can do
different experiments with that okay now
I will ask you for your database
identifier now the database identify
your data instance name so I will use
database name as telescope and then I
will use master user name as Naveen and
I will set the password as one the done
and ok so you can see my password
afterwards once you see the code
anywhere will change that later and I
will use the same password here and then
you click on next now when you click on
next will create your database instance
oh it is asking you for some some more
conjugation now again all this
configurations let's go over the default
one with like default
VPC and here as well I will go for
easier we have to go for RDS launch
wizard okay I am doing this from a long
time I'm getting errors from a long time
okay so this thing book I let's enter
your database name and will also give
the details name and that is for itself
so my instance name is also the disco
and it everything is also to score you
can have a two different names that's
fine
and anything else does the default
portable supports if you're using mask
your support time it will give you a
three three zero six four four six five
four three two and once we do this then
nothing important let's click on launch
DB instance I hope it will be it will
work now and you can see your DB
instance is working now how do you know
how many DB instance you are running
buck so if I go to instance this here
you can see I have the whole shop open
here for DBMS I guess it with the two or
three so you can see I was doing some
experiment so credited mask yokel of
stars then I was going touch post or
then we are doing telescope test
I will not be using this one or ABCD I
will be using just post okay so we have
created this one but we'll be using this
one okay because this is working and I
want to do I don't want to take any any
risk with this okay so okay now what is
important once you've got so so once you
okay so now how to configure this and
what are things you have which is
important so before expanding this what
I want to show you is if I go to my STS
see what are things you have to remember
when you when you connect with database
there are certain things which is
important the first thing is the Java
plus the Java class here is calm I asked
you I did observe driver because I was
using mask you'll before then you have
to mention the URL which is the
determination here then you have to
mention the username and password so
this thing will change depend upon which
DBMS you're working with now since I am
deploying the application on on Amazon
Web service which is audio so when you
when you open this you have to click on
the second tab which is what is called
as detail so when you click on details
it will give you all these options now
most important thing here is the it'll
explain the first thing I remember is
database name I would recommend you to
write it somewhere in fact let me just
do that I will write my things here so I
will mention my database name so my
database name as okay let me just use
the term is name we can study score okay
the next thing here is the user name
okay the next thing is user name I will
create user equal to or Naveen and let
me share the password with you not not
now each other password data
the password is one two three four five
six seven eight so that's the password
for my RDS database in fact I should not
be sharing this password with you but
then that's fine I can do this for time
being and okay what next
okay
and then this is important the end point
now end point basically means your host
name so as you know that it will ask you
about the host name right so we say host
equal to this one this is your host name
okay the next thing you have to remember
is the de port number so the port number
is 5 4 3 2 so these are thing that
remember Peter Smith username password
host name and port number yeah so once
you've got your database tank all this
information let's replace all this
information in our code so I want this
information our code right so with open
my eyes cheers and let's let's replace
all the things now first of all I am not
using my ask you anymore
I'm you I'm using Postgres right again
that different DBMS available right I'm
using force ratio so what I will do is I
will replace this combat miles ql or
diddy so driver with with Porsche will
now before using for scripts you have to
also make sure that you are adding of
course with dependencies in your system
so how do we add a force with dependency
again you can go to map and deposit 3
and you can get the post with dependency
so it's going to form and let's go to my
window cause the tree to get that
dependency so I will go to my main
repository with it as this one so we've
got to manage repository and we'll
search for Porsche whip so let's first
fork over and we'll select paws grills
here we'll go for this version
ok let's copy this and this patient here
so we got of course which dependency
note system and if I on my mine and
repository or is that and you have to
also verify ok whenever you do anything
you have to also verify if it's updated
or not ok if I open libraries it was
taking some time what's wrong
ok so you can see we got a post grist
dependency here in fact I don't need
Maskull anymore so I can also remove
markers from here so just drag it and
let me just remove my ask you I don't
need mascara anymore
so it is that easy to add dependencies
and to remove dependencies
suddenly my machine is running very slow
because eclipse is doing something
behind the scene so it will move my
skills from here so we have removed mad
skills and now it's time to change these
values so the first thing is you have to
mention your your Java class so Java
class is hodgiedot disposed grids SQL
dot driver the next thing you have to
mentioned is the URL now this URL would
be so it will be Jerry BC : we have to
use pores Gris here so we are not using
masks anymore we are using a Postgres
since I post this SQL ok and then here
you have to mention your host name and
how to replace this one with the host
name so I already have an host name in
my in my sub line so I will use this
host name you have to copy from here to
here and let's paste it this one so they
are pasted that ok and then we have to
mention it we have to measure the port
number as well so we have to give a
colon and remeasure the port number as 5
4 3 2 so we have mentioned the port
number as well you have to mention the
user name the user names here which I
have written here is Lavie so is a
living here and the password for my
machine for the database there is a
beast a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ok and what next
that's it we have mentioned everything
here we have to mention the govern a we
have done with that we have mentioned
the the URL the I mentioned that and
then we have mentioned the password and
I okay everything get everything seems
good ok but unfortunately I don't have a
data on the server right we have simply
created two database right if you
remember if you go to Amazon Web service
here we have created only the database I
mean we have credit database right which
is table we have not
created the table yet so we have to
credit table now how do we do that how
do we add a table okay so to do that you
can search for the console where you can
write SQL queries so if you search
everywhere and you will figure it out
there is no console here
how can you insert a table if I click on
this there is no option of inserting
data if you click on this you can see
there is no option of inserting a table
so from this page yes so what are the
doors you have to use a client so you
have to make sure that you use a client
so if you're using mask you'll you have
to use maskull workbench which is here
if you are using Postgres here then you
have to download p3 team RPG admin so
you have to install PG admin here okay
and I already have a setup here what I
will do is I will delete that setup
let's do that so if you open your PG
admin now PG ID mean is used only for
forceless okay if you are using masks
you'll be have a different steps for
that I am using PG editing here so
whatever you do is I was right click on
the server and then okay there is no
that's it let's click on the file and
you can see the option of add server you
have to look for this option of adding
server so click on add server and it
will ask you for certain things it will
ask you for the name it will ask you for
the name or we can have any name here we
said this is AWS it will it will ask you
for this host name and I know you
remember now the host name is your this
native Slendy name let's paste it here
that's your host name then you have to
mention your port number and nothing
important here the user name is Naveen
the password is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and then
click on OK now you can see this is
getting connected with the Amazon Web
saw this software it will take some time
because Amazon Web service doesn't trust
your machine right so it will do lots of
verification and then it will be enabled
so as you can see if you get this option
here that means you are Amazon Web
Services
which is on the server is connected with
your machine and trust me when I was
doing this for the first time it took me
five hours I was not able to able to
connect with this okay I was getting
lots of issues which I don't know what
was the issue but then I was getting
permission if you if you expand your
database you can see we already have a
disco here so this very school is
actually coming from please from the
server and even before the session I
have created table ok I've done this
before before the session so that I
wanted to make sure that everything goes
good on the live civilization so if I
open public so if you expand all the
things inside this public table a public
schema you will be having your table so
you can see in my tables I already have
a feedback table now by default you will
not have this if you are doing this by
yourself you will not have this table
what you have to do is you have to
create this table click on your table
and you have to say new table ok if you
click on new table and and then you have
to give the information about the table
you have to you have to name the table
then you have to add the columns inside
table you can click on the Add button to
add the columns right so have already
done that let me show you the table now
so this is my table with all these
columns you can see we have 6 columns or
7 or 6 columns here we got name email
message registration code and rating and
I will right click this and I will say
view data
oh is that I was writing on a table and
will say view data all the rows and
actually I have I just have one row only
we got that will be what is data right
now this data is not there is my machine
ok the data which is this row is not in
my machine this data is there on the
server now I know I hope you know how to
insert data you can simply use a query
tool to insert data or if you are using
forces then the query tool will you will
find that in tools so when you see a
tools option you can go to query tool
and you can fire the kwazii's here ok
greater is getting opened ok this is
your query table and here you have to
type the query whatever you want to you
want to
you want to work with okay so I got my
table right I got my table I got the
recorder as well and this data is not on
my machine this data is on the server
okay so it is there on the audio server
so once we got that once we got the RDS
server okay it sounds like our DX Lloyd
yeah so we got the god of server record
a database record the data as well now
what I want to do is you can see it has
eight connection because I guess three
connections are some force duis five
connections are there from the website
okay what's next now once you burn a
database let's connect let's deploy the
application here now how do we deploy
the application is it that easy of the
answer is yes it is actually very easy
we have to go to sta office let's verify
everything is perfect here it seems
everything is perfect nothing wrong in
this code in it all the better to verify
before deploying the application because
if something goes wrong then you have to
do lots of circles so this o RG dot
postgis SQL is our driver then we have
or we have that length which is a port
which has a port number five four three
two we have a user named Naveen as you
got a password which is one two three
four five six seven eight everything
seems good
let me just go with this now how do we
so how do we deploy for deploying this
we have to first create a batch file
okay so if I click this and we'll say
export and select vast volume and we'll
create a bad file on my desktop so on
the next time I'm creating a test dot
grad ok if I go to my desktop now
desktop you can see as what a bad file
and this Val one is created at 554 so we
just created a file file and we'll go to
Amazon solve it now so so ok just
remember this is RDS where you can
create database ok we are using two
instance here what is audience which is
relational database service and we are
also using elastic V
stat so to deploy your application on V
stack so click on upload and deploy
select for the application so I'm
selecting this dust to add and will give
any name we'll say this is test 1.0 and
then if lick on deploy now it will take
some time for the deployment it is 16 MB
and my internet is very fast here it is
very very fast it will take some time
ok so just taking lots of time let's
hold down so by the time it's getting
uploaded so we for the questions of our
case I make a video on SPL and log4j
or let me try that taking lots of time
or done so it says deploying or
deployment done so I think it is working
now that and you can see you have to
make sure that your health is ok I mean
not your but your server health is OK
and ok let's click on this now and you
can see we got of public you are L so
this is the public URL using which you
can actually work with this ok you can
see we got welcome that is why learning
will give get feedback dot HTM and I
hope it will work I hope it will work
and yes we got a feedback awesome now
this data is coming from database now
how do you be very positive what I will
do now is I will click on let's also
test this ok we have done this quite
let's test it it may go wrong but that's
fine what I would recommend you people
to do is I am showing this link with you
here on the in the chat window just give
a feedback everyone the stick on that
and so I have feedback let me just also
do that here
hi my name is Evan ready
my email is Naveen ready to either HTML
calm and then I'm giving this but I am
giving the review for online courses no
code is required and given the feedback
as good and then I was great myself as
for and then I will click on submit
get feedback in my Postgres database if
I verify the possible database the
column type is just
registration is integer and if I go to
my HDL registration is as the feedback
oh you can string oh my god it is
straying my mistake it was it was spring
earlier when I've been a critic table it
was wrong that what do we do is I will
change it to what we do is I will delete
this column and let's recreate it column
so we say did it let's create one more
column here which is called strikes are
taking some time because it is happening
on the server or right-click and say new
column and the name is column as we legs
and the type of code would be text okay
and let's say okay now there will be an
issue of sequence but I guess that is
fine a hybrid it will map it with the
name let's try let's run this thing once
again and oh it work can you see that
what the problem is in the code we have
returned welcomes our J's which is not
dead right but it will work now if I go
for if I go for so just copy this link
okay now everyone you can try with the
feedback but let me verify if my
feedback is getting added or can you see
that we got my feedback as well so the
feedback which I have given is this one
so what I would suggest you to go is I'm
sharing this link with you or feedback
send me a feedback on ok let me show you
a link on the chat window send a
feedback let's verify
okay any feedback yet no only I've got
two feedbacks and let me know if you are
getting any other there or just just
enhance the order just make sure that
