to add this how to add two numbers and
how to subtract two numbers but but
without using this implements action
listener so it me remove this action is
not from here even with me to remove
this part we'll use that file in my
notepad so let me delete this action
perform also and now instead of using
this this I need to define that object
or define that anonymous class here so
we'll say new action listener okay you
can see by default it came so and as the
advantage of using netbeans you get
boilerplate codes by itself it happy to
give that good now so let me just
reformat it look better
okay now let's copy that code which is
for addition of two numbers and we put
it here so anyone I click on this button
which is add it will execute this
statements and then whenever I click on
this button which is subtract now it
should call some other statements it
should it should execute the same thing
but in different way instead of a plus
it should be subtraction so what we can
do is we can just read this code say a
copy and then here we'll say paste so I
should have addition here we'll say
subtract right even if I want this code
now it should work so let's say we have
six and we have let's see - when you say
and it is a twenty societies for right
alright and and we can even convert this
thing with lambda expressions so instead
of writing all this thing remove this
part and say all the below coding
belongs to a lambda expression am I
missing something extra bracket that's
it so you can see this is using normal
coding in till Java 7 and this is Java 8
coding
simple so let me run this again and
we'll say again sex and two addition is
eight supply chain is four so that's
just for this video that in this we have
seen how to use anonymous object for two
different for two objects or two buttons
in the next video we'll see some some
new components in swing package so
thanks for watching and do subscribe for
