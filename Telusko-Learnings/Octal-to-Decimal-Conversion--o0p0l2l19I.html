Queens octave and you have to find a
scar a decimal format which is extent
but to find decimal format you have to
convert this often to the same well for
that we have to use a power of 8 format
see whenever you convert from any system
to his system let's say from if you
convert from decimal to binary or
decimal to octal and decimal to let us
select a symbol number we have to say /
so far Vinay / to four decimal / a time
for example / 16 and how to go back so
from existing multitude is Sigma we have
to use power of 16 from octal to decimal
part of eight and from been a two
decimal power of two okay so the
question here is you have to convert a
number from octal to decimal that means
we have to use power of 8 and you have
this four options okay so let's let's
try to find if you find a decimal format
or the number before point you will get
the answer these all are different so
now I'd to find after point for that
let's do the calculations this is your
number which is six 3827 dot 4051 so
what we'll do going to take this number
so this is six and three to seven which
is comet of eight we need to find octave
so we have to use powered off eight so
dig a trench 208 wins 2-1 a 22 and a
dress to the region which is 11 in 27
this number plus then if it is 8 into 2
plus this is h264 into 3 plus this is a
two to three is five and two in 26 clear
and then way to add all these numbers so
this is 512 in 26 which comes out to be
possibly
by 12 into say something in 3091 167
so this is 3 07 2 plus 6 3 4 into 3
which is 192 Plus this is 16 plus with
this is 7 and if you calculate somewhere
the answer will be 3,200 something and
if you compare the answer here the first
option this is 3287 got something
doesn't matter see it all the answers
you have 5,700 so most appropriate is
this silicon confirmed by putting this
you will get three toes 287 and as the
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
