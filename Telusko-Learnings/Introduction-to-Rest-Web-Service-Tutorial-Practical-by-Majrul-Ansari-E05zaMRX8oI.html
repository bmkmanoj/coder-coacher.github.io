on setting up jax-rs the API that I
talked about in the introductory session
with the help of this API we can develop
a restful web services using Java
technology and it provides a rich
collection of API interfaces annotations
a lot of customization options a
wonderful API production very very
popular API as I was talking about
during the discussion we can use
alternatives explained in others but for
this demo we'll be using Jersey which is
the reference implementation for restful
web services using Django technology how
do we get access to Jersey the URL Java
just sit on java.net this is the site
from where we can get access to the
latest build of the same and let's go
ahead and quickly download the one that
we need right now we can always start
with the recent version as of knowledge
we can see its two point twenty five
point one now we can start using the
maven approach for setting up a new
project but for simplicity I will be
downloading the whole bundle you can see
this link will provide me a zip with the
help of which I will get all the
necessary jars together available to me
so all I need to do is just get them
copied into the project's library folder
and start developing an application what
are the Neve and dependency is needed
this is good amount of documentation
available on this maybe in some one of
the video we will talk about the same in
detail so I've got just C downloaded
let's get the same extracted as we will
need the libraries shared by Jessie to
be copied into a project that will be
creating so very very no file system
will extract the same and
as you can see in my case it's already
been done by now we can see the
necessary jars required for using jax-rs
are the same so we'll have we'll need
all of them now since we are new to JAXA
is it will be very difficult for us to
pinpoint which jar is needed which one
is not needed we will talk about them in
detail later on as of now what is
important for us to understand is the
basic setup so will will not worry about
any individual jar right now we'll take
up all of them and set up the project
get some working code and also our
understanding improves then we can
discuss more about the dependencies and
the setup and the importance of all this
libraries that we are application code
is depending upon so now I am going to
go into Eclipse create a new project a
new dynamic web application we need some
server I have already set up concat I am
sure with an understanding that you
already know how to do the same it's
very easy creating a new server
configuration in Eclipse
in my case I am using Tomcat 8 we can
use a lower version of Tomcat also if
required anything will do we can use
alternative servers like JBoss and
others as well let's go ahead and create
a new dynamic web project give some name
to it so just a simple one to begin with
let's say call it as jax-rs starter the
tomcat server that i have configured
will select the same the version of java
version of a servlet api doesn't matters
3.1 3.0 will go with whatever defaults
we are able to see over here you can
directly click on finish as such the
options on the next screen not so
important right now
so will get the standard structure for a
web application ready the dependency
jars that we need we'll copy them into
the Lib directory so let's do the same
we have downloaded jax-rs now it's time
to copy the required jars or take up
them from those folders individually so
I've got the Col jax-rs API all the
extension API classes
and finally the important jars of
jealousy great so we have got all the
required jars now and it's time to now
start writing some food there's not much
of a setup we have to do that's the best
part
with this pre-configured environment and
this basic step that we saw very easy
for us all to go ahead with let's create
a new class the first step when we
create a new project in which we want to
use jax-rs the restful api for java is
to start with some application class I
will start with some package name for
example con dot add keep it simple let's
call this class as my rest and give us
now this is the first step now this
class which we will be creating is only
needed in the beginning of a project and
some importance of this class in all yes
it's it's like as we go ahead we'll talk
more about it what we need to do in this
class is extend this from the
application class provided by jax-rs so
the package that we will be importing
Java X dot WS dot R is not cool now
generally when you write a class and you
extend another class the tendency would
be to override some method but for this
example we don't need to override any
method as of now in this class all we
need to do is imitate this class with an
N notation called as application part
and we'll give some path to this
application for example let's call it a
slash app so any jax-rs application
needs to have a class called as an
application class the primary role of
this class right now will not be very
clear to us I need to give spend some
more time discussing about the
importance of this as of now we'll just
follow it as a step that is needed to
get a working example and once our
understanding improves we'll come back
to this what we are decided over here in
this annotation is a URL which will be
needed for accessing the classes that we
will be creating in this application so
think about this as a servlet mapping in
traditional web dot XML terms so you are
going to do some mapping in an XML file
where you decide a URL pattern this is
somewhat the same now it's time to
create our first web service so this was
just a preliminary step really
preliminary step which we had to follow
now it's time to write a code which
looks like a web service so let us
create a class if you remember during
our discussion that we had done we had
said that the naming convention that we
will follow is resource so keeping that
in mind let's give this file name
hello resource dot Java so restful web
services generally would follow this
naming convention now what do we do in
this class we use again some annotation
this time the name of the annotation
part I mean some URL which we will be
using it for accessing this code from
the client next we need to write some
method which will execute for any
incoming requests using the get method
of HTTP protocol test web services if
you recollect it's all about writing
code on top of HTTP protocol get post
and all the methods of HTTP protocol is
what we need to concentrate on so let's
write a small method which will execute
when the incoming request is done using
the get method of HTTP protocol this
method will return a string method name
can be anything it's written a welcome
string welcome to Jack's father's you
can see how easy the pouring is here it
is no specifics formal declaration of
any method or anything that you have to
follow just a notation style programming
which has become very popular so yet
another framework which promotes at
Hagley the method names and all can be
very very flexible there are lot of
arguments you can take in those methods
we will see those options later on
written type of the method can also vary
depending upon how we are writing the
code for the simple example we'll be
returning a string and what we will do
is we will provide more information
about what we are returning using an
annotation called as producers so let's
see we are going to return some plain
text because whatever this return type
indicates basically it's all about
telling the client that if you are going
to invoke the service this is what you
get back in return so I'm telling my
client that I am going to send you some
plain text and there you go that's the
text welcome to Jack's Aris that's a
this is how you write a web service
using jax-rs
basic and notations to remember our path
and notation any web service class will
be identified using a path and what will
a web service contain different methods
and they will be executed on top of HTTP
methods like get and post now this is a
very simple example yes when we do
better examples later on we'll see how
do we take in port and based on the pair
pass then we accordingly return output
will also see how do we support JSON and
XML later on in a different demo
altogether what do we do next it's all
done
there is no configuration nothing at all
so jealousy is one of the framework
which promotes a zero configuration
policy you don't have to do any kind of
XML configuration to get this example
working it's already it's just that we
have to go and get this example deployed
and we should be very soon be able to
see the output of our hello world code
so let's go and run this application on
the server quick restart of the server
if required okay not to worry about this
for not whole page that casing because
Tomcat is searching for the index page
and we don't have an index page now what
we are going to do is the parts that we
mentioned in our java code starting with
the path in the application class so we
are going to append slash whatever part
we gave in the application class
followed by the path we gave for the
hello world code so followed by slash
hello and if things go well we should be
able to see the output of our simple web
service code that we have written great
so you saw there was hardly any effort
we had to take and this is nothing but
like the ease of using all this
technologies which are so popular
nowadays
as you can see jesse has made it so easy
for us to develop an application using
jax-rs this API for developing restful
web services using Java thanks a lot
everyone I will see you in some another
tutu video and we'll talk about the
options that we explored in this in more
detail thank you so much everyone or
less I hope you got how this example
works we'll talk more about all this
options of bit more in detail later on
ok so that's it for this video we will
see in a different video the various
options that we saw in this example a
bit more in detail good bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
