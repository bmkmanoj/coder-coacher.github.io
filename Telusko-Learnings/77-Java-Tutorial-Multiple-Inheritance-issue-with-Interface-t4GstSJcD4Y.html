we can define methods and interface
right again there are lots of
controversies is it should be allowed or
not but we have that feature now so we
can define method and interface using
default keyboard do we have any drawback
of this let's see if you remember Java
doesn't support multiple inheritance
because one class if it exchanged two
classes it will be difficult to track
from which class we have to actually
fetch the method right the same problem
may get arising interface as well let's
see we have an interface here which is
my demo so we have two interfaces now
when it demo it's against my demo and
I'm not defining a method here and now
if I call show and first we have to
implement both the interfaces I would
say I'm demo comma my damn eye from this
code you can see just which is working
right we chose in angel let's say in
demo show just for the confirmation it
is calling from in demo show but now
what will happen because when you call
show we don't have show inside demo
implementation right and that's why it
is fetching that show from interface but
what happens when you have show in my
demo as well let's say this is not in my
damn in in demo it is in my demo now and
if you see it is giving you an error it
says that duplicate default methods
names show with a parameter in the with
the same parameters so it is giving you
an adult right now how to solve this
error there is one way to solve this
problem is again this is an ambiguity
problem right because which method to
called as a confusion so one of the
solution for this is create a method
I'll show inside your class itself okay
which prints in demo in sure now what
will happen is as soon as you call this
show it will execute this one so there
is no confusion of this one and this one
so that's how you can remove ambiguity
issue within with interfaces now okay
that's one that's one of the may second
ways you can see it is giving you an
option there you can click on the option
if you click override default method
what it will do is it will create a show
method but we don't want our execution
there I mean we don't want to print in
demo Impulse show what i want to do
from this show I want to call the
superclass sure I mean so point of a
show of demo so for that you have to
mention demo dot super dot show so this
is the first time we can use super with
interfaces so you can call the method of
the interface with the help of super but
you have to me also mention which super
because since we have two interfaces now
so I have to mention it is demo dot
super if you don't this you will get in
demo show but if I change this to my
demo dot super not show it will call in
my demo show
so due to default methods and interfaces
also we are getting that ambiguity issue
so to solve that we have two solutions
in fact we have only one solution by
defining the method so either you can
provide the implementation get your own
implementation or you can call the super
interface methods by specifying the
interface name the super keyword and the
method name so that's how you solve the
ambiguity all what you can say is
multiple inheritance issue in in Java
