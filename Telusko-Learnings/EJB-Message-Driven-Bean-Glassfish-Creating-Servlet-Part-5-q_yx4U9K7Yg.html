using which you can achieve GMS service
so to send a JMS message what you can do
is so NetBeans provide your feature in
fact you can type all this statement by
yourself but I will take help of
NetBeans here so we'll say right click
insert code we'll click on you can see
there's option of send a JMS message so
click on send
Jamis message and we'll provide a
distinction name which is so a
destination you in fact we have to go
for message even beam and yeah so this
is my message even beam which is my beam
and that's it and click on ok so you can
see by defy it has given you something
what we'll do is we'll change the code
here well provide GMS demo the wind dust
which is proper let me remove this part
I will have my own connection settings
so we'll say add resources resources is
the annotation which provides you the
resources we'll say with a name so
mapped by the attribute so if you are
not good with this annotation part you
have to learn annotation so go to google
and search for the annotations so if
you're not familiar with the nutrition
it's ok because our main concern is not
annotation here is just this step we
have to use so that his source name is
forward my resource name it was JMS demo
and it was nothing ok so this was my
resource name now now we'll create a
object of connection factory so if you
remember from the last PPT we need to
create object of connection factory
we'll say it's queue ok let's import the
package from Java dot
Shia extremist okay so once you created
the object of Q you can now you can just
go down now you can see we have added
our extra method here so what we will do
is in this method we need to achieve
some tasks so first thing let's assume
achieve this message instead of we can
directly send a string here okay so once
you got this string now so there's an
error here let me remove this line okay
so let's start with these statements so
first thing the way to create object of
connection so once you get at your veto
connection factory let's create object
of connection which is fun and we'll say
it is the quotient null in fact we can
write everything in try block and catch
because I know there will be it will
expect us to write exception try catch
exhibition and we'll print the value of
a here and we can directly say instead
of saying null we can say it is Q object
name is Q here yeah I have created a Q
here so we'll say a Q so with the help
of with the object of connection factory
we can say Q dot create statement or
create connection let's import the
package control shift I so in that means
if you press control shift I it will
create the connection now let's create
the object of session so to get object
of session we'll say session as equal to
con dot so there is a method there is a
method called as create session let's
import the package so I get it Java X
dot j ml start session now once you've
got the orbit of session now so if it
let's go back to PPT
now if you remember so once you are done
with this connection factory then
connection session now next year since
we are inter sent the message we have to
say a message producer
so let's create a message for you sir
now so we'll say a message producer it's
an in blue class again it's an interface
I guess let me check yeah it's an
interface message but you say the
interface will gives name as MP equal to
to create the object of this message for
you sir we have to say s start a create
producer is an good message and way to
provide you a station name so from you
variable get a change in name it's here
so this is your destination name which
is Q so any message you sent to this
destination it will go to the queue next
to send a message we need to create the
object of text message so text message
is again inter interface so text message
is also interface will say TM equal to
to create the object of text message we
need to say s dot create text message
now what we can do is we can just simply
say we can set the text which is TM dot
so we need to set this text with this
message data so we'll say TM dot set
text okay we can simply say it a message
data and then we'll say MP dot so
there's a method call has said what to
send TM that's it if you call this
message it will send this data to your
JMS now so before going for that I will
simply say once you send the request I
just I need to call a method which is
send JMS so we call that method from
here and what will passes will pass the
data which is accepted which means to
accept from user so we'll say string STR
equal to request dot getparameter you
we'll enter data which is named that
name will go into STR and that STR will
go here so we'll say this is sto simple
and this STR will go inside this and way
to execute all the statement to sign
that data so now when we are once you
are done with this code now we will have
to run this so before running this let's
that running will do in the next part so
let's have a quick recap what we have
done we have created the we have created
these annotation which is the source
which which will map your queue with the
destination you have assigned in the GMs
service we need to provide a connection
factory object for the particular queue
and then we need to create a way to
create object of connection session
message producer text message now how to
deploy and run this code that we'll see
in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
