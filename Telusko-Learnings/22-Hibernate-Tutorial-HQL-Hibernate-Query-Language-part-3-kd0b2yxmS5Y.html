different areas for learnings and let's
continue with hibernate so in the last
video we have talked about hql right so
now you know how to use hql a different
language which is almost same like SQL
but we all love SQL is it exactly right
but let's say let's say if you want to
use if you want to use SQL in hyper that
is it possible let's try let's try so
what we do now is I will go here and if
you're filing a hql query let's go for
SQL query so what I want here is let's
say I have a student table right we have
done with that so interests when table
we have roll number we have name and we
have marks I want to print all the
students whose marks is more than 60 the
same query which we are done in SQL
let's see how to do it so when you work
with hql will you be create a query
object right but since we are using SQL
in hibernate we have to create object of
SQL query so looking for SQL query and
we'll say let's like let's say a query
name itself is query and then we have to
say session dot now in case of SQL we
have I mean hql we have used could
create query right here we have to use
create SQL query in which you have to
mention the query so I will mention a
query which is select again our favorite
query will say select star from student
and we specify a where clause we'll say
where marks is more than 60 and we are
done
it's so simple we can simply specify
select star from student where marks is
greater than 60 but how do you execute
this to execute this query we have to
again we have to use the same thing
which we have done in hql right which
will say earliest again the output will
be leashed right so we'll saliste
and we'll say students equal to let's
import the package for list that's done
and then we'll say query dot so this is
a methyl as list right but I have just
one query here if I say query dot least
and if you are getting the list
how can you fetch the values because
this is the least right if you if you
try to print C this will work I mean
this
you will get the output but that output
is there inside student and that just
does not least format how can you print
this elements okay so let's try the
problem is if you try to print this
values because the type of the least is
object right so if I say object o :
students students and if I try to print
the value will say print oh and if we
run this query you can see we are
getting all object reference type and
all the hash codes we don't want that
what we want is okay what we want we
want exact object right for that what
we'll to do is we have to specify that
we are using a list of students right so
when you say least often and how it will
work okay let me just think about it so
what we can do is we can say query dot
so we can specify add entity because
what you are getting is not normal thing
right we are getting an object of
student will say student dot class right
so we get student dot class now we will
be getting the students object and we
can typecast it here so we can say this
is not a normal thing this is a student
and we can change here itself we can say
what we are getting is not a normal list
but it's a list of student I hope this
will work now let's run this and here we
go can you see that we got the list of
student okay so that's how you can fetch
the you can you can work with SQL in
hibernate so we can specify a select
query which is your witch which is your
normal SQL query we can specify identity
by specifying what type of values you
are getting and you're getting a student
objects so that you can use typecast you
can use generics here which is student
and we can print all the values this is
one way now let's say you don't want to
print entire table you want to specify
specific columns so sure of using star
we can specify the columns here so let's
say I just want roll number and I want
marks I don't want names okay odd just
to change it let's say I want name but I
don't want roll number in this scenario
since we are not
fetching the entire student we cannot
typecast a good student right let's
remove that okay but I will work now so
I cannot even say identity student
because this is this by specifying this
you are saying I will be reading the
entire oh we are not getting that for
that if you want to specify okay before
that I have one more thing so this will
be not student this will be object and
here I can say okay how can you print it
now so what you have to do is when you
say you're fetching name and marks you
have to specify that we are getting two
things that means so when you execute
this name will have a value and the
marks will have a value right so name
and the value so it will be a key value
pair so it will be named as a label as a
key and then the name actual name will
be the value right and marks is will be
the key and the actual marks will be the
value for that but what you do is you
have to say query dot so there is a
method called as set result a
transformer in this you have to specify
criteria dot Allies to anything map what
it will do is it will convert your
output into map format okay so that you
can use it okay how do you do that so we
say from student every object will get a
map first you have to type crossed it
with map right
so once we got an object here we have to
typecast it okay we'll say map M equals
you will say oh but hold on always a
normal object right say typecast here
itself we have to say map let's import
the package for map okay now once you
got the map we can actually face the
values will say Oh dot get and you can
specify the key here the key is name
then we'll use a colon and then we say
Oh dot get okay not oh but M I made a
mistake here so it should be M m dot get
and you can specify marks
quite simple right so you got map and
you are getting the output will it work
let's try let's try and if I run this
query here it works right so that's how
you can use SQL in hql in hibernate SQL
in hibernate so that is your yeah one
more thing this SQL actually called as
native queries so this is called as
native queries okay so that's it we have
talked about SQL how to use SQL in the
hibernate so if you liked my video
