technologies are available with are you
but if something called us HBase and I
guess what'll be HBase it is Hadoop
database now I will equal a HBase when
we talk about SPF mechanisms DFS reduce
our file system so in NTFS or in fat32
what is your file txt file in case of
HDFS what is your file it is HBase you
can say HBase is same like a DBMS
relational database table column table
table column and row structure now HBase
in HBase we are in our DB what we use we
use SQL in HBase we don't use the
squirrel question is why
in fact HBase doesn't support SQL they
are same so it's like exactly same Monty
BMS supports or RDV support SQL HBase
doesn't support SQL question arise why
which because your our DB has rows and
columns called rows and columns in HBase
also you have rows and columns so in our
TV we have rows and columns which HBase
also we have those in columns now so
difference in our DB you have individual
columns in HBase also you have
individual products now the different
cell and odd DB you have rules here also
you have those the most difference here
you have individual roles only
individual rows and columns in our DB
you have individual columns here you can
have individual problem or combined
column
example let's say you have own number
you have name you have box so you have
individual column that means you can you
can differentiate between values but
HBase provides you a feature where you
can combine multiple columns and that
combination will be called as column
family an unfortunately SQL cannot
search for column family
it's column family so when our DB we
have rows and columns we use then in our
DB we use tables in HBase we use
something else columns are those and
columns but this column can help our
column family now let me talk about
these applications this applications are
normally build in Java but you can also
build H based application in technology
koalas have to so like Java we have
technology which is available now why do
you have ever when you can when you can
use Java is because the learning curve
of Java is very large example you want
to learn Java you should know C
programming we should know C plus then
you can launch our I'm not saying you
cannot learn Java directly but to learn
if efficiently you have to start with C
when you it will be helpful for you to
understand what is c plus plus then you
can learn java but let's say you want to
learn our technology only for HBase then
why to start with C programming till
Java even a given have to yeah so in
HBase what we have we have table
structure but this will be those in
columns difference will be we can take
it for them family and in this fallen
family all your data will be combined
here you have a dataset or data values
here you will be having a a topple one
data or topple a combined value
so basically SQL cannot walk with this
column family and that's why we cannot
use SQL then question arise what to use
I can be after you something called as
clear or you can build your own edgeways
application using Java which one don't
want to use MapReduce you can use Java
to fetch this data clear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
