this we'll talk about and up a bit wise
and up it in between or operator now
when you talk about bitwise so let's
take an example so let's say we have a
variable called as a and the value for a
is 21 and then we have a variable called
as B and the value for B is let's say 15
okay and when I say you are applying a
bitwise operator so first you have to
convert this number into a binary format
now when you convert a number 21 into
binary format or worldwide 21 let's say
25 or a bigger number so if you talk
about the binary format of big of 25
which is 1 1 0 0 1 okay that's the
binary format for 25 and let's go for 15
the binary format for 15 is 0 1 1 1 and
1 we have four ones so this is this one
is the money format for 25 this is one a
format for 15 now let's try to apply bit
work bitwise and operator so when I say
bitwise and it is this sign ok so this
is V twice and and this is bitwise odd
ok now when you apply B twice and so let
us say we have a variable called as C
and we'll say a and B now when you say a
and B the operation will be so what it
will it will do is let me write here
itself
when you apply this bitwise and operator
so it will check bitwise okay it will
compare all the values bitwise so in to
start with this value this first two
values so first two bits so when you
apply and so when you say and an is
actually so when I say and if both are 1
the answer will be 1 otherwise the
answer will be 0 ok so this is 1 and 0
tonsure will be 0 1 and 1 answer will be
1 0 1 will be 0 0 1 will be 0 and 1 1
will be 1 now this one double 0 1 is
actually a value
nine okay and now if I print the value
of C it should be nine okay so let's run
this and bingo the value is nine right
so that's how you're you use bitwise and
operator now let's use bitwise or
operator then case of or operator
something something will change and that
something is when you talk up when you
talk about our operator so let let's use
auto beta so in on if any of the value
is 1 it will be 1 again so let's say the
different let's so let's go for the next
combination for all is if both the
values are 0 then only 0 otherwise it is
1 ok let's take one more one more
combination so let's say your
combination is 0 and 1 so again it will
give you 1 so if if one of the one of
the value in combination is one answer
is 1 so here your 1 0 you have at least
one one right so it is one we have again
one we have one we have one and we have
one and this is a number this represents
again this is 31 so when I apply the or
operation here the value of C should be
21 or bingo this is 31 right so that's
how you use bitwise and operator and
which buys offered or operate on so
