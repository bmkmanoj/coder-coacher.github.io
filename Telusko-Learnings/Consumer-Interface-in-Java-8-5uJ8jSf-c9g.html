created a added list and in which you
have five elements and then instead of
painting that those elements with the
help of external four loops or normal
for loop and enhance for the what we are
doing is we are trying to print those
values using internal loop which is
available in Java 8 so whenever you work
with 4h you can also use something
called as lambda expression to print the
values so we have seen how for each
works we have seen how lambda works now
what we'll do in this video is we'll
let's we'll check how how this
expression works here because what we
have done is we have seen how how lambda
expression works with the help of or
normal interface so we have created an
interface which is a in which you had a
method which is show and then we are we
were trying to print the values of we
were trying to implement the interface a
with the help of lambda expression so
let's try to do it in this example so
what I will do is I will just remove the
extra code we just have a list of Ally
and or list of elements and then we have
we are just printing those values with
the help of and Hansford or not
announced for loop a for each loop so
now let's see how this thing exactly
works so when you walk with this for
each method it takes a parameter which
is the object of consumer so whenever
you write this statement here it's an
object of consumer ok so let me show you
something let me just come in this part
ok so whenever I work with it but if I
say values dot for each so you can see
we are get it says in order to walk it
for each you need to create object of
consumer so if I say enter it needs an
object of consumers let's say what is
consumer here so what I will do I will
go up and I will say consumer and since
we don't have the package let's import
the package here and it belongs to a
package which is Java dot util dot
function dot consumer again this package
was not there before it is available in
jar 1.8 it will ask you for the type of
the consumer time it will
empty and let's go back to consumer
interface so if you go to consumer
interface it says it's a functional
interface a good news for you whenever
you have a functional interface we can
use lambda expression so consumer here
is an interface and this T defines the
type so if your consumer is working with
integer so this will be integer here so
you can change this T to integer you can
make it float you can make it any type
of object you want now for this consumer
interface we have our metal which is
accept so this consumer method or this
consumer interface which is functional
interface which has only one method and
the name of that method is accept which
takes a parameter so in order to work
with consumer what we need to do is we
just have to create an object of
consumer force so how do it object of
consumer the problem is consumer is a
interface right so we need to create a
class first and we'll name this class as
cons imple which implements consumers
will say this is imple which will
implement consumer that's how you get
object right so we'll say this is
consumer and now since you are
implementing this method or implementing
this consumer interface way to define a
method which is
interface consumer inside this we have a
method which is public void except now
so if your consumer is walking with
integer so again you can see we are we
are asking for type here right so what
we'll do is we will mention we are
walking with integers and this except
method will take integer eyes depend
upon this type it will define this type
here and we need to we can do anything
with that now we can simply say s out
and we can print the value of I so for
given number you have to just print the
number that's it right so we have we
have care to the class which implements
consumer now here we need to create
object off instead of creating object of
okay let's do it later let's do it
outside so this good object of consumer
will say this is corn
I will just call this a consumer for
integers we'll say C equal to new now I
cannot get object of consumer way to
create object of cons
imple right that's how we do right
that's how we get object and then we can
mention here way to my dimension and
then we can pass C now what will happen
let us run this code so you can see it
it is printing the same values so
exactly it works us whenever you say for
H it will pass those five values one by
one to this object which is cons imple
object which implements consumer so for
each will fetch the first value which is
4 it will send this value for to the
accept method and then it we are
printing for next it will take 5 and
then this wire will be sent to accept
method and then we are printing 5 okay
white takes all integers because we are
mentioned integer here that's how it
walking right and if I run this code you
get five six seven eight five six seven
eight right now instead of using so you
can see we are using this object only
once this this object which is see
before that what let's let's modify
something let's before that let's do
something so we have this class here
which is used only once right so instead
of creating unnamed class or a class
which has a name will we can create an
anima
right I hope you remember and they in
inner classes we have talked about how
to create an object of interface so what
will do is will not do it here or we can
simply say it is consumer now you will
say we cannot create object of consumers
because consumer interface right but we
can provide the implementation here
itself we can mention we are working
with integers so that's integer for you
that's integer and we can we can define
that method which is public void except
which takes a integer parameter we'll
say into I and with this int I let me
print the value let's print I okay so it
takes so again we are doing the same
thing just we are not using extra class
we are doing everything in the same
class right so we are creating object of
consumer consumer C and we are creating
object in this way which in which you
have to provide the implementation of
the interface in which the method name
is except which takes the parameter I
which prints the value of I so the same
thing they have did with the earlier
class now this time if I if I say for a
25 pass C so initially I'm passing 4 so
this 4 goes to accept method and it
takes in parameter and it prints the
value then it takes 5 then it prints the
value takes 6 and then it goes on so
that's one way right now what we'll do
is if you if you just focus on this
example what is this this is anonymous
in your class right
and we are creating this anonymous in
the class with the help of consumer
interface so what we need is we can
simply if you focus on this line so this
is for sure as is functional interface
so this is obvious thing right so on the
left side we have consumer interest
interface or consumer integer C so on
the right side also will be having new
consumer and inside this consumer you
have only one method which is public
void accepts so why do we one write that
what we can do is we can just we can
remove this part here
we can remove this part and now since we
have removed that curly brackets let me
remove this one also okay now this this
is your method brackets okay and this is
the method definition so whenever you
have whenever you using something in
this way you have to use an adder which
defines that we are working with some
block so this is your a method parameter
and that's the block here now since we
have only one statement we don't have to
write this curly bracket so let me
remove this curly brackets even the
semicolon and we can write everything in
one line okay so we have written
everything on one line now when you have
when you have what when you have also
when you have integer here so when you
so when you say that we are working with
integer so why do you want mentioned
integer here we can remove that integer
this from this way and whenever you have
only one parameter you don't even
require these round brackets if you have
two parameters then you require those
round back is there so we can mention I
and we can provide the adder and the
implementation right so that means this
C is equal to this let me just run this
before going ahead if I run this code
you can see we got five six seven eight
or four five six seven eight so you can
see we are from the big implementation
of we are going for the small
implementation that is the advantage of
lambda expression right so you should
have passing this thing inside instead
of passing see here what if we can just
copy this part and paste it here so we
don't require this all thing and you can
see this line is equal to this line and
if I run this code you got the same
output so that's how you can use lambda
expression to work with collections and
you can use consumer interface which
takes up a diameter and prints it simple
right so that's it that's it from this
video so that's your dad's consumer
interface for you so if you have liked
