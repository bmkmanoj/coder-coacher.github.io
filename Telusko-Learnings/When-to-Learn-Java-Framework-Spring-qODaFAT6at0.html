Wendy and today we're going to talk
about what is the right time to learn a
new framework for Java
now I got this question for a long time
on YouTube on Facebook then when should
we start learning a framework I mean how
would you know that you are you know
either for coach I want to start
learning framework so first of all when
I say you want to learn Java we have two
different things here the first one is
the Java language the fundamentals of
Java and the technology Java technology
now if we talk about fundamentals of
Java which simply means you're learning
about Co Java you're learning about the
programming stuff right
how do you use form know how to use a DS
how to use connection API how to use
threads then once you complete the co
Java stuff okay when do you know that
you have convened kochava so once you
complete threads collection API then
exception handling then working with the
jacks or suffix programming so at that
point you know okay now you know Co Java
so what you want to learn now is the
advanced part by the java technology now
in java technology we have java web
technologies which is savage asp
right so you can learn some that you can
learn JSP now why do we need savages
fees because if you want to make a
website right let's say if you want to
make a dynamic website of course you
need savage ASP there
so we require kochava because that those
are the fundamentals if you want to
build website if you want to build a
dynamic website of course you have to
learn some JSP right but in Java we had
lots of frameworks Lloyd now if you
don't know this framework is framework
is basically a place where you will get
all the ready-made ready-made stuff it
will give you a design pattern of course
right if you want to be a good
programmer you should be good with
design pattern as well you should know
different design patterns available in
Java we have practice and pattern we
have we have creation design pattern in
that we have Factory we have abstract
Factory right then we have behavioral
design button so if you you when you
build a project you have to make sure
that you are using design patterns and
Wendy is a framework it will help you to
do that now for web technologies we have
Stoics framework in fact it's a world
framework but then B we were using
Scotchmen framework before if you want
to go for data base if you have a object
if we have a data base if you want to
connect this
- we have hybrid framework then we also
have a spring framework now spring is
one of the best frameworks available for
Java now so if you want to learn one
framework you think which you can do
everything you can learn spring example
in spring we have different modules we
have spring code which deals with code
Java we have I mean Kochiyama means when
I say object creation dependency
injection so all those things are
available using spring code let's say if
you want to make a website if you want
to make a website using sub a JSP you
can also use spring MVC so spring MVC
provides you a frame where you can learn
you can use that in spring we have
spring ORN we can connect hibernate and
spring together so it's a very big
framework so if you want to learn a
framework now the best one would be go
for a spring framework but question
arise how do you know when to start
learning spring framework I would say
you know its spring framework is
actually very big framework if you just
go to spring dot IO website if you go to
the project tab there if you click on
that they will give you a list of
modules available do we to learn
everything of course not you should not
learn I mean you don't need to learn all
the available modules in spring but then
there are some basic modules which you
have to learn an example Spring
Framework which includes spring code or
spring MVC yes you have to know that we
have spring boot now in fact if you
learn spring boot it will make your
software terrible experience very very
easy the thing is when you build a
project that lots of stuff included
right you have to create a project
structure you have to add dependencies
there's a lot of things which you have
to do even you have to configure the
application you can do all those things
with the helper spring boot ok but again
the question remains when to start
learning this so first of all out of all
these modules have to select which
modules you have to learn example if you
want to learn only spring code where you
have to use dependency injection what
you can do is learn code Java threads
exception handling collection once you
do that you can go to spring code okay
so first complete kochava till threads
and then you can jump to spring code so
now what you know is Unix
you know code Java and you know spring
code and luckily I do have videos on
spring code on YouTube then if you want
to go ahead let's say if you want to
make a website of course you have to
learn a servlet and JSP because those
are the what is the de factos
for Java web technologies so sublet is
something which you always use even if
you have launched stores even if you
have learned spring before or maybe
spring and miss you if you have seen any
example there you can see we don't have
any sublet thing there but still in the
back end what works is solid because
Tomcat only supports sublet right so
first you have to learn sublet then you
have to learn JSP after that you can go
for spring and BC in fact you can also
launch spring the best but I would
suggest before landing spring rest get a
feel of rest api i mean how exactly this
API works how exactly we implement rest
api with the help of Jersey framework so
what you can do is you can I do have a
videos on REST API right so watch those
some does not all everything is there
but then once those videos first you
will get the idea how rest works on
Jersey so that you can learn spring rest
right so again so code job if you are
done coach are you can go for spring
code of some a JSP you can learn spring
MVC and for left learn rest API to learn
spring rest
next is hibernate now once you know JDBC
once you know that JDBC in Java you can
learn - it as well the only thing is you
should know you should be also doing
about the database side I mean lots of
people they ignore this thing they think
we are programmers we don't need to have
a knowledge about programming or
database and that's not the case I
should know database as well so you have
to improve your skills on database so
once you learn code Java once you learn
JDBC batida base of course you should be
knowing and then you can learn hibernate
now once you know hibernate what you can
do is you can implement spring ORM right
so once you know hibernate so once you
know kochava once you know JDBC once you
know hibernate you can go for spring o
RM and you can connect spring
applications with high point application
it will be an awesome thing if you just
want to see the right live example you
can just go on off my so we have a
videos on spring hibernate integration
on youtube you can watch that video and
you will get to know how exactly it
works right it's awesome so we have all
those things now once you know all these
things you can learn you can go with any
spring base module example if you want
to go for spring scala of course why you
shouldn't be doing Scala
so what's a like time off yourself let's
come back to the base topic what's the
right time of starting a learning a
framework so once you know kochava you
can start with the learning framework as
well and then if you want to learn
spring everything should know some JSP
as well so that's how it goes okay
now in the can be learned spring
framework without running code Java we
can try you know in fact I was thinking
about this to make a video for those
people who don't even know Java can you
learn directly spring framework because
I mean of course when you join a company
you have to work on spring framework so
can you be done spring framework without
core Java we can try ok so I'm thinking
about making us CDs I mean not now it
will take some time
well I will teach you spring boot ok
because playing boot is damn easy to
work with and without having any core
Java knowledge let's try with that you
can also learn spring good time we see
without knowing some a JSP again we'll
see that how it works ok so the basic
thing is if you want to event to start
for learning framework once we know Co
Java you can start with any framework if
you have any more questions let me know
in the comment sections and I hope you
