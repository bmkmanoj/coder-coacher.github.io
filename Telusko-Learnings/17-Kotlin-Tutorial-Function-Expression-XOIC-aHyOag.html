enjoyed different social learnings and
in this video we'll talk about functions
now in Java we normally call them as
methods right but then in Scotland we
can call those methods because
ultimately your job you're caught in
code gets converted into Java code right
but then we use this fun keyword right
which is also defined search functions
so when you purely looking at Cortlandt
you can say these are functions but then
if you are somewhere running java with
codling together of course we will call
it the methods of course when you
convert this code you will be getting a
main method right so yes so you can call
them as methods you can call them as
functions but just for time being I will
name the I mean I will I will use a term
called as method today I will call them
functions now why do we need functions
first of all whenever you want to divide
your modules if you want to let other
functions do the task that's better to
go for functions right because you will
be dividing your tasks in a particular
way so that when you work on it you will
not feel a burden you will not feel that
everything in one thing and again the
most important part when it comes to
functions is you can reuse them now how
do you define a function zero so it's
very easy what you can do is let's say I
want to add two numbers let's go for
typical example here so if you want to
add two numbers it's very easy you can
define a function and you can say you
can define a function with the help of
fun keyboard again programming in
Cortland is actually fun
then you will say a function name as we
define that in math in Java as well in
fact every programming language we have
to define methods now this add method
will takes two parameters right so let's
let's pass two parameters there I would
say this is a that's my first parameter
and the type of a here is ain't alpha
before second parameter which is B and
the type of B again is int now this
function which takes a and B as a
parameter it will add those two numbers
so what we can do is we can say println
and we can print the output of those two
which is a plus B right again SEMICON is
not compulsory here now how do you call
that method so we can simply say add and
we can pass those two values 4 comma 5
and our job is done right so if you run
this code of course we'll be getting the
output
as nine let's run this code let's see
what happens and as you can see we got
the output here which is nine right our
job is done that means when you add
these values which is add four comma
file you will be getting the answer
which is nine and that's easy now we can
pass some other values we can try it out
we can write whatever whatever way we
want so that's how you can add two
values or that's how we can create a
create a function now here's the twist
the twist is what if I don't want to
print the values here itself I want them
to return return the value because
that's what functional programming
believes right you should not use it not
the function should be something which
takes input which does some processing
it gives you output right it should not
create any side effect whenever you
whenever you try to print something on
the console it's also a side effect
right in fact you might be you might be
doing some you magic printing on console
you might be entering data in the
database you might be doing some file
handling so those are side effect right
but when it comes to returning the
values so I believe in a function should
always return a value because that's
what make your system stable so what you
should be doing is instead of adding
those two values I mean of course you
should add those two values here but
instead of printing them here itself
what we'll do is we'll say hey I don't
want to bring those two values I want to
simply say a plus B I want to return the
value okay but to return a value we have
to give a written type here right so
when you don't mention a written type it
means you don't want to return anything
if you want to return something you have
to give a colon and you have to mention
int now the problem is we have to return
you have to use those special keywords
which is use in Java as well which is
written statement so you have to use a
return keyword here to return the value
and now this one it returns you a value
right so of course you will store it
somewhere so I will say where result
equal to I will say add a 4 comma 5 and
then later we can print the value and
then we can print the value here itself
right so this function here is actually
not printing anything it is just reading
the value and that's what your function
should do let's run this let's see or
we'll give a different value this time
we'll go for 8 and 5 just to see if you
are getting different output and let's
wait for the output here
as you can see the got the output I've
studied so yeah that works so instead of
printing that value here itself we are
returning the value but don't you think
of instead of writing this I mean if we
just have one statement right that -
which is returned so can we just write a
function which will return a value
directly something our inline function
is it possible can we write our inline
function in Kotlin let's try it out so
whatever you do is okay now we cannot
call this an inline function but then
you know it we can write in one line so
what I'm thinking is what if after this
ain't we can give equal to or maybe a
function expression you can call it as
because this function will return our
expression so instead of doing all this
return statement what if we can simply
say equal to a cup a plus B so whatever
value you are getting you just need the
written written value of that right why
you have to write a return keyword why
you have to open the curly brackets
right so this is the awesome thing about
about Kotlin now you might be wondering
this is awesome yes this is also
possible in Java as well but then you
know we have to go in interface way we
have to create the interface we have to
define the method of the interface using
lambda expression right so we can do
that as well in one line in Java but
then this is also possible here okay so
now let's try to run this code let's see
but again we'll go for different values
just to prove that this works let me
just run this code and here we go
we got the output as 15 so this works
right so we can write this in one line
let's go for another function let me
just add one more function here now this
time I will go for a maximum of two
values right this is what we do in every
programming language every C language
C++ or Java you must have learned the
programming language with the same
examples right
addition of two numbers finding the
maximum number and then in future maybe
you'll be having find the maximum of
three numbers right so let's go for two
numbers let's say we have a function
which is max now this max function was
written you a maximum value of course we
have to take two parameters here again I
will go for ain't a int comma B int now
how do you return our maximum value so
of course when you when you have done
something you have to mention I want to
return our int value now how do you
check so of course we have to use ifelse
right now
in if what we'll do is we'll say if a is
greater than B I will return I will
return a right and then else will return
B now this is what we can do here right
but then okay let's let's let's check if
it is working here instead of calling
the add method I will call or add
function I will call max function by
passing these two values 8 and 7 of
course I am expecting answer 8 here
let's run this and yes we got the output
as 8 that's great
we want we got what we wanted here even
if you change the values this will work
button don't you think we have seen if
expression before so instead of
returning like of written keyword and
can we just write it in one line the
same way we have date for a plus B and
yes that's possible what we can do is we
can keep a equal to symbol here and we
can say if a is greater than B in this
situation written a else written B right
and trust me you will not miss your
ternary operator here right so you can
die you can die clear-eyed if else in
one line
now that's this is an awesome thing you
know to achieve something like this so
yes we got ad we got Max and we are able
to find a village ago we have not tried
this yet so what I will do is I will
change this value to maybe a 65 and
let's run this now let's just run this
code let's see what happens and we got
the answer which is 65 years so when you
compare 8 and 65 of course to 65 but
Gators right and you got the max value
so this is how it works but then I have
a question what if you want to call this
from a java code because again this is
the cott link code right and we have
used method x a function expression here
a function which returns a value but
using equal to symbol does it work with
java as well as we have mentioned in the
earlier videos that Java and Kotlin they
are 100% into interoperable what about
this equal to how about these functions
can we call this from a Java function if
we can if we can the question arise
whenever Java calls a function a
function should be a
part of a class-wide it can be a
non-static method it can be a static
method but if you look at these methods
here we have not defined this in any
class right you can see these functions
are open we have not defined them in any
class how can you call these functions
which are not defined in any class
that's the challenging part right but
how to solve that that we'll see in the
next video so I hope you liked this
