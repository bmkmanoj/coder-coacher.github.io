talk about network security and this is
the second video of this series now as
you know we have already discussed about
network with already spoke about
security right so in our introduction we
have talked about network we have talked
about security they have talked about
how to secure your data why to secure
your data all those things right
so in this will actually start with the
first chapter okay and the first chapter
its attacks on computers and computer
security okay so so for this we have to
see if we talk about computers we if we
talk about networks we have to secure
them right and if we talk about security
we have different models the first topic
we are discussing is security models so
what is the quixote model so we have
basically we have four security model
first you can provide security with no
security it's something like if you if
you show there is nothing important here
if you if you're not trying to secure
that thing it signifies that's nothing
more important there so once the
advantage is if somebody want to if
somebody wants that data they will think
it's not that important because there is
no security right so you can secure
something with no security I know you
can also connect up security so security
through obscurity because there's
something important but you're showing
without applying security that is not
important so for a person who want to
hack it he will think it's not important
so he will not hack it so it's not part
by then we have something this host
security now see we talk about computer
it's also called as host so protecting
your computer or making your computer
secure is making your host
secure so first thing no security
second one is security with off security
and third one is post security and the
last one is network security to protect
your whole system to protect your all
the computers in unit well you have to
secure your network so because they're
getting your hosts you are securing your
hosts if you're securing your network
you are securing all the hosts in that
network right so again we have the
level so if you talk about small simple
levels we have to secure the hosts if
you're not going complex level you have
you can secure your network then then we
have something called as principles of
security now the second topic is
principles of security now if we talk
about principles of security there are
certain principles we have to consider
the first the first principle is
confidentiality so what is
confidentiality it's something like
there is something called as normal data
there's something called as critical
data so if my normal data is kept or it
is somebody has hacked my system Isis is
taking all my normal data it's okay
because those data's are normal but if
somebody tried to hack my critical data
so that's critical right so in that
critical part we have two parts we have
personal data we have confidential data
personal means like individual have
personal data or if you talk about
commercial people they have confidential
data so like my company's password my
company's and will live in you my
company's on and will salary
and will growth it's this all are
confidential right so I don't want
anyone to hack that system and they can
take this confidential data so if
somebody that suppose if I'm say I'm
sending a mail to my friend and somebody
tried to hack it or try to try to see
what I'm sending to him it's there I'm
losing my confidentiality next is let's
suppose if I send my data to my friend
and somebody in between changes the data
or they know did that data it is called
as integrity problem so my data is not
integrity right now it's not going for
and it's not going in integrate format
because I am sending something else and
he's getting something else if I'm
sending if I'm sending five and he's
getting six so the data is not integrity
so it's not it's not following integrity
right then we have something for us
authentication what is at Otakon
authentication there are sort of certain
things like some features there are some
features which will be only be used by
some authorized person right example if
if
have an account of Facebook's only I can
use it because it's my account right
nobody else can update my profile like
only I can update my profile I can
change my DP I can change my profile pic
nobody else can change my profile pic
it's because when I use my Facebook
account I have to log in right I have to
show them I'm the authorized person of
this account so I have to debit check
the account ocation right and yeah then
we have non-repudiation what is
non-repetition
it's something like it's something like
a thing in this way if if I see to my
bank transfer this amount to this person
let's suppose I'm only transferred
10,000 rupees from my account to my
friend's account and if I say this to my
bank using some instructions and my bank
transfer that I'm on to my friend's
account after a while I cannot I cannot
say I have not I have not told you to a
transfer you have to you have done it by
yourself what to want to prove the bank
have that I have told them to do it
so that comes under non-repetition right
so again a where to read all this thing
we have to from which book I am
referring all this thing since I am only
talking right so what you can do is
again you can take this book the book
name is a to the cohutta's so this is
the book this is the second edition you
can see second edition of cryptography
and network security from Ithaca hotel
so I'm referring this book okay so when
I say you something you just change your
pages you will see the topics and there
is some points there so it's easy for
you if you take the book see my video
and try to try to match it so there's
something called as confidentiality
there's something called as integrity
there's something authentication and
non-repudiation then we have two more
one is access control and availability
No Deal access control let's suppose if
I have a server I have a big server in
that server I have multiple features and
for normal users I want to assign only
certain features not all features so
what I can do is I can keep the access
control so this user can do this thing
this is again take this thing right
because if a normal user get all the
privileges they might have some chances
that he his intention will change
with that it will delete all the data so
we don't want that part right so what we
can do is we can give certain
restrictions all we can we can have
certain privileges okay then then okay
then we have availability availability
now what is availability if let's
suppose a want to access a resource if I
want to access a resource suppose some
features and somebody stop stopping me
to use that you so the example I am
assigned a job in that job I have to
calculate things so it so to use to act
to calculate those thing I need a
calculator so in my Windows system I
have a feature of calculator so I'm
trying to open that Calcutta using
command from self in command Rama time
typing CA LLC so it means calculator so
it should open the calendar right but
the problem is if somebody tried to stop
me if somebody writes some written some
code and trying to stop me that comes
under availability problem right so and
that feature is not available to me
since I have I got the privileges but
still because of some problem not not
able to have to take the axis okay then
we have the next topic you have ethical
and legal issues now it is the thicker
line Englishness not thing about this
you're walking your have you have your
gmail account you have your Google
account you have your Facebook account
right now what we claim we access we use
every feature for free we use Google for
free we use Facebook for free you use
YouTube for free
then how they are they aren't from
advertisement right they aren't from
advertisement you see those ads on your
Google you see so those ads on Facebook
you see ads on YouTube so those company
earn from ads
we enjoy for free they earn from ads
it's all together we have win-win
situation they are on the winning side I
am on the winning side winning side is
because I am getting the service for
free and winning for them is because
they are showing us the ads and they are
earning from those companies like if on
Google if I'm getting a dove
reading add of Toshiba so Toshiba is
paying Google Google is giving that
service for free okay so the thing is
now if we talk about Google search now
if you talk about Facebook this services
are like they are free they are free
right so if you talk about this service
which are free like think about this do
if those services are free there is some
way your data is this is given to
Toshiba please because now we want some
customized searching right now if then
suppose if I'm getting ads for for
Johnson baby care I don't have a baby
I'm not a baby so what why I am getting
that ad soft babe Johnson baby can bite
so if let's suppose in future out of ten
years if after five years if I have a
baby right and if I have a baby at that
time I'm getting that those ads of
Johnson baby care it's makes sense right
so that means the ad should be short
those people who want that term
not everyone I don't want that add up
Joe Johnson baby can wait I don't want
ad off of girls do I don't want ad off
especially hey guys because I don't have
it so I don't want those ads I want ads
of laptops I want add some mobile I want
add some books I want ads of maybe a
menu or clothes right so those ads are
called as personalized ads or customized
ads so how will Google knows about this
so what Google will do Google will check
who are you what's your agenda
what do you where you work what do you
do what's your passion everything they
will know they come they know all this
because of your Google search because of
your Gmail account Google because of
your G+ account so don't they know
everything I didn't hear or they know
all these things but they know all this
thing they will sell this data to
Toshiba company so that they can send me
ads all right
in fact last week I was searching for a
laptop on Flipkart
so I have an account a standard chatted
bank and I have live cut account and I
don't know how they merge together I was
searching for a laptops on my flip card
and suddenly next I'm getting a mail
from a bank so that saying that buy a
laptop from Flipkart you will get 20%
off my bank is sending my mail it's
awesome right your data is exchanged
between Flipkart and bank it's a privacy
issue right my data flip card is sending
to my bank my bank is hitting those into
the flip card it's a privacy so right so
I don't want my privacy to get hurt so
that's why we have some ethical and
legal issues first your privacy should
not go problem should not go in it
should not have any if your hash should
not have any issue with privacy you
should not have any property a problem
with the accuracy is because if I
haven't said I'm updating my profile on
Facebook it should be accurate right
they should not change anything like if
I am saying my phone number is this they
should not change my phone number
it's because it's my data next is
property you are photos your information
is your property like let's suppose if
your photos easel is used by Google for
searching it's it's illegal right and
yeah and accessibility it's your data
should be accessible to you it's not it
like if you're uploading a photo on go
on Facebook and Facebook says now this
photo is ours
you cannot delete this photo you can
delete your photo right because it's
your property so this this is what we
have some legal issues we have legal
issue with privacy we have bigger issues
with accuracy we have bigger issues with
property and accessories then we come
with tens we come towards attacks now
what is tag attack is something like
your ring attacking a system okay so if
you attack a system if your diagram
meter system you can attack a normal
system you can attack humans so if we
talk about this attack attack normally
classified to two parts one is passive
attacks and his active attacks now what
is passive passive is something like a
sender and receiver they don't get hurt
the message is let's suppose if a sends
message
to be a sense message to be but let's
suppose see tried to check want the
messages being sent that is called as
passive attack but let's suppose if a
send message
he is sense a message to be as hello how
are you and see takes that data and
delete that part which he deletes hi so
that is called as active attack you are
changing something with the message but
when you talk about this theoretical
point of view or general view you have
three types of attacks one is criminal
attack second is publicity attack and
third one is bigger type so if we talk
about the criminal type it is like oh
you want you want some cash from this
bank you are attacking that server to
get cash it's your criminal activity
right second is your publicity attack
it's something like you are there in the
server not for your benefit but to get
publicized you know in headlines we'll
be having a news mr. nubbins Whitney has
hacked this account publicity I do I
have not got any money or any cash from
it but I got the publicity next is
leavin italics its nigga attack means
you know we have some hackers some
security professionals now they can hack
facebook server they can hack Google
server they can hack your house over but
no one can stop them because they are
doing in legal way they are finding the
flaws they are finding loopholes of
these servers okay so this is developed
ax so basically my talk about attacks at
criminal publishes publicity and legal
attacks okay and yeah I'm remaining part
will see in next video so stay tuned to
subscribe for the further videos thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
