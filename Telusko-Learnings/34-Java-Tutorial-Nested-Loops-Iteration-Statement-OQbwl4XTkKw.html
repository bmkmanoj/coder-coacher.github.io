so once we know how Luke works let's
talk about nested loops now what exactly
nested loops are what I want to do now
is I want to print something like this I
want to plane star star star star again
this comes under logical patterns okay
so based on this video you'll be getting
also assignment we saw your four stars
there we want to print this right I want
to play in this format now for sure when
you want to print only one star here so
let's focus on Lee on one star
so the first target we have here is to
print those four stars
the condition is using one statement you
can only print one star so what I will
do if I say system dot out dot print not
print Ln make sure when you when you
write this you have to make it print
when you say only one printer to write
this code you can see we only got only
one star which is this star I want four
stars why so I have to write this table
four times redundancy right so whatever
you I will I will use a for loop and I
will name this loop as J loop again you
can't a with any name and I will start
this J loop from 1 to 4 and then J plus
plus so if I want this code now since
you have a for loop here let me just use
some tiny packets also so if I on this
for now you can see we got four stars
because we are executing the statement
for time but hold on I don't want just
for star I want the complete box right
so that means after every fourth block
after every fourth I mean fourth star I
want to print a new line because the
next the next statement should be on the
new line so I'm putting a new line there
and I want to execute the same stuff for
four times you can see I want four lines
right so I want to execute the same step
four times we can again apply a for loop
here which will execute the inner for
loop four times so I will say I equal to
1 I less than equal to four and I plus
plus okay we can just provide a proper
formatting now again we can do
formatting with the help of control
shift F in Eclipse or you can simply say
tab even that will do and if you run
this code now you can see we are getting
this box structure here okay so that's
how you can apply a loop inside a loop
again this can be done with the help of
while loop it can be done with the help
of do-while loop it can be done with the
help of fondue so that's how we use our
normal for loop or a nested nested for
loop and in Java so
yeah that's it because of I mean from
this we will be getting lots of
assignment let me do let me give you one
code here if I just want to plain number
so I will spin I will simply print J
okay so what it will do is it will print
all the J value example the I will start
with one and then J will start with one
and then it will print the first value
of J as one and then it will it will go
it will increment in do and the J value
becomes two now so it can feel print
this it will become two again it will go
it will go on the J value becomes three
it will print three the J value becomes
four it will print 4 as soon as this
condition gets false it will print a new
line and that's why we are getting the
next output on the new line and it will
go back to this now I becomes 2 now as
soon as your eye becomes 2 your J again
will start with one and that's why you
can see we are getting one so the inner
loop executes multiple times to give you
one more thing here in a week we have
seven days right so in one week we have
seven days and in shop if ensure of
naming the days we can number the days
let's say Sundays day one and the
Monday's day two and Tuesdays day three
in that case so on Sunday when your eyes
won the 12th art will be the first are
then you'll be getting in second or
third are then once you complete 24
hours your day will change the day will
become second day and again the number
of us will start with one right again
we'll be having second all will be
having third are so every day we have to
in four hours something it will work
something in that way you nested loops
so that's it
based on this we'll be adding some
assignments so all the best it's time
for assignment aliens now based on the
logic which we have seen in the for loop
behind this is nested for loops right so
you need to build a code where you can
try into one two three four and then you
have to plane 1 2 3 4 5 and then 1 2 3 4
5 6 in fact let's make a proper tree
here so we say 1 2 3 and 1 2 and then 1
so this is what you need to plant using
that nested for-loops this is the first
pattern you have to parent you can also
print that with therefore all stars so
you can so there are two different
questions one you have to print one two
six and one you have to print with stars
then another one will be bit complicated
but not that much we'll say a bee
then we have to say a B and C this is
where you can use the ASCII values to
print this value
yeah so you can convert the ASCII value
into int into character it will work
then the next one would be you need to
print this pattern now this is bit
complicated but it's worthwhile so you
just try this
so print dollar and then a dollar and
then a dollar so you have to basically
you have to build a box of dollars so
these are the three assignment question
you have for this video now how do you
upload this assignment so whatever it
suggests is as a developer you need to
also know how to upload videos on github
now if you don't know I have a video on
how to deploy a project from eclipse to
Kitab you can watch that video and share
so this is where you can send your
assignments or maybe the best way would
be legs submit your link or the comment
section so that everyone will see your
assignments so that's it if they can
help you so does it run this with you
thanks so much for watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
