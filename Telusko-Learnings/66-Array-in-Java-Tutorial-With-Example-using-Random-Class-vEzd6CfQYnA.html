we have assigned the values from one to
five to an added right now so this time
what we'll do is we'll try to assign
some random values instead of taking a
day off five let me take an array of 20
values and all these 20 values should be
a random value so the range of this
values should be from 1 to 50 but to do
that we have to use a class in Java
called as random class so when you want
some random values so Java provides your
class colors random and this class
belongs to a package called as Java dot
util okay so let's name it as our equal
to new random and that's it
so we'll say random are equal to new
random now in order to assign the random
values what we can do is instead of
saying I equal to I plus 1 what we can
do is we can say are equal to there is a
method called as next int now the value
of the maximum value I want is 50 right
so we can say next int or it should be
lesser than 50 I found this code so
instead of getting this values what will
be getting is all those random values
from 1 to 50 so if I run this so these
are my values
it's just charged with 0 so it will
start from 0 1050 so this is this is how
you have to print all those random
values so to use random random is a
class in PD class in Java which belongs
to our package call this Java dot util
dot Java dot util package and this class
has multiple methods you can use next
and you have for many other methods to
use okay and all right now let's say I
want to assign 50 values so what we can
do is we can just say 50 and that's it
and I will get all those 50 values so if
I run this you're getting here 50 values
so this is how you have to assign a
random value to an adding even you can
pick up any value so if I say s out you
can say if I want to fetch the 25th
value so we have to write a of 24 so
somewhere down a starting starting point
will be the 24th element so if I run the
now I would put LC she studies the 24th
element you have so you can you can pick
the middle value you can print all the
values and you can use something called
assigned m+</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
