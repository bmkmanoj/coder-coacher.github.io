we'll talk about des algorithm so des
works with symmetric key now to
implement des it's actually very simple
since we need a plane - we need a key
- John with a ciphertext what Java does
is it has inbuilt libraries or in build
packages to give you those keys and then
you can do encryption and decryption
with those keys okay so let's try to
improve on that
so for that let me create a Java class
here and we'll name this our class as
des next and we'll do yeah okay okay so
what we need first is we need a main
function here so we'll say P V SVM tab
it will give your main main method okay
we need two things we need a plaintext
and we need a ciphertext so we have
string PT and spring city soap it is
your plain text and city is your
ciphertext now next thing is if you look
at Fiona encrypt this plain text -
cipher text what we need is a vendor key
right again the DES goes with 56 bit key
so we don't I don't want to create those
keys right so I want Jaguar to give me
that key so for that we have a class in
Java called a secret key which will give
me the give me the key again how to
import the package if you say control
space here it will fetch that key from
this sacred key sick this package our X
dot crypto so we'll say it is as key ok
now I need to take input from user so
we'll use buffer so again you can take
it from users using buffer time bin will
go for the direct data so I will say my
plaintext is what I will go with my name
I mean 20 okay so my plaintext is now in
20 and
okay now we need to get where to get an
object of this key right again I guess
this is not a class it's an interface
right so he secured he is an interface
that means to create object of this
interface we have to use some some class
or one class which has implemented this
secret key and the class which has
implemented this is your key generator
so using key generator you will get the
object of secret key now again key
generator if you want to get object of
key generator
it's a singleton class which means
whenever you want to create object of
key generator you have you have you have
to gate you have to use a function
called as get instance because we want
to get only one object off with it that
is a singleton class so we have to use
get instance we cannot use new key
generator here again what you think that
in class you can go you can go to
youtube and you can search about
singleton class okay so time beam will
go for this key generator dot get
instance which will give me the object
now it will ask me which object you need
I will say I need object of I need a key
for DES so we already specify the
algorithm name here which is DES and
then we'll see when say I need a key for
that so generate key simple right
so this generate key will actually give
me the object of secret key so if I
check let's go here it says it will
return it will return you can see this
it's public final cigarette-case it will
give me object of secret key okay now I
guess there will be some yeah so we have
I checked exceptions here which means
there is a possibility that this
algorithm does not exist for that it
will give generate an error so we have
to say if those exception okay so for
check take sections check checked
exceptions you have to go for through
those exception there okay now once you
got the key once you've got the
plaintext you can actually find this I
for text now and to find the cipher text
will say do encrypt as we have done last
time also so doing it will pass two
parameters here first will pass or
plaintext and then we'll pass a key
so that it would it will do some
operations and duplicate the ciphertext
okay once you call the cipher text will
print a ciphertext so we'll say s tau
tab and we'll say city
so after encryption you have you will
get the cipher text and then you have to
plain say T now question arise what will
be the operations in do encrypt method
right so let's define that method again
it should be static a string do encrypt
oh do I encrypt it will take two
parameters one will be string PT and
second will be string key no string
gauge this time it is secret key secret
key key okay now what next
okay so if you have a cigarette key key
here now
now to find ciphertext once you do all
the operations you will get ciphertext
right so for that we have to create
object of cipher
again this cipher is a singleton class
so that means to create object out this
cipher we have to use cipher dot get
instance and this year in this you have
to pass the algorithm name which is
again des but there is a possibility
that this algorithm does not exist so it
will generate an adder so we'll say it
throws exhibition okay then now once you
got this object see we have to
initialize this object and to initialize
we'll say C dot in it
this will initialize initialize your
cipher text but when I talk about the
cipher block you can kill you can you
can create cipher block for two purpose
one for encryption second for decryption
to specify this cipher block will work
for encryption you have to say you have
to use a constant which is called as
encrypt mode and which belongs to a
class first cipher so we'll say cipher
dot and grip mode and then you have to
pass a key now why and creep mullen key
because one cipher block
only for one mode and works only for one
key plaintext much might maybe maybe
different but mode and key will be same
for one block now to do these operations
with the ears first we have to convert
your plain text into a byte code or a
byte format because des algorithm works
on blocks so what we do is we have to
create a byte array for that and we'll
name this by today as my PT bytes next
now to convert this bit into bytes will
say that I actually get bytes which will
convert this into white format but again
invites also you have different formats
and one of the format is utf-8 so time
bit for example we are going for
inputting format as utf-8 then now once
you got your plain text in byte format
once you go to your cipher block now we
can go for actual operations and that
operation is we'll say finally do
encryption so we will say do final do
final on what on petabytes so it will
apply those operation on petabytes and
it will give you a cipher blocks
trying to stow that cipher blocks will
again create a byte array and will they
will name this as e and C as an encoding
cipher again object name can be anything
so time when I'm going for a and C which
means encoded cipher now since it is in
encoding encoded format we have to
convert that cipher into string now how
to convert that into a string format
this way simple will say string STR
equal to neo string and in bracket we
can pass a and C simple right and
finally what we'll do is we'll say
return STR now it should work right
almost we have done everything we have
done the encryption part and then we
have returned C T and then we are
printing city here now let's take its
work if it's box so I take and run now
ignore the background sound it's my
nephew who is making all the sounds
it's running okay and this is the
encoded format right again now you can
see we have something called as e and B
you can see something this is all a
cipher text but problem is what is this
box the problem is when I talk about
this string format it only works with
ASCII values that is there is the
possibility that this encoded format is
not asked representation so for that
this will not work because of this thing
it's giving me those box to actually
convert that encoded format into a
readable ASCII formats because it is
unreadable format now to make it
readable we'll have to use something
called as base64 which will convert your
data into a readable format so we have a
class called as base64 encode err and
this object has a method called as
encode and when which you have to pass
your a and C now also don't do this it
will convert your text into editable
format
let's see some warning ok and let's run
this file now I can't will give you
ciphertext but this time it is a
readable format now you can read there's
no box here this is hypertext which is a
digit readable format right it's so
simple so this is how you find
encryption and decryption so this we
have done bit on the encryption part
what if you wanna go for decryption so
it's way simple again you have to go for
plaintext equal to do decrypt and then
you have to say CT comma key all right
now so we have to define this method
here so we'll say it's a static so
static string to decrypt and we'll say
string city comma secret key I will say
keep a typo
okay there might be some chances that
will give you exceptions by let me take
this okay now what next we have to do
all this all the same opticians right
that just the difference will be your
show going for the encryption well this
time we'll go for decryption mode that's
it go for it
the steps are simple first we have to
create object of cipher which is cipher
C and then we have to go for cipher dot
get instance and this you have to
mention the algorithm my name which is
des and then we'll say C dot in it again
as you know the difference is this time
we have to go for the decryption mode
suit cipher dart decrypt mode and then
you have to specify the key now once you
can once you have visualized your cipher
block for decryption mode the first step
you have is you have to convert your
ciphertext which is a string format to
are in great format because again to do
the decryption part you have to apply
decryption mode on cipher blocks which
is byte blocks so I'm going to convert
that into byte blocks we have to use the
same we can use the same keyboard or
same words so we'll say new at this time
we have to convert from string to bite
right last time we have converted from
byte format of byte encoded format to
string format that's why we have based
encoder this time we are converting your
string into byte format that's why we
have to use something called as base64
yeah I guess was right it was it will be
decoder and then we have to say we don't
have a decode method we have a decode
before in which you have to pass your CT
so this cipher string will convert it
into and cut it encoding bite a bite
format now what next we have to do again
same step we have to do for final it
will do the encryption so a decryption
on a and C and then you will get a bite
format of byte array as you have done
last time so again we'll name this as
petabytes
now once you've got the petabytes now we
have to convert this plaintext also the
plane bytes into a string this time we
can directly use STR equal to new string
because by by default it is in readable
format right okay now what we have to
convert we have to convert VT bytes in
which format you have to mention utf-8
that means it is already in a readable
format so note it for and converting it
and last day will be you have to return
your STR that's it let's play in this
code let me print this not printed it so
it is my PT then this code so this was
your encryption and this is the
education part simple right so this was
your DES next value will be depend upon
a es and blow faithful stay tuned for
