set up a Tomcat server in your Eclipse
so once we're done with the setup what
we'll do is we'll create a sample
project or sample web application so in
order to create a web application what
we can do is you have to just go to your
project Explorer here select like and
you can select new here and click on
project or you can click directly on
dynamic web project if this option is
not there what we can do is we can click
on others and here you have to search
for dynamic web project or you can
simply type web dynamic so if you search
dynamic it will say dynamic web project
here and say next
so Danny be a pear project and say next
now it will ask you for a project name
we'll say this is sample web app so
that's my project name it will ask me
for which server you want to work on I
will say Tomcat of version 7 this is
your servlet API version which is I am
using here 3.0 and then you can select
nothing else we can select next here and
as the folder will be getting say next
okay so when you say next year it will
say this is your context root which is
your project name and there's an option
of generate web dot XML files so if you
if your family with servlet programming
so we have to use a deployment
descriptor so we can check this so that
it will create our deployment descriptor
for you if you uncheck it if I have not
done this tick mark it will not create
web drive simple files so that you have
to create that file later on
so in this scenario I'm just selecting
it so that I will be getting that file I
will click on finish once you click on
finish it will create a project called
as sample web app and that will be
having a hierarchy and which will be
having a file called as web dot XML so
if you expand this there are lots of
thing to be notice
of your all your web content or web
pages or that configuration will be
belongs to this folder which is web
content all your Java files which is
yourself lights beans different belongs
to Java resources here so there it will
be having a source file or somewhere
here which is SRC and in web content you
will be having a web and a folder a very
important folder for your project and
this will be having a web dot XML file
which is if you open this file which is
a deployment descriptor file so you can
see there's an option of socio so you
can you can see the configuration so it
only display all they welcome list now
what we'll do here is we'll create a
sample web application or sample file a
JSP file so that when you run this
application it will open that file ok so
to create a simple JSP we can right
click on the project and we'll say new
we have to select a JSON file here so
it's a JSP and we'll name this file as
index so it is index dot JSP
we'll say next and we'll click on finish
now as soon as you click on finish it
will create a Jace web page what I want
to write here is a hello world and save
now once you save this it will create a
Jace page which is index dot JSP and
here in fact XML you can see there is
some people as welcome file list in
which you have all the welcome files so
first it will search for this file which
is index dot HTML so we don't have any
file for this it is when stable so it'll
be searched for index of HTML not there
thank will search for index dot JSP so
ultimately it will search for this file
when you run this application so to run
this project we can simply right-click
on your J's file and we can say run as
run on server all what we can do is we
can right click on your project and say
run as one server so if you say run on
server it will search for the Tomcat
which is Tomcat 7 here with
next and this is the project you have to
work and the click on finish here so
initially it will start your Tomcat so
you can see this Tomcat is starting here
so it is getting started and you can see
here there is something they will get
there will be a URL which is a sample
web app I prints in a world now you can
also open this in external browser so
you can just click on Chrome here and
will paste this address here so it will
say hello void right but what if you
want to open this output in browser
itself or the erection of browsers so
what we can simply do is we can go to
this in window and in window you can
select a web browser by default is
internal web browser we can select your
system default system web browser and
let me just close this browser view and
let me return the project so if you say
run as a non server same thing with
finish now it will directly open that
output in the Chrome browser clear so
this is how you have to create our first
web application cool
in future if you create a servlet files
so you have two choices will be having
annotation based servlet orbit will be
having a simple base of it so for that
you can view all those of it serve it
tutorials on YouTube so that's it this
is how you have to create a simple web
application in Eclipse so thank you so
much for watching and do subscribe for
