will talk about something called as
serialization now to demonstrate what
exactly selection means we'll take a
class for that save now in this class
let me create only one variable as int I
now see if we talk about this class it
has only one variable as I that means if
I create object of save let's suppose if
I create object of say vo so it save obj
equal to new save you save now it will
create an object right it will create an
object in this way suppose it creates an
object and in this object will be having
one variable so in this object will have
one variable say I okay so the value it
does the object is obj so this object
name is obj and in this object I have a
variable called as I now so if I assign
the value for eyes as obj I will say
four that means if I assign this value
here so what it becomes is where I is
equal to it will become four right so my
I value is four
but what if if I create one more object
so obj1
equal to new save okay and if I say if I
if what what was the value of this obj
so if I say if I if I take one more
object it will be named as if I take one
more object and in this object this the
object for this object is obj Oh
obj one and in this also have a variable
called as I now the value the value for
this variable is unknown now right
because we have just created the object
or it is not unknown exactly it's zero
so since we have only created the object
we don't have value so to assign to
assign this value to this object what we
can do is instead of creating object in
this way it will exactly copy like if I
say obj it will copy the values of Oh
AJ in obj one it will it will take the
it will take the memory it will take the
values but what's my finder here is what
I need to do let's suppose we are
walking with some game we are walking
with some application or if you if you
are playing some game like let's suppose
if you if you are playing your game
called as cricket so if I talk about
this a a sports cricket in this you can
play a game and once let us suppose your
score 50 run in one week eight and we
have photo was done so when you want to
save you know when you want to exit will
say right so when you want to save your
object that we will never store the
whole object what be stories we stole
its state state means we will not store
the object we will store this state of
the variables like I will not store the
whole object I will store the value of I
the value have four variables if I i
will stole only the values right because
when i create new object i will get the
memory I will get the memory but what I
will not get is now this two objects
have the same memory same amount of
memory the difference is this object has
value as four and this object I 'value
is zero right so what I can do is when
you want to store when you want to store
this this data in a file you can store
this data in a file and then after you
can you know you can get it back so to
implement this thing what we need is we
are going to have to implement the code
where you can save data in a file but
this time we will not store data we will
store objects okay so for this we'll say
again if we have to follow those steps
of file input stream if remember while
last code so I hope you have my last
video this code if you remember so yeah
so what I to do is if in order to store
data I will pick up this two lines I
will pick up this line this one also
so copy and here I can just paste it so
this is my code right so it's file
output stream then it's data output
stream now again are some some steps so
we have to import the package and
package is imported and yeah we have to
handle the exceptions so we can say
closed exception right now
now the problem is again let me change
the file name will say file them as of
obj dot txt
doesn't matter was the filename so I
will say obj txt now in this if we talk
about this object is this file object
right normal file object in order to
store anything in a fire to require file
output string which defines the type of
data will be stored in so it will be a
stream format right
but this time we are not storing data
will be storing object right so for this
in Java we have some new class called as
object output stream so of using data
output stream you can use object output
stream and here also it will be object
right again you have to import the
package the package the importer right
and it will say oh instead of clear is
okay now in order to store this data we
have a method called as right object so
instead of right UTF in the last code we
will say right object and in this object
we have to say in our date send our
object is obj right so now this obj will
store in this obj dot txt now again file
name doesn't matter you can have any
file name but the state of this object
will be stored in this file okay so if I
run this if I just run this shift f6
and we'll see some output taking time
yeah now we can see there is an error
error says there is an exception in
Maine which is not serializable
exception it's because Java is pretty
secure language see when you talk about
saving the object it should not be by
default allowed right because if you
allow your object to be stored it can be
used for Manisha's purpose
what we need is we by default in Java
that it will not allow you to store the
objects so to make it allow we have to
use some of some marker interface and
one of the marker interface to implement
to work with theorization is
serializable so if you implement your
class with C risible it will allow it
will allow your object to be saved and
the amazing part is this is just a
marker interface that means this
interface don't have any declaration so
it means they don't have to implement
anything so now refer on this C it's
been successful now let me go to the
folder weight when I have that file so
if I go to my documents net bin project
and hello without me I can see we have a
5 year so if I open this in what bad so
that something is save right as as
normal user we cannot say this but Java
can read so it mentioned that we have a
class called save in this we have a
variable I and we have some value for it
right so let me close this now what if I
want to get the value back so for to
demonstrate how to retrieve value will
stake one more object as save obj one
but this time we will not take value we
will not go for new save because it will
give the default values I want values to
be come from our file so what we can do
is to in to get data we can say we can
we have to retrieve data from file so
these are this is the Co
to get the data so copy and paste using
this you can you can communicate with
your file so yeah but instead of get we
are not we don't want data we want
object so object input stream and object
input stream now going to achieve tie to
pack to import the package now to
retrieve data we have we have when to
change this we will say oh I is so oh is
dot so today TIFF we have read object so
trade object yeah now the problem is
when you say read object it will return
you the object of class called as object
right so in Java we have a default class
class object
so when you say read object it will give
you object of object so what I need is I
need to convert that object in to save
object so will cast it with save okay
and that's it
now if you want to get the value of obj
one so we'll say s out say obj 1 dot I
and it will give you value of I will
print something value of obj one so let
me get simple and if I run this now
so it's it's it's an object of value of
obj one is for right obj one value is
for now again a quick recap so what we
have is we have visitor transfer is save
we can have any class that class need to
be new to be implement or CLI usable so
that the object of safe will be saved in
this class I have one variable so if I
create object let me rise the variable
as full and so after we have initialized
we have to store that object in a fire
is obj dot txt and when retrieving we
have to consider it on this for this
class is class name file output stream
object output stream trajectory file
input stream and for object input stream
and this caste is necessary because you
will get object of object class and
that's a simple part of civilization so
if you have any doubts please comment
thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
