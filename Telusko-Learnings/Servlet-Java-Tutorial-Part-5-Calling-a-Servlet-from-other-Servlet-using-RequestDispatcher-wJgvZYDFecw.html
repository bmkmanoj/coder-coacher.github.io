talked about a visit counter in this
video we'll see how to call a servlet
from a servlet so let's say you have two
servlets and you want to call a servlet
Ramah servlet okay before that what I
will do is I will create a web page okay
in which I will just give a button so
let me create a HTML page first HTML
page here's not okay so let's create a
HTML page and we'll name this page as
index or we how do you have a page here
so I have an index dot HTML page here I
will use this page what we want to do
here is I just want to call a servlet so
I will use a form tag in form I will
mention action I will say the first
servlet as posture bridge okay which is
not there yet
will create that serve that later so I
have this servlet here and I want to
call this servlet when a button is
clicked so I will say input type submit
and we'll say value so we'll say okay so
as I click on okay
it should call first serve it simple
right now let's create that servlet so
in my project my project let me get us
off let so I click on a project say new
and let me get us off that I will end
this of it as first solve it and say
next now I want to add this Inc
description in XML file let me click on
OK and I am normally I get lots of codes
right are normally in the last video we
have deleted this code but in this video
let's just keep this code let me remove
all the extra comments which are not
required here what we will do is okay
let me remove this comment first now you
will see we we have seen do get do post
what is this process request so every
time I use a sensor request since in
HTML we are not mentioned in method so
we are not mentioned any method here
which simply means if you mention a
method I get it should call it will call
do get if you mention a method as
it will call to post since we are not
mentioning the method here by defy it
will be get so it will call do get so
you can see there is a plus button here
if I expand this button you can see
there's already two methods defined
which is to get and do post so if we
have to get and do post and both are
calling choices the question okay so it
doesn't matter if it is a tectonic what
is a get request or post request it will
call this process request okay just to
make it simple let's lit this part okay
and we'll go with do get not do post
will go with do good here okay
and I hope you know the difference
between do get and to post that we have
discussed in the second video tutorial
okay
now let's create our method which is
public white white to get which will
take two parameters one STP servlet
request and we'll say req rdq request
and then let me create sublet response
so which is here and will then this as
response now once you got this method
what way to do is initially we just
print something you have a couple print
let's paint on the console will say s
out let me just as out I will say in
first just to check let's say first
servlet let's deploy this website we
already deployed it let's run this which
is index dot HTML it will open in Chrome
and you can see a big button because I
have just maximize the screen what we'll
do is we'll click on OK as let's click
on OK
it is not printing anything here is
because we are not printing on the page
we are printing on the console you can
see not watch a log or a party log here
you can see we are in first servlet so
at least this is working ok but I don't
want to print anything here that was
just for testing now what we to do is
wait to call seconds of it so I have to
create such seconds of it first
for that I will just use this quote
itself so I will say copy and let me
create a new servlet which is will say
this as second serve it will add this
into prom descriptor and click on finish
and for this also will you will use the
same code difference will be instead of
first subject we have second subject so
now we have two subjects we have first
serve it and we have second served it in
second servlet I will create object of
printwriter just to bring something on
page we say print out equal to response
dot getwriter which we have seen in the
last video and this might throw an error
so first let's fix the import so we say
control shift I just to fix the import
and we'll click on this bubble will say
add those which is those iya exception
and now let's print something on the
page what I will print here is I will
say in second servlet that's it so we
are we are printing in second solid we
can to lots of tasks here but our main
motto is to call second subject for the
from the first servlet so now if I click
on this HTML page which is on button ok
it will call first servlet page ok and
what we want to do is we want to call
second servlet
so in this do gate we have to write some
code which will call second serve it in
order different ways of doing this so
the first way is using this a interface
called as requestdispatcher so we have
to use something as equal dispatcher
we'll name this as our D now if you go
to this word dispatcher it is an
interface which has lots of constants in
it ok and which has two methods one is
forward and include now the problem is
in order to create object of require
dispatcher or instance of request
dispatcher way to use request object
which has a method called as get request
dispatcher in which you have to mention
which serve that you want to call which
is second servlet okay so once again in
order to create object off request
dispatcher
way it took say the
first dot get Ripper dispatcher which is
a method of request interface which is
HTTP request interface we had to mention
the servlet name you want to call goal
and then we can use our DDOT so you can
as we have seen here it has only two
methods one is forward second is include
this time we'll use forward just to call
that servlet and we have to pass two
objects one is request object and we
have to pass response object right might
throw an error so what we'll do is we'll
add the which will throw the exception
which is server exception and way to
throw one more I went to call way
tractable IO exception also so we have
to go into exception which is servlet
and IO cool
so when if you want to call a servlet
promise of it we have to use
requestdispatcher and way to say forward
pull and now let's run this code so if
you say run so if I click on okay you
can say it is it is printing in second
servlet that means we are able to call
the second circuit cool so that is the
first way to call a circuit from a
servlet with something called as request
dispatcher okay so that's it from this
video so do subscribe for the further
videos because in the second video we'll
talk about another way of calling a
servlet from a servlet so thanks so much
