from the disco nothing and in the last
video what we have done is we have put
it in a sublet where you are sending a
name and then we are printing that name
on the JSP page using this label tag
here and this is al right now what we'll
do now is let's try to use jst so we'll
do this we'll do the same thing we'll
print something here but not using al
but will be with the help of jst L again
we can do that with here but you know L
was introduced just to have an attribute
and jst also let's see how to do that in
jst L so if you have to use this with
this first of all let me just give a big
tag here so if you had to use this with
jst L we have to use a special tag
called as out the problem is out is not
a inbuilt tag inside HTML right so this
is the custom tag and anyone who want to
use a custom tag we have to import or we
have to use that library now to use that
will say percentage at rate and the way
you can add libraries inside your your
Java JSP is using tag Lib then you can
mention something called as prefix the
prefix means whenever you want to use
any any gstl tag will be using that
prefix so let's say if you want to use
out we can say out is a j-style tag by
mentioning C at the start then you have
to mention URI now it is URI URI is a
location where you have your jst L okay
I am in the definition of your jst all
abilities now what you are URI we need
here so if I say control space you can
see I am getting lots of options here so
we will be using this one a code one
okay so this is the path for jst okoda
basin inside inside j SQL we have lots
of libraries we have jst l we have
okanagan ordering options okay so you
can see we have code we have a format we
have functions we have SQL we have xml
out of which will be using will be using
code function and SQL in this series so
we start with code okay so we have to
mention
C and then okay yeah so we have to
mention URI and then
that's it you can whenever you want to
use out now we have to mention C : and
then you can mention value.you which you
want to print so let's say I want to
paint home the hello world nothing else
if I want to print hello world we can
say C out value hello world and save
this now but you have to make sure that
whenever you want to use J STL you use
the library here you have to add this w
which is jst or library so J STL 1.2 you
can download this from Google just go to
Google and search for J steal and there
will be some website which has this
library you have to also make sure that
library is there in your web minor for
web app library or you can do that by
adding one of the ways by adding that
library inside Lib folder of web-inf
okay now once you do that go back to
your browser and say enter you can see
we got Naveen and we got hello world now
why we getting oven because we are using
this label why we are getting hello
voices because we are writing hello
world let's I don't want to print how to
avoid you know I want to print up in
itself so i will use caller and the
callee packet and we can say label okay
so you can see using expression language
you can mention we can mention that here
so even that will work but this was
introduced in 1.2 JSP I'm a JSP second
version or the first version okay so in
gin the second version of JSP we can't
use this but not so in the earlier
version we used to work with this okay
so that's how you use out out tag out
tag in jst L now what else we can do
here this is just a basic let's go for
some something else
what what what else what other tags we
have here so if I say C : you can see we
have these stuffed tags franco space you
can see we have catch now catch will be
used when you want to do exception
handling right we can use for each so
let's say if you have lots of we have we
have a list which you want to print we
can use for teach we can also use import
to import some some other website in
your project example if i say import and
if i say telescope calm but not this way
you have to mention the whole path this
HTTP colon double slash wo Telecom so
you can fetch the entire source code of
the robotic arm in your code
okay let me move this one okay let's see
how to fetch the code if I say enter now
that's the okay so you can see I am
fetching my entire website here okay I
was not able to fetch everything but we
got I got my website here in fact I can
if I mentioned some specific thing if I
say online dot HTM okay Orlando HTM and
if I don't this code now okay you can
see we got our so that's that's that's
my website registration details if
you're a traditional for the course like
if I say details it works it is well
yeah so we have to provide that link as
well but you can see we got our we got
the page here we have not got the CSS
file on all the stuff but record the
page so we can use import what are the
other things we have we can say C : we
can use let's see what else we have so
it can set the width so you can set the
variables you can remove the variables
let's say condition T variables we can
say set and we can use property name we
can specify the scope till what point
will be using this then we'll be using
value what value you want to store and
the variable name okay so you can use
set we can also say remove for removing
the elements but in this example what
what I am passionate about is to use an
object let's say any in this I am not
creating object of string I want to
create object of student so I'd only do
is I will create first of all made to
put that string so that will not get any
error let's create a class here and
we'll names will say this class as
student which belongs to comm dodge
there is scope in this student class let
me have some variables here okay some
properties I will have this properties
as private int roll number okay let me
just remove private just to show you
something if I they moved it private and
if I say string name just two variables
okay and if I go to the servlet and if I
create object of that student if I say a
student oh we also need a constructor
using which you can assigned the values
just to make our work more easy with
say-so's a constructor will fetch both
the variables here with click on ok and
in the in this object now let's create
all the top student this is fluent
equal to new student by passing those
two values will say 1 and name I'll be
using is Naveen I love my name I don't
know why but Naveen and instead of
sending the label I don't want this
string name here I'll be sending a
student again you can use any name here
any label and here I will be sending s
so I am sending s with a label student
now in this Despero JSP if you want to
print label what will happen is since
you are printing the label if I go back
to my browser if I say enter ok it is
spending nothing because it is not label
it is student because we have removed a
label right so now we are using student
why this is our video this error and you
ignore that if I Center now you can see
we got something and that's your hash
code okay I don't want to print the hash
code I want to print the actual data so
what you can do is you can say student
dot you can specify the property I want
to print name is it name what is that
yes it is name so if you want to print
name you can sister in dot name and if I
run this code we caught an error this
error says property name not found it
hold on we have a name there right why
it is not able see is also specifying
that name property is not inside student
why it is so it's because whenever you
want to use JSP and when you want to use
any object you have to make sure that
you are using beans okay and how to make
a bean to make a bean you need getters
and setters so that's the only way you
can press the properties you have to say
source you have to say getters and
setters for both the variables we will
say ok you can see we got all the getter
setter here and if I save this if I go
back to my browser if I say enter we got
Naveen there right it's awesome right so
we can freakin send the data from your
from your servlet to the JSP in the
object format you can see I'm sending an
object here and then we are fetching
that object with the help of expression
language now again you can use also use
that G or that jst LC out tag the main
intention here
is not to send one value let's say I
want to I want to send these top
students and I don't want to print only
one thing I want to print the entire
object and to print the entire object
you have to make sure that you implement
or to string method in your code so
let's implement the two string method or
if you are familiar with poor Java in
codes are we whenever you try to print
the object it calls the two string
method right so I would I would like to
print the two string method of that
because if I run this code now it will
bring both the stop the roll number and
name
but let's I do not want to print on you
one thing I want to print the entire
stuff let's I want to print I don't want
I just don't want one object I want
three objects or four objects what you
can do is you can create a list of
student here so I can say list of
student and here we can say studs equal
to now we can create new add a list and
you can do all the stuff but since I
know whatever object we are working with
how many values we need we can simply
use arrays dot as lists and inside this
we can create multiple object I can say
student first object one and name is
Naveen the second object let's say we
have new student a two comma or three
and then we have new student this is
three comma in double quotes will say
predict so what we are doing is we are
creating us we are creating an added
least with this all this values I don't
want to send it one object so instead of
sending one student object we can say
students
I am sending lots of students and the
object name is studs okay so from this
servlet I am not sending one thing I am
sending a list now how do you interpret
that list here because if I say students
and if I go back to my browser if I say
enter you can see we got all this data
here but you know in one particular list
I want to print that in iterative format
one after the other
for that we have to use a for loop right
we normally use for loop the normal for
though in J steel it provides you a
special loop called as for
each loop so we can use for each loop
and inside this for each loop you can
mention certain parameters the first one
is items now this items is the least
name so it creates dialogue okay first
of all you mean it up we need that
double quotes in this you have to
mention the least name which is students
write it just verify let's go to servlet
and it is students then you have to
mention the variable name now what
variable so one I mean which object will
hold one object I will say s so when
this loop runs it will so it will it
will fetch one one object it will fetch
first object that will fed second object
and the third object and every time you
just have to print s right but that
should be inside the curly brackets okay
and after everything will print a break
statement so that it will it will be on
new line if I go and run this code now
you can see everything we got on a new
line right in fact if you want to paint
only one specific thing you can also do
that we can say s dot name it will only
print name now not the entire object you
can see we got the names here so that's
how we use jst L so we can use for each
tag which belongs to jst L and we can
mention items we can mention the
variable name right and then we can
iterate using the name there so that's
how you use gstl code tag in fact we
have lots of tags just trying to explore
on those tags okay in the next video
what we'll be doing is we'll be working
with the S are the functions or your
functions type of function functions
tags okay so that is from this session
