from those four learnings and in this
video we'll talk about how to fetch the
data from the hibernate or using
hibernate database so the last video we
have seen how to add values right so we
can use this method which is saved using
which you can store the object but let's
say I want to fetch the data now but
before fetching we should have some data
right so I already have this data in my
database if you can see in my mask
you'll we already have 1 0 1 and grade
we are not using name is because we have
made it transient it must run this once
again so that we'll get to a transient
object as well let's go back to our
database and if I say show you can see
we caught that record now what I want is
I want to add some more values or the
problem is if I say 2 and if I change
this value to let's say Sarang and if I
say the color is white the problem is
since we are saying create every time it
will get a new table right we don't want
that we want it to use the same table so
we have to make it update right so we'll
say ok update now by saying update what
you are doing is it will not get a new
table now so if I have this code you can
see in your database if your database
will be having two rows now one naveen
green and once you're too certain white
now if I if I go back here ok
now whatever what I want is I don't have
this values here ok let me just remove
this values in the same code and in
alien I also want a one more method here
which is to string so that you know when
I print the object it should not print
the hash but I want to print the values
of it so we will implement two string
method here now if you're not familiar
with two string method you can just
watch my video on to string on YouTube
so to string you have to override two
strings so that you can fetch the values
because by default to string method
fetches the hash code now let's go back
here and yeah so after this what I'm
going to do is I want to print the value
of the disco so I will say system dot
out dot println I will print the object
any score
let's not save that because we want to
fetch it
database now since you can you can see I
have created this object which is blank
now so this object has a blank object I
mean it's an object which doesn't have
any any default values and if you try to
print an object it will give you some
beer output which is 0 0 and then null
value I guess so you can see we got zero
and then null for name and null for
color I want to fetch this record from
database now how do we do that it's very
simple we have to say that I want object
of tedisco equal to now there's a the we
can use session dot so there is a method
but as yet in this case you have to pass
two parameters the first one is the
class name the class name is alien dot
class then you have to mention the
primary key which object you want to
fetch I want to fetch 1 0 1 because 1 0
1 is actually Naveen right and we have
to typecast it with alien because it
will give you so get method gives you
the object of object I want object of
alien so if you type class 2 enjoyed so
once we have done the type car string
let's run this code if you can see the
output now we got alien 1 0 1 Naveen and
green so we are fetching the data from
database in the back and you can see we
are getting an SQL query so even if you
are saying get it is filing a query by
passing a where class where you mention
that the ID is question mark which is
actually 1 0 1 in our case if I do it
for once here - of course you will be
getting the data which is which is which
is sorry you can see once your to Sarang
and white so that's how you can fetch
the data from the database again we have
two methods to use here what is get it's
against load again we'll talk about load
in one of the video in the subsequent
tutorials
but you can use get to fetch the data ok
so that's how you fetch data data from
database you're saying I use using
hibernate and we have to do that with
the help of get method or one more thing
or you don't have to create object here
we can also send null because it is it
will be giving you the object why the
instance you don't have to do that and
if I if I run this code now you can say
it still works so we did have to create
the object or you can simply specify a
null what that will do
so that's it so if you liked this video
make sure you like the video and do
