we are live on YouTube and this is the
first time we are doing a light at life
session something like this well I have
an industry expert with me who can
answer all your questions and why can
you talking about his experience and the
the questions I mean the answers to your
questions and I can see we are going
live and yes so there are people so we
can see I can see 21 people are watching
this session if I'm not wrong and I can
see that in life and one dislike that's
fine the most important part is this
number of views which we are getting and
we have Chaitanya with alsea
and who is the exploit for today and he
has experience thank you all yours okay
first of all thank youing for inviting
me over and giving the optional thing
for me to speak to so many people there
are a lot of changes which are sweeping
the industry today as everybody would be
looking at the news and you know there's
some very positive it's a very negative
news that's you know that we read today
the positive causes the is the new
technology is that I am packing our
lives bringing in whole lot of new
opportunities and the negative side we
do hear a lot of news about the risk of
automation taking away a whole lot of
jobs while it's creating jobs but there
is also a fear uncertainty and doubt we
typically call this as the four factor
which is one I guess people are not able
to hear our voice that is what I can
sing the comments okay so you can just
just one minute I guess there's some
problem with the with the connection
everything see I can see a lot of
questions coming the way yeah but then I
also can see some message which says no
audio okay just help me with this people
there if you can hear us
so there's one comment from of it okay
yeah there was this proper I guess the
problem with the people who have
listening so maybe they are not excited
the speakers yeah so I think most most
can hear good so I can see a lot of
questions you know there's a whole
stream of questions which is very good
so which means that we have a lot of
people watching us and listening to us I
want to first you know start by giving a
broad overview of what's happening in
the industry and then we can take some
very specific questions so three areas I
want to talk about today what is some of
the technologies which are impacting at
the enterprise at the enterprise level
so you know the water things which are
going to impact is the artificial
intelligence now it's a very big very
big area we still have to do a lot of
research and go a long way but what's
the bond in the AI space is the machine
learning in the Alaric's most
applications will become intelligent
applications and we'll have some sort of
machine learning and data analytics
built inside of it so that's one clear
area which is going to impact that's a
clear trend technology trend going
forward the other bridging technology
trend going forward is about augmented
reality and virtual reality that's
getting a very fast will have a whole
lot of applications which will be
developed on AR and VR and the third a
third trend third me the trend is that
of distributed apps and some of you have
heard of the recent craze around a
Bitcoin then you would know that you
know VidCon is one such application of
the distributed app or decentralized
happens more appropriately call that's
catching up the interest of the industry
and that's likely to disrupt pretty much
every industry going forward and the
technology behind us is
should see very distinct trends which
are taking shape in the industry going
forward over the next couple of years
which is go to it which is going to
impact the enterprises and all
enterprises are adopting them in
different ways so let me repeat it once
again it's the presence of intelligent
applications through AI then of course
is the AR we are and third is the old
train around blockchain in the indium in
intelligent intelligent devices we also
have some other areas which are acting
as are things like Internet of Things
they are going to become there will be
you know billions and trillions of
intelligent devices which are going to
throw whole lot of data working on
machine learning with machine learning
models this this data isn't or to become
a very very important property and
aspect of most applications going
forward that's what the larger
technological trend then let's talk
about what's happening of the at the
architectural level so he's come down
okay that's the technological trend
what's happening at the architecture
level so two very clear areas which are
you know evolving number one is micro
services I'm sure some of you would have
heard microservices the way to go
forward in terms of architecture and the
other is containerization so the
combination of and containerization and
micro services is proving to be very
very very very very very appropriate for
building the scale and the kind of
applications with a scale that they need
in the internet age that we need to
build today so macro services and
containerization are two very key
architectural paradigms which we need to
understand because that's going to
impact every application that we build
the third will be still come down
further areas of framework and
programming languages which all of us
you know today probably most close to so
there in terms of the frameworks we have
some very important
you
which are used to build api's we also
need to understand that it will live in
the API economy everything is pretty
much an API today we interact with
services and the API architecture and
the consumption and making of the API
makes you know inter interoperate
ability very very easy an
interoperability is is happy a challenge
in the software industry that you're
trying to resolve for for many years now
the you know the the the standards with
which we build the API allow us to do
that's not so Express is one such
framework which is helpful is publishing
it to the api's at the programming
language I would say that you know to do
good full stack development if you can't
do using the once one singular language
which works across all your stacks helps
us do product development lot faster and
also the maintainability of the of the
stack becomes a lot more more meaningful
so in that regard I think JavaScript has
caught up over the last few years and
has become a good full stack language
apart from JavaScript over the last
couple of years with the popularity of
angular time Strip is gaining a lot of
ground as of today the dine strip is
used most to build components for
angular for those of you not a very nice
trip is this is a class oriented
stripping language from Microsoft it's a
language that we use to build components
in we lacked the confidence thanks to it
so far is you know more popular on
building the front end conference but
going forward
it's going to also be available at the
back end if that happens just the way
that's the way what node.js is done to
javascript with the variability of batch
script service server side the
frameworks
it will it will really become you know
clear you know choice of a programming
language for building application tack
strip is also nothing but a superset of
JavaScript its builder top of that it's
for addition features so that's one
programming language which is gonna gain
a lot of ground along with JavaScript
the JavaScript with ec5 ec6 release is
already you know becoming very popular
and with with the new features which
will be released in it allows you to you
know compete with pretty much any object
oriented programming language the other
programming language which is which
everybody's been waiting for and it is
almost out is Java 9 that's a major
upgrade so Java 9 is going to get more
and more adoption Java already has a
very strong photo in the web development
in the enterprise space so with release
a Java 9 that's only going to become a
bit better as a programming language I
often get asked his question that is at
the end of the road for Java that's
certainly not the case Java 9 makes this
makes his case even more stronger so you
know so we should we should look out for
Java 9 and you know that's for to you
know just strengthen the existing Java
landscape then there are some other
programming languages like like go which
is a catalan which are and you know
which are gaining ground as far as
analyst is concerned are and white some
are already you know the leaders in that
space and that's not like actually
change going forward it's only going to
become mu stronger we have more and more
of those libraries now and our advice
the Pythian of courses become the
preferred language for all data
analytics you know applications and
that's not going to change so on the
programming front those are the key
trends
that we see in the industry so three
broad areas that I touched upon and I
just want to summarize them the trends
which are changing the industry at a
broad level and then going down further
the architectural paradigms which are
important today for building
applications and then the programming
languages which are you know impacting
or getting more and more likely to get
adopted for building those kind of
enterprise applications okay so that's
at that's what I want to talk about at a
broad level since this is you know 30
minutes like session I'm already in do
15 minutes of talking I don't want to I
do or take a few questions so this
structure the chat and see if you know
what questions do we have
so that we can you help me with picking
up a few questions here so in fact in
fact going for those questions first I
have some questions from my side because
these are these sub questions which I
get a lot you know as I'm not expert in
every technology so you know Piven
people ask me about different stuff I'm
not that experienced so that's why I
wanted some people like you who can help
them with those questions now the one
question which I normally get is the
importance of certification you know
when at my point when I was doing my
graduation everyone was saying you know
should you should be going you should be
going for seasick certifications maybe
for Java or.net so what do you think
what is the importance of certification
at this point in the in the industry
okay so certification is very very
important but all certifications are not
equal so number one when you are trying
to go there to do things when you trying
to enter the industry when you're trying
to enter the street you have to you have
to make sure that you have focus on a
certain expertise
at that expertise comes from moving a
programming language very very well
oh that's very important once you enter
the industry and you work on projects
then besides the programming language
there are lots of other things that you
need to be aware of and one of the most
important certifications for a developer
which I feel is is absolutely paramount
is professionals from developers on
education because development today is
is not about just working as a solo
individual it's about working as a team
and many have to do that there are
practices that Moz is to follow while
EPS is important to write clean code and
to understand how to write the theme
code but you write the team code first
you need to be profitable in the
programming language so do you achieve
that proficiency first once you achieve
that then you scale up into
understanding how do you write better
code how do you write better code faster
and how do you write better code which
is more maintainable and you are able to
release your products in in the in the
release deadlines that you would
encounter a miyawaki in rabbit not too
ought to do all of that it is very
important to follow a different
practices and those practices are
practices like test-driven development
behavior driven development practices of
trail programming practices of
refactoring practices of you know how
you are how do you write clean code
practices of understanding how do you
take a code from from your laptop from
your machine into production and what
are the various stages and steps that
you need to follow it including things
like got yours integration it's curing
things like build management in doing
things like release management and then
so and and thereafter you know
maintaining the code which is
going to be more reliable and more
resilient so you know which is why we
have and software is the most imperfect
world while it is it is also the most
creative it is also the most imperfect
world which is why there are so many so
many jobs and which making sure that as
you write the cord will be of MIDI we
need to understand that as we write code
there are more negative forces on the
cord and they are positive forces so
making sure that we maintain it is very
very important now to do that all of
that certification which allows us
trained ability which gives us
credibility and makes us understand in a
very formal way what these practices are
are very very important so once it's
finished which I always recommend to
everybody with professional strength
developer which everybody needs do the
movement they are in two years of
development and they they have had some
experience of participating in teams in
writing code and doing product
development so yes so certification is
key but all certifications are not equal
you can start off by doing
certifications which are programming
language specific which gives you the
credibility that you understand the
programming language in a very broad way
to move on to understand not the the
process and all the practices that are
involved to make a good developer okay
perfect perfect answer
so that was very helpful and so next
questions for you again from the so this
question was asked on Facebook by
Nagaraj even before this session and I
feel you know this is also important
question about DevOps so so nowadays we
have this trend of any everyone want to
be I mean she comes because of different
companies they have a day bob developer
option so the question is is that a good
future for DevOps developer okay so the
way to ask that question knowing is that
you know I started off by saying that a
lot of automation is taking place and
the same motivation is also taking place
in in the software well in the whole
software development lifecycle we all
understand the tradition SPLC
and the traditionalist LDS DLC as we
know it is also undergoing a lot of
automation nothing but automating the
traditional SPLC so that we can release
the software better faster and cheaper
just to give you just try to say is that
the release of every year now that's a
whole lot of people working together
over 12 months to release a new software
you idiot you a new hardware with all
the everything else put together to make
sure that the final product is this
perfect which is lost by everybody and
you know so that's the speed that we
talking about today the business
environment has become very agile and
therefore the traditional way we do as
TLC is notice no longer that said we
have to automate areas which can be
automated and mostly all of those are
now increasingly getting automated
whether it is the release process where
is the build process so each of the SDLC
which is now got automated is pretty
much what they've up says so has DevOps
path this is the integration of the
development aspects and the operational
respect of of the development
so while software development by itself
which follows the tradition SDLC the
operational aspects of releasing the
software of provisioning the software of
packaging the software of deploying the
software of building the software of
testing the software all of these things
are the operational specs which are all
increasingly getting automated it is not
a either off question it is it is a
question that it has to be done so
it is a knowledge that every developer
needs to have today it is something that
has become part of the developer
knowledge set - to be a proper developer
a productive developer of production
software coder in addy it is not
something which has been left to a
separate team for them to handle it a
big part of the knowledge needs to be
get the needs to be had with the
developer team itself while they can be
very specialists DevOps engineers who
focus in on specialist tools so you know
it's it's absolutely something which is
this is not just essential it is it is
mandatory to have that knowledge yeah
great so so that's the answer for you or
nagaraj the future for DevOps it has to
be done there is no choice it's not that
you have a special skill set but then
that's how the industry is working right
so knowing there is a there's a few
question which I get taken by because
you know I come across so many people
wanting to move and there's one such
question which I can see here is you
know what is the full path to learn
machine learning from scratch you know
this coach Patel is the name of the
person he's asking that question if he's
still there listening to us
it's not about machine learning but you
know generally the data analytics or
artificial intelligence what's the best
way to do that or even Big Data
for that matter I just want to take that
question up you know the way that you
what needs to go about making sure that
they can become you know part of the
industry and work on projects which are
either machine learning or big day an
hour and its products is to build a very
strong foundation in programming that's
that's the only way we can because all
of these areas require models to be
built and and these models are built
using programming languages whether
you're doing Java or they eat window Jay
most of the machine learning algorithm
today are increasingly getting
productized one set example is IBM
Watson so you don't everybody doesn't
need to be a statistician everybody
doesn't need to be a you know a data
scientist you'll be working on our big
data or a machine learning project or a
massive learning product but what you do
need to have is a good understanding of
mastery of a programming language which
allows the use of such products like
Watson or allows any other product which
is giving algorithm or the box for you
to use it the other area so machine
learning is a very multidisciplinary
area the other area that you must have
understanding and knowledge of is basic
statistics which is basic applied
statistics so having understanding of
what this fundamental machine learning
algorithms like are are important so you
know understanding of various kinds of
regression logistic regression various
other algorithms like random forests or
so on and so forth I can born that is
essential but you as somebody who's
starting off would not really be
changing this algorithms much you would
not be rewriting but you will be reusing
so you can do that if you have a strong
understanding of the programming
language and a fundamental understanding
of the machine learning algorithms so
that's the best way to approach and into
the industry for any analytics machine
learning or big data big data project ok
great so can you find some other
question have you have you seen any kind
of questions or should I take one so you
I just I just saw one because which are
which is you know which is very which is
you know probably asked for everybody
how do I go about making a career in
analytics and most people focus on you
know just learning let's take a loop and
then
struggling that they've learnt so much
but they not being able to because bring
through I just thought I'll address that
ok there's one more question which is
again the same questions repeated by so
many people just because the
taken that point with Java is not
outdated so again the same question from
everyone is Java outdated because of all
these different languages overtaking a
Java language so is it Java or did it
that's the question no it's not in fact
you know the the programming world is
now it's kind of somewhere got to be is
back was was getting divided into two
kinds of programming languages one we
refer to as the object-oriented
programming languages and the other as
the functional programming language now
increasingly the object-oriented
programming languages are adopting the
functional side of functional aspects of
programming language and the functional
programming languages are becoming more
object-oriented which is why we have the
release of the new versions of
JavaScript which was fundamentally a
function programming languages which is
sitting on top the code code JavaScript
and becoming more and more popular but
going back to say is Java dead no that's
certainly not the case it's a very
strong programming language a lot of
existing applications are out there
which needs support with these
enhancements so it's not going out
anywhere in the near future not for the
next five years will there be new
programming languages yes there always
are new programming languages which will
which will have specific applications
which may be more more likely to be
developed in those programming languages
that will already be the case so for
example there is a lot of products which
are now being developed it's it's Scala
that's the other programming languages
which is gaining ground which is both
object-oriented and functional but Java
is certainly not going anywhere simply
because there is a lot of existing
investment which is being already in
Java and like I said with the release of
Java 9 the language only becomes
stronger and everything that you can do
with it any other language you can
pretty much do with Java as well there
are there are some low-level paradigms
which
you know probably one can debate with
whether it is faster or slower than any
other language whether you know the
competency models are more suited for
the internet kind of applications
I think Java has proved them proved that
it can it can scale and work with its
existing programming paradigm for pretty
much any kind of application and and
thanks for that point and now if you
want to learn Java online there are some
there are my videos are believers which
was a good point okay so we have one
more question on Facebook and the
question deal I don't know if you have
been to this this field which is
business intelligence and dimension
models there's a tool called as Evelyn
even I'm not sure about that tool okay
this person is from now on I if you have
if you know something about it or if you
know it you can just put a light I
haven't heard about the two I would have
to go back and have a look what this
tool is but this is the question
regarding the tool or it's a generic
question I guess the question I'm not
sure which is something with bi tool and
dimension modeling tool like Elwyn I
guess it's something to do with bi and
time machine modeling yes so there are
lots of BI tools out there you know we
are still a very strong space and if you
get you know a master duel in the BI
space is always very useful we work you
know so so bi starts from the
visualization goes down to data modeling
that the ETL and then all of that good
stuff is still very relevant but I'm not
very sure about this particular tool so
I can take that question not an issue
there's also big liability class two
questions and the first question would
be what is the future of scholar Oh
what's the future of scholar
I think Scala has a good future it's
both the function as well as
object-oriented
language I see a this it's not so much
use in India as of now so if you look at
India
it still is yet to catch up you won't
find too many Scala openings so somebody
who's wanting to enter the industry but
not be it's still at is still early days
for the language but yeah there there is
a strong community getting builders
culpa so we can also say not recommended
for pressures at least so if you already
working for the company you know
while there is there is there not
there's not too much a strong demand in
the industry for the program for the
language there may be a few very niche
companies who are working on it
but not a very strong hit something like
Ruby on Rails RoR it's been there for
many years but it never really caught on
with the big companies in India so you
don't have that many openings of RoR
however there are some very rich
companies who do some wonderful work in
using karwa and one question so that is
about more specific on blockchain and
etherium please so right so when it
comes to blockchain platform there are
two you know frameworks which are most
commonly used to say one is from the
Linux Foundation which is called hyper
legend the other is from the company
Coliseum which also have their own
cryptocurrency called ether so the
theorem is this for something is is what
we call a smart contracts
whereas hyper ledger is for you know
decentralized apps and also has a
certain small contract built into it so
these are the two fundamental platform
that one needs to know to be building
any decentralized app using
using blockchain okay okay it's yeah
it's uh it's it's a good skill to have
it is still early days in terms of
adoption but you know over the next one
year I personally foresee a lot of
companies adopting this and they're able
to start working with you know building
some kind of applications using using
this and India's additionally has not
been a product you know geography we
have been a we are very in a very
service oriented geography so as the as
the demand for such products grows in
you know the the big markets of Europe
and North America I'm show more and more
you know job openings will see how
they're in India because we're it
outsourcing up so I do see a very strong
very very strong you know a talent
requirement in in blockchain over the
next few is certainly a area certainly
an area to look out for and certainly
you know a lot of opportunities emerging
here over the next few days okay that's
good in fact even I was trying to get
into a blockchain you know they simply
because of all this was around it and
then later I realize did not have to
focus on life stuff first and then I can
think about all these things but then
yes
that's a very good technology to look on
right okay
plate so this is what without all
questions we can take us as of now
because it's already out of so we were
supplying fortunate sessions and we are
going beyond it
so again III hope Chaitanya will joining
us again after after some days if
anybody is free available out of the
training all the development thing you
are busy with and okay so check Anya I
just last few words for the people or
just to motivate them or anything from
your side for my subscribers right first
of all I I enjoyed this I hope that I am
able to
you know get invited again and persuaded
some most very specific discussions
today it was more about you know very
broad-based general discussion the one
thing that I want to leave and thought
to everybody is that you know software
industry a lot of changes happening at a
very fast speed you really have to be a
lifelong learner to be able to adopt to
that you know initial years of your
career make sure that you focus more on
specialization in super specialization
and as you grow it's it's like an
inverted inverted pyramid and as you get
more experienced you can become more
broad-based but for now it's very
important that you you focus and it'd be
very very specialized in what you're
trying to learn if you are doing
JavaScript then make sure that you you
love Atlantic very well if you live in
Java make sure that you learn that
language very well though and try and do
multiple things do one thing but know it
very very well so that's the one most
important thought that I want to leave
with everybody okay so thank you so much
for you the experience and it talked and
the discussion we had here
it was awesome once because the things
the thing is this is the first time I'm
doing something like this I mean the
series again we have done that before
but then this is a new initiative which
I'm taking well I can talk about it we
can I can talk to industry people so
that they can share the experience as we
did in these sessions and I hope you
will get some time again to join the
sessions because it was an awesome
experience for me as well to hear from
you why my pleasure no mean and I
enjoyed it thank you so much for having
me over
and I hope to come back again please you
know you're my first target so if I get
stuck somewhere I fight if I have some
questions for me subscribe where you are
before target yeah absolutely I
absolutely enjoyed this and I hope
everybody is only useful to me yeah so
everyone thank you so much for watching
and we had an amazing discussion here
and this is just a start you know as you
can see the title itself it is hash one
this is the first thing so the most
sessions are coming so I'm talking to
defenders to people Japanese here for
for us as he promised and we'll have
more sessions like this do do click on
the like button if you enjoyed these
obsessions and
we'll do this once again next week or so
every Sunday I'm trying to do this so
let me know your thoughts in the comment
section and the chat window as well I'm
there for next 2 minutes in the chat
window after the session so that's it
thank you so much for watching everyone
thanks so much I Tanya second I left I
guess yeah
