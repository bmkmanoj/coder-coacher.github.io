request response things now if you go
back to your postman and if you try to
send data so let's see what do I do now
is it let's get a new resource and do
that we have to use a URL which is a
lien right and then we have to send data
as well now to send the data we have to
go to go to body and you have to insert
a new object like let me go for one to
the four and we said this is mayank and
let's say my young as ninety points here
now let's see if you have this data now
see I'm sending this data in XML format
right
what if you want to send this data in
JSON format is it possible so what do we
do here is I will just convert this into
JSON because I want to send Jason not it
not XML so of course this will not work
so we have to send data something like
this you have to say in double quotes
you have to mention the ID then you will
give a colon the idea I want to send is
one zero four right then oh I forgot to
put a comma there and the second thing I
have to send is name and let's say the
name is my UNK
and we'll give up comma and then we will
have a points here and the points would
be later 90 so I want to send this data
now at the moment I click on send okay
so you can see it is getting stored so
in this which is getting stored ideas
working right so that means you can send
a request in JSON format or you can send
a request in an XML format right now how
exactly is working so what do you what
if I do okay what if I change this thing
now let's I don't want to I mean I want
to specify something example if you want
to specify whatever data you want to
accept you can also use consumes so you
can say consumes and now if it is
something which will send from server to
client that is produced so from this
server I am sending data to client edges
producers consumes is something where
your client sends the data and your your
cells will build a accepting it so let's
say consumes and so it only consumes
let's say maybe so if I mentioned the
media type as media type dot applique
Asian dot XML so I will make it XML and
let's see it is working with JSON or not
so let me just make it XML and I need to
restart the server I guess it will be
happening automatically but in other
keys it's not happening automatically
it's right-click and say run as a non
server okay so now if I go back to my
postman to send this request this time
we'll go for one zero five because we
already have one zero one zero four
there and we'll go for a name called as
pooja and let's have a points which is
eighty even those point doesn't matter
in this case okay let's run this and
let's see what happens now if you click
on this send button can you see that we
got an error
it says unsupported media type because
what we are doing is we are specifying
that it will accept only XML and that's
the problem when you specify it will
support only XML then it will only
support XML that means if I send data in
XML format it will surely work so we'll
go back here and say I want to undo so
that I will get the XML which we have
written before
okay so let's set this as one zero five
and let's say name is puja and the let's
say this is 80 and if I click aunt I
have to make sure that I select XML and
if I click on send now you can see it is
working so that means when you specify
the type of data you want to accept it
will accept only - particular it's
better to have both right our client can
send adjacent data or they can send an
XML data that's their choice if you want
to assign both if you want to accept
only these two not anything else or you
can specify those two things here and I
did this will be a good thing you know
I've specify both so that when a client
strength sign they try to send something
weird it will not accept so it's better
to mention the consume citation as well
so consume says whatever data you are
going to accept XML JSON plaintext what
else right so once we have mentioned
this okay it's a some magic issue but
it's fine let's go back and let's go to
postman and okay so we'll sakes and oh
okay we have this two times now I want
to go for JSON this
so let's enter JSON data so we'll say
Jason again we have to type the same
thing right I should have copied it
somewhere to reuse but let's make it
fast so I would say ID ID is let's say
once your sex and we'll say name is
equal to let's say in double quotes
let's mention the name obvious end this
1:06 in double quotes as well
okay now this will be let's say pravin
let's say points and let's have a point
which is let's say 85 okay we'll keep
that in our codes okay now if I send a
JSON format let's see if it is working
or not if I click on send it is working
you see that again you are getting data
in XML format because we have not
mentioned whatever data you want to send
right you cannot specify by going to
headers and say hey I don't want XML I
want JSON I do in return so if I say
send now okay raise our data is it's
coming I don't know why I did this is
giving you this inform this is giving
you Jason format so that's how you send
requests that's how you accept requests
and yeah that's how we use Atkinson
sanitation so in this video we have
talked about ad consumes so that's it
for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
