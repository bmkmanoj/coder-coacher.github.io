ready from social happenings and today
we will try to answer the question why
to learn JavaScript you know I got lots
of questions on YouTube and Facebook
that is it okay to learn JavaScript I
mean is it enough to learn JavaScript
and I always should just say that
JavaScript was only fall in applying
site programming you cannot do you
cannot do much with that but now the
world is changed right so when
JavaScript was first launched in year
1995 it was just a language which is
used to make your page interactive you
can see this example here if you want if
you want to create a webpage you need
HTML right so using HTML you can create
a web page but let's say if you want to
design it better you can use CSS and to
make a page interactive example if you
want to you know if you want to alert
your user using some pop-up window you
can do that using JavaScript right so
the only way to create that pop-up
windows and those you know changing of
images on the pic on the screen was
possible using javascript and we also
used to buy date forms right so we used
to create those pages for validations
and everything was done with the help of
JavaScript right so there was not much
importance for JavaScript orgia days but
nowadays everything is built on
JavaScript in fact let's talk about this
in fact I am NOT promoting JavaScript
here there is no way related Java is
rated to JavaScript okay two different
languages
I love Java but if we talk about
JavaScript let's let let's start with
this one if you want a platform if you
want a language which is platform
independent we go for Java right because
we say Java is platform independent it
works on all the platforms that's good
then let's say you want to make an
application for mobile devices of course
we have to use either Android or iOS or
let's say if you want to make a cloud
application right you want a SAS
software if such a software service
example if you talk about Gmail and it
is it is a software service right so
everything is actually built or you can
build all this stuff with the help of
JavaScript also let's say you want to
make a class a cross-platform software
you can use JavaScript
think about this one which is mobile
applications so let's say if you want to
make an
I make an app for Android we have to use
native programming right which is Java
and XML but using javascript we can make
we can make hybrid apps example if you
want to make an app for Android we
require Android programming to make iOS
app you need Swift programming for
Windows you have to use c-sharp
instead of that use one language
JavaScript and you can make the hybrid
apps right so we can use JavaScript to
make mobile apps okay example we have
frameworks like PhoneGap we have ionic
framework we have all those stuff now
what next
so for mobile devices we can use
JavaScript let's talk about let's say
websites if you want to create the UI
normally if javascript is used to make
the page interactive right but we have
evolved it right we have jQuery now so
example if you have a page in which you
want to change the images continuously
they know you want to change slide slide
slide next image right you can use
javascript there but knowledge is done
with the help of jQuery right so we have
jQuery for that let's say you want to
send a synchronous request again it's a
very big concept right a single sink or
synchronous requests we can achieve that
with the help of again JavaScript which
is based on a Jax right then we have
there's a concept concept called as
angular JS it has evolved a lot you know
now you can make a single page
application I mean single page website
using angularjs if we talk about Gmail
it is built using angularjs which means
you can create a page which is linked
single page website right and it will it
will make you feel that it is your
desktop software you will not feel that
it's a website it's a website right so
that is possible with the help of
angularjs it's a single page you can
make a single page website and what is
angularjs it's a it's a it is built on
JavaScript right so if you want to
create an amazing UI you can use J's so
we can use JavaScript for mobile devices
which is hybrid apps you can use
JavaScript for websites
I mean UI now can we make can they use
JavaScript for back-end
I mean a server example if we talk about
PHP if we talk about Python if you talk
about Java we can make
websites all right we can create the
backend part of it the processing part
now we can use JavaScript to create that
server I mean we can create a back-end
application using Java JavaScript this
is there's a framework or there's a
technology called as node dot J's right
so using node dot J's we can actually
make a website and the advantage is no
dot J's works with single thread and as
a advantage you know it's a lightweight
and you can make a website using
javascript which is no dodgers again
there are lots of frameworks which are
actually built on node.js so there are
lots of startup companies they are be
even there are big companies they are
following node.js to make their own
technology right so companies like
LinkedIn then lots of companies were
working on node.js now so we can use
Java for mobile applications we can use
JavaScript for website designing or the
UI part and you can also use JavaScript
for back in part now what else if you
can do if you can design a mobile
application I mean if you can make a
deal if you can develop a mobile
application if you can design a web page
if you can make the backend part of the
website what else you need that means if
you know JavaScript you can do
everything right you can build a mobile
application you can build a SAS
application which is the software
service application you can build a
back-end application which is a website
right so everything can be done with the
help of JavaScript in fact in future we
are saying that everything will be moved
on cloud that means you just have to use
a browser right so using a browser you
can use all you can access all the data
right and that is possible when you have
a language which is works which is which
works on browser and the only language
which which works on browser is
JavaScript now just imagine the power of
JavaScript in the next five years for
sure javascript will be top three or top
five in next five years right so if you
want to learn if you only feel a
beginner in the programming and you want
to learn a new language I will suggest
go for JavaScript
okay the again there are lots of lots of
things like if you want to go for
Android application like native games
you have to go for Java if you want to
be if you want to use native and iOS
apps you have to learn Swift but if you
want to be a
full-stack developer right so you can be
a Java you can learn JavaScript or you
can make everything and not saying it's
easy okay it's not that easy to learn
but once you learn JavaScript the whole
framework like JavaScript jQuery AJAX
then we have angularjs node.js
this is lots of opportunities for you
okay if you haven't if you heard about
the mean stack which is MongoDB forward
the e part is it something then we have
a which is angularjs and then the end we
have no J's that means we can use
everything using Java so if you can make
a full website using javascript even
database right so there's something
cause no SQL databases which is MongoDB
so if your structure is not defined you
can use MongoDB which is no SQL you do
not have to use any SQL there and it is
also built using JavaScript right so it
is that powerful so I will suggest go
for learn JavaScript and even I started
learning JavaScript now because there's
a huge opportunity there okay so I know
Java but still you know it's better to
know JavaScript technologies so yeah
that's it from this video make sure you
learn JavaScript as you have as well as
your primary language or as a side
language okay it's not there's no harm
in learning JavaScript so that's the
