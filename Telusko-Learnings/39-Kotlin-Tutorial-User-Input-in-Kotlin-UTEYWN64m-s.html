important concept in any programming
language and maybe C C++ Java or
Cortland
the thing is how to take input from user
in fact I have not taken this example of
a long time and then I got some comments
you know where is the video for how to
take input from user and here we go now
taking input from user is actually very
very difficult in Cortland you have to
write ten lines of code to get the input
and that's not that's not the case so it
is one of the easiest language so but
then before going to I mean before
knowing how to take the in term the user
in court Lane what we'll do is let's try
to understand how you used to do it in
Java now in Java we have a concept of a
scanner class if remember we use take
input introducing scanner class and then
we also had a class called as
bufferedreader so these are the two
classes we used to use right to take
input and we all used to hate
bufferedreader because you remember if
you want to take input using
bufferedreader you have to write a full
line which goes something like this
again this with this code will not work
in question because i'm writing java
code here so it says before you do BR
equal to new bufferedreader and then in
that bracket you have to mention new
inputstreamreader and then you have to
mention system dot n right such a big
line and i always to hate it I also used
to shade scanner class I mean for
multiple multiple reasons you know see
we are all coming from C background
right in C we have scanner right it's
straightforward we can use canif and
your job is done in c++ we have C in job
is done in Java we are not using
something very simple you know what I
feel in Java also if I open a Java code
here I feel you know if you want to take
input from user so it should say int I
equal to system dot in dot reader okay
there should be something like this and
what if I say it does work this read
method will give you the data again it
might show an exception you have to
handle that but then this will give you
the data the problem is this read method
in Java returns only one character and
we don't want that we wanted the exact
sentence right again if you to know more
about this you can watch my Java video
but this is not important here the
important is in Java we have to use a
concept of scanner class or
bufferedreader
so can we use that thing in Cortland
let's try services
I will good object of scanner here and I
know no I mean you might be knowing
about scanner now right how to create
object in Cortland and we can say
scanner but the problem is we have to
import the package for that and we have
done that already now what else we need
here so we have to mention the object of
system dot in so you have to say system
dot n okay now you will get an error and
I hope you know this thing because we
have seen this in the earlier videos
right in is a keyword so we cannot use
that directly we have to use a back kick
so have to use a back kick do I skip
that character now once you got a once
we got a nod our object let's say we got
bad a number equal to SC dot next int
right our job is done so when is the
next train to you will get a string and
then we can print this string here we
can print now one and that's it if I
don't this code let's right-click and
say is one are your first code and here
we go we got oh is the output oh okay
I just waiting for the input first of
all I was in 78 and you've got 78 white
is that easy to take input so here I'm
taking the input I'm just printing it
okay I'm not doing any extra operation
here but you can try it out so this is
what you use you do you take input in
coil in but within spoke Java syntax but
don't you think this is again oh this is
again a lengthy code there should be
something simple and yes we do have
simple thing example if I say we're
number one instead of doing all the
circles here Quadling says hey just read
just use the red line on your job is
done so if you want to take input from
user in cotton just say read line on
your job is done so let's say println
identify print num1 here okay now one
and let me just remove all this extra
thing we don't need that now right and
if I love this code let's see if it is
working and it's waiting for the input
let's say 99 and you got 99 it's that
simple right so if you want to take
input from user in Coeur d'Alene just
use read line and your job is done you
don't have to write all the text raw
code here right no no need of kind of
now no need of any other thing but then
question arise what is happening be it
behind the scenes so if I click on read
line you can see read line is using an
inline function which is system dot n
our trade line and if I jump to this red
line okay and it is using bufferedreader
so can you see that indirectly it is
using bufferedreader so if you're
thinking hey no need of no need to know
need to know about scanner and
bufferedreader but hold on behind the
scene Carlene is using Java code right
so even if you are not using before
using the code in behind the scene you
are using buffer Ito so before it is
going not going anywhere right so that's
it that's how you take input from the
user as a program enough score playing
you should know that this part but -
it's better to know the back end scene
also right so that's it from this video
guys that's how you can you can take the
input from the user
