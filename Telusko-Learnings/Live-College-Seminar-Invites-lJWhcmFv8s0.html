everything is working here so my hand
God says I am live I just need to check
if I'm life there and today I will try
to pick up questions for mobile phone
because I need to switch this screen
here is it possible to switch Sims and I
know I'm late I was supposed to be live
at 2:30 we are late by 5 minutes because
I don't know what's going wrong play
with my camera settings you can see and
my face is not looking good it's very
similar light coming today I may be the
mobile mobile phone is enhancing my
colors I don't know what is going wrong
here let me do some adjustment here is
it good yeah it seems good now and how
many people are watching this okay I
cannot see much people today because
maybe it's a long time and there's a
match going on I know let's see let's
see let me just pick up questions not
from here from ok maybe I can take a
question from here as well this looks
good ok so first of all before going
through the question is the sound let's
do something else and if you can see the
topic for today is be different a topic
for today is college a college invite
for seminars I don't know if you follow
me on on Facebook I have been uploading
a lot of photos of different colleges
because I'm visiting a lot of noises
this time so I do use I do is to visit
colleges before but then from a long
time I left watch visits I wanted to
focus more on corporate now since I'm
focusing much I mean I'm shifting my
focus from corporate to again YouTube so
I thought let's again visit the colleges
which I should go to and let's have a
good seminar there now I choose
different topic for seminar let me
reduce the temperature to the yeah so I
wanted to visit colleges to deliver
different topics because I always
believe you know that colleges have a
different syllabus what we are expecting
in the industry you know industry is
working on different different paths and
college teaching different things I
still remember when I when I was in my
college we were having a subject which
is which does not make any sense in the
industry I'm not saying it
be there it is basic right it should be
there but the college lapis is not
matching with the industry standard so I
thought let's visit this colleges and
let them know what is going in the
industry so I thought let's visit some
colleges and I used I used to do with it
before as well but this time I don't
know I got some different reaction from
students not from all colleges because I
have been not visiting multiple colleges
now I don't know what is happening
nowadays with college but I feel there's
there's something going wrong with the
college syllabus or the way the culture
of which we have in cause now it's good
you know they are focusing more on an
external event they are focusing on
cultural events that's good that's
amazing the only thing which I'm face
I'm not liking is the behavior the
response of everyone the teachers the
students are the coils management
everyone is playing their own game
I feel management is focusing how to
earn more money
teachers are focusing on how to you know
go to go back to home and enjoy and
students are focusing more on how can
you spend these three years and then
just go out and struggle because they
don't know people who are in first year
second year third year I mean in any
year of the degree the the more they
have years they get since here in the
fourth year they understand okay next
year we have to get up go for a job but
people who are in first year second they
don't they're not able to understand
what's going wrong with them they are
focusing more on enjoyment I'm not
saying you should not enjoy but then
this is not a way you should enjoy I
mean you if example here you know I I
used to get some requests from different
colleges that they want to arrange a
signal different topics which I don't
know because the topics which I know I
do
gives them down that example or clouds
on Java on different topics but let's
say if you talk about hacking if we talk
about laser testing I'm not good with
that those topics right so some people
do ask me to you know to recommend
someone from the industry who will go
there and give a session but the problem
is when I quantitate some people and
then they agree to go to colleges for a
seminar and they went one of them
when when first seminar I mean thinking
about this a person working from home
last seven years in the industry or
different background maybe testing
bagging on in this example so killing it
can you imagine that having centers of
experience in testing on different tools
and this guy goes to a college for a
seminar now if I was a student if at
this place I was trained I would have
attended that session in a respectful
way I would have tainted everything from
start to end listen to everything but
when he went first signa everything went
wrong
I mean he went for a seminar and then he
was talking about different topics and
people will enjoy their own jokes I mean
this is what you say I mean I am sure
this guy will never get any colleges in
future I'm sure so that's one thing okay
I don't I'm not saying it this happens
in every college when I go to defend
colleges I do get some good audience
there in fact I have faced these issues
in some colleges because I have this
different way of teaching I don't make
sure that everyone is quite because I
want people to enjoy but then not it
this way not in this way the way they
behaved it's very bad the response from
students see if I'm not only responds
properly from management that's fine
management is not focusing on educating
people they are focusing more on earning
money or teachers yes they are having a
good interaction with us but the moment
you talk about students you know I am
not liking the way they behave I don't
know I mean I can handle because I have
experience of going to course for
training before with someone coming from
the industry who don't have much of
teaching experience my industry in the
colleges and that person is working very
hard in the industry knows a lot of
technologies I feel people should
respect those I mean students should
respect those people who are coming from
the industry so I don't know how
politics will be helpful in this case I
feel they should make them understand
the importance of seminars the
importance of people coming to your
colleges let's see so that's about thing
and one more thing I am available till
2020 Feb 28 in fact because after that
I'm getting busy I don't know if you
have even knows about this I've never
this on on this platform I guess so I'm
getting married this month so 2035 I'm
getting married so I'm quite busy with
those stuff you know there are a lot of
things happening here being a South
Indian has a lot of things have to do
something with that so before that I'm
available after that also I cannot be
sure but before that I'm available for
different colleges I am do visiting
different colleges now so yesterday I
went for went to Martin guy number for a
college and next week also I'm going to
to I to colleges yes is to the to
colleges I guess yeah so that's that's
update so if you want to invite me to
your college let me know or you can send
a request on facebook or you can email
us on Telescope training at that
gmail.com that's how that's where you
can invite us now why I went live today
at this point in fact I wanted to go
live at 7 p.m. but then as I mentioned
there are different things on which is
happening now I'm busy with a video clip
a video creation project and my
situation so I wanted to go live at 7
p.m. but I was not sure why would I be
able to go live there so I came and I
mean I'm live now maybe I will I will go
like one second at 7:00 if I get chance
but today I mean this is life session
and quite a number of people are
watching this I thought it would only
tend to well people will show up because
it is afternoon time Sunday so no no we
show up but then yes people are showing
up so that's great ok that's great
so yeah topic for today was the quality
Dwight so if you want it send me the
invites or you can but the only thing
which I need here is discipline ok next
time when you call anyone from the
industry doesn't matter me or someone
make sure that you know college the
students which are who are sitting in
the classroom and disciplined because we
are not responsible to make 10 tsp wife
as we are not polish teachers we are not
spending time with them for the entire
year so we don't want which we don't
want to waste our time in that so let's
see so that's that's one thing I want so
great so that subtracts about this
that's about the invites and now let's
take up some questions
Vishal says what's my
okay so I'm 28 now doesn't look at 28 I
know but then I'm 28 and numbers of my
boy so I born in 89 1989 so I'm 28 now
okay so David Oz says so party okay sure
so next time we'll have a meet-up we'll
have a party so I'm going to do meetups
in different cities now but we'll do it
after May or April maybe let's see okay
so lets me go back to some questions
again I have started this chat in a slow
mode because I am basically sister from
a long time you know the moment I take a
question I can see so many questions at
the same point right it's very difficult
to track the questions so what I'm doing
now is I just on I've just you know I'll
just set the slow mode on which means
you can post your questions once in a
minute okay so people who are trying to
bombard with questions do not do that
now okay I mean questions are good but
then some people they just want to
bombard anything else spam so I think
this should be helpful them they think
which we are doing here okay uh leisha
okay let me say hi Java guru ji is a gem
ability okay that's a good boy maybe I
should get a channel like this Jody
sounds cool okay I hope I've not changed
the flat because I just it's okay it
seems good it seems good okay the
question was yeah so don't you watch
match
I do I you I was much I was watching
match before this before they before
going live so I was doing some other
stuff and on the second screen the match
was on but then I thought life is more
important so that's so that I can
completely life and I was I'm supposed
to go out now at some time so I thought
okay let's do a live so yes I do watch
cricket
I love to get by the way okay so hello
sir I think you are uploading savages
video in a load rating yes that's you
can blame me there you can blame me that
I'm getting about it yes I'm uploading a
video on Savage ASP with a very low rate
I was supposed to upload at least one
video of server JSP every day but I
failed to do that because okay I cannot
give excuses
I'm trying Korea also will upload a
video on savage as Petraeus we have one
video to be uploaded the thing is I'm
not eating much time to make videos
that's excuse again okay no excuses but
then yes I will try to upload as much of
it as possible on Savage ASP and the
coach our videos you can see they're up
they are continuously uploaded because
it's the thing is I have those recording
already been done
it's just that I just need to edit the
cohesion of videos that's why I'm able
to upload them very quickly
I'm not saying editing is very easy but
it takes around one art where did the
entire video because I have to remove
all those ah oh
you know the repeated sentence sometimes
because when I make a video let's say
the video is for eight minutes I make
sure that it goes down to at least five
or six because instead of wasting your
eight minutes if you can got the same
constant in six minutes that's awesome
right so that's why we need lot of
editing so I try to edit each and every
second of the video that's why the pace
is going down now so time and I'm
focusing one on quality content and
quantity so I stopped making 5 to 6
videos per day hey why not 2 videos per
day which has good content let's see
okay I can see once your six people
watching this and only put in and lags
come on guys if you enjoy these
obsessions let me know it by click on
like button there okay so is it good to
learn Java effects or move on to Python
see both have different different
reasons to use you cannot say Java X
replaces Python or Java Java Python will
replace Java X 10 different purpose if
you want design applications on Java
of course Java FX is the go-to thing but
if you want to go for machine learning
if you want to go for scripting if you
want to go for server-side programming
path is a good option is it to learn
that's very important right because some
people they want to be a software
developer they don't want to focus they
don't want to spend more time in
learning programming if you can learn
something very awesome very easy to
learn so that's Python for you okay so I
would like to develop a channel so I
cannot I can connect my app and web app
which technology should I use you want
to connect your channel through app okay
one is saying that you want to fetch
some videos from the YouTube which I am
doing so if you download my app I do the
same thing I have said I'm connecting my
app with the YouTube channel so for web
application
do have a video I don't know if you have
seen my java web development videos okay
let me search for that so video name is
okay you max
yeah the library name is you max so
search for tennis score you max it's a
JavaScript library you can use that
oh it says no video found that's weird
okay so maybe YouTube is blocking you
max term that's very bad of YouTube what
we here to do like you max library
all right that's that's via you know it
search for you max on YouTube oh it's
dead ok videos are coming but then when
I set foot I just go you max it says no
isn't found that's weird
that's really weird so I would say
tennis Co okay let me check for the
video later and I will post that on
YouTube on the on the comment section of
this video
that's weird I'm not able to find my own
video there here okay okay so tell me
something about Salesforce not much of
idea but they provide your cloud
services not much idea on that oh ok one
question in Java so please tell me what
a different method and function ok Java
basically says every block I mean the
thing which you execute is a method okay
so that's emitter because object has a
method okay so in Java we always say
methods we don't say functions I mean we
used to say methods so till job point
jar 1.7 we always say those are methods
but then in Java 1.8 we got a concept of
functional programming so you can do
functional programming in Java now so
Java now supports reactive programming
it supports functional programming
itself lis supports object-oriented
programming so in object-oriented
programming in Java we say methods when
it when you work with functional
programming we say functions because the
Java in Java 8 you create functions
again those are methods but then you
know just to make it more interactive
just to make it more you know is it to
understand we say functions but all our
methods by the way okay so Kim Shu say
is hats off nothing so you're doing a
great job
oh thank you so much thanks so much for
that
ok University College of Science safe
about please come to our call
so isn't what's up tank oh I don't know
is that tank is it I don't search for
that oh it's in highs about okay
okay so my plan are to visit Hyderabad
but not now maybe in month of May so yes
in May I'll go visiting Hyderabad for a
primary function so I mean my native is
on the potential I will tell anyone I
was always looking there so yes I'll go
visiting Hyderabad and we'll do some
meetups there and if you maybe some
point as well but it will mean me I
don't know which college will be opened
in May so let's see okay
please make a video on all tools server
used in corporate office and trying to
do that on these so my aim was to teach
you all the things which is actually
used in the industry not just any fancy
things which comes on the way so I'm
trying to teach you those things which
are really used for in the industry so
when you join any big company these are
the tools which they use right example
AWS then continues integration Java
hibernate spring frameworks yes I'm
trying to do that thing on this channel
but yeah I am guilty of the paradigm
which is I'm not uploading videos or ago
you know I should be uploading five to
six we just four days as for some people
so I'm trying to do that
okay so hello so how many spring boot
more videos please yes videos for the
hibernate spring boot all the way okay
when I say all the way it will take
three to four months more because
currently I'm trying to finish saw the
JSP then kochava those are things those
things are going badly and some videos
aren't
data structures as well some videos
aren't get as well and then I have a big
event coming on at the end of defender
February I will be available only in May
now so that's where you will get all the
videos so pulley usually these dumb or
you cannot say that you knew cities dump
is just that because what makes a
university is the entire entire think
you know the the faculty is they will be
college apart and the college management
the students I believe I we I cannot I
cannot change the management I cannot
change teachers but at least we can and
the students we can improve right so why
to keep the entire whole on your
teachers and manage
we can't hold that why we can't change
the way college works and I felt bad
when I heard about that guy Mike one of
my friend he complained a lot about this
thing so let's see okay so oh nice
lecture by you so helpful for all of us
in shop wasting time it's better to
learn oh thank you so much
how much okay how you get started with
iPhone development without having Mac
how do you get started okay uh now if
you go for it I guess using javascript
frameworks we can make apps I'm not
trying that did if you need Mac there
but yes you can do that with the help of
JavaScript frameworks or you can use
zomlings and it works on Windows as well
and use example you can make iOS apps
you can try that okay so say Leah says
what software do you use for streaming
I'm using hangout if you can see that on
the top right yeah yeah so you can see
Google there so that's that's so I'm
using Google hangout for streaming okay
I'm still trying to find out different
tools for streaming like we have OBS
there are different tools available but
I'm using hangout as of now because I
know it works maybe in future I would
switch to something else but as of now
I'm using hangout okay so let me check
if everything is going good on this
streaming because I'm not getting much
questions here okay yep okay so next is
you are awesome so thank you so much
comma
akka say Sano so should we learn
coordination of big size apk issues of
each other okay so yes you should be
learning quarterly now so if you walk if
you want to be edited of all I would say
go for Portland the only thing is can
you learn cutting from scratch if you
can't go ahead okay there's no need to
learn Java but the only thing is when
you learn Java you learn about different
implementation how JVM works how stack
heap works because not about language
you know some people only focus on
language but I would say it's not just
about language it's also about the
ecosystem which are working on example
JVM JRE how that works how hip works how
that works if you don't understand those
things then even if you learn a language
it doesn't make
cents so landing Java will help you
understand those things and then you can
not cut them very easily right because
learning Carlene is more of syntax than
the actual concept so learn Java first
understand the other one I mean
understand everything around it and then
go for partly that's my suggestion okay
so he should say so we love your way of
teaching oh thank you so much sure okay
so congratulations for your manager
thanks so much
okay please make video on security
strategist like oh the JIT abilities
okay so the thing is I'm very bad with
security I am NOT into security March
I'm going to develop Mitch I'm going to
Web API so yeah okay so I should be
doing that I don't I'm not saying I
don't do it
I didn't work I don't test my
application but then making videos on
that takes some efforts maybe not now
maybe in future we'll try okay coding to
the college football okay
nothing planned for Bupa as of now but
surely if if time permits I will visit
there sure I mean you know the thing is
I want to visit as many calls as
possible well I just want to visit all
the was in India are not just India and
in the entire world
it's just that studies of time I because
I'm doing other stuff as well I love
these things which I'm doing now I'm
doing all those things as well I said
that's what I enjoy so I'm just confused
which one to go oh hey don't you get
don't you scared formatted sir and start
about this much okay
I have not scared I'm happy that I'm
getting marriage I'm getting married
with my loves of course I'm not I'm not
scared about that okay was the
difference between sublet and GSP so
sublet is basically technology and even
if you are working on jasp JSP is good
if you wanna tease the design pages
basically if you if you heard about MVC
which is model-view-controller
when you put your view we produced and
we create news with Yelp of GSP
but ultimately those really gets
converted into service itself so even if
you as a programmer to write JSP those
things you will get converted into
servlet so what once on your containers
are service not
Espie so that's the thing in fact better
would be watch my video on sorry JSP so
I do have some cities watch that it to
make more sense okay uh-oh
so constructive training is most
important so when you are launching this
video or is it you want concentrating
video okay we'll do that we'll do that
yeah so I have a pretty super cute video
so I should be uploading the
construction video as well good point
so I would suggest to you to charge just
send me a mail on this because I need
four cards if I have a meal at least I
will remember this so construct a
training video let me just write it
somewhere let me do that I'm a sublime I
love something by the way so it is
constructor chaining great okay Dao and
do difference what is do I know I've
never seen do before is it data object
or it arms we were talking about model I
don't know Dao is basically a layer you
know database acts data access layer so
it's a layer when you actually interact
with it with data and I know not all
about do so can you just give me a full
form of that so I can explain it okay
why Java understood you when we create
app from unity all box it's more about
an Adu programming it's about how can we
use a complete power of your CPU can we
achieve all the new features
I'm not going to add weapon much but
then I believe native app native apps
must works faster than the hybrid apps
oh okay
okay all the questions I just lost all
the questions everything bent up okay
what is Jade Java - EE so first of all
Java to eat an apple of Java EE so they
have removed - finally so Java to Java
EE stands for Java Enterprise Edition
which means if you want to work with the
enterprise I tend to work with the
enterprise network or enterprise
software example if you want to make a
JMS application which is you're sending
messages between different servers if
you want to work with JT a Java
transition API if you want to work with
Spring Framework if you want to talk
with high mind framework all these
things comes under Java EE which is
Enterprise Edition then we have another
Weiser which is Java SE which is
standard ation where you work on kochava
things standard applications like Java
effects collections threads all those
things from a Java SE so it's more of
addition part of things so code and the
advanced part which cloud do you like
more or g-cloud all it applies I love a
turbulence I started working on Jake G
cloud last year which is Google App
Engine but later I found it applause is
much more efficient for me okay I'm not
saying it is good for everyone a device
is very efficient for me and as for
research AWS provides you more features
and has more users than Google Cloud and
white but maybe because of more features
okay so question is from conscience so
first I want to thank you thank you so
much your videos your job videos helped
me a lot I'm going to campus placement
please tell me about what should I
prepare I have done with Java and SQL so
I would say go for Java interview
questions so just go to Google and
surface now enter your questions
provided you you know all the concept
because interview questions when you go
for Google and search by interview
questions you will get a lot of
questions if your base is not clear
those questions will not make any sense
since you know your basics you know Java
you know SQL just go through some
interview questions and be prepared it's
all about how well you answer because
you know the concept right it's also
about how do you answer questions how do
you think about the question how do you
frame an answer so practice those things
I would say do some math mock interviews
with your friends ask that ask them to
ask you questions and then give them all
let them let them collect them what you
say rate you on the performance you are
giving and improve yourself every day
that's what I would say okay so so come
to yahoo engineering college and please
guide everyone so i don't know whether
engineering college is let me know if it
is Mumbai I was shown to visit Mumbai is
correct Mumbai or new Mumbai I can visit
there at least at this point with all my
project and other stuff is it good to
move from Java to Big Data of course
it's a good move
why not can I go friend when you find
our Java 2 threads yes that's what you
want I would say threads and connections
as well so make sure like you learn
connect ok collection why Java ok so we
have done with that question we are done
with this question again I lost all the
questions are watched I know there's
some sound someone is drilling at the
wall there
ok so Jin Mei says it is nice experience
meeting you in you say at washi or that
stretch in my I remember your chin may
pop ah that's great ok Caudill says what
frameworks is and what they do
Oh flame works just make your work easy
because if you do everything from
scratch it takes a lot of time do you
know actually manage because it's also
about critical structure of the project
using service doing feature so framework
will do it for you and frame book also
gives the design patterns how do you
build an application because if you know
in Java we have lot of design patterns
to work with if you're using spring
framework not all isn't part is you have
to use you have to implement because
spring will do it for you
so I would say watch my spring videos
you can understand how what dreamworks
will give you so this is springboard
videos do I have a spring good video I
do have one video on that I guess ok son
you are best oh thank you so much
I'm losing all the questions now some
says Java me what that means what to
learn for back end after Java and SQL I
would say if you know Java learn some
programming like solid JSP or JDBC
then hibernate spraying that's the
entire stack we learn and
trust me it is awesome okay waiting for
scholar videos
oh is it it will take some time scholar
videos okay so a lot of questions are
there okay why Java is called as purely
object oriented because in Java whatever
you do you talk about objects the only
place where Java is not the only object
oriented asleep limited it arrives you
know we have eight float all those
things other than that Java says it's
all objects right if you want to add two
numbers to create an object and do it
yes we all start of of static which is
not a purely object terms but then yes
Java is object oriented because
everything what you do is object I can
see 92 people are watching this that's
great ok so we are live for next 10
minutes let me know if you have any more
questions I do have some more questions
here ok please please make a video video
on spring project okay I do have a
spring project video on my own website
you can try it out
chinma okay so how much time I like to
invest okay this question from finish
how much time I need to invest every day
if I want to learn Java SC in 3 months
that's a good question ok so basically I
freamon's see learning Java is so how
much time it will take is different
depend upon person right aren't very
slow lot now so it takes an hour for me
to take a lot of time so for 3 if I want
to complete and the entire Java in 3
months and if we talk about me it will
take around 2 hours per day for me at
least to complete Java basic in a good
way some people it might change some
people may take 3 hours some people may
take one actually be enough for them so
it's subject to I would say spend as
much time as possible to you don't just
say two hours or three hours if you can
spend three hours that's great why you
have to specify three months complete
that into one month if you can so vemos
say is when you will take seminar at
across college the planning to take a
second because what is doing from a long
time let's see how thing goes because
let's see let's see so you can talk to
your actually you can talk to your
teachers let me know if they are they
want to do it now because last time we
had a talk and they turn I don't know I
was I got some I got busy
forgot about the college seminar let me
know if because it's my polish right I'm
available for that cause any time so
it's my college I've done my BSC prom
because call it so I would love to come
there again so if you know okay so good
next question is okay where's the
question best topic for minor project oh
that's the way India the question you
know best topic you said your own topic
because they are not saving in 19th
century or two in century where teachers
will give you a few three you feel look
at look around your vault and see what
are the problems which you are facing
and solve those problems
okay should I learn stores JSF before
going for spring not needed you can
diagnose spring
later also you can learn stores and J's
but that's fine
I feel starts a de facto technology now
or deformity factor framework for all
job projects this says what about your
internship so I want to do internship
under your guidance
okay surely so um it may mostly may/june
I'm starting internship again but it
will be a remote internship I would love
to have you people on on band so ia
Jonte hey say is I'm in ninth class and
my name is th the branch please make a
video one solution of java video
solution on java the what that means
watch my playlist you know that will be
helpful i guess that'll be helpful okay
now i saw spinning now i didn't know why
okay so if you get time please come in
Bangor or Bhopal Oh Shirley Shirley why
Java doesn't support multiple
inheritance oh I do have a video
yesterday also I actually only have a
favorite video why doesn't support
multiple inheritance watch that okay
future is AI IOT or blockchain so can we
integrate this features in Java yes why
not
so we do have some Java libraries for
machine
we do have we do use Java blockchain for
IOT we do use a minute Java so yes we
can use all the can use our everywhere
and Java is teaching now we have the
active Java we have Java 9 features yes
ok and below is tough to learn provided
you know good amount of JavaScript
it is good I'm not good with JavaScript
so I do find it difficult to work on new
technologies I'm not saying they're bad
I don't think of where they were working
on new technologies and kids say sir
come to talk with college of engineering
and technology
I'm coming to talk word on 12th or 7th I
forgot the date I need to check my
schedule again this week I guess the
connect I mean coming week and I mean to
call to talk about for a semi now but I
don't know as a teacher in college is it
MCA which Department I'm coming for so
yes I'm coming to taco College this this
week in fact I'm not got the
confirmation yet in to check with them
ok what's your view on a I a I is a
future you know that devil it's not far
away that a software a builder software
in future so maybe if we software bits
of software we have to build a software
which will build a software ok that's
what as I probably do okay why should I
learn Java as from web development
background so I can build apps using it
new to you what is the opinion see in
what perspective you are saying if you
are saying in a perspective of startups
you could talk in a perspective of
freelancers yes react need you is
awesome ok not never seen that before
but then I mean I've now worked on
reactive Nate you but then I heard about
a lot of things on then but never make
you talk about you know enterprise
market you do you just don't make web
applications there see IT is not just
about web it's not just about making
websites not just about making apps you
know I would say if we talk about
IT I would say 5% is 5 or something had
to do with the apps and websites you
have to understand this and if you talk
about all these businesses nowadays you
know Ola uber if you talk about people
do to Facebook of whatsapp people's
say you know just by using a language
just by using react knit you just by
using Android you can build the entire
business that's now how it works you to
understand this
ninety-five percent startups are failing
because they don't have this idea of you
know they just think that make an
application and you're successful that's
not how it works it's not just about app
development it's also about how can you
make an average which sustains which can
sustain huge load I mean thinking about
Twitter
Twitter was built on Ruby but later they
were forced to move to Scala because
Scala can handle huge amount of
processing power then it's also about
the business model which you make you
know so don't just go into that stuff
that you can make a website you can make
an application it's not just about web
it's not just about app it's also about
the backend part of it that's where
people are missing nowadays so that's it
that you'll understand once you join a
company what you joined big industries
okay and button by no way and I'm saying
react nudity is bad okay it's good it's
very good but then you cannot compare
these technologies with Java yeah so
there are Java works on enterprise
boiled better reacting to works on
website better
so that's thing okay Oh match needed ok
Matz where's the question I lost the
question there I guess the question was
something with mass engine for
programming not everywhere example if
you are making web application Android a
textual application you don't need match
knowledge but the moment you go for
machine learning if you're going for
blockchain if you're going forward I
need this new technologies where you
need lots of hustling a big data as well
you need good good amount of math skill
there so even if you hate magic you
don't have a choice buddy ok so come to
j SP and colleen boonie oh I was then in
Pune last week you should have mentioned
that
ok sure I mean I visit put it next time
I will sure to visit your college but
why did your polish invites me because
it's also depend upon polish like if
they want to invite invite me or not
because every college have their
different perspective some people want
to call industry people some people want
to call volume some people want to call
youtubers so it's depend upon your
college what they want they want so if
they want
me there I would certainly be there if I
was it if I was it put me there can you
visit p/es olicity in Bangalore surely
just send an invite so if you said my
invite just say my invite to the disco
training at the gym a lot concert it is
called training at ign.com and try to
send it by official a do feel of your
college so they can trust okay sir we
met in Pune meet up you can you
suggested me to post small web game on
get up yes that's right oh it's you yes
is it you do that on github both the
game me you have made those games right
the to get a running a game on to mobile
phones using node.js great miss Lang I
had to learn to do internship under the
disco learning oh so you want to do
internship I think I would say front end
because we need friend in yoga pose very
badly
I might have side my applications my my
projects needs front end other power I'm
surely looking for good friend
developers JavaScript angularjs mostly
will be fine colleges here and your
JavaScript ecology is photoshop skills
and bit amount of Java as well
specifically in Spring Framework that's
what you need to do internship it is
color earnings okay how do you find size
of variables in Java size of variables
of Java it's fixed right if you create a
linter variable that's fixed okay okay
tell something about artisan tation
doesn't meant okay for that to talk
about aÃ§ai i would say go to Andrew ng
on on YouTube search for Andrew ng and
to you and Gia
okay so make Java K videos bad ball
Cuban are they who okay so the question
is why I'm making the same video again
so oh no I'm not making the same theory
of YT for second time some knocking is
happening there somebody's some is it
padding their house ideas okay the
important thing is why I'm making the
same video again is because I do have a
cogent video there on YouTube but then
those videos some videos I have don't
have good quality good audio party some
don't have good video party because I
started this thing in 2013 when I was
waiting you
- I was ready to content creation so I
just created the way I wanted to create
I can't create because you have not seen
my setup when I started the YouTube it
was very bad I was not having a tripod
and all those things so it was very
difficult feat for me to make those good
videos so the part is not good in the
old videos but this videos the video
which I'm up early now they have good
amount of quality so that you can at
least watch them properly and I don't
think it should be having a problem if
you put the same video again okay when
should we choose Java to develop
applications every time okay not every
time but I would say if you are making
an application go for Java or parkland
if you are going for enterprise but
Chico for Java if you're going for
Hadoop be - the framework I would say
Java it's a big language to work on are
pieces you are much more than
celebrating for me oh thank you so much
I'll quit you know this thing actually
motivates me to make more videos okay so
what to do I lost the question
I lost the question where's the question
okay what they do for inviting you in
our College okay so to invite there are
certain setting criterias the first
criteria is your college most loudly if
it is Mumbai I will be visiting this
month only but if you are cautious in
some other other cities like maybe
Bangalore Hyderabad Pune then you can
expect me there in May in the month of
May or June okay that's one thing if you
are in Mumbai you just have to send me a
mail by mentioning the topic which you
want me to take the type of audience we
have and that's it that's it I'll be
there in your college I need at least
wasn't one hour to two hours okay don't
give me half an hour one hour session
more than one hour sessions which I
would like because I do want to make any
back there so making talking about if or
why because I visited some cars you
talking about for one hour and I feel I
felt you know I'm not able to deliver
the proper content there so that's the
only requirement I have nothing much the
reason why I want to visit your college
is just to motivate you people you know
just to connect you connect with you
better just to help you and just to
understand what exactly industry needs
all the qualities these nowadays so that
they can get into industry
because I know the industry perspective
and not quite sure about the boys
perspective now what is happening there
so I just want to visit there just to
understand what is happening so let me
know if you need me there in your
college
oh okay so no God no okay so I'm going
to say so which book is better for Java
okay now if you want to learn Java in a
comic way I would say hit first Java I
was having that book okay sweets way up
okay it's reading to some time it was
there it's here okay see it's here it's
see I see okay so I do have a book here
okay this is this is what we're not my
favorite book okay I do not say the best
book but then Java complete reference
this is good
the only thing is it might bore you for
learning in that case okay can you see
that I also have the 8th edition of the
same book so I have 9th edition I have I
have a tradition I just bought these two
books and it is there I'm trying to give
away these books you know that will be
awesome right giving away these books
and I have headphones Java and I'm not
able to see it here Java is there up I
guess it's there so yes I'm trying also
to and also trying to I know give away
these books because I'm not using them
now I'm using I'm not using this books
so maybe giveaway will be a good option
so next time we'll be do our Meetup
ok next Meetup I will give up with this
box I'll take this book and I will give
it to one person one person one work
maybe we will play some game there and
whoever wins will get this books because
it is they are which they are getting
wasted in my place here so someone will
be you know some one will be I mean it
will be helpful for someone to read this
book ok so thanks for making this
YouTube channel your technology my
teaching with her this also thank you so
much make more videos on savage ASB yes
they are on the way they are not the way
ok so the home stays so today I started
learning angularjs within 1 month I will
learn it how can I apply so after okay
in May what what you will do is till
then prepare yourself be ready in May
will will host an event in that event
whoever wins I will select 3
top three yeah so well three top three
will get the internship at is for
nothing that's what I'm planning
as of now three maybe I will before I
can make a proper planning wave four or
five because the more people you have it
is difficult to manage them and I'm very
bad with managing people's so let's see
so three max will do any what internship
maybe a paid one or free one that we'll
see later because I'm still searching
for funds now okay now last two minutes
last two minutes because okay so sweet
Ron says tell me tell about your what oh
this watch okay this is i watch
basically this is I watch I loved it so
this is my gift to myself so on my
birthday I gifted this watch to myself
that's what I did
this i watch not this series this is not
this series once it is not used to
because history is bit costly this is
better okay this is something which I
would have avoided at that point so this
is I watch I love this watch the only
thing is it is very fragile you know if
you travel in local train in Mumbai
it's very ski okay because it if you get
if you lose it then you're gone alright
so which is key
okay spring all the way yes bring all
the way okay what about Delhi met up a
deli meat up yes I'm trying to do that
in March because March I'm coming to
Delhi for some work let's see okay the
name of the author of this book okay
who's the author its how about okay what
you can do is just search for Java
country reference on Amazon this is the
author and this is the publication
weather is about vacation okay so can
you take a seminar in s odd TTC Pune yes
surely I would love to but Pune okay
when I was doing full a what you can do
is okay okay well for what about where I
am and when you are sending I invite in
case if I get more invites for one city
okay maybe I will visit that in this
month only
yeah we can do that right so let's see
because I want to finish as much as
semanas as possible in this month okay
so what is difference between abstract
class or interface I will do a video on
that because in Java 8 you know in Java
8 we can define whether they
to face that that is making abstract
class and interface almost seen okay so
the last one question then we are saying
bye-bye
and the question is okay I just saw the
question I needed went up so make a
video Andre Jax
