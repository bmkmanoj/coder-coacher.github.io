just check everything is it working I
don't want to get any trouble okay so I
guess I can you can see me there's maybe
five but so you can see I have a desk
here which is messed up totally I have
all the white wires it's very confusing
which a body is connected where you just
check everything
okay
I know if my my internet connection is
not that good today so I was not able to
connect properly if you can know
I know if I'm getting a proper light
okay so let me just know how many of you
are watching this
so I guess zero people are watching
okay let me just do all the stuff our
light is not good not at all good I
guess I have to change my location for
today how good the light is
let me just shred this link
I guess nighttime is not a good time to
make this type of videos okay so two
people are watching
I'm not able to see my own video in the
list that's weird okay great
so now oh 19 people are watching it's it
is jumped good numbers okay let me share
the link on Facebook so that people who
don't know can connect it now and let me
know is the problem is it I think it's
proper I don't think it is good but
and I also need to mail to some people
how is the light guys is it is it proper
you just made it to everyone who is that
in my list by the time this swimming is
going on you can ask your question and I
can try to
okay so lighting is proper as you're
saying if you just because people are
asking me for the line
well as I stay linked everyone asking
the same question by the leg and I've
shared a link on Facebook guys we just
see there
oh gosh Roy I guess I remember you
just two two more minutes guys
just two more minutes
okay
okay so swimming is good right there's
no lags nothing
okay perfect so I guess light is one of
the issue and let me just remove my
headphones okay so we are all set to
start the thing and if you feel any lag
is there just comment in the comment
section because I'm not monitoring my
own video there might be some lag and
just checking all your comments here
okay so and I'm getting some more
messages
okay so not today's why why I mean why
I'm a life today after long time in fact
it's been to all I don't know maybe more
than two months I was it's been more
than two months I have done a live
session now why today it's because after
a long time I got free from the training
so so that's why I wanted to do a live
session today and Kate Shaitan I cannot
increase the brightness of my screen
because it will only increase the
badness of what you say brightness off
my screen not the lighting here so I
know it's very very bad lighting is
there how about if I if I on my friend I
mean the flashlight just do that oh I
don't even have a flashlight option here
that's weird
so I cannot on my flashlight but I have
something I can okay what I can do is I
can use my this phone I will say right
now and that will look more weird you
know have it it will be pain in my eyes
in some time you know if this will work
okay hold on a stable guy okay so you
can see this is not at all a
professional setup this is just with
some beard okay I can see myself now
okay so how is that now is it this is it
lighting is fine okay okay okay okay so
I mean the topic for today is Career
Guidance motivation and how to prepare
for introduce how to prepare yourself
for a better career an IT and and and
then some some questions which which I
will try to answer okay so let's start
with the let's tell you the first one
let's start with something as motivation
then we move towards the credit guidance
now now CV we are into this world of IT
right now whenever you say IT we are
living in two different worlds in fact I
feel we should not like that because
that's jugaadu I know
okay yeah so yeah where was I
okay that I can feel that light in my
eyes now yeah so say we are into this
world of IT right now wait when it comes
to IT we live in two different worlds
right
so as as human believe in real world
right example if you see this if you see
this small tripod this is this is a
living object if you say this headphones
cover this is a living object so I mean
this is the object in real world so all
these are objects right around you so
it's all unreal but when it comes to the
IT industry mate when it comes to
software everything is virtual right and
you are the people who will be the
virtual who will be working in this
virtual world let me just hold on man my
nephew is making some noise okay okay so
yeah so we are into this software world
right so everything around you I mean
when you when you talk about software's
it is virtual can you touch soft and no
right so software is something you
cannot touch so it is something like a
virtual world right so around you you
have all physical entities but so around
you we have all physical entities right
and you are walking with virtual things
example we are living in real world
which is physically we are in real world
but virtually mentally we always think
about virtual world so physically we are
in real world but virtually we are
always in virtual world that means when
you think about software's when you
think about let's say if I if I tell you
a tumble as Windows in fact one day I
say this to every everything I mean
every batch for that for that matter but
once one day I was working on a project
I am continuously for lots of hours and
so continuously after walking for some
hours
I was so enough I mean mentally I was
disturbed on that working on that
software it was not a difficult thing
but it's just that you know thinking
about some issues and bugs in the
software make you makes your mind very
weird so I was working on the project
and my
mom was going out for some some some
work and I have a Macintosh machine
right so I use Mac OS and suddenly my
mom says okay when you go out make sure
you close the windows I was like hell I
don't have I don't have a Mac here I
don't have windows in my entire in my
Mac right I'm using a Macintosh so she
was talking about the actual windows
which is there here so what happens is
we always think in virtual world right
so when you hear Windows we talk about
Windows always when you talk about
whatsapp now so if anyone says hey
whatsapp
what's up so with the term which comes
to your mind is whatsapp right so
everything what you think is always
example packet if I say packet I always
imagine packet is a network packet you
know the packet which goes on internet I
don't other than think about what you
say a packet which will have some data
right so we always talk about this
we always think in virtual world so when
it comes to IT what is our job so our
job in IT industry is to solve these
real-world issues with the help of
virtual world solutions ok now what I
mean by that so let's say if I want to
get a cab for the airport now so let's
say I want if I want to go to airport
now I want to get a cab and it's very
difficult why'd you have to go on road
and you have to show your hand ok Rick
so when you go to airport and of course
all this taxi weather and auto-align
Mumbai especially no one no one will
know and will I get to go there so so
now what what happens what has happened
is that's a real issue right so not
getting our proper taxi or a cab to go
somewhere is an issue now how to solve
that issue so uber ola they came up with
an application using which you can book
a cab right so that application is a
it's a solution for the real world issue
ok so when it comes to software so when
it comes to software it's all about
solving the real-world issues with the
help of virtual world solutions and you
are the people who are responsible to
make that right you are in your the
people who will be making that thing
work so you will be making all those
virtual world solutions for the real
world problem I mean it doesn't matter
what problem you're working with example
in issue
when no one was having any any mode of
communication they used to use those
what you say in India we have this
famous thing called as Kabuto you know
the wish to send pigeons to send
messages to one from one place to other
place and then later on we we made
something called a steady phone so using
telephone you can call someone you can
give the message and later we got SMS
service right and everyone was happy
with SMS service trust me everyone was
happy with SMS service I mean just
imagine if you want to if I might talk
to someone special if you are if you're
in love for the first time you know you
will be sending got some messages you
know all those you will you will create
a message just imagine you living in a
world of Nokia double one double zero
remember that phone we have used to have
torch one phone I don't have my mom
mom's phone here
but anyway so well we have used to have
those phones right no care about one
double zero in which if you want to type
a message you have to go to message you
have to you have to click on create
message type the message now that
message goes to sent items right and
then so let's say if you receive a
message from the other end now you have
to verify okay from the receiver end I
got okay so if you get okay on from the
receiver I mean from the you receive the
message for less okay now you're not
sure what that person is talking about
right what you have send it so you will
go to your column so you will you will
go to your sent items you will check the
message and then again you will come
back to inbox and you will check the
message again you will go to sent
message again you will come to inbox so
that problem was solved with the help of
the SMS some mobile application where
you can get the thread view right so
when you when you get messages now you
always get that using a thread view I
hope I will not open any weird message
on my phone now just to show you which
one to okay so everyone knows about the
thread view right I don't have any
message in this phone that's weird so
this is third view right so this is
thread view so you have all the messages
so you have all the messages and if you
send a message it will come here when
you receive the message you will get
here so when when you get messages one
by one it is like
zigzag zigzag so you can see what you
have sent what you are
saving right so that was everyone was
happy with a semi service then someday
whatsapp came up and says okay SMS is
not good because it uses it uses here it
will charge you second when you when you
send an SMS you don't get delivered
option we get delivered option but you
don't get a readout read option rights
on whatsapp when you send a message you
get that read option so person has read
your message right so SMS we only get
delivery report but in on whatsapp you
also get what you say is the read
message right so everyone is happy with
whatsapp now so if you talk about this
problem of communication it is solved
with the other wats app but hold on now
we have Google I don't know how to
pronounce that it's alo so now we have
Google hello I don't know how to I love
a maybe our doesn't matter so you know
their application right so if you don't
know that go to Google and search for
Google a double-l oh now it's an
application it's a chatting application
where it has an inbuilt AI so it will
give you suggestions depend upon what
that what type of person you're talking
to so let's say if you're talking to
your your mom so it will give you so
depend upon your last chat it will try
to predict your next move right so it's
an it's an it's an what you say it's an
application so telling application which
is a robotic toy application so
somewhere it will beat whatsapp now okay
maybe what's I will not shut it down
because of that but somebody will reduce
the market of whatsapp right so we all
are walking with what for this so
software is something which is which can
solve a real-world issues with the help
of virtual world solutions okay so now
it is your job okay you are the
magicians for other companies now think
about banking industry into some
everyone says by that banking industry
has lots of money for in this oil
industry they have lots of money but
mind you people all this industry works
based on IT so if it if you think about
ITIF you think about banking now to do
anything they need software's they need
systems they need people who can work on
those softwares right there are totally
relying on software's now and who is
making it possible it is we people we
are creating the software using which
banking industry works
think about e-commerce industry think
about Amazon Amazon has you know Amazon
flip card they are cracking everything
no one goes to malls now to buy
something they go to flip cart they buy
products in fact clothes right we are
not sure if that load will fit to you
but we go to flip cart and we buy
products there because they provide easy
returns we have all those schemes
important is IT is changing everything
and you are the part of it
ok see ID is not just about software now
a lot you see if you go to colleges and
if you join any course like be a CIT
engineering model doesn't matter which
engineering you're from you have this
mindset you know IT is all about Sophos
nothing like that I just not about
software I think is about providing the
solution IIT is it's working with
information so using technology to work
with information and you are the people
who will be doing that ok so there's a
huge scope variety there are lots of
fields available it's not just software
development it's not just website
development it's also about providing
the support it's also about providing
the support it's also about testing that
software it's all about coming for
coming with a new solution right so when
you think about IT now don't just think
about programming don't just think think
about the language that's the first
thing so now why why to be an IT
professional I mean everyone is doing so
I'm sure people 75 people are watching
me now and I'm sure everyone everyone is
like they are from IT background hardly
one or two people will be from other
background and maximum people are from
IT background right you are doing your
BSC IT or you are doing their b e odd
you have done with your b e and i if you
are looking for a job or by no way i'm
providing your job here and maybe there
are people who are into IT there is a
different domain now they have to ship
to java so the main thing is you have to
understand as a students specially if
you have to understand that it's not
about your syllabus ok industry works on
different technologies ok there is
there's a there's a huge difference
between these syllabus you learn in
colleges
there's a difference between the
technology vis they use and industry
example it mean let me talk about if you
talk about Java you know in colleges
they teach you coach our concept they
teach you about
oops concept that teach you about
further of their teaching about threads
but as soon as you come into industry no
one uses Java right everyone uses
servlet I mean not even servlet they use
Spring Framework they use hibernate
framework they will be using all those
frameworks and some ways that plain work
you will be using Java right so it
doesn't know is this it's not that you
know if you know Java you'll know if
your thing Java is just a part of it
okay
so you should know it you should be
knowing frameworks example spring
framework like hibernate framework I'm
talking only about Java because I know
about Java if we talk about PHP I don't
know much frameworks on that maybe there
is something called as wishfully what we
have for PHP we have cupcake hold on not
cake cases it is cakephp ojeda on
YouTube what's that error okay I hope
there's no lag there let me just check
the health of this this proper you know
first time I'm not getting any health
issues here
is okay so yeah so I was talking about
you know so don't just depend up on your
color syllabus okay
please don't depend up on your caller
syllabus I'm not saying don't read
I mean don't study those syllabus I'm
saying that you have to sell you those
syllabus plus you have to look out for
some extra technology we are not living
in a world so it does that generation is
gone okay so if we talk about here mm if
we talk about year 2005 that's okay if
you know your college cut if you know
about your college curriculum and if you
are giving the exam it's because all
this curriculum I mean all this syllabus
they were that they were designed in
year 2000 okay just imagine when you
let's say this is year 2002 okay so
you're reading something you're learning
in your called something which is
designed two years back right but now we
are living in 2016 and still still you
are reading a syllabus of year 2000 and
that's the biggest issue I'm not saying
all colleges all all your cities they
have year to the 2000 US but most of
them they are still using year 2000
syllables okay they're still teaching
you see see programming on turbo C plus
they're still teaching you Java on come
online they're still teaching you Java
only till not even threads I guess right
so the important thing is don't don't
depend upon your college syllabus it
doesn't matter you're from B EBS CIT or
any field okay that's not enough
then question arise how to improve your
skills okay okay let me show you this so
first don't depend up on your course
syllabus second one see everyone wants
success okay trust me there's no one in
the world who is I don't want success
now success for other people it means
different things for some people success
means money for some people success
means getting a good post so for some
people success means being happy in
their life example I am not earning much
and I am you know I'm not what you say
but I'm happy with my field right and
what I'm doing is I'm very happy I mean
I'm in the training field I am very
happy
daily it doesn't matter where I go if I
go to go for corporate training I'm
happy when I'm doing live session on
YouTube I'm happy see that when I'm
doing quadric
videos I'm happy when I'm teaching
online I'm happy right so so for some
people it's about money for some people
it's being happy in your life right so
so everyone wants success so if you want
success the first thing is don't just
stop yourself for college syllabus if
okay that that's the first one second
be in to good friend circle and trust me
your friend circle matters okay now when
it comes to fencers but it is like this
is a quote I mean they're saying that
you are the average of five people
around you okay so let me repeat you are
the average of five people around you so
if you are staying with people who don't
like to study of course you will not
study right because your friend says
okay let's go for movie let's go for a
party you will go for a party right of
course why you will study but let's say
if ya shut the yeah she sucked it is
popular ideas success I can feel that
now okay so there was I was talking
about your friend circle so if your
friend Sun is good we know if any if you
know if your friend circle believes that
you should you should work hard I mean
if your friend circle is working hard of
course you will work hard because you
will try you will gain something from
your friend circle you will try to what
you say match up with them so have a
good friend circle that is very
important I mean I have seen people from
colleges you know they spoil their
career it's see trust me you are into
the most you are into the field which is
one of the biggest field ever okay trust
me it is one of the biggest field ever i
t is like what you say without ID no one
can work now okay I told you right right
ecommerce reps I mean
commerce banking medical fields
everything is work with ID right so you
are into that field so you have to take
the advantage of it okay I'm not saying
for next 50 years we will be using the
same concept but currently everything is
going with IT right so why don't you
give give your best right so good get a
good friend circle I mean change your
friends okay so if you if you have a
best friend if you have a friend circle
who are not into that into IT spend some
less time with them I'm not
not saying leave them but trying to
spend more time with those people who
are working in this okay get a good
mentor okay so what I'm doing now is so
what I'm doing now is mentoring you
right so I'm not just the only mentor
you have there are lots of other mentors
you can get so you can get mentors on
YouTube you have your college professors
and the most important thing is you have
your college friends okay your seniors
if you find anyone from your seniors who
is good with programming who is good
with this IT technology be friends with
them okay so so get a good friend circle
dad is very very important okay okay now
next see if you like if you look
polished student spend money on learning
don't spend money on buying new gadgets
buying new vehicles buying new maybe
buying new clothes
okay if you have money you can do that
but if you if you don't have much money
spent on education spend on learning
notes new stuff you can join classes you
can if you if you want to be master get
certified okay that's very important
right so spend money on that so first
thing for success is you have to learn
extra stuff you have to be into good
friend circle now next one you have to
improve your skills daily
okay so when I say daily I'm at home I
mean I'm at home minor in in fact the
whole day I was I was at I was at home
and just imagine if you're a hit on what
you will do you will you will take rest
right but what happens is I cannot do
that since I am a youtuber I am a
trainer I have to I have to update
myself daily and now today I was
learning Scala right the whole day from
morning till evening I was stepping for
two hours in between but from morning
till evening I was learning Scala right
so even if you know some technologies it
is not enough you have to improve
yourself daily so at this level if I am
learning new stuff you are a student
right you have to learn daily then you
have to work hard you have to work two
times than me okay Frank if I'm if I'm
working on if I'm improving improving my
skills for two hours you have to improve
your skills for four hours right when I
was truant I used to work very hard I
mean
I'm not talking about the education part
I was I was not a topper of the college
it's just that I wanted to improve
myself okay so I wanted to improve my
skills so I used to I used to read stuff
which which others don't know I had this
habit example if pH pH pH if pH P is
famous and everyone is learning PHP I
will not learn PHP I have that neck I
have that mindset okay if everyone is
going for one thing I will go for
something which no one is going I don't
know if it's good or bad example when I
choose Java for the first time I was not
knowing Java so Java is so important
it's just that people were going for
dotnet I went for Java when in 10th
standard when everyone wanted when
everyone was hating 18 mats I used to
love math I used to hate other subjects
right I mean I feel if you if you are
investing at time always invest in
something which others don't know right
so that's why I'm learning Scala now
because we don't have much programmers
we don't have much trainers for scholars
so if you improve your skills in such a
language that no one is knowing that's
the best thing you can do you know you
will be the first one to know that ok so
yeah that's that's the thing so improve
yourself daily and what's important is
how can you judge if you are in if you
are improving daily I know people are
learning lots of stuff right but how can
you make sure that you you are improving
yourself daily so what you can do is you
can you can be you can go to some
websites where they have competitive
programming's example there's a website
called as hiker earth is a website
called as hiker drank and you can go
there and you can you know participate
because on those websites that you they
will give you lots of lots of what you
say quizzes or not quizzes but
programming assignments so you have to
complete the programming assignments ok
so you have to complete all the
programming assignments here's my nephew
ok he want to be into this thing so
yeah that's a bit of you ha so uh where
was I was talking about so you have to
uh yeah yeah you can go to hacker rank
you can go to hiker so these are the
websites where you can go and you can
improve your knowledge daily okay so on
this website you can find some
programming assignments you can find
some some questions to work on
and if you see initially you will find
it very difficult trust me initially you
will find it very difficult to crack
those questions but you know step by
step you can do that once you will start
with so you can start with small step
you can start with code of palindrome
prime number but after some time after
some time it you know you can crank
those difficult questions and there are
lots of companies they what it do is
they you know they crack they try to
they try to hire people example Google
Facebook Twitter all this company they
hire people from for hi Kovac or hiker
earth right because hacker Earth has
best programmers so what they do they
hire people from this these websites so
if you want to get into Google it is
your time go to hacker earth and try to
compete okay I could eat this I got this
not my website and by no mean I'm
promoting that website here okay it's
just that if you want to be a good
programmer because I can see lots of
questions are there how to master in
Java
see you cannot master in Java in three
months or two months it will take lots
of time it's just that you have to
improve yourself daily in fact I cannot
say myself as master of Java now okay I
know Java I know Java till I exchange I
have to improve myself dinner right so I
you can see there are lots of books up
there you cannot see this is a whole
show this is a three-floor shelf fear
right so there are lots of books ah it's
there so I applied myself daily I'm not
trying out saying I read the whole book
but some point some some new topics one
day that will that will improve our lots
of stuff right ok so yeah so you have to
improve so you go to hack earth compete
and if you can rank I mean if you get
the top if you are into top ten
trust me Guk you will get a mail from
Google for the interviews I am NOT
saying you will you will crack the
interview of Google
but at least you will get a call from
them right Konev oh yes and hiker rank
is difficult okay so that's so first one
to get the success improve yourself get
a good good
get into good friend zone okay you can
join some clubs the tech tech clubs okay
john malkovich oh okay that was my
nephew my my my brother's son okay I
guess he also want to learn Java I mean
he'll he knows all those keyboard
shortcuts now okay so yeah so you have
to improve yourself and now what is what
the next thing so let's say now after
your graduation let's say you have done
with your B e you have done with your be
a CIT know what next we don't get a job
see that there are college campus wide
took everyone get job in campus so
companies like TC years they will DC us
in for Infosys they will they will go to
this companies I will they will do they
will go to colleges and they will hire
people right but you know what the issue
is which company you should choose first
as there are basically three types of
job you can search for first you can
search a job in service industry you can
you can get a job in product based
companies or you can get a job and in a
company where they use IT example if you
join bank sector like example Bank of
America or some companies like this they
will have their own IT department right
so you can join them I will I would
always suggest you to suggest you to go
for at least product based companies or
other companies where they need IT
developers don't ever don't ever go to a
service based companies and that's
that's my that's my thing okay
nothing personal okay I don't want any
issues on this thing but I would suggest
if you if given a choice always choose
our product based companies are a
banking type of companies don't go for
don't go for the service based companies
okay okay the thing is the problem is
service based companies is did you don't
know what the dot profile they will give
you example they may hire you for a
developer
we'll give you some support stuff
because especially in India there are
lots of vacancies only for support thing
they don't have much vacancies for
developers okay so I would suggest you
to go for product based companies now
question arise how to get into products
companies is it that easy very difficult
okay because the problem is
service-based industry they hire 200
people from one campus just imagine
they're going for a campus interview for
a thousand people and they hire 200
people out of them I mean like he'll
having 200 people from one college one
company and then the same thing when you
when you talk about protect based
companies they only hire five to six
people from one college hardly five and
six okay so if you are getting to
polygamist companies you'll be actually
working on technologies which you want
example if you feel good if you like
Java you can use Java technology there
if you like dotnet you can use dotnet
there if you I mean you can work on
doesn't auto platform because that's why
they are hiring you right so so get into
okay let me just verify this anything on
Facebook
I'm just saying okay so I'll just get
into product based product based
companies that's that's what I would
suggest you to go for okay okay let me
just
okay yeah so go for Patek with products
companies now is it is it to get into
that and the answer is no it is very
difficult to get into various companies
for that you need you need to do you
need to show some skills now there are
two ways of showing skills first get
certified okay the second one build
amazing product product
I mean projects okay no one is stopping
you from from building the projects
right so there are two ways one is get
certified second one is build projects
okay so if even if you are in college
now you can start working on big
projects no one is no one is saying that
you cannot do this right and this is
what happens when you have some new
concept and when you will when you will
go to your college so when you when you
get that concept and when you go to your
college what happens is there will be
your friends there will be your
professors who will say now this is this
is impossible okay so this you will say
that this is impossible right what what
you have in to us what you have to do is
you have to okay there is there some
guest in my house okay I guess someone
had their birthday party in my in my
building and we got some we got some
cake and wafers that's awesome I'm very
hungry now I was talking about yeah so
you have to get certified or you can
build a project and no project is a
small project or it is impossible
project if you think there's a concept
in your mind start building it okay
maybe you can you can make the hook you
can complete the project fully or even
if you're not able to complete that
that's okay but you have to at least
ride it right so while working on
project you will learn those stuff which
you cannot learn in your college you
can't you can't even learn by yourself I
mean if you are practicing so doing
project always helps okay so get a get a
concept and start working on it now the
most important point is that is
certification there lots of questions
should we go for certification or not I
would suggest if you have money if you
have time please please go for the
duplication the thing is company will
trust you only based on your certificate
okay again UK dick so let's say if I
want developers I wish I want Java
developers what I will do is
okay yeah so if I want donor possible
for my company I will hide those person
who knows lots of stuff like so
but how would I know if you if I ask you
to send your resume and if I am getting
thousands of resumes to whom I will call
I will not call everyone right so if I'm
getting thousands of resume a every day
I will call only those people who are
certified right all at least who have
done the project so if you have your
project live I can go then I can check
your project right so you need two
things either you need you need one or
not one of them either you need
certificate or you need a project or you
need both
okay get certified which one to get
certified as you can choose you can go
for Java certification you can go for
dotnet certification you can go for what
else we have the uncertificated like Red
Hat certifications so for different
things we have different certifications
right so for Java you can go you can go
for Oracle certification what dot need
of course you have to go for Microsoft
certification I don't know the cost for
Microsoft certification but for Java it
is so that there are certain levels you
have to go for if in java we have Java
six Java 7 Java 8 exams which are still
going on I don't prefer to go I've done
well I don't I will not recommend you to
go for Java 6 exam you can go for Java 7
or Java 8 okay so yeah so you can go for
Java 7 and or you can go for Java 8 but
if you're going for Java so Java 8 you
have to give two exams now one is OSI a
and OCP so first you have to complete
OCA which is where I got certified
associate in Java programmer then we
have OC OC P which is our Oracle
certified Java programmer those are the
two things for Java programmer and after
you complete Java programmer you can go
for Android you can go for web
development you can go for the Hadoop
right you can also set certified
yourself in Hadoop in fact I started
learning Hadoop now I'm working on
Hadoop
I mean I'm learning Hadoop now and soon
I'll be making videos on Scala and
Hadoop okay so that's the thing okay so
get certified if given a choice I will
either always choose or certified
okay but the only thing is the cost
issue because it will cost you a nine
thousand rupees per exam so if you are
running short of money go for project
okay if you have money you can invest
time and I told you right if you have
money file investing your money on so if
you have spending money on clothes
you're spending money on I'm not saying
don't wear clothes I'm just saying don't
spend much on clothes I don't spend much
on new gadgets you can use oil gauge
that student and don't spend much on
vehicles you can buy certification
vouchers if you want
okay spend on your on your skills okay
okay so to get certified for so to get
certified you can go to a local website
and Oracle website you can go for good
so if you go to Oracle website is option
of training and if you go to twinning
there will be option of certification
okay so you will get the idea from there
so yeah so to certification I will
always pay for a person who is certified
okay anything else talked about okay let
me just go for some questions here
Oh for Java they're asking for 14,000
rupees for training or for the for
certification for certification it is
only 9000 okay for training it see it
all depend upon which which Institute
you join the everyone have their own
everyone have their own fees in fact I
take online courses I charge around I
can my daddy's depend upon the discount
anyway so 14,000 is not a big amount for
to learn Java so you have to think about
return on return on investment if you
are if you are spending 14,000 learning
Java and if you get a good job just
imagine how much you will earn from that
so it's an it's an investment so I feel
my spending money for the education is
an investment okay so let me just go
forward okay so question is which is
best for career Java or Python C if you
want to keep your options open
I would suggest go for Java because Java
is faster than Python in fact pythons
getting famous for data analytics
okay and I would suggest Java because
Java is faster than Python
and for data scientists if you I mean
for the Hadoop at least what is I do
basically is it's a platform where you
can process huge amount of huge amount
of data example is recently if you know
whatsapp in whatsapp you had this option
of you can share I mean there was option
of you can you can connect your whatsapp
with Facebook okay so in settings if you
can go this option of uncheck yourself
from Facebook right so what Facebook was
planning Wars Facebook's will access
your whatsapp data to get the interest
okay so they will get your interest and
based on that they will give you ads so
Facebook was ready to process all the
information of all the chat so let's
I've if you say hi to your friend
Facebook knows about it and let's say if
you if you say if you say you want to
it's always 10 it's almost 10 p.m. now
I'm getting signals from my mom because
I have another session now normally I
take online training at 10 10 to 10:30
11:30 so just two more minutes yeah so
if Facebook want to process all the
information they have to use a concept
of big data and for that we need Hadoop
okay how do you be the framework which
works with big data okay and to work
with big data we have three languages to
work with we can either work with Python
in fact Big Data uses a concept of
MapReduce so you can you can use Python
you can use Java you can use Scala so
Python is slower than Java and Java is
slower than Scala so if you want speed
ultimate speed go for Scala if you want
good speed go for java and python if it
personally I don't prefer Python but
it's not a good it's not a bad choice to
go for Python there are lots of
programmers it is easy to learn language
because Java has lots of by the
boilerplate code you have to remember
lots of stuff Python is easy to learn so
it's depend upon you what in which field
you want to go for okay now how to start
online make your own videos it's so
simple and now start making a start
ok fertile for jobs you can go to some
websites like freelancer calm they will
be having some projects but they will
not give you the project ok because you
are someone who is in a very new so
initially you have to work for free ok
so take some projects work for free and
when you complete the project ask the
receiver of the project to give you good
back okay and based on those feedbacks
next time when you when you I know when
you apply for the what happens is if I
want to make a project I will give it to
you I will post that on free the
freelancing freelancer calm and lots of
people they will bid okay so someone
will do it for $5.00 someone will do is
for $50.00 I will I will give it to
someone who will who will charge less
plus who will who will who has the
experience okay so start with
freelancing calm it will be helpful okay
next question is okay so big boss says
he has one month of holiday what goes to
do learn Java get certified okay and you
will bless me later okay okay okay what
next we have is lighting is good
everyone's talking about writing yeah
background noise is rotating I know but
if I close my windows it will be very
hot here okay so for Java which book is
off offspring which book I prefer in
fact I use this book which is okay hold
on it's not coming out okay so this is
the book I prefer for Java for spring
okay but this is spring 3 and the latest
watch latest version of spring is spring
for this is spring 3 for big news from
sure denim shop or sharanam Shah okay
I'm not saying this is the best book but
I use this there are lots of other book
you can read you can also use spring in
action which is a very good book
okay how to stay motivated while writing
an app okay that's a very good answer
wait for the output okay you have to you
have to keep working on your app till
you get the output in fact there will be
some days where you will stuck with the
code and trust me that code will like
hell
okay there will be a bug in your code
annual it will take two days for you to
find the bug okay and once you solve
that work when you get the output that
is something you're waiting for okay so
how do you keep motivating yourself work
on the project and let I mean get the
proper output and so you took joy to
your anxiety or professors show you to
your parents oh no you have friends
there was a tilt they will guide you
okay there was a setting change
okay last minute signing off
again I was not able to complete all the
questions today but next time I am again
going for a live session in next week so
next week probably it will be on Monday
