functions let's talk about in fix and
operator overloading
so I mean think about this when you talk
about this this function which is plus
and you know that it takes only one
parameter so in Cortlandt we got this
awesome feature which is called as in
fix now what is the advantage of using
in fact so instead of talking with using
fix before let's see the advantage the
advantage would be instead of saying a 1
dot plus a 2 can we make it just more
like English language where you simply
say a 1 plus a 2 there's no there is no
need of bracket there I mean it will
look awesome right when you have a 1
plus a 2 right
it looks more like English language in
fact we have used this before as well
life we remember when we have talked
about for loop or gate when we talked
about range in range we were saying 10
down to 1 so when you want it to go from
10 to 1 we say it 10 down to 1 so that
down to is also a in fees for in fix
function then we have one more in for
job also we were saying I in some value
right so that even that in is a in fixed
function so we using anything in fixed
function we can actually use English
like text where you can say a1 plus a2
the only thing is in fix was with a
function which takes only one parameter
so as you can see in this case we are
passing only one parameter and it also
returns something right so what we'll do
is just to make it work we simply have
to put one a keyword for this in fix and
your job is done can you see that it is
working there is no compile time error
now so you can simply say a1 plus a2
your job is done
the only thing you have to do is you
have to put in fix in front of that so
this is in fix for in fixed function you
remember only one thing in fix function
takes only one parameter now if I run
this code and it should work
you can you see that it works so instead
of using dot and then racket at the end
we can say a1 plus a2 it's that awesome
right so this is in fix function now
let's talk about operator overloading
now if you if you are coming from C++ in
fact in C we were not having all this
concept
in c++ they said hey we now we can use
operator overloading we can we can
change the way your operator works and
we were very excited with that and then
in Java we don't have operator
overloading and to be honest I used to
love orbiter were loading but not that
much that we should include that in a
project even if you love operator
overloading in C++ I don't know how many
of you actually implement that in a
project scenario and in Java also we
have not missed operator overloading
there but and quadlings says okay maybe
you are not using orbiter overloading in
the project but we do provide those
features in case if you need it because
officer what learning using operator
overloading do create some issues in the
project you know it increases the
complexity of your software but then it
is good to good to have features right
now how do you implement operator
overloading here because when you say
operator operators it simply means that
you know if you have well-defined types
like integers so when you say integer
percentage it will give you integer when
you say string plus string it will give
you a combined string but when it comes
to a 1 and a 2
can I see plus in between you can see
this it is get is giving you an error
right of course you cannot use plus in
between a 1 and a 2
how would your plus operator knows what
to do right and that's why we use a
concept of overloading so we specify a
plus if you if you find yourself in
between alien object and an alien object
what you have to do is you just have to
call this function plus it's that simple
so whenever you see plus operator in
between you just have to call this
function called as plus but then can be
can be used any character here can we
use any of the character or not exactly
so quadlin says there's a limited set of
operators which we can use for operator
overloading now how do we know that so
you could you can go to the official
website of Cortland which is which is
Cortland bajji and they do have their
own documentation I just love this
documentation in fact I'm trying to
create as many ins videos possible from
this documentation are not exactly I'm
following this tutorial here but then
you know I'm taking help of this how to
create exchange ins how to use loops how
to use ranges so I have you some
examples here so in this they have a
concept called as operator overloading
where
they are talking about different
operators which are supported example
they support unity operators where you
can use plus/minus then exclamation
which is not and even if you are using
plus here it will get converted into
unary plus when we use minus it will be
converted into a unity - when you use
not it uses not function same goes with
this one increment decrement when you
say plus plus it goes for increment
method when you go say - - it goes for
decrement method and this goes on now
then we have binary operators where you
have + so when you when you try to do +
we have to use our function name as plus
now this company ok you have to use the
same function name otherwise it will not
work so in this example we'll be looking
looking at only + here you can try it
out you can go with - you can go with x
which is multiplication you can go with
division you can go with remainder and
in fact you can see that we have used
this one before as well right so this is
range in fact so this is range ok so
let's go back and yeah there's one more
update so if you want to go for mod you
should be using Ram which is for
reminder not mod because mod is they
have deprecated mod so again you can use
mod but then not it is not recommended
so let me go back or they are they also
have a index thing okay they also
provide zakat as the operator
overloading we can use this ok let me
just go back to my code and let's see
what we can do here so anyway you have +
so if so this plus we'll call this +
right but it should work right we have
seen that on the on the page but then
just to define that this + works with
the operator which is not a inducer
function here we have to use a keyword
called as operator the moment you do
that it will be treated oh what's that
yeah so the moment you do that it will
be treated as an operator so whenever
you say plus it will call this plus if
you want to go for - you have to define
- that's how it works
let me just on this code and it does
work right so that's how you use in fix
function and that's why you you that's
how you use operator overloading just to
recap in fixed function takes only one
parameter that you have to remember and
you have to define in 6 keyword there if
you want to use operator overloading you
just have to put an operator
operator as a keyword before and then
you can use a normal operators which we
use so that's it that's it everyone
