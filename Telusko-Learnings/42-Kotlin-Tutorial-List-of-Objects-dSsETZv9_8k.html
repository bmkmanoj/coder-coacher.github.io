create a list of integers now what if I
want to get a list of string maybe I can
create a list of float it's actually
very easy now
whatever you do is I will go back to my
normal list I will not be going for
mutable this because we have seen that
one let's remove this and let's get back
to L which is least of least of and let
me just not add this stuff here let me
remove everything now the thing is what
if you want to have a list of float it's
very easy you can simply mention float
here right and you can you can have
float values of course integer value
will not work right you have to say
float values here what if you want to
work with list of string you are welcome
you can have a list of string and it
will work that's very easy the tricky
part is can I have my own class maybe I
can have my own data class can I create
object to my of my data class here first
of all let me create a data class so I
will say data class I will say alien now
this agent will have two variables I
will say the variable is where okay so
bad name I will say name of type string
and let me just have a point so it's a
bad point and we say point will be of
type int so once we got our data class
what I do is I want to create object of
my alien is it possible let's try so
what I will say I don't have a least off
float but I have a list of alien that's
allocated list of aliens here and then
here how can I create those objects okay
so I will say alien I can specify those
two values I will specify the name as
let's say in double quotes I will
specify Naveen and I will specify the
points as 70 I will be having a second
object I will say alien the name is
let's say shredder just as father
whispering wash with okay shredder and
then let's say the the point is let's
say 80 so we got naveen 70 and Shwetha
80 and once we got these two aliens can
I print those aliens let's write out a I
doesn't make sense
let's write a lien here again there's
nothing wrong with a that I okay and
it's just saying values we can say
aliens that will make more sense now
let's verify these working or not and
let's run this code okay it's coming
okay so here is that it is also it also
work with data class as well so when you
talk about the digital values or least
of least in in Cortland it also supports
complex object as well again this is the
obvious thing because this this does
work in Java so it will be working in
Cortland as well the only thing is some
people do get confused because when you
talk about arrays when you talk about
these people do learn it in only with
integers or string I'm going to work
with complex object that's where they
define difficult it's actually very easy
the way you work with integers the way
you work with string the same thing you
will work with normal object as well so
regatta sailing class and there is no
need that this agent should get either
class it can be any class we just have
to get the object here and against not
composite to assign the values here
itself we can specify the objects value
later I mean you can specify this object
in the list later provided you're using
multiple lists right that will make more
sense because you have immutable list
there now what if I want to go for the
explicit type so you can get it right
now so if you want to go for explicit
type you can say this is a list of alien
oh what's that
this is a list of alien right so we got
a list of alien here and then you are
printing all the aliens inside you can
print a specific value so if i say alien
dot if you don't want to print all the
values you can print a one specifically
which can print name as well so if i run
this code it will only print name now so
it will print
naveen and shweta so that's why we can
work with complex objects and code line
with list interface oh I forgot to 85 it
is what is that what is which is this so
as you can see least is also the
interface in cotton line the same wages
there in Java and it extends this list
extends a collection collection
interface the same thing right
and it has got all these properties from
Java so you can see everything which is
there here the actually coming from Java
so they have taken lots of stuff here
from Java and ok and one of my one of my
video I got a comment as well AG don't
stop raising Java but then you have to
understand that if I don't play Java
Cortland will not survive because
quadlin works on Java technology right
so it's not that I'm not saying I'm
saying Java is the best languages that
it's just that cotton is based on Java
so yeah so behind it saying everything
is Java here right so we go out yeah so
that's how this thing worked
and then in coming videos we also talked
about how do you physically - maybe I
don't want to print all the Asian object
I want to print only alien object
who-who got less than 40 points or maybe
who in - whose name starts with N and on
Facebook this trending is going on just
tag a person with name n this we will
try to do that all the stuff so yeah
that's it from this video guys in the
upcoming videos we are getting some
amazing features so stay tuned and make
sure that you subscribe my channel and
