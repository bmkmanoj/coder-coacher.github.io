from tellus quadratics and in this video
we'll talk about registration form so we
have already done with addition of two
numbers now we know how to use Android
studio we know what is activity we know
about different layouts we talked about
relative layout now we also talked about
how to create event on a button why in
this video we'll talk about the design
once again so we talked about a layout
and then we'll talk about linear layout
and which will try to make this this
design here in which you have an image
in between you have a text field where
you enter your name and then you will be
having a radio buttons for gender then
you'll be having your email ID and
password and then we'll say this is once
you click on this button it should save
your data so in this video we'll only
talk about design in the next video
we'll talk about the walking of this
okay so I will break this in two videos
one will be designs again for the
walking okay we may not achieve the same
design exactly the same but we'll try to
do it similar okay so let's get back to
Android studio
okay that's Android studio here okay now
once we got into Android studio so this
is the activity I have already created
so the activity name here is sign up dot
XML okay focus on this design so let's
go to the text view so you can see we
just have a linear layout here so
whenever you create a new activity you
will get a relative layout we are going
for a linear layout here okay now so how
to use linear layout instead of using
creative layout just mention linear here
now when you work with linear we have to
mention that you are working with a
vertical layout or you are working with
horizontal layout so if you see the
output we want to achieve it is a
vertical layout right so we have all the
components one below other so to mention
that we are working with a linear layout
so in vertical layout we have to mention
that we have to mention the orientation
here and the white orientation we are
working with is vertical now once once
we have mentioned that now let's go for
next so if you see the background color
here so that's a blue color right so we
to set the color here so we can set we
can say color or we have to set
background here okay dot o we have to
use inside this bracket so that's
background and then we can set any color
so we can mention hash and if you
mentioned this as f of zero zero zero
zero that will give you black color
right and of course we don't want black
color so you can see we got a black
color so we want a specific color so I
have already created a color here so you
can create a color you can mention the
color here or you can let's say you want
to use the color throughout the
application the same color so instead of
writing that color everywhere you can
mention you can create a variable or you
can do you can call that as variable so
in your arias folder you will be having
values inside values will be having
colors XML in which you can mention
different types of colors here so you
can mention a color name so let's say
this is my color name and that's my hash
code for that color or not hash code
that's a hexadecimal code for the color
right if we want to use this color here
which represents our blues the type of I
don't know I'm not that good with colors
so we have some color here so you can
mention any color you can define your
own variable here so let's say if I
mentioned one more color and we'll name
that color as let us say a button color
so I want to use this for all the
buttons will say BTN and we can mention
the hash code and let's say I want that
color to be red so I will use FF 0 0 0 0
0 so that's is it extra 0 that yeah so
we got a red color right so we can this
is how we can create new colors so I am
I want to use this BG color here that is
BG which as is CC yarn color I don't
know here how to mention that we can use
at rich color
okay and inside color you can mention it
is as BG
see how the mentioned BG there let's go
back to design you can see we have
changed the background color here now
what next we require a image now so
let's take a in äj-- we can just drag
it there so take the image view and can
drop it here you can see we can not it's
not that visible right so first we have
to include that in certain inside a
linear layout it's already there okay
now we had to change something so first
we have to mention the height because we
want to see something right so we can
mention any height we can say 72 DPI
think that will be visible and if I go
to that you can see the height is
increased now and the width is depend
upon the image size now where to put the
image so when you go back to your
project folder so you have this project
folder here so whenever you create a
project you get this all this different
files and if I go to app if I inside
that is a s SRC folder inside SRC we
have main inside main we have re here so
you can see whole hierarchy here inside
app we have our ears inside audience we
have we have drawables now this drawable
is useful for your images so as we have
seen in the theory video so we have a
drawable you can have all the images now
the thing is you have to take one image
so I have already have an image here
which is the disco dot PNG in which I
have this image weird-looking image
that'sthat's the logo of our website
okay so I want that image to be I want
to show that image on my what you say
the design now how to do that so you
have to include this image on in
different folders so we have this HD P I
folder then we have MDI folder so what
is this so every so like every mobile
phone we have different different screen
size right there will be having a
difference in resolution so depend upon
your phones you have to set the image
size right so if you talk about this
mdpi this is 32 pic statistics pixels 36
PX then we have this is H dpi which is
approximately I guess 72 then we have X
dpi which is 96 so depend upon your
screen size you have to mention the
is there so I don't want to do all those
all those things what I have done is I
have taken one image I have insert that
image in all different folders okay the
same image with the same size okay I
guess if you have also change it let me
check this resolution if I go to the
resolution no it's not just mentioned
the high resolution here okay so we have
different different size of images and
differen different folders right so let
me go back to my Android so if you
expand this drawable so we have all this
files here which is telesco dot PNG and
then we have mentioned this size here
right I'd want the first image to be
here okay all we get will automatically
take that image this image here right so
what we can do is we can go to text and
how to fetch that image now so just let
me just open the preview so that it will
show you the preview there now how to
get that image is you have to mention
SRC so we'll take we'll go to the image
view and we'll type SRC and then here
you have to mention that we are getting
that image from drawable folders I have
to mention at drawable and then you have
to mention the name of your pic which is
here telescope right and you can see we
got the image there awesome right so
it's that simple so once we have
mentioned the image the next thing we
require is the edit text for name so let
me go back to my preview so what we want
we wanted it text right for this so what
we'll do is we'll go back to the design
again we can type those things here so
we'll go to design and from this will
pick edit text which is text field plain
text and we'll drop it here okay now
once you've got that field go back to
edit text and now we have to mention
something you the first thing is we'll
have to mention the name of that text
edit so we can mention name here itself
so we can double click it and we can
mention the name and
say this is let us say input name
so now we have mentioned ID here and
let's say enter let's go back to the
text so we got without tor di D H oh we
got the ID here now once we have got the
ID now let's specify the type of the
input so that is a that is text what
next now let's also set the color for
this so we can also set the text color
we can mention it as text color so that
is the property we have to use again we
can mention the hash code here itself or
you can mention the code from color so
we can take add color and you can
mention I want white so I hope you
remember it we had white there we had Y
yeah we have white here this that's here
right now once you got that if I enter
some text here it will be white now we
also need to provide the way to provide
something here right what is why we are
using that text field
maybe flow for the name may befall a age
so have to specify that we have to
specify a label there so what we can
specify is we can specify something else
hint
so hint will actor at like act as a
placeholder for the field that and when
you can mention this is this is for name
you can see we got name there now once
we have done with the image and the text
field or the edit text the next thing we
have we require here is gender now if
you observe this gender here is not just
one component of a linear layout inside
this also we have a layout right because
we have we have broken it two into two
parts so that's a linear layout in which
you have horizontal layout so we have
gender and then male female on the other
side so the gender is the first part
male team in the second part and inside
the second part we have a linear
vertical layout that's very complex way
let's do it here so what I want I want a
linear layout so I will take a linear
layout so that's linear layout okay and
I will say this is oh that's that's
weird okay I will always mentioned that
is that content for the width and the
same thing for Heights
say web content let's take it here so we
got a linear layout and we have to
specify the orientation first and how to
specify orientation we can say
orientation again have messed with it so
that's orientation and then we can
specify the orientation as horizontal
because we want gender and male/female
on the same lines of invention
horizontal there and we can specify the
margin so that we at least it will be it
will get it will keep some space between
other components so we'll specify the
margin so we'll say margin top as 8 DP
and we can specify a margin bottom so
that's margin bottom as 8 DP again you
what size you should take depend upon
your experience depend upon your
requirement so that's 8 DP for me now
once we got this layout what we need in
this layout we required two components
one will be gender and the second will
be again a linear layout so let's start
with gender first for a gender we
require a textview so instead of
dragging it with rick and i will type it
here so we take a textview okay inside
for the textview we have to specify the
width how can we can be just permanently
yeah god so where to specify the we have
to specify the width here we'll say this
is wrap content and the same thing we
have to specify the height which is wrap
content so that's the text view and we
also said we haven't also set the text
and we have to say this is gender and
you can see we got gender there but hold
on something is not good now we'll set
the text size so that it should be
visible so it's a text size and how much
text size maybe 20 or let's make it 18
now it's visible so that's good right so
we got gender there now once we got the
text view the next thing we require the
light on the right side so let's go back
to the preview so we what we want we
want a male female white and that is
inner linear that is a linear layout and
in a vertical format so again
this linear layout we have a nested
linear layout okay and then again we'll
say in next ed next nested linear layout
will mention oh we don't require that
hold on content here that's rough
content and again wrap content here and
what next now we have to mention the
orientation so we'll say this is
orientation now and so again the same
thing it's orientation and we can
specify the orientation as vertical and
there's in this layout what required now
we require two radio buttons right and
what is the what's the advantage of it
using radio buttons we can select any
one but unfortunately the property of
radio button is if you take two radio
buttons on the on the screen you can
select both by default it's because
let's say you have just imagine you have
fully two buttons on the screen two is
for male/female that's gender and two is
for your what may be your favorite sport
maybe maybe cricket or football so if
you have this two options so if you
select male you should be also able to
select your your sport right if your
cell if you're selecting maybe female
and if you are trying to select cricket
so it will automate the female will be
ultimately directed right we want to
selection on the screen and that's why
we have to create a group of radio
buttons so the first male female will be
one group and second the sport will be
the second group so before getting radio
buttons we have to also create a radio
button group again you can do this all
with the help of design so you can see
we have a container kbase container here
yeah so in containers we have radio
group so we can drag it here and inside
this video group you can put two radio
buttons let's do it using text so we say
this is radio group and we have to set
two things I can wrap content again wrap
content so we got that okay now what
next we need we also require an ID here
so we mentioned ID and we'll specify
plus ID and we can write this is my R a
radio
Group sounds quit right radio group now
once we have mentioned the radio group
here now next thing is required two
radio buttons right so let's create
those two radio buttons will say radio
button
so that's video button here we have to
said rap continent again the same thing
rap content okay now what else we have
to also mention the label or the ID
let's mention the ID first we'll say ID
equal to ID and we'll mention this as F
for female and we'll set the text now
and the text should see show as female
right okay that's not properly visible
we have to also set the text so what
we'll do is we'll say text size how much
maybe 15 DP equal do I guess that's
visible right 15 DP will do now and by
default it should not be selected so
we'll can we can keep it as false or we
can say we can set one more property as
false so that it will not be checked so
that's one radio button we also want a
second one so we can just take this one
copy and paste now that's not a
copy-paste right that's code reuse we
will say this is this IDs M and the text
it should show is male and the same
thing right so we got male and female
right so let's compare with the design
we have almost same okay so that's done
with the gender the next is email and a
password so what I will do I will just
pause the video I will type those code
for you and then I will show you instead
of wasting your time so let me just
pause the video once we have added all
the components here so we have edited
text for email and edit text for
password and a button right now things
to consider so we have not taken a
normal text field I have taken a email
address text field the advantage of this
is let's say you when you are entering a
normal data into text field it will give
you suggestions right on the keyboard
but if you enter in email text field or
email address free
it will show you the email address in
your keyboard does advantage the next
thing is password if you want to see
that circular symbols when you type your
passwords if no one if you do not want
to show others your password you can use
text you password here that's a type and
then we have created a button and inside
a button we have mentioned the margin
from the top so that we can get some
space here and that's it that's that's
quite simple right
so that's how you can create a redesign
which is which looks like this in the
next video we will make it work and
we'll once you click once you click on
this once you enter this detail once you
click on this button create account it
should show some data on the come on the
console so that's what you want from the
next video so yeah that's it that's it
from this video we'll see in the next
video thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
