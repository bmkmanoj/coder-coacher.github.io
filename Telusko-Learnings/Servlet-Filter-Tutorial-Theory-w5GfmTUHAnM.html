from toys for learnings and in this
video we'll talk about filters in
Southlake now this is the most ignore
the topic in cellular technology so we
we learn about we talk about several
requests we talk about response we talk
about the life cycle now this is one of
the important stuff which we use in
sublet I mean it's not important to
write this in your server application
but you can use it now why we need
filters so let's say we have a client
here and then we have a server in fact I
should you know for all my videos I
should have this static things because
in all my subject is I'm going for a
client and a server right that's how it
works so let's say we have another we
have a client and a server and all this
server we have students tablets let's
say we have a servlet we have a servlet
and we have a servlet now what you want
is when it was up lined since the
request of course when you sent a
request request goes to web.xml file and
then that's how you figure it out which
serve it took all right so let's say
from this line you are requesting for
this particular servlet and after some
time you are requesting for this
particular object and after some time
requesting this we can solve it so we
have subject a B and C now whenever you
request for any of the sublet let's say
if you want to maintain some log files
you want to maintain the security now
for a and B you want to maintain the log
file and for B and C you want to
maintain the transaction and for a B and
C you want to maintain the security so
with this feature of a a B and C you
want some extra features like mentoring
the log files or then maintaining the
transaction and measuring the security
so what you can do is you can write to
school so if let's say if you want to
maintain the log file you have to change
your a solve later on you have to add
the log code there why do you have to
use log4j and you have to add the lines
in a servlet the same thing I do in
beasts of it as well because here also
we want to maintain a log file now let's
say you want to use transaction so you
want to do transition management those
things also you have to write in B and C
and then you have to write certain codes
for security if you are allowed to solid
safe up line
solid you have to verify if that soffit
that client is allowed to use that solve
it so for that you have to check
something right again that check will be
done in a B and C right so the point is
instead of writing those thing inside
your ABC then you just take it out now
since a and B has a common feature of
log B and C has a common feature of a
transaction and a B and C has a common
feature of security can you just take
this modules out and the advantage would
be if you can take those common things
common thing outside and those common
things will will make in such a way that
you can plug it anywhere when I say it
can be plugged anywhere let's say in
future if you have D and if you want to
have if you want to achieve transaction
here you just have to plug that request
and your selvage will not even know that
you are doing in the back end so what we
can do is we can add filters in between
so let's say we have the first filter
here this is your first filter which is
filter f1 we got a second filter which
is f2 and then we'll be getting a third
filter which is f3 now you might have
guessed it the first filter here is for
log so we can write a filters which will
so this filter f1 will work for log
files
this filter f2 will work for transaction
and this filter the f3 which will work
for security right
so using solid filters we can we can
create some filters which will be
intercepting your request so anyone who
send a request if you are sending a
request for a it will go through f1
first
so if f1 says okay I got I have
maintained the log then it will go to f3
it will check for the security and then
only your a will be called in fact if
you are let's say if you are sending a
request and f1 says everything is good I
have maintained the log f3 says no this
guy is not allowed to use solid a f3 can
return the request right then a will not
be will not be call right so you are
secured now let's say for the second
request because any requests it will
first go
all log maintenance then it will go for
transaction then it will go for security
right and any of this filter can return
the response I mean they can send a
response back so they will act like a
sublet but those are not actually sublet
those are filters right so if you want
to have something if you have certain
southern things which are common like
dog maintenance transactions equality or
we have some other thing as well you can
write those things inside filters so the
advantage of using filters they are
pluggable you can so if you have a new
sub region if you have a new sublet you
can add a free time between in fact
let's say in future in future if you
have one more one more filter let's say
that is f4 which is let's say for any of
the XYZ purpose what you can do is you
can add F food here because those are
pluggable right your serve it will not
even know that you're using filters and
is that awesome in fact this filters
they don't know which freaking you're
working with example if you are working
with f1 f3 don't even know that
equations coming from f1 that's awesome
right in fact your f2 don't even know
that after f1 you are getting these
fonts so this filters are also
individuals and they don't know how I
mean how it is working I mean how other
filter works right but then your Tomcat
says if you have multiple filters and if
you want to if you want to check for if
you have to go for multiple filters what
we do is we have to chain them so this
called as filter chaining ok so you have
to filter chain I mean which we have to
change all these filters again f1 will
not know that it is any request to f3 it
will be done by Tomcat but then where
you have to configure this so when you
write a filter f1 you have to mention
once this check is done once this is
done do go for filter change so whatever
you have in the next thing it will
execute that one but then question arise
where to configure all this thing where
to mention for which request we want to
call which which filter that you have to
configure in your favorite file will
spoiled as web dot
similar file so web dot XML file will
handle so you have to configure in this
file
which filter you want to go for make
sense right a button question arise how
can you create a filter so to create a
filter we have to create a class which
will extends so it filter okay and then
you have to use three methods none if
you go if you remember your sublet
sublet sessions we have talked about
init method we have destroy method we
have do get a do post in the same way
for filters we have a method like in it
we have a method like do filter okay
that's to filter and then we have
destroy okay so we have these three
methods now anytime destroy something
which we normally don't use right we
never use that thing and if you want to
do something yourself on vacation you
can do that but let's say we don't use
that in this you have to pass two
parameters request and response and
that's how you can check right example
if someone is sending a request to a
servlet how would you know if these
allowed or not so that data will be the
inside request object but then let's say
after executing this filter f-for if
something goes wrong we shall have full
can return this response right he can
send all these forms with the help of
response object right so that means your
filter can I mean they can work as a
servlet but then that's not the main
purpose of criticals so filters are
basically to intercept your requests
right so that's it that's about the
theory of filters we have talked we we
have a concept of soffit filters in in
servlets and it we can also do filter
chaining you given also configure
individual filters if you want the
configured filters we can use something
called as filter config so it is also
available the way we have serve it
conflict the same way we have filter
contouring for every particular servlet
we have subject conflict for every
particular filter we have a filter
conflict right so it's that's it's
dancing but I can will see the packet
intervention of
this in the coming session so that's it
that's for this video thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
