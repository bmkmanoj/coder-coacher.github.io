from telesco learnings and as for the
requests I am making a socket
programming tutorial so once we have
seen the theory of sockets now let's
focus on the practical implementation of
that so for that what we'll do is we'll
create a new class here one for client
and one for server and we'll name this
class as socket client which belongs to
a packet which is comm dot let's say s
OC so this is your client and will
require a main method here so we'll say
finish now we got this main here right
now in this client side what we'll have
is we will require a a socket which will
send a request to the server right every
client needs one socket and on the
server side you will be having multiple
sockets right because a server will
interact with multiple clients and for
each client we require one socket but as
a client you have only one socket so
we'll require a socket so the socket or
so it is a class in Java which belongs
to a package java.net so when you press
control space here you will get this
package there and we say socket s equal
to new socket now whenever you mention a
socket you have to mention two things
there the first thing is the IP address
of the server and the second thing is
the port number because in your server
you will be having multiple process and
you have to target to a particular
process right and to how to identify a
unique process in the on the server side
is using a port number so the first
thing is the IP address and the second
will be the port number so let me create
two variables here we'll say this is as
IP which will be in a string format and
then next will be the port number which
will have been a integer format so we'll
say this is port now what port number we
can assign here so we can assign
multiple port numbers let's say the port
number ranges from 0 to 6 5 5 3 5 so
this is the complete range out of which
0 to 1 0 0 to 100 it's 1 0 to 3 these
are reserved port numbers so we can use
any port number above 1 0 2 4 2 6 5 5 3
5 but the catch is in your machine
you'll be having already you'll be
having some process or softwares which
are using those port numbers example if
you in your machine if you are using
Tomcat
so H 0 H 0 is already booked in your
machine if you are using mask you'll 3 3
0 6 is already booked so there are lots
of port number which are booked right
how will how would you know that which
port number you have to work with so I'm
using a partner which is 9 9 9 I have
got this port number by doing some trial
and errors I've never got data for this
number there lots of port numbers
available so this is one of the port
number available which is not used by
any of the pluses in my machine so time
mate will work the IPA to the server if
you are using two machines one for
server one front client are you need to
mention the server port number here or
summer I PA Idris here since for this
example I am using the same machine I
will mention it as localhost localized
with the iPad of same machine right and
in your socket you have to mention IP
and you have to mention the port sounds
good but the problem is there might be a
chance that this port number is already
booked you don't know maybe some other
processes using this so it will throw
the exception you need to handle this
exception using throws exception you are
sending the error on the topmost
hierarchy which is JVM you are using
throws exception there now once you got
the socket so once you want once you
write it by write this line and when
when secure this the request will go to
the server side and then you are
connected now once you are connected you
will ask use or your server to do
something for you now what will do is
will write a string here and the string
I am using is Navi and ready so what I
want when you send this request you want
the response as first three letters you
don't want all the data I just want
first three letters so that's what you
want your server to do again you can
write any code you want you can add two
numbers you can create login form you
can create maybe a banking application
using socket programming that's up to
you that's your logic but time when you
are focusing on the steps you need to
follow to connect to the server so you
can take anything here so we have a
string which is now in trendy and you
want to send this data to the server
side
now in order to send this data on the
server side you need to first create
object of output stream writer which
will convert your data into a stream
format we'll name this object as OS
we'll say new output stream writer so it
is output stream writer and in this
output stream writer you have to mention
from where you have you want to send
this data maybe a socket maybe a monitor
maybe a printer so you want to make you
have to mention from where you want to
send this data we have to mention that I
want to send this data to the socket so
you can say as dot get output stream
which is the output port of the socket
because socket will have two things the
input port and output port you can you
send data to the server you need to send
this data to the output port of the
socket now so using this we are we have
we are converting your data into a
stream format and then you are
mentioning where to send this data but
to actually send this data we need to
create object of printwriter which is
responsible to send your data we'll say
this is out printwriter out equal to new
printwriter so we have a printwriter
here in which you have to mention the
output stream object which is OS so you
can pass this object OS here so whenever
you print something you with out it will
send a data to OS and then OS will send
that data to the socket output stream
and then using this OS we can say with
OS we can say what's the method we have
to use we can use right so we can use
write or we can use we can use what we
can use here we can use right there so
we can use right and we can send this
data which is tr now this data which is
STR will be sent to the server and then
sauer will process it but that's your
client right we are sending data through
server now what to do on the server side
on the server side we need to create a
class which will which will be I will
say so C server and this also required a
main method so we'll say public static
void main
I mean main and which I have to define a
string array
okay I mean you can define that in
whatever you want so we got a server on
the server side we require two sockets
one a bigger socket which will accept
all the requests the second socket will
be for one client so if you have one
client you will be having one socket if
you have multiple clients you will be
having multiple sockets so what we need
we need requires our socket s s equal to
new server socket in this server socket
you have to mention the port number
which you will be working on so from
client side we are sending a request to
the server which is to the port number
nine nine nine nine and we had to
mention the same port number here okay
and then there are chances that this
port number will be busy so you have to
handle the exception and we are saying
throws exception now for every request
of the sock of this client we need to
create one socket object we'll name the
socket as s now when to create this
object whenever a client sends the
request then only we have to create a
socket object right then how would you
know that client is sending the request
if your server socket is accepting any
requests it will create a socket object
okay so we got to class here one is your
client and second is server the client
sends our request as soon as you get an
equation on this our side it will create
a new socket for you now from this
socket we need to fetch the data what
we'll do is before this I will simply
print a statement just to notify that
server is started okay then we'll print
server is waiting for client request and
once you accept the request will print
client connected okay just to
demonstrate how it works so we have this
three statements here okay so let me
just provide this space there now once
you got the request from the client side
what we'll do is we'll fetch the data
now how to fetch our data there
so we can use buffer data to fetch data
so we'll say bufferedreader BR equal to
new I'm assuming that you know what is
buffer data input stream and all those
things okay if you don't know this data
or this classes go back to my tutorials
they will you will find a buffer heater
video there and was that video first and
then come back to this video just to
understand it properly so we have to use
a buffered reader in which you have to
pass object of input stream reader so
you can see on the client side when you
send data we are using output stream
writer when you read data we need to
mention input stream reader in which you
have to mention this sockets input
stream you have to mention from where
you are getting the input okay way to
import the package also so we'll say
control space we got the package now
using this buffer data we can say be our
dot readline which will read the data
from the client or from this client side
we'll save it enough string which is
string STR so we are saying string STR
equal to BR dot readline and then let's
uh okay let's apply some operation here
or let's print it here on this our side
just to make sure that something is
working
we'll say client data we'll give a colon
and we'll print STR so this is this is
what we are doing for a one-way
communication so we are sending data
from the client side to the server side
okay if this works then we'll move
towards the both way communication so
once again why we require buffer data
here is because in order to read data
from the socket
we need to use bufferedreader in buffalo
you have to pass object of
inputstreamreader and inside input
simpler you have to pass this socket
input stream okay and then using BR dot
readline we can get it data so we need
to first run this server so we'll run
the server here and we'll say java
application okay so it says so i started
so a is waiting for the client request
let me run Cline now if I say okay so
yeah so it says client connected and you
got your data from the client side which
is client Delta equal to null
why not we are sending the name right
the thing is whenever you send details
so your your network has a buffer size
and the buffer size is approximately
five and two bytes and now vendredi will
not cover all those bytes right so we
need to forcefully send it data this is
our so we'll say flush let's see if that
works now let's run this code so it's
waiting for the client request run you
can see we are getting the data from the
client side which is not ready so that's
that's how you do one-way communication
but we do not want one-way communication
we want to a communication we want the
data which should go from the server
side to the client side so how to do
that that we'll see in the next video so
make sure you like the video if you
liked it and do subscribe for further
