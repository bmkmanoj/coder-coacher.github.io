political earnings and in this video
we'll talk about object copying okay
basically this video is all about
cloning but we'll start with the copying
concept okay so if you remember if you
are coming from C++ background so now
you're doing Java right but you're
coming from C++ right so in C++ we have
this concept of papi constructor you can
actually create an object using the
existing object as though the concert in
C++ but if you ignore that part in Java
can you copy an object is it possible
let's say you have this object here so
let's say you have a class which which
has two variables int I and in J okay
you can have multiple variables let's
talk about only two so we have this
class a in which you have two variables
in I and J okay and then if you want to
create the object of this class you have
to say a obj equal to new a right and
then later you can set the value so
let's say for this up for this
particular object I am setting the value
of I and J and as five and six so the
value of I is five the value of J is six
now you want to use two you want to have
one more object which will have the same
value of this existing object because if
you don't copy it the the values for the
new object will be zero zero right so
let's say if I creating our new object
is obj one so the a obj one equals a new
a in this scenario the values for obj
one will be 0 and 0 right because we
have not initialized it we want the
values of the oil object so what we can
do is so so this concept of having the
values from the oil table scholars
copyright so if you copy it you will you
will get the existing values so this
this copy can be of three types the
first type of copy is shallow copy the
second one is deep copy and then we have
cloning so what exactly the shallow copy
means so let's say if you want to copy
if you want to copy this object one way
is don't create a new object simply say
a obj equal to the old object is obj so
we have the first line as a obj equal to
new a the second line is a obj one equal
to obj now what we have is obj one will
have the same values obj but hold on
that's not the case right it's because
you are not creating two object you have
only one object and two reference so if
you can imagine it looks something
something in this way in your heap
memory you will be having only one
object and inside your stack
be having to reference and both these
reference are pointing to the same
object so now if you change the value of
obj one it will reflect to the values of
obj because both are referring to the
same object so we are not actually
getting two different objects we are
creating only one object and to
reference right that is abstracted that
is shallow copy the next one is deep
copy now what it means in deep copy you
will create a new object so in total you
will be having two objects and manually
you will copy one one value something in
this way you have two objects are in
fact Delta this way right you have two
objects one is a obj equal to new new a
and second one is a obj 1 equal to Nu a
so we have two objects what you're doing
for obj we have we have set the values
white which is I is as 5 and J's as 6
indeed in the next for the next object
you can simply say obj 1 dot I will be
coming from obj dot I so that's your
manually copying each and every value so
it is that is deep copy again you have
to spend lots of time right you have to
create a object you have to pop each and
every value so there is no issue for two
values let's say you have 1520 values
where you copy one one value it's not a
good good thing right so that's that is
deep copy it works but what is that not
that's not equal to B the third way is
using the concept of cloning now what
cloning means is in in this class which
is object you know we have object class
it provides your feature of cloning so
let's say if you want a clone an object
simply say obj dot clone as soon as you
say ogle clone you don't have to create
a new object okay it will create it will
create a new object for you right and it
will have the same value so it is a
combination of two it's a combination of
shallow copy and deep copy and you will
be getting the cloned object okay so
basically when you copy you have three
ways shallow copy deep copy and cloning
now how exactly to do all this stuff in
practical you can find in the playlist
so after this video make sure you watch
the whole playlist it has around three
to four videos which will explain you
how to how to use shallow how to use
deep and how to use cloning concept
but something related to cloning when
you clone by default you are not allowed
to copy object okay you are not allowed
to clone an object for that you have to
give permission and that permission is
possible with help of a cloneable
interface I can how to use that you can
watch in the practical session so that's
it from this video thanks for watching
and make sure you subscribe the channel
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
