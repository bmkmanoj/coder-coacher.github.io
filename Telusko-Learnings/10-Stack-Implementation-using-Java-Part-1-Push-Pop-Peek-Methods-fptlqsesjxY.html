ready and in this video we'll talk about
the stack implementation using Java now
when you say a stack basically stack is
a class inside Java so if I simply say
control space it belongs to a packaged
Java dot util so you can use all the
features of a stack here but then why to
use are into the class when you can
create your own so I don't want to use
the stack class which is in build I want
to get my own class so what I will do I
will right click here on the package I
would say new and I want to create my
own class and that class name is called
a stack so I have my own class here and
here I will create object of stack I
would say stack nums equal to new stack
now in this stack object or the Nam's
object I want to perform certain
operations so when I say num start push
I want to push the element I can specify
any value here if I say 15 so the first
element should be 15 and then I can I
can push multiple elements and then I
maybe I want to pop element which is
taking out Dielman from the stack or
maybe I want to fetch element so when I
say stack basically it has certain
features right as we discussed in theory
session we can use push or we can use
pop on we can use pip so we will be
using will be working on these methods
so let's start with the first one which
is push so in if you can see in our
stack we don't have any method here so
let's create certain methods so the
first method is push now to implement
push what I will do is I will say public
wide push now since we are adding the
value we are not expecting any value so
let's say push data so we have to send a
data and it will add data there so now
you can see if I go back now you can
push the element and there is no error
but then what you will do with the push
to make it work first of all we need to
create and add it right so we have to
create an array and we have to also
specify the size of the array so let's
say if I say we have an added here and
initially we'll take an array of 5
elements so that if you can work on 5
elements you can work with a number of
elements so let's say if I have the
first one then the second one then third
one and fourth and fifth so we have this
5 with elements here index number may be
0 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
now if you want to add the first element
as we are doing it here we are passing
15 right so that 15 will go to the go to
element 0 so it's somewhere here
we'll be having that value which is 15
but then we don't have added yet so even
before you push the element you need to
create that array so let's do that I
would say int and you will say stack
equal to or stack it's an array
basically so we'll say stack equal to
nil
int and the size of int is 5 you can
make it dynamic you can you can take the
input from the user
what array size you want but time and
let's specify a by by ourselves so we
are we have created the adding and now
we can push the element but kosher
eisewhere
so we'll say okay you have when you say
push you will assign the value to the
address location 0 okay so that makes
sense we can simply say 0 over here
right so we can say stack of 0 and you
can assign the value whatever code data
is coming it's so easy you can that
value which is 15 will be assigned to
the index value 0 it is that simple but
here's a twist the twist is what if I if
I want to add one more element so if I
say in nums so if I push another element
here will say let's I want to pass maybe
8 now we are passing two elements right
we got we got 15 and we got 8 now what
will happen is the moment you pass 8
here the 8 will be the value 8 will be
assigned to 0 again with the zeroth
location that's not what we want because
if you if you don't this code the value
of 15 will will be replaced by 8 we
don't want that I want to assign value
to 1 that means we need to count it we
have to use we to use a variable which
will count the number and maybe I will
use a variable here which is called a
stop and the initial value of table
would be let say 0 we can simply specify
top here right in stuff using 0 we can
say top ok now when the first element
getting inserted so when you insert 15
that 15 will be inserted here at this at
the top location 0 right so we got 15
here now if I send 808 is also the value
of table is still 0 that means after
doing this thing we have just you have
to simply say plus plus so every time
you push an element you just need to
increment the value of top so that when
you pass 8 now 8 will be assigned to
index value 1 because when you pass 8
the value of top at that point is 8
so yeah so that is how you push the
element in the in the stack okay now
next point would be how will you fetch
the element maybe I want to pop the
element or even before let's push all
the element and let's say I want to
print it I want to print this tag so
after pushing two or three values let me
just pushed one more we have a stack of
size five in that let's say we have only
three values let's say this is fifteen
eight and ten I want to print the entire
stack so I will say num start show so it
should show the entire stack but the
problem is we don't have show method in
these tags so let's go there and say hey
I want a show method here which will
print the entire stack now personalize
how do you print the entire stack it's
very simple actually you can take a loop
and ask for loop here and you can say
int n colon tack that's an array and you
can print each value and you can print
that value with a space so I will say N
and then I will print a space so that
you know when you print all the value
they should be separated with us with a
space sounds cool let's go back and what
do you think will it work let's try so I
will right-click here and we'll say run
as java application and it worked here
you see that we got fifteen eight and
ten and regard zero zero so yes it is
working so stack is working when you say
push but how about pop I want to remove
the elements now is it simple let's try
so when I say pop I will simply say
public now pop will also fetch the value
so it will it will remove the value from
the stack and it will also fetch the
value so I would say int pop and this
will not take any parameter now how will
you fetch the value now temporary we can
say int data is equal to okay first of
all let's declare that how do you fetch
a data it's simple right we can say data
equal to the data is coming from stack
now the stuff property of stack is if
you have three elements as we define
here we have three elements right we
have 15 8 and 10 now anyone use pop what
do you think which element you will be
adding and by default the value of 4 and
3 is 0 because that's how a day works in
Java the point here is when I say pop
which value will get so it is done with
the help of top so we have a top
variable here and whatever value we have
for top you will fetching that value
because you will always get last in
first out so the last element which I
have added is 10
so the top ref referring to 10 now
dislocation so it will give you 10 and
the way you do that is by simply saying
he will say stack and he will say top
now you will get that data quite simple
right
okay now they have we had to do one more
thing now once you say you are removing
this 10 we were making it 0 so I will
remove I will make this element as 0 and
how do we do that it's very simple let's
go back here and say stag off top is
equal to 0 so we are making 0 so that
again you can make it 0 you can make it
negative value for whatever you want and
then at the end we can say returned data
I hope you work now so let's run this
code and you can see we got oh we have
not we are not saying pop so we'll say
nums
dot pop now it will delete the last data
run and you can oh not working what's
wrong what went wrong here okay so we
are saying top top oh ok so we have to
do one more thing see as you can see
here when I say push the top value so
when I say push first time at the top
when you become one second time table
value becomes 2/3 time table on you
becomes 3 that means it is referring to
this value wait to do - - we have to
decrement the top before using it so we
say top - - is it
let's try so I will oh I'm not the one
printing pop value so whatever pop I am
getting I should be printing it right so
I would say system dot out dot println I
hope this will work but on this code oh
it worked now it worked you can see that
we are removing the value for stand from
the stack and you got 0 here cool right
so that's how you use push and pop now
what else we can do we can also
implement peek here and how do we do
that so peek is very simple peek is
almost same as pop the only thing is in
peak you don't delete the element so
I'll paste it here and I will say this
is peek ok you will not do - - because
if you do - - it will it will decrement
the value but value of fetching
you will be fetching the - one of it so
it's a minus 1 and you will not delete
the element that's what you will be
doing that's it
let's peek for you after adding the
after adding value 8 I will peek I would
say nums dot peek if I run this code now
you can see we got 8 so the last value
which I've inserted is
and then I'm pushing 10 then I'm popping
10 and you can see that's when the in
the stack we don't have 10 simple this
is how you use push peek and pop what
else we can do here now we can implement
certain other methods as well example
you can get our size of the stack you
can get you can you can make this
dynamic instead of saying 5 whatever
size defined by the user or very dynamic
which is every time you add the element
even if the initial size is 5 you can
you can change it so you can could
increase the size on the go now how do
you do that that we'll see in the
upcoming videos I hope you enjoyed this
session on stack how do we implement
stack and it's quite simple right so let
me know in the comments section of your
thoughts and do click on like button if
you liked it thanks for watching
