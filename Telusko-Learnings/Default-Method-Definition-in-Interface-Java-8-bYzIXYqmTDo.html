of Java 8 so the first feature is you
can define the methods interface right
so let's say we have an interface here
which is interface maybe a phone phone
interface and in this phone interface we
can only have abstract methods right so
let's say we have a method called as
let's say call with this call method or
this call which I will not have any
definition it will only have the
declaration which is void call right and
then let so yeah so did so we have a
method which is call way declared now in
order to create the object of this phone
interface we need to create a class and
that class will that that class will
have let's say with the the class name
is Android phone now this Android phone
need to implement our interface called
as phone and in this Android phone way
to define a method which is called as
call right so you have to say public
void call now it's it's compulsory right
in case if you if you comment this part
if you just come in this section and if
I save this you can see there is an
error here it says Android phone must
implement the inherited abstract method
phone call so we need to define this
method that's compulsory right because
whenever you implement an interface you
should define it and we are defining it
and then we can simply say here obvious
we can say calling okay that's the thing
we are saying here and now let's create
an instance of phone so we can say phone
P equal to new Android or Android phone
okay and we can say P dot call right
that's how it works so that's how we can
create instance of interface but let's
see in future if you want to update your
interface because because may be
operating an API and in your API you
have lots of interfaces and then you are
giving this API for
to other users and they will be or other
developers and they will be using your
API
they will define the class or they will
implement the interface which you have
declared in this case your you have
created an interface which is phone and
Android phone implements your interface
which is phone and they are calling they
are defining a method which is declared
in your interface in future if you want
a phone that should have a feature of
message okay
now that means this Android phone it
also needs to define that medicalize
message but once you publish the
interface it should not be changed or
you should not be you should not change
the interface once it is published but I
want a method map I want a method
message there so what we can do is we
can say void message but instead of
declaring it we can define it we can
give them a open and close curly
brackets now this is not possible in jar
1.7 okay and in the version on which I
am using here it's also 1.8 so why it's
not working it's because by default all
the methods in interface are public
abstract now to break that default thing
we have to use a keyword here called as
default so you can define methods in
interface using default keyword and let
me let me print here or something called
as sent again we can simply say P dot
message okay and if you run this code
let's run this you can see we record the
output calling and send so that's how we
can define method in interface now you
will ask what's the use of this because
we why anyone would like to define
method interface again just for the
conceptions remember this we can define
methods in the father or you know in the
C's of industries of tutorial we'll talk
about why we actually needed that
default method in interface okay trust
me in the maybe in when we start with
the connection part
the stream API part we'll discuss that
but time in focus only on interface an
interface we can define method using
default keyword so thank you so much for
watching and make sure you subscribe the
channel so that you will watch the
further videos so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
