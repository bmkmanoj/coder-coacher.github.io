hello everyone am i audible - now it
should be okay so I'm trading my screen
now and I was on mute at my mistake so
so yes 36 people are watching and only
17 likes if you're excited about this
cause if you're excited about the light
coating do click on the like button
there okay so let's talk about some
contributions and we got to contribution
here
okay so we got contribution from two
people one of them is Karthik
Rajendra and a second name is darshan
and we got the Java contribution so we
are using a code of Shilpa so we are
very thankful this to this people so
thank you for contributing to the code
to the to the to the project okay so
today we are going to implement we are
going to implement hybrid net here so
we'll be implementing hibernate and in
our project in fact I was so excited
about this I was waiting for the 5:00
p.m. in fact yesterday I was like what I
was about to do this but then there was
some internet issues there was lots of
lags and now I think it is perfect so if
you can just hear me just so I need one
more favor from you people I just need
that like button all the like I just
meant that button click on the like
button and I want you people to share
this video with your friends on Facebook
or whichever platform you use maybe you
can also share this on whatsapp but do
share let everyone know about some
torches like this at least I will be I
will be motivated with this right so
this is how you can help me with I help
me with now so we have to accept yeah I
mean by submitting the project or by
sharing this video or by clicking on the
like button okay so it's time to start
the project some last time what we did
is so let me just go for a quick recap
what we have done till now okay so we
have a first of all have to start
recording from my side I will be
uploading this recording soon on YouTube
okay so it's time to start the recording
so here you go here we go three two and
one okay so what we are doing here so in
the last session what we have done is if
you run this project let me assure on
this project first I will say god okay
so it is running you
the server is started let me just go to
the browser and in this browser I have
to run local 80 82 and if I click on
submit not this if I click on enter
Oh what's the was the port number I
guess I have given the wrong boat number
or letting us run this project once
again right like run as the non server
and finish okay you can see you can see
this is our this is what we have done in
the last session when you call for I
mean when you request for task project
it will okay so you opening in okay so
you can see just showing the home page
but if I say free PI because we are
working on feedback now right and if I
say feedback on HTM you got a page now
this page is is contributed by one of
the member so will in turbulent our name
will say this name is Mahesh and we'll
say aji at rate gmail.com and gmail.com
and then will say you are giving the
feedback for the course and will give a
message which is good and if I give a
four star rating here the moment I click
on submit if we click on OK you can see
I am getting an analytical page by page
page here because we have not get that
page yet but we are sending all the
information here now that information
you can see will be printed on the
console so whatever we have entered in
the main page will be will be printed on
the console now why we are getting that
is because in our code we are we are
mention that whenever I use a cause or
feel arrest iam sorry
whenever I user click on the submit
button the submit button will call add
feedback and add feedback will be
calling will be huh will be having a
method let us add feedback and okay so
if you're new to this do watch the
earlier videos because I cannot talk
about everything here okay so what we
want to do is we are the data which I am
getting in the feedback and that
reprinting that theater I don't want to
do that what I want here is to store
this data in the database that's my
agenda here
our to store whatever data I am getting
here into database now how we can do
that so there are multiple steps you
have to follow the first step is
whenever you want to work with hibernate
you have to add the dependencies for
hibernate and when I say dependency I'm
talking about the jar files I mean you
have to it is very important to follow
these steps okay so I hope you have seen
the earlier videos and based on the
earlier videos we are going for the next
session and configuring the application
is very very important downloading the
jar files and having all those things so
which jar files I need here so I can you
can see we already have a sprinkle files
here right now I want to add one more
drive file which is which is - a jar
file so what I'm going to do is I will
go to my permits will file and in this
dependency I have to add the hibernate
jar file again I already have all the
jar files in my system I can just copies
them but then I wanted to show you how
to add jar file so that it will be
easier for you to work on the project
and again whatever I am doing now it is
actually contributed by Shilpa so I will
just write it here
we should we should mention the names
right so I will say I think this thing
is contributed by Shilpa same Raj
okay so a spelling mistake sorry for
that so this project is this this is
this the module which I'm talking about
now is will be is contributed by Shilpa
so thank you should know for this okay
so what are the jar files we need here
so the first jar file is the hybrid jar
files we want to use hibernate here so
what I will do is now from where do we
get the dependencies now for this you
have to understand maybe now if we don't
know mavin do learn about my event so we
so to add the dependencies we need to
use maven how do we use maven here so
what do we do is we will go to the main
repository now this is the main
repository I want to use a hibernate
project
so we search for hibernate and if I
search for hybrid night you can say I'm
searching for hibernate here and so with
this is the jar files this is the
dependency we have to add so I will
click on this now the jar file I need
here is okay so which version let's go
for five point two point nine this is
the latest version and never go for the
recent version I can go for this table
version you can see this library is used
a lot so let's go for that one so we'll
go for five point two point nine let's
copy this you have to copy the
dependency and you can just go back to
our project and let's paste it now we
got hybrid and dependency the moment I
say save you can see the dependency
section here we got all the library all
the hybrid jar files so these are the
jar files
I got using hibernate okay now what are
those jar files are needed now since we
are using hibernate and string together
I wanna also have to add one more jar
file here which is for spring o RM now
when you would remember this whenever
you combine spring and hibernate we have
to use that jar file we have to use
spring o RM jar file so we'll go for
that as well let's go to Miami
depository and search for spring or M
and this is what we want so we want
spring o RM let's go for spring four
point three point seven that's our
spring version here let's copy this so
let's go back and let's paste it here so
we got the spring or autumn dependency
as well okay so this is this so these
are the two dependencies we have added
okay so people who are asking question
to chat window just to let you know we
will only talk about your project in
this live session no other question
please so let's not get distracted from
this project okay so okay what else we
have so we got this dependency which is
spring ORM now next
pregnancy is the MySQL dependency
because the database which we are
working now is MySQL right so see this
we have added a dependency for spring
and we see this is what we have done in
the last session then we have at a
dependency force for hibernate code and
spring ORM in this session we want some
more dependencies here one of the V
dependency which we need is MySQL so
what I will do is I will go back here
and now with mass for dependency we need
to let's go back to the memory of having
depository and search for mysql
connector
okay searching
okay so if I click on this will go for
the version which is five point two one
point three nine this is the stable
version again I will use this and let's
go back to our dependencies and paste so
we have added being hybrid dependency
the spring one in dependency and we have
added to mask ul connector dependency
now what are the dependency I need okay
so okay so why we need all the
dependency first of all we have added
spring MVC because we are building a
spring MVC project I wanted to implement
hibernate that's why we have added
spring Co so hibernate code I want to
use hibernate and spring together that's
why we are using spring ORM C we can
either use only spring with database
which will be using JDBC all we can use
only hibernate but then it is better to
combine spring and hibernate together to
work right and that's why we require a
spring over them here and Maskull
because the database which I am working
with is a master it appears now we need
two more dependencies you first one
would be for JDBC because we'll be using
je basic JDBC pulling here so I want to
use database connect database connection
pool and whenever you want to use fool
we use we use a dependency which is
wished which is a c3p0 that is a
different our dependencies available for
this one of them is three c3p0
this is JDBC connection pooling
okay so we got a question from Mohammed
fares will be using hibernate
annotations
I mean falling to make to make an entity
will be using JDBC so if we'll be using
JPI but then for for the implementation
will be using hibernate okay so from
this we'll be using the first one
because that is used a lot let's go back
and let's go to pom.xml file and let's
paste it here
okay so we have either lots of
dependencies right I mean that's a
critical thing okay
now if you are wondering just to make a
feedback form we are writing all the
dependencies no actually we are doing
this for the entire project you just
have to do this once okay
so once you have added all the
dependencies you will be using this for
the entire project so this is a one step
okay this is what you say the initial
configuration for the project okay so
they have added this one let's add one
more now see will be so many many work
with database we know the concept of
transactions right so we have the
concept of the whole bag we have a
concept of commit so whenever you use
whenever you do any transaction of the
database you have to make sure that
either you click on I mean
if everything goes good go for commit if
if something goes wrong you have to go
for rollback now again I don't want to
do that I don't either
I don't want to focus on rollback and
commit so what we can do is we can ask
our Spring Framework to do that position
for part for us have to add one more
dependency at first it is the last
dependency we are using now which is
spring px which is spring transaction if
I search for this spring TX this
dependency we have to add and we'll be
adding four point three point seven and
let's go back and done so by doing this
we have added all the dependencies which
we need here I know it is lots of
dependencies but then we don't have a
choice it is required to use JDBC or not
so we got a question from Quran if you
are using hibernate and we need JDBC
know
if you are using hibernate we only have
to focus on hyper tonight we don't need
a babysitter
okay so you can see they have added all
these dependencies here we got spring
MSE because spring cold we got spring on
em we got a mask UL regards very basic
condition pulling and then requires
spring pas so once we have added all the
dependency what next database I mean to
connect with hibernate I don't know how
many of you know hibernate here but I'm
assuming that you know hibernate
if you don't know hibernate that's fine
so we just pause this video and if
you're watching this live you don't have
a choice but then if you are watching
this video and afterwards just pause
this video and you have to go to youtube
and search for that Isco hibernate I do
have videos on hibernate on YouTube so
watch those videos it will clear your
hybrid concepts and you can just
continue with the session then okay so
we got a question from Mohammed fares
what about spring security dependency so
we'll talk about spring security later
timing we are not focusing on spring
dependency or spring security so will we
talk about that later okay so now when
you work with when you work with
dependence I mean when you work with
hibernate you need to add okay so we've
got a question come up where you have
added dependencies c3p0 for that do we
need to add related properties yes when
you work with CP c3p0 you have to add
the properties which is pull full size
you have to mention the minimum idle
time and like Sam sighs you have to
mention all those things we will be
doing that so on okay so you have to so
we we need to use a hibernate here right
and whenever you use hibernate we need
to create object off session factory so
what I will do is I will say private
session factory and I will name this as
session factory okay so I want to create
object of session factories I think put
your package for this and you can see
the package is important on this package
so session factory is interface which is
coming from
Oh RJ dot hibernate package okay
the question arise how do we use the
session Factory
and how do we save the data I mean he
will not believe it is so easy to store
the data
normally in JDBC we have to follow seven
steps I mean I hope you know all you all
know JDBC and if you want to do the same
thing in JDBC if you want to store this
feedback in it in the table you have to
write the seven steps now fortunately we
got hibernate in in hibernate you don't
have to do seven steps I mean you you
have to but not in the code so what we
will do is I would simply create a
little session I will say session
session equal to and I will say session
Factory which is the other fashion
factory which is created about and will
say get current session so whenever you
work with hibernate we all know that we
have to work with the session session
object now once you've got your session
object list cincuenta package for that
it should be Oh our date or hibernate
dot session and here once you got the
session object what we will do is we
will simply say session dot save and I
will say save the feedback and that's it
your job is done a moment you don't this
code we aren't expecting that it will be
storing data in the database
unfortunately fill in this code you will
get an error because we are still have
any bits of quantification now what
confusion talking about let's say it on
this code
how would your hibernate thing see
hibernate is hibernate right however net
is not versioning trying to do
everything by its itself you have to
configure your you have to configure the
hibernate but then where I will
configure the hibernate which plays ok
so what you can do is if you want to
configure hibernate properties this is
the file you have to use so this is the
file where you have to configure your
hibernate ok so if you want to configure
this we have to add extra extra or you
say the namespace here the first name
space you have to mention is ok so what
do I do here is I already have
discord samba sorry Title II assistance
of typing Paz it will take it will waste
lots of time so the first thing we need
here is the x SD which is for
transaction okay so we will need this
one so we got this one so we got P X so
XML xmlns px so it is XML namespace for
transaction is this one and then we have
to also mention the X is the file for
that the existing file is copied that
one as well
so I am copying it and let's paste it
here okay
so we have to add this things if you are
typing by yourself you can diverge okay
so that's great
oh yeah so what we have done till now is
we have simply created this we have
simply added that transaction thing now
what else we need here so we have to
provide lots of quantification right the
first thing you have to provide is the
properties for connection pooling now I
will not type all the properties here I
will simply copy those properties from
the from the thing which I have in my
system I will I will try to upload all
this thing on the key table don't worry
so once the session is complete I will
be uploading this thing on github to
copy I will explain you what are all
this or what all this thing means just
give me a second here okay what went
wrong okay so we got okay so anyway you
want to configure your connection
pooling but it's really busy pulling you
have to mention the you have to mention
the database place so I have my database
inside this system I don't have database
in my system I have another machine just
next to me with IP address 192 dot one
sixty eight dot one dot two and in that
we have a database which is the disco
okay
and we have to mention the java class
name which is comm dot masculine a just
delivery tour driver and you can mention
the username password and I can I'm
revealing my username password here that
is root and root this is the minimum
pool size and this is the maximum full
size or minimum five connection banks
have any connections and idle time would
be very seconds okay so we have
configured our connect data connection
pooling now once we have done with this
next thing we have to configure is
decision factory because see when you
talk about this object know where we are
creating object for this right I'm
directly using the reference and we
cannot use the reference directly right
we need to create the object it is
important and since we are using spring
I will not create the object by myself
of course right when you when spring is
there why you have to create an object
by yourself you can ask splinted give it
to you
and while spring is giving it to you you
can also assign the properties because
whenever you session factory we have to
provide lots of properties right so
which from what I am talking about let
me just copy those properties as well so
it's here let me just copy that okay and
let's paste it here
notice all the properties for we roll
down
okay so yeah so we have to we have to
set all these properties now what is
this property so this is the object of
such an Factory which I have created now
so this is a session factory object now
many we want to create a session back to
your object again we can use a normal
day DPC way but again normal so a normal
hibernate way but then using normal
hibernate way it becomes very compact
you know if you want to change any with
anything you have to change the source
code in spring what you can do is spring
provides you the hibernate features so
using spring ORM you can use local
session factory pane which will give you
the object of session factory okay but
you have to configure you have to
mention something you have to first
mention the data source the data source
which we have created here okay so
whatever data source the whatever
property is the activation here the same
properties will be used for data source
next thing you have to mention is where
do where do we find all our entities now
currently we have only one entity which
is feedback you can see we have feedback
here this is the only entity we have now
okay this is what we have been in our
session right we have critical feedback
via feedback failure so we have to
mention the feed we have to mention all
our entities will be in this file okay
so you want me to increase the font size
but it is all which is better right if
you can see my video in full screen and
if you increase the quality of your
video to 720 I think it is properly
visible okay so yeah so I just verified
this with my other machine and it is I
can see the part properly okay so let's
go back here okay just before continuing
if you are watching if you are just
joining this session we are doing a live
project if you are liking this session
do click on the like button so that I
will know that you are enjoying this
session because that's what motivates me
okay so this is what we have mentioned
here we have okay let me do some
indentation here
okay just call it on okay so as you can
see we have so we have mentioned the
place where you can find all the
packages the next thing which we need
here is the hibernate properties now
anybody work with hibernate you have to
mention some properties one of them is
okay so you're watching this I mobile
phone you want to increase the font size
okay you win I lose
let me just change the font size here
and I will say text hello okay I will
make it 16 not more than that because if
I increase more than that then it will
be problem for me
is better now I guess we can give
multiple about properties I think the
Kama will work here so again I think you
can give kama as well or you can try it
by yourself as well okay so you have to
mention these two properties so anyway
you work with hyper that you have to
mention these two properties the first
one is a tiling now why we have to
mention italic is because different DBMS
has different way of writing SQL queries
right so one of the query is I mean if
you are using mask you have to use MySQL
dialect and then if you want to see the
query which is running you can say true
otherwise it is not composing anywhere
you can even if you don't mention this
property it will be by default pause
okay so that's cool okay so we have done
with this properties so we have
mentioned we have mentioned they okay so
we have mentioned the data source we
have mentioned the property for session
factory we have to set one more property
here which is for transact and of course
right we are doing a transaction here so
how do we set a property here so to set
this a transaction transaction property
let me just copy that okay
okay so that we just paste the
properties for transaction so for
transaction will we will be using
hibernate transaction manager so because
I don't want to manage the transaction I
won't hibernate to minus the transaction
because I don't know how many of you
learn - it by yourself if you wash my
hibernate videos you can see in that I
was managing all the hibernate sessions
by myself okay the transaction but now I
will ask Spring to do it for me okay let
me just do some indentation here just to
make it look good okay now what else
what else I need the final property we
have to mention is for transaction so we
have to mention all the transactions
will be done with the help of
annotations I will not be using cross
section I will not be doing mazuma
myself all using annotation and since we
want to use an occasion here I will be
using this one so is a TN sanitation be
engaged
sanitation free one and I'll mention
transition manager as my cross section
manager notice this my transition
manager it is the ID which you have
mentioned here so you can see everything
is interdependent here so by doing all
these things we have configured our
projects so that we can work with hybrid
it now okay so I'm tired with this only
so we have configured our sublight xml
where we have mentioned the hibernate
properties so all the properties are
mentioned here in case in future if you
are not using masks you all you just
have to change this one you have to
change this one you have to change which
one you have to change the dialect
that's it so that's the advantage of
using spring you know okay now what next
now once we have done with this let's go
back to our feedback cow and in this we
have this method which is feedback Tao
okay so in this what we have to do is I
want to be the object of session factory
now I will not get object of such
effective of myself I will be using
spring here so I will be using either 8
or 2 wired
now if you use I don't auto wire it will
create the object object obsession
factory by itself however we got a
question from hottie Martha says
property name will always be session
factory you are talking about this one
yes this property is always such an
factory because that is the inbuilt
object of hibernate translation manager
which already downloading the source
code but once it is downloaded you can
see this one which is the session
factories that is the name which yeah
which you have to use and this session
Factory is our object which we have
created here in fact look at also we can
have also uses used to iterate sorry
auto wired XML property for that you
could have use that okay so you can see
we call it documentation for this and I
just hope I'm right out what I was
talking about yeah you can see the
invalid object name itself a session
factory so you do not change that we
don't have a choice okay so but that's
good I got 61 likes and one dislike okay
so
spamming the chat window let me just
block that person so macho Kumar you are
blocked okay great
so let's cook let's continue with us now
so okay so that we got we got all we
have set all this properties here now
what next we can do okay so now what I
want is this should work
will this work no because we have four
transaction we have to use an annotation
which is called as a transactional and
we want it to manage the translation by
itself so I will not use this term by
myself I will I will ask you to do the
transaction and I will avoid could
package from this yeah so this is the
thing which you have to use so add
feedback we have to put a great
transactional on top of it so that it
will manage the translation by itself
okay so now it should work right but
then I got a point from someone here who
was mentioning about at the rate at it
is OTP void D people says if you are not
mentioned at the rate entity will it
work no we have to mention that right
but if you don't mention what will
happen it will give you n oh right so
let's mention that so let's mention this
is identity so whenever you use
hibernate and whenever you mention I
mean whenever you want to use I mean
anyone you want to specify that this
will work with hibernate you have to use
identity that will make it this will
make it at entity right this will make
it as entity yeah and we have to also
mention the primary key now I am no I
was not thinking about primary key
earlier but now this composite you use a
primary key here so I will make this
email as a primary key so I will say at
the rich ID so be using mentally ID you
can make you can make a variable as a
primary key of the table so if I use a
great idea on top of email it will make
a primary key okay now if I think
everything should work huh let's try how
many of you think it will work
oh no let's take a pause
by the time you answer let me just have
a cookie okay
I mean everything in the world 33 people
are watching no way honestly if I'm
sounding weird I'm actually having a
cookie so okay always answering let's
run this code let's show this let's
let's run this code and see which is
working or not
let's go back to our Firefox OS Firefox
it's here and let's just reverse this a
hi Shilpa thanks for the code so we are
using your code here I hope it will work
Shilpa okay so I will use my age I will
use all this detail and with the
consummate I quite thank you here okay
so we got another but that that's it
because we don't have a chaste we could
be don't have a welcome page let's go
back here in my stairs - okay you can
see this is working we got a hibernate
output which say is insert into feedback
it has inserted your feedback but hyung
how you will how do you verify this oh I
forgot to mention I have already created
a table right in the last session we
have printed a table so it will be use
in the same database here so I will go
to my workbench and if I father the
query yeah you can you see that we got
my age we got a man ID regard we have
not entered the message oh what's wrong
with message what's wrong
message I have I guess have I have not
typed the message there is it just go to
Firefox oh I have typed the message but
message is not coming here so there's
one problem with the message message is
not coming Dacians coming code is not
coming or QPR not entered the code
there's something wrong with the message
here let me just verify what that
problem is
so if I see my HTML page okay if I see
my stable response you can see message
here is msg and the message there is the
complete a message hmm let's see
oh that so what we'll do is we'll change
this name here so it's a right-click
we're not here I was all right click on
the feedback I would say alter table
I'll make it as I want to change this
message to message msg and let's apply
now again this is another machine it
will take some time to reflect
okay
single
anyway let's try once again let's drive
a different output or different values
so right here what's wrong with this
this thing so if you have just joined
this session don't become like button so
that I will know you have just drawn a
session I know how I hope you are
sharing my videos with your friends by
shaking so much of time okay let me put
it aside and let's reach the refresh the
page and we didn't set a new values here
okay not able to get these focus as well
okay record of scope okay my machine is
working way slow now well let me just
change this name and I will name this
name as Condon and I will mention demon
ID as write that image calm you want to
wreck it for me
and you'll insert the code as one zero
one zero one zero and we'll say good
very good
okay and we'll keep the feedback as five
legs click on submit thanks for the
feedback Quinton okay let's go back to
our database and it is still my database
is actually hanged here workbench is not
working properly right that's why I took
this and say for Squatch okay so let me
open my workbench once again
why now let's see you let's use the
disco database and let's fetch the
feedback oh can you see that record
Kundun here we got content we got to
regard once in a once you've got it oh
we have not got the message here it is
because oh we've got a message but white
is not working it means verify with this
let's open STS let's see feedback tau
everything is perfect here also oh we
don't have a message here that is weird
how can we make this type of mistakes
and let's have the constructor for that
as well in fact we are not using
constructive right let's remove this
constructor from here okay I need your
message as well so I will say right like
souls and white
visitors okay we've got a question from
fares which is better the annotation way
or XML I always pay for a negation way
because it makes my work easier I was
never a fan of XML before so that's why
I always I always before XML way
annotation way let me start the server
that CV is working or not let's go back
to Firefox and let's do this again by
changing the email area of concern
because we are made it primary key right
so I will say kundan it say kun kun
Anthony de Mello calm let's submit this
it says thank you for the feedback let's
go back later database now and let's try
this query now run can you see that we
also got the masses this time okay so
yes we can also use create and update
instead of using save we can also use
create and update here
so the way we are using save method we
can also use update method you can also
use or we can also use delete all those
all those things
okay so that's it so we have so well
guys we have done with the data based
code and we have used hibernate so I'm
very happy with this because I was not
thinking about hibernate before I was
thinking about JDBC I wanted the code in
JDBC but then shilpa has given us the
code in hibernate and then i have
implemented that it is working so we'll
be continuing with a spring and
hibernate so that we'll be having that
complete power right so so what I want
from you so complete this project by
yourself now so we have done only for
the add feedback I want you to create a
method called as get feedback so I want
to see all the feedbacks here I want to
see so I want to see all the feedbacks
so we should be able to add feedback I
want to see all the feedback so I want
you people to complete that stuff for me
and send it to me upload your project on
github and give that thanks to me
so ok so we got a question from current
in hibernate - it's behind you okay so
this is that is different why we are
using I wouldn't talk CMG where you can
use Gradin update in spring it is better
to build database by yourself initially
and then you can use that in fact in
spring I won it all so we can do that
except I it's a point of research then
Google how to use that and that's it
from this from this life coding what I
want from you in the next session is I
want you people to redesign this page so
we have Sevilla almost under the
feedback right so we have done with
initial step that the next step would be
I want you people to give me the
homepage I want to be poly to redesign
the homepage okay so he's opening here
Oh
he's working based low so I don't know
why he's doing this yesterday also also
it was not working properly come on you
guys might get me to page
get me a web site okay so I want you
people to redesign this page okay so
what I'm expecting is is you're not
having three different okay so first of
all let's talk about the link so I want
you can see you have a power you can
redesign these things the way you want I
want this online course to be on the top
here not here here I mean that is that
is what I have done I'm not quitting
designs right so I want okay so this
page slider you can just animate this in
a different way okay and then you can so
the so you can see we have explore our
videos happy coding so you look at the
codes from here and you can also give
the test instead of having two different
section can we just have everything in
one section we can have a video we can
have codes and we can have tests and if
I click on the video icon it should
expand it to something like this if I
click on the code icon which should be
here if I click on that it should expand
in in code the code text so that's what
we are expecting here so I wanted to
design this thing and we got a question
from what about deployment with the app
engine yes we'll be doing that in the
next session saying I was about to talk
about - it today in the next session
which will be on Monday so the next live
session will be on Monday and we'll be
deploying the project on Google App
Engine
by Monday Sunday I will - I did I take a
live session I'm not sure about the will
it be taking on Sunday or Monday I will
try my best to take it on Sunday but if
I am NOT if I don't get the time I will
take it off Monday okay and I all
one more update here is if you can show
the latest videos some ways after the
slider if you can show the latest video
so whatever when you are plotting on
youtube if you can just put that if you
can just put that here okay so we got a
question from Tech Talk tricks okay what
is the question I'm eating so many
comments here in the previous video I
was not able to insert mavin in Eclipse
I guess you are using eclipse and that's
why it is not working so make sure you
use the latest version of Eclipse Mars
and Dione it should work but then if you
are using spring I would suggest you to
go for STS only because STS will provide
you all the spring features so use STL's
instead of using eclipse and anyway sto
see the Eclipse wise so while you're
worrying about that users cheers I just
follow my steps whatever I am doing now
just follow the same steps you can do
the explain by yourself later right
yes cut on images first like a slider
images for slider years okay you want me
the you want the images what you can do
is you can just give dummy images I'm
able to place that so we have a design
team here they will replace the images
ok bothy got a question so path which
everybody is cussing that in the in the
batch okay against STS is also available
on Windows platform it is available on
on the platform
okay that's it guys I hope you are
