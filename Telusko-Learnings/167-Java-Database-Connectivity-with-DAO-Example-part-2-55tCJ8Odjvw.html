now that means we aren't to create first
a student will say I shall fetching like
I don't want to fetch now fetching is
done and I don't have to bend this I
just want to save I want to add a new
student so what a new student will base
will say student this time we'll say
esto equal to new student since we want
to create a new student here and then
the student number it's a student roll
number will be let's say 15 and the
student name also interests name will be
let's say will go for Archana okay I
want to store this name here so what we
can do is we can say D a OH dot ad
student which student s too but
unfortunately we don't have any method
with that name so that means we want to
create that method now so we'll create
will remove this gap first and somewhere
here let me just minimize this code
method okay and after this method I want
to create a method public void I don't
want to get anything so we'll say add
student this student will accept our
student object we'll say s and we want
to save that so that means we want to
create a query and this query will be
inside query now whenever you work with
insert in JDBC we don't go for a
statement go for prepared statement that
means it will say insert into student
and since I don't know the values I will
say question ma comma question mark so
that I can replace the question mark
later now I want to achieve those seven
steps again so what I can do is I can
just take out this steps from here and
will reply declare it outside so in the
class here I will say connection con
equal to null because I want to go for
this instance declaration so I don't
have to declare here in the previous
method which is get student
and we'll everything we'll do here and
then instead of will require one more
method which is public voice connect to
that it will create the connection
doesn't matter if this gets rent out
there or our ad student I want this to
method or this to statement should be
outside once I create the connection I
don't don't have to do it again again we
require a try-catch block here so we'll
sit around with triage and we'll go for
some generalized exception and we'll
print this out e^x I'm just I'm just
taking out the common methods in both
the common lines or statements in the
both the methods and here what we can do
is now we can say I want to create our
statement but this time to a patch
statement so we say a prepared statement
will say PS T equal to corn dot prepared
statement and we are getting this corn
from connection and this query will be
is query and I want to replace that
question mark so is a PST dot set and
roll number also it should be the
question mark number and this should be
roll number
not simple roll number should be s dot
roll number because the data is in this
s oh I'm getting in either okay I want
to have to handle this will sit around
with trackage okay again I don't want to
go for specific type of exception you go
I will go for the general exception and
we'll say s out e^x and let me just cut
this line from here this one cut and
paste I want to go for replacement of
second question marks will say such
string and this will say two and the
string will be a start
esteem clear and then what we can do is
we can just execute the query so to
execute the query we'll say execute
date its execute because when you insert
you have to update it when you fire the
query you have to say execute query and
that's it
once you say update it will store that
data into database but before calling ad
student I need to call now connect
because I am creating I am going for a
new method called as connect here say
this so once you do the connection once
you call the connection it will call
this statement and this statement so the
instance for this con is creating on
this statement so we have to create a
connect first so first have to call
connect and then add straight clear and
now if it on this I hope it should work
no errors let me go to my mask you let
me just say select star from show you
can see we have a nutrient with roll
number 15 and name is Archana right so
this is how you can add static removes -
in fact you can do you can write coding
4d a dot remove student so what we have
to do is we just and pass the whole
number we said 12 so it will remove the
student with roll number 12 but again
you have to write a code for this after
I delete query so you have to write a
method and this you have to write those
steps to remove that method or to remove
that student simple so this is how you
have to use Dao thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
