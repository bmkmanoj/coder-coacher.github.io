table so in your mask you can see we
have not caught that table white even if
even after running this it's because I
mean you have two ways now one is you
can create that table by yourself or you
can ask how I had to do it but the way
you can do that I mean the way you can
ask highway to do that is by specifying
a property so you can say property name
as HB m - DD l dot Auto okay again you
can use control space to get that and
you can specify update
so when you say update in fact we have
update we have create so when you say
create it means whenever it is on this
application it will create the database
it will get the tables for you so for
all the entity classes it will create
tables for you if you say update if you
if you if the team is not there then it
will create okay it will not replace
your existing table so now let's see if
it is working or not and if you want
this code and okay so you can see we got
a table not found alien but after some
time we see it is saying that schema
update complete let's verify let's go to
your mask you'll if I say show tables
now you can see we got a table here
which is aliens let's verify do we have
a data there so we'll say select star
from alien and if I run this code you
can see we got the data as one zero one
naveen green so finally after this four
videos also in the fourth video we got
our output right so we are able to run
this application in which we are getting
the output in the the database so that's
how you store the data inside a database
using hibernate okay but there are you
know the we also getting our before
before going ahead you can just have a
round of applause for yourself for
completing this code here again now what
I will do is I will create so see if you
can see we are getting our method which
is deprecated right so what happened in
the latest latest version of the
hibernate which is after 4.1 we got a
new class on new interface which you
have which we need to use to work with
the session factory now what is that
method so this interface called as
service registry or not of this package
with a service registry it belongs to
package
Adi dot hibernate dot service in fact
hybrid provides lots of services one of
the service which you have to use is
service registry we'll say our eg equal
to new service ok so now we have to use
service registry builder because that's
that's how you can create an object will
say service registry with that service
registry builder and then we can say dot
apply setting so you have to apply the
settings of the corner object so it's
not setting it is settings you have to
remember that settings and then in this
you have to pass the object I mean you
have to pass the properties now how do
we do that we say count dot get
properties because all the configuration
is there inside this con in this inside
this corner object right so we say
properties dot then you have to say
build build service registry by doing
this you are getting the object of
registry or case you have to say a new
service build service registry builder
apply settings and then you have to say
build service registry now once we got
the object of registry we can pass that
here we can say our eg and now you can
see the deprecated method is not there
so we can be a got build session factory
and now it should work if I want this
code and we got error now what is this
error you can see it says to make it
entry 1 0 1 it's because we already have
one in our table right so if I have to
say 1 0 2 this time let's change our
alien name will say this is a radula and
let's say we have a color here which is
blue so weather-wise in blue color let's
run this and you can see we have ok so
we got our schema update let's go to
database to verify file on this code you
can see we got two entries now once
you're to Missoula and blue so that's
how you use hibernate to store data in
your database
there are not a lot of lot of concepts
remaining in this so that will be saying
in the subsequent tutorial so make sure
after before going ahead like this video
