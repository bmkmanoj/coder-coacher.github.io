aliens this is Ivan 20 from police car
learnings and in this video we'll talk
about list at least view and empty these
two will be having different activity so
this three to one is the images we will
be using here so just it was just for
the show let me just close this three
buttons here now all three images now
what we require from this video is a so
we require something in this way so you
want to create a list so in this last
example we have seen how to create a
list right but at least was just string
so let's say you want to create a list
in which we'll be having an activity so
this is one activity the second activate
this third activity so you can see we
have an activity itself this is a layout
in which you have a image so this one
here is an image and this object here
it's a string then we have an image then
we have a string then we have an image
then we have a string and we want to see
this in a list view since we have only
three images available so I am taking
this the images you can take any number
of images you want to do this first you
have to put it in activity so we'll say
right-click new and we'll say activity
which will be an empty activity and
we'll name this as what a list view
image because we want to show an image
also and you click on finish
now once we got this view we also got an
activity here and in this activity we
require a view of a list view so we'll
go to this container is the container
it's is the container it's here so we
can just drag it the ListView here and
we'll set the okay so we got this
ListView
let's set the name for it let's set the
ID it is by default ListView will say
yeah we'll do that place view to will
keep the same ID itself and now what we
need so if you compare this image so in
this image you can see in was in one
list item we have in a layout right we
have an image and then we have a
textview so to show that we require one
more activity
which will be for only for the view so
what we'll do is we'll create an
activity okay just turn around will I so
we get an activity and we'll end with
activity so let us say this is new
activity we'll keep it empty again and
we'll name this as image or image list
okay we don't require okay so let's say
okay layout live image list click on
finish now in this view I don't require
this Java file for this I just required
a image list now you can see what we
have in the output is we have a layout
in which you have two components which
are next to each other so this is at
least this is a linear view linear
layout right is not relative this is
linear layout and we don't require all
this padding here so we can just remove
this padding and we need to set one more
thing one thing here which is called as
the orientation so we'll say orientation
as horizontal okay - that's the one
thing required now in this list linear
layout what we need is we require two
things one is the image view so we'll
say this is image we can also it like
break it down when that will do I should
be capital so that's the image view
require here and this image we require
the width we'll say this is 20 DP
because we want small width and the
height will also keep it 20 DP now once
we have set these two things the next
thing we require is the ID for this and
we'll say we can give any ID we want
okay we want an ID to be image vo1
so we can set any ID here so once we got
the ID next thing we have to specify as
the what next that's it I guess okay
once we got the image view next we
require a text view in which you have to
mention the width will save lab content
I
it will also say web content okay now
what next we require is let's say text I
don't require text what I require is
text size set the text size will say
text size we say 25 SP okay that will do
and that's it I guess so if I try to see
the view okay let mrs. should say deep
text so that we can see at least what's
what is the default value so let's say
this is our text view okay so we got a
text view here let's also see some image
there and I will set the image we
already have an image right in min map
do have an image yeah we have I see
launched iton min map so we use that so
we'll say add rate mipmap so that's map
map slash will use I see launcher okay
so you can see okay we cannot see was
the error okay and we can see there is
an image so we have an image and we have
a text view right but it is not in this
Center hmm what we can do for that is
qualify specify the gravity will it work
if I specify the gravity as Center start
working oh it's not working
mm-hmm that's it the gravity for this
text also will say gravity and we'll say
Center okay now that's look good now
once we have this to or once we have
this component we want this component to
be in the least right so we will not
have one component will be having
several components or go back to your
list in the this Java file now in this
list we have to work with those to
layout so we need to include this layout
this layout inside the ListView okay so
for that we have to go to list view
image now in this you have to the first
thing we require as the least view
object so we'll say in the class itself
is say
ListView will name this as LV now once
we got the object of ListView we also
need object of context here because
anyway we are working for the adapt we
are working will be working with
adapters so let's take it and we require
at least again we'll discuss why we
require all this components and we'll
say this is program list again as it is
now once we got this three components
now we need to show this data on the
screen right on the list view so what
data I require I require some images and
I require some text so for that I will
create a addy and we'll say this is
public static array this will be of
array integer so it's like kind of your
what you say this will be like in enum
so we'll say this we are creating an
array here so how to create an array now
I want something in this area and that
something is I want this this 1 1 dot
PNG 2 dot PNG and throughout PNG inside
this array and how to get that reference
we can say r dot drawable dot one does
the first component so we can just give
a comma you can see we have we got one
here then we can say r dot drawable dot
two we can say r dot drawable dot three
okay and we can just copy this for
several times let's say we want line
values so two and three right after -
after three will set enter okay and at
the end we don't require this comma so
let's remove that so you can see we got
nine components right and so once we got
this nine number since we do not have
multiple images we'll reuse the numbers
now we require four text we'll say
public static string and we'll say this
is program names right
and we'll create or array for this also
so we can say the first element what was
the first element it was object class
polymorphism so we got object then we
got class then we got polymorphism okay
what next we have inheritance then we
have JDBC so we have so let me just
pause the video and we'll type it
everything and then we'll come back so
now once we have once we have added this
nine names I want to show this name in
the list right now what to do for that
so to add this into the list we need to
use some adapter so in the last example
we have seen how to use adapter right
which is added Apter but this time we
are not going for arrays because we have
a layout in the layout so we cannot use
normal array adapter for that what we'll
do is we'll create our own adapter to
work with now how to get an adapter just
right-click on your java and you can say
new Java class and we'll name this as
any we can begin name it anything ok -
the page structure so we want it inside
main right I don't we'll name this class
as a my least adapter okay now what are
things we require here now since we are
calling we are using the adapter in the
list within the other class which
external class the things we require
here is the we require the first thing
as activity so that's the activity
object we require here and we'll name
this as let's say context next we
require as this the adding of string and
the what's the error here yeah so we'll
do that later so we have we require
array of the text and the array of the
images so what we'll do is we'll say
private final we'll say string this will
be for names let's say prog list right
and we require one more thing final
integer array and this is your prog
images
it was those programs names right yeah
so once we got this three add a way to
create the constructor for mileage
because we want to initialize this
objects here and how to initialize this
we can create a constructor so we can
say public my my list so that's my or we
can just ask on it this understood you
to give us constructor so we can say
generate constructor for all this values
so we got the constructor here right so
we got this constructor okay that is
sequence e'er now we need to also call
so we need to extend this my list
adapter because we won't be occurring in
adapter right so we need to extend this
with an ally adapter because we want the
features of our adapter which will
support this string values okay and we
from this we had to call super
constructor which is we bypassing
context by passing rogue names and
bypassing prog images so that's the
thing we require because we are using
adapter here and we are getting some
other errors cannot resolve to super oh
that's weird
oh I just made a mistake here so we need
to pass one more parameter I guess hmm
no it's and with the error okay let me
just drag the constructor once again the
super constructor so one you have to
pass the context yeah the second one we
have to pass not the context but the the
view this you have to pass this one I'm
going to forget that
so in this saw you have to mention we
have to pass we have to say r dot layout
and inside this layout you have to
mention that activity image list and
then we need to pass this string which
is program names
okay so once we have passed these three
parameters now what next now every time
so whenever you to end out this least so
of course right you will be getting a
list format here now this one you will
be getting a list format is it that this
one so you will be getting a list format
and this will be getting that one image
least right this one the second the
third one the fourth one and every time
you call the you you render it it will
call the adapter I this adapter
responsibility to give you those views
so it will give the give you the view
you just have to use a method which is
gate view which is a overrated method of
a deductr which takes a so let me just
use that overhead method here so how to
do that just press ctrl n and we'll say
overhead methods and the method name is
get view is it okay so just have to say
you have to get this method which is get
view and we don't want to return this
let us return that later on so it is a
now in this you have to so in this get
view we need to include this view right
so we need to include this view and to
do that we need to use something else
layout inflator because inflator is used
to feel or fill the layout so we say
this is inflator
equal to context dot get layout inflator
that is the method yeah so we have get
inflow so that is the standard way of
filling the layouts now once now how to
feel it so to feel we have to use we
have to get object of view we'll say row
view that's the object name and then to
inflate we have to use infinito dot
inflate by passing to power or three
parameters the first one will be the the
image you want to fit so we'll say r dot
layout dot activity image list does the
image we want to fill the second
parameter is what it is view group I
will say okay null I do not want to set
any view group and should it attach to
route yes it should be attached to route
so true now once we got the view now the
next thing is we
in that view you have to set two things
the image the text and the image right
to set this text and the image just
create object of text view and we'll say
this is txt txt what txt view audio
extra title we can say equal to way to
search text view we have to say find
against not to not find it is from the
view right so if we have to fetch the
text view of activity image least so we
can use row view because it is there it
is it is in that that view right so we
have to say row view get fined view by
ID and we can say r dot ID dot what it
is a bit text so what was the name of
that it should be okay let me check the
name i you won 5-4 Dineen so this is the
we don't have ID for this let's set the
ID ID will be what ID we can give we can
give any idea we can say this is mm
textview textview one so you can set X
to be 1 this is text V 1 this is image
v1 or text V 1 is already busy so we can
say textview too so just remember
textview too so it come here and say
this is text vo 2 so once we got a
textview there the next thing we require
as the image so we'll say image view
we'll name this as image vo equals shoe
you can provide image view and the same
thing Rho V o dot find view by ID and
then we can mention our dot Adi dots it
was I guess image view one let me just
make sure it just image we want so it is
image we won yes and okay that's Q
semicolon now once we have done this to
done this thing we just have to I'll
give you a remaining or something else
yeah we need to set the text we also
right so we have to say
txt title and we to set this we need to
set the text
the image from the add a few remember so
we have this added which is program
names right so we can say program names
and we can specify the positions that's
the integer value here so that's the
position now the next is for image that
we have to say image view dot what set
image what was the method name it was
set image I just said image resource and
here we have to mention image okay was
the add a name it is folk this burg
image and then you have to specify the
position okay that's it and then here we
have to return instead of returning all
this thing just return low view because
that's the view you want to show in the
list right I think it should work now is
it will it work no we have to first get
object of adapter right then it will
work so in this we have to create object
of adapter so if it is my least adapter
not working not able to find the package
okay see you why it's there let me just
drop it
so we to create in this package the
above package I think it should work now
okay so we got my adapter and we'll say
this is adapter we can give any name so
that's adapter equal to then we have to
say - adapter and we can probably to
pass the object of the context the
current context will say this this is
the correct current context then we need
to pass the array of program names so
that's program names and then we have to
find latest we need to also send the
images will say prog
images because we are very accepting
those values here right so you can see
we are accepting those where we are
accepting those values here so it also
pass it now once we have passed those to
those values now let's create let's set
the view so we'll say lvu dot or way to
first grade object of LV right very
maybe I remain with that so we'll say
least view find view by ID we'll say r
dot
ah DDOT what is the listview object name
okay let's check the needs to be object
name it was or we have not you know it
is leased view to so the back to this
least it is leased view to now once we
got the audit of list let's set the
adapter so we'll say LV dot set adapter
and we can pass adapter which is which
we have created here I think it should
work so let us on this code
let's say hopefully it will work so just
pray for that okay so it will take some
time to load in the output window so
this is the earlier code we which we
have done in the last video okay we are
dealing with one more time how can i
forgot that so we need to change the
launches so this time the launcher will
be the least of you so here just
mentioned the launcher and let's run
this once again okay why it's not
working okay there's some problem with
this notice was found as textview to
okay that starts view it takes you to is
not found let's make it my text view
that's my text view and inside this jar
file which is our jar file here inside
of erupted oh it should be my textview
okay this problem with our itself
so there is a problem here it should be
Plus which I have forward to mention so
let's go back to the activity and it
should come now so it is my textview so
once we got my textview let's run this
code now I think it should work so what
we have done till now as we have so it
is running so project is running so what
we have done in this in this view in
this list where's this yeah so in this
list we wanted this images so we want
this thing there but not one we want
multiple so we have created the adapter
here okay got the thing over not which
no it's still come on come on get me the
output is taking some time to load again
oh I forgot to major just changes so let
me take this cut I guess I have just
undo it
in the last running so let me run this
again okay so let me just repeat what we
have done so we have created this array
of this this list view image in which
you have to create two array one for the
images and one for the text and to set
the text we require object of adapter so
we have created the object of adapter
here in which you have to first create
the constructor and then we have to
mention the view because every time the
you are you increasing you increase the
our images and the names you have it
will call get get view by mention the
position and then it will try to render
all this values so it will fetch values
from the array and then it will side on
the view so if you see this we got we
got obj one we got class we got
polymorphic we got inheritance and we
got all this values right so that's how
we can use a view here or we can do one
more thing here we can also set the
listener to it it is very easy now so we
can say set on item click listener and
we can we can say new way to get object
off what on item click listener and here
we just have to
toast dot make text and this you have to
pass this is leased view image dot this
and then we wait to pass the position so
we say you clicked at plus we can set we
can get the position so we can say
program list which is the program where
is the program list your program names
we have a program names off we can
specify the position which is position
right and then we can set the the length
we can say this is long duration so we
can set it long and at the end we can
say dot show no other side so we don't
have any errors now let's run this code
once again for the last time it would
take some time to load I mean I would
put here if I click on inheritance we
got inheritance if I click on swing we
got swing or hey we got swing it with
it's a long duration that's why it is
taking some time and if I click on
abstract it gives abstract so that's how
we can use list view with the images so
