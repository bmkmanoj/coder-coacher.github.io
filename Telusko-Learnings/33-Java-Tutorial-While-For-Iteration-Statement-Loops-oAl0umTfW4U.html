statement let's talk about betrayin not
exactly iteration means when you want to
repeat something repeatedly we can use
iteration example what we'll do here is
let's say I want to print a statement I
want to print a statement like hello
that's it so I can simply type system
dot out dot println I can type hello
there and if I run this code you can see
we got the output as hello so let's say
I want to execute this statement
multiple times now so in shop only once
let me type it five times so if you want
to print hello five times you have to
write this code five times right so if I
write this five times now you can see we
got five times hello here in the console
window but this one issue here we have
this statement repeated five times right
and when you repeat any code it is
called last code redundancy so when you
wanna repeat any code it is called as
code redundancy and code we tendency is
a try so you have to make sure that you
will not repeat any statement because if
you repeat a statement you are doing a
crime there how do you make sure that
you print five statements without
repeating the statement we can write
hello only one and we can say I want to
execute this statement multiple time so
we can put that thing in a block so I
want to execute this block multiple
times but when you say multiple times
how many times one two hundred 500 1000
so to specify the number of times it
will get executed right so to specify
that what we can do is we can specify
some looping statement so you have to
use a loop so it exert a loop a loop
will loop will execute continuously so
it will go it will execute this block it
will execute this statement it will go
back to the loop it will execute the
statement it will come to the curly
brackets it will go back here it will
execute the block but when it comes to
loop and you'll be just a concept the
actual implementation of loop is with
the help of while loop so either we can
use a while loop or we can use a
do-while loop so we have do-while loop
otherwise we can use a for loop and then
we have the advanced loop well as for
each loop so now this forest loop is
also called as enhanced for loop so what
we'll do is let's replace this loop
keyword let's go with wild now how while
works is inside your while we can
specify the condition so we can say what
it is true so when you say well it is
true it will execute this statement
time's example if I on this port you can
see just and I just continue printing it
and how to stop that by clicking on this
stop button you can stop it which is
printing infinite times right I want to
make sure that it is going finite so
when you say you want to make it finite
so let's I want to print only five times
so you have to you need a counter who
will count it so to use a counter we'll
define a variable we'll say this is I
the initial value of I will keep it as
one it's my I value or while my I value
is less than equal to five so if the
value of I is less than five and then
that's okay you can go with it so
example when is when it comes to one one
is less than five yes it will execute
the block then same as - same goes for
three same goes for four same goes for
five what about about six as well so I
become six it will check okay
I six is not less than five that means
it will not execute the block it will go
out way to make sure that we are also
incrementing the value of I so as we
have seen we can also use I plus plus to
show the increment so the initial value
of I is 1 and then we are checking if I
less than equal to five and then we are
saying I plus plus my friend this code
you can see the output is where we are
getting hello five times so that's the
magic of a loop where you want to
execute a block for multiple times and
we have to use three statements here so
the first statement here will be called
as initialization statement because this
is the line where you're putting the
initial value of I then this is the
condition and this is your increment so
basically when you want to use a counter
for a loop we can use it three steps the
initial value the condition and the
increment or decrement operator looks
cool right so this is how I loop now we
have one more loop to look at we can
also use do-while loop now what is
difference between while and do-while
let's say I want to execute this
statement now is it just not depend upon
the increment value I want to execute
this statement multiple times so let's I
am taking the input from the user and if
user is giving the number like fifteen
twenty any number I just have to take
that number and I have to print it my
user says five if I use assess and if I
uses is fifteen I have to take the input
from the user I just have to print it
that's it nothing else but let's say if
I user says hundred now if a number goes
beyond 99 I don't want to print that I
want to stop the execution now in that's
in our
you're taking the input from the user
right at least once even if a user says
hundred you are taking the input at
least once so that means when you use a
while loop even if your condition is
false it will not execute this block but
what do I look does is we can write do
and while we're the condition is checked
later even if a user in terms of 100
imagine we're to take an example of user
input and then depend upon that I want
to clean something this is not big this
is not that example which we are talking
about but let's say in that scenario we
will be using a do-while because even if
you are even if a user enters 100 it
will execute the block at least once so
if you want to execute the block at
least once even if your condition is
false we can just do one example if I
than this code you can see this printing
the same Strout statements five times
but let's say if I make the value of I
as 9 now a 9 is greater than greater
than 5 right and even if I run this code
it will execute hello at least once is
because the condition is checked later
now this concept is same as C
programming so if you are coming from C
and C++ you know what I'm talking about
all right so this is happy this is what
you do in C and C++ in Java also we can
achieve the same stuff ok so that's your
do window we can also use for loop here
because in case of while or do-while
what we do is we write in this 3
statement which is initial value
condition and increment in 3 different
line using a for loop what we can do is
we can write everything in one lines
example you can I can say int I equal to
1 then we can give a semicolon we can
specify I plus plus so you can see I'm
using one line but we have we do have
three statements first statement this is
second statement and this is third
statement so we can write all this 3
statement in one line if you are using a
for loop and if we run this code you are
getting the same output we are printing
hello five times so again we'll talk
about while loop do I look at the hook
to all the course there will be lots of
conditions where you have to use this so
that's how your the for loop works okay
so when you have iteration you when you
want to iterate from our values we can
use a for loop now when to use a while
loop when to use a do-while loop when to
use a for loop so when you know that the
starting point and the ending point
always go for loop example we know that
we have to start with one
and we have to end that at 5:00 so we
know it always go for for loop but let's
say when you don't know the starting
point ending point sometimes you know we
have to iterate in loop depend upon some
some other factors example you are
creating a chat application and you want
to take the in from the user
continuously till the user saying says
exit so if user is in putting a value
like exit you need to make sure that you
are closing the chat window so now you
don't know right how many times our user
will type the message how many times you
will be chatting it all depend upon the
exit keyboard as soon as the user enters
exit you have to stop it so in the while
condition you have to specify the
condition that if user says exit then
close the while loop otherwise skip it
continuous so you don't know the number
of times our user will type the message
in that scenario all this before file do
when to use do I look even if your
conditions fall so you want to execute
that statement once before do-while loop
now we have one more which is for each
loop we will be talking about 40s no
once we talked about array so we have a
concept of array so once we have done
with add a concept we'll talk about for
each because for the it is a special
type of loop specially made for arrays
and collections so once we have done
with adding that will this fall it will
make more sense there but remember when
you talk about iteration or loops we
have while loop we have do-while loop we
have for loop and we have for each loop
so that's it from this video that's how
you use looping statements that's it
