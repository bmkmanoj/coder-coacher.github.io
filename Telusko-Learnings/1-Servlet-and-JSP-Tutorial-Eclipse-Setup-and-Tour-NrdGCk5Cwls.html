where do we code to work on a project
you need to use one of the app or the
software which is called I D e now IDE
basically stands for integrated
development environment
it means it's a it's a software where
you will code where you will compile the
project and where you will run the
project now the different ID is
available for servlets in fact for Java
field we have certain certain ideas of
enable so one of them is NetBeans we
have Eclipse we have IntelliJ so that if
these are the three top most software is
available for Java developers now which
is the best one I would say IntelliJ is
the one of the best IDE available for
Java but the only thing is it has two
versions one is community version and
second is the ultimate version and if
you want to work on server-side coding
you to use ultimate one and
unfortunately you have to pay for that
otherwise you can go with eclipse this
is the next best IDE of enable and the
awesome thing is it is free to use and
then we have NetBeans normally in
academic purpose they use NetBeans a lot
but I've never seen a dilemma
environment where we are using a
NetBeans but then people may be using it
but I prefer Eclipse in fact the
industry which I visited for training
they all use eclipse now we will see how
do you get eclipse in your machine now
the first thing would be open your
browser so it's go to google and search
for eclipse download now if you select
Clips download you can see it will show
you this option which is Eclipse IDE for
Java EE just click on that and now you
can see we have four different OS we
have different setups here now you can
go for any washin I mean depend upon
your OS example in my machine I am using
Mac so I will be going for Mac OSX if
you're using Windows depend upon which
bit you're using maybe write a bit OS or
64-bit OS you will choose one of them
and if you are using UNIX flavors you
can choose this one now since I'm using
Mac I will be going for the third option
here click on this and then you will
click on download not in some time it
will get downloaded and you can see it
is getting downloaded here now it will
take some time based on your internet
speed
now we don't have to actually wait for
this I already have a setup in my
machine so if I go to find out you can
see I already downloaded this software
on my machine and the only thing is
since it is started GZ you can simply
double click it and it will give you the
unzipped version right and the answer
portion is eclipse and the moment I
double click on this you will get your
IDE so the version which I am using is
eclipse Mahseer you can also use neon
that works fine now it will ask you for
a workspace now workspace is basically a
folder where you will put all your
project so what are you on your working
projects will be there in this folder
you can choose whichever folder you want
and I would choose a servlet I would say
a sublet workspace I was thinking okay
and as you can see this is the Eclipse
IDE so let me just make it full frame
and I would close the Welcome window
again you can enjoy this welcome window
where you have some tutorials you can
see some sample code but then let me
just close it and this is how your EPS
will look like on the left hand side you
have your project Explorer so all your
project will be explored here on the
right hand side you have some task list
you have some outline to work with so I
we don't we don't need that as at this
point now this is the area where you
will get your code window as you can see
we don't have anything here yet but then
this is very well code and this tabs are
very important now this is one of the
tab which will be helpful for debugging
your application whatever wrong with
your project you can see that here then
this is the tab which is important this
our tab now you might have guessed it
till now
since you are working with solve like
you need a server to run it on right and
in the theory video we have talked about
it we need a server which is a servlet
container where you will run the
servlets and the Sabich pendulum which
we are going to use in the course is
Tomcat so of course you need to link
your Tomcat here but how do you do that
that's it if that's a different thing
then this is for data source if you want
to explore your database connections now
this is what you have on the on this
side now let's talk about this one this
is a perspective so if I if I click on
this perspective these are the
perspectives which are enabled now you
wonder wondering what this perspective
means now if you are walking on sublet
or any enterprise level code let's say
servlet JSP ejbs you will be selecting
java ee now java ee offers you those
features where you can configure java
Java is stuff example it's the server
tab which you are getting here thanks to
the Java EE perspective because if I
change different perspective it's a Java
which is used for normal code Java
development in fact look on OK you will
see there's something change and this
our tab is gone now so these are the
perspective you have so you can see if I
click on Java EE perspective you will
get service if I click on Java
perspective here you will not see
servers there and if I again open the
perspective there are get perspective so
if you want to see the apposite trees
there is a jb a perspective if you want
to work with JP a note I mean we want to
work with Java e so let's stick to it
look on okay and you got Java EE
perspective now the next thing would be
you need a project and you need a tomcat
server because even if you have a
project here how will you run it because
you need Tomcat server right now how do
we get a tomcat server that we'll see in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
