this series of the Java tutorials now in
this will see some effective way of
working with Java now say when I talk
about this code this is the last last
time we have done this code of edit of
converting a character into half-inch
value or you can say Oscar value let's
suppose if I do the same thing if I like
the same code so the first step you have
to do is you have to compile it right
took to cut to compile it we have to go
through our comma or to go to our
command prompt and then we have to say
Java C and we have to mention the file
name which is a dot Java right and once
you get the compilation then you have to
do the next step which is learning right
so you have to say Java + classname and
when you say enter you will get the
output but the problem is you're typing
your code at different in different
place you are running your code at
different place and with different
different commands right so we have
different different environments to work
with so what we can do is we can just
integrate all this thing we can just
integrate all this thing to make a
single software will use a single
software in which you will type the code
in which you can compile the code in
which you can run the code right and
those thing in which you can compile
your code is called as IDE or you can do
everything is called as IDE IDE stands
for integrated development with
development
it's and one okay
okay excuse me first misspellings so
this is ID right now so what we can do
is we can just say we can we can use IDs
like we have ID which is your eclipse we
have ID call which is your NetBeans we
have IDs like J edit so we have these
two IDs now what IDI uses NetBeans so I
use NetBeans NetBeans we have lots of
version of NetBeans the latest version
is 8.0 but I will recommend you to
download the version which is 7.4
because it is stable 8.0 is new version
so there might be some chances your code
is right but the output you will get
some wrong output so make sure you go
with the stable version so go with 7.4
still have already installed 8.0 I will
be using 8.0 if you know how to download
in order to download your NetBeans what
you can do is you can go to your browser
and you can type your download NetBeans
it will take to our site for us NetBeans
dot o-r-g this is your site from this
side you can download this software so
there will be having multiple versions I
was taking out some time yeah so the
current version available is 8.0 but I
will recommend you download 7.4 it's
stable version but if you want to
experiment with Java 8 go with that
means 8.0 so it will take to a download
page ok now in this download page you
have multiple multiple bundles the first
thing first bundle is normal go Java
bundle in which you will be getting the
base IDE you will be getting Java I see
you'll be getting FX no other feature we
know how to create enterprise
applications you require this bundle in
order to work with C and C++ you require
this one too in order to work with html5
and page speed quite this bundle and if
you want to get everything you can get
this bundle if your machine is fast if
you have 3 GB of RAM go with this bundle
all right what if your machine is slow
like my machine go with this this one
initially ok so once you download you
have to install it and this is this when
you install though you will be getting a
shortcut icon on your desktop and when
you open it with it will take some time
because it's bit heavy depend up on your
machine speed since I'm using netbook it
will be it work bit slow on my machine
so I am using netbeans
8id 8.0 but make sure when you install
NetBeans JDK should be installed so you
require you require some prerequisites
for NetBeans it is your JDK and the
version of JDK should be suitable with
you an advanced IDE so if your NetBeans
IDE version is 8.0 JDK should be 8 like
I'm using JDK which is 8 let me show you
my JDK
so it's Program Files and the version of
JDK I'm using is 8 point one point eight
point zero it should match Oh still long
time I guess there is some problem with
my machine it's open right so now I
already have a project here let me close
that project close close close it fast
buddy
okay so the amazing part is get new
updates you know every week we'll be
getting some updates a bit annoys me but
we don't have option you can just go
through your tools and you can off your
updates okay so when you open your
NetBeans IDE might be you're getting a
different look and feel because I have
changed my look and feel of my NetBeans
the default will be getting some
different type of look and failure I
have changed it Oh cancel for my my
purpose so now in order to walk with
NetBeans first thing you have to do is
you have to create a project so when you
say a new project and this new project
you have to provide a name or so before
name you have to specify you're working
with java application so you can see i
have i've downloaded an enterprise
application in which I am getting
everything I am getting Java web I'm
getting Java EE I'm waiting x-15 because
I've gone for or j2ee version next or we
are getting a normal application here we
have to specify the project name and
we'll say like my project we can go for
any name violence in my approach okay
and then we can say finish I might do
this by default this project will create
a file a normal Java file for you so
just wait and watch
so this project has already created a
file for us in which you have a normal
class you have a normal class in which
it is you are getting a main function so
what you can do is you can type your
code here this all are coming so we can
remove all these comments we want okay
we can remove all this thing
now now what we can do is we can type
our code here now what I need is I need
to print a statement I have to print a
hello so what I can do is I can say
system dot out dot println right so if
you get a others also let's suppose if I
miss nu it will give me a tonight so it
checks for everything and then we can
double what we can say hello okay so now
to run this thing to run this project or
to run this application what we can do
is we can just say play write all you
can just say you can say run or what you
can do is you can use your keyboard
shift f6
so when you say stiffed f6 it will run
the current code it's running it's
running
and here's the output so output is hella
right it's very simple
but let's supposing for me to create a
new file in which I have to add two
numbers right again we have done this
code previous previously but this time
we'll use NetBeans so you have to say
like click on your project a new class
and we'll say this class named as ADD
and we'll say finish
now when you say finish by default
you're getting getting all this thing
we'll say select all did it let me type
the code now something is very sure you
have to create a class I will say class
add okay now what next you require a
main function right now in NetBeans you
have some shortcuts
okay so diet shortcuts are now if you
are not tigh published shutting void
main what you can do is you can say P
SVM and say tab so when you say by
default you get this straight matrices
so we have some shortcuts here and then
what we can do is we can type we want to
add two numbers right so week what we
can say we can use the to pick a new
story tables into a and B and we'll say
value far and value for then to add
these two numbers we can use C and C
equal to and we can say a plus B okay
now you have to print we can say system
dot out dot println bracket see what we
can do is we have a shortcut for that
also and it is s out so you can say s
out and tab so we get a statement and
then here we can drink C let me save
this and shift f6 will run this
application and your output is nine
right so five plus four is nine
now what a you know create your own
shortcuts now what I need is let me just
remove this now if I say if I type ABC
and tab okay in this case I should get
that code that's my new shortcut right
so to create new shortcuts you can go to
tools
you can go to options this is editor and
editor you have code completion no
coefficient coach done with a templates
your code templates here you have lots
of shortcuts right you have all the
shortcuts what you can do is you can
create your own shortcuts so we have to
say new application we'll give it as ABC
and ok and here we can say paste we can
just copy paste the code what we which
we need everywhere so say apply ok ok so
what we can do is we can say if I say
ABC tab I am getting the code right so
if I say BC tab I am getting the code so
that means we have we can create our own
shortcuts and nightbeat's ok so I hope
