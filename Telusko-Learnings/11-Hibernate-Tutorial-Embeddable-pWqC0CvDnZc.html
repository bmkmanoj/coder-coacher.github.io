do is let's try to understand how to use
embeddable objects or embeddable of
fields what we'll do for that is let me
just remove all extra things here this
one okay and okay see ya
so we'll okay so let's remove that and
let me add one more property here and
we'll say that property is or maybe a
name a name okay
so we have a name we have a name here
right but what happens you know in the
in your name if I were to take a full
name
okay example if we talk about my name
everyone thinks that my name is diamond
20 but not exactly today let me reveal
my full name on on you on YouTube so my
full name is Todd equally Naveen Kumar
Oh ready
Bapuji okay that's weird I know so
that's my that's my that's my surname
this is my first name and this is my
father's name okay so this is my surname
this is my first name and this is my
father's name okay so we have I have
this big name here so it's not even
leaner in commodity poverty and it just
close that now that's enough for my name
so what we have is we talked about the
name we have these three things right we
have first name last name and middle
name what I want is instead of having
one field I won't leave fields so that
you know when I when I go with name it
should be easier for me to work with
right example if I want to see only the
first name of the people I can use the
first name if I want to see the last
name of the people I can use last name
and if I want to see the middle name I
can see the middle name right what do we
do for that is so we can create an array
of string but instead of that we can
create a class called as name okay name
class or maybe say alien name class and
this alien name class will have certain
variables so we have a variable like
private string F name then private
string L name
and then pry which string em name which
is middle name because we have these
three things and of course for this we
also need we also need getters and
setters would say so skitters and
setters
okay let's select all these three and
click on ok now with get ends like that
we also need a two string method for
that also will use sews and say two
string method and we'll select all these
three okay now we got a two string
method and get and setup let's go back
to my so this is my area name class in
this alien instead of having string now
I will go for alien name now the
advantages this alien a name will have
three things a first name last name and
middle name of course we have to change
the characters as well right since we
are changing that so we'll say sews
getters and setters I will say for a
name okay now once we got this once we
got this a name L name we have to go
back to app as well now since we want to
we want to save the value we'll say new
alien again because if the last video we
have talked about fetching that's why we
have done fetching here right but this
time we'll go for again save I will say
session dot save and I want to save what
I am planning to save disco here okay
now what else we need here I want to set
the values now for sure when you say set
the values I will say the disco dot set
a ID I will say this is 1 1 0 and or
maybe 1 0 1 because since I'm changing
the structure so we have to make sure we
are use create here not update let's go
back to alien or not idiot app and let's
set the point we can set us we can say
set color I will say color is green but
if you say set name that is something
which is different right when you say
set a name now this is not a simple
string right it's an object that means
to set the value first you have to
create the object I will say alien name
I would say a n equal to new alien name
and we'll send the values we'll say a
and dot set F name which is Naveen Kumar
Reddy and then we'll say a and dot set L
name which is Tata Polly okay in fact I
should change my tennis I should change
my you know my swap ID I should change
my channel link to this one okay so once
we have said all these things that set a
and here that's and that's your a n
right so we are creating an object of
name and then we are passing that name
here that sounds cool right now the deal
question is when I say save in the
earliest scenario we were having name as
a string right so when you save name as
a string it will take a string but this
time your name is not a string it's an
object how many fields it will create
since we have two classes now not one we
have alien and alien name will it create
two table with it fat will it keep all
these values in the same table does a to
create table we have to make sure that
we use entity right and for a name we
have not mentioning anything let's see
what happens if I run this code if I on
this code you can see it will give you a
it says it is not able to find the
columns for name X because it is getting
confused is it an entity or something
else we have to say hey don't create a
new table for me what I will do is I
will put this values inside the same
table so that table will have multiple
values and you can do that with the help
of M variable so when you say embeddable
that means this name will get embedded
inside a alien table itself so this
alien table will have alien it will have
a ID it will have color it will also
have a name but not a name exactly it
will have these three things F name L
name and M name let us run this to see
you to show you the output if I run this
code you can see it is working see the
table structure here it is a ID then we
got F name then we got L name then we
got em they
then we got color and then okay so then
we got color and that's how you are
inserting a value here let's see how
this this how this looks inside a table
if either on this query you can see this
is your sequence record a I D we got F
name L name M name and color the thing
is you can see the sequence of us okay
so that's how you twelve so you can see
we got one zero one we got Naveen regard
my son name we got my middle name and we
got our color so that's how you use this
embeddable annotation to M'Baye your
your your object inside another table of
course when we use entity here instead
of using ember dip then it will give a
new table right but we don't want a new
table here and that's why we'll be using
embeddable so that's it that's it for
this video in which you have used a
embeddable annotation again we can we
can change the column name here as well
we can say add column we can we can do
all those extra things now since this is
not an entity we will not it will not be
using @ ID because an ID is for this is
for the primary key right and since you
are inserting this in a new table so we
don't have at the existing table that we
have to do we do have to do that so
that's it from this the from this
