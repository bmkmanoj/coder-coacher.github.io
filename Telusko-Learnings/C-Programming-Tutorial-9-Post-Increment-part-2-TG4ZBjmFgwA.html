happening here is to explain this let me
create one more variable called a stem
okay so we have a variable called a stem
so what's happening here is when you say
it will first assign the value and then
it will increment is not actually
assigning so it will fetch the value
here and it will keep the value as 1 and
then it will increase the value of I
which is 2 now but the last value of I
was 1 right so it will again assign 1 to
I so what's happening here so just
imagine we are getting a bit available
which is stamp and the value of temp
will be I which is 1 initially or if you
are committing this part and then it
will do I plus plus as we have defined
here and then we are assigning the same
value again to 10 so we are saying I
equal to time so that means we are
fetching the value of i keeping tap in
temp then we are incrementing the value
of I now the value of I is 2 but we are
fetching the value of time which was 1
earlier and then we are getting a new
value for I which is 1 and you run this
code you will get in same output which
is one simple as that was the mystery so
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
