from the skull earnings and in this
video we'll talk about soft lights now
why exactly we need servlets and and how
to use it so first of all let's
understand why we need servlets
so you might be knowing about this
concept of static pages and dynamic
pages right so when you talk about
static pages what it means you know we
have we have a client here and then we
have a server and this server will have
a page which is premade page which is
already already there when you send
request servers thanks ok we want to
send the response now the server send
respond now this this pause was the
inner format of HTML white sincere you
are asking for the page so a client
sends the request so since it responds
in the format of HTML that's so simple
right but the moment you say ok I don't
want the page which is pre-made I want a
page so let's say if you're asking for
your Facebook profile so when you go to
Facebook and when you ask for your
profile now that page is not the build
right so it will be created at runtime
so static pages are those pages which
are labeled and dynamic pages are those
pages which are built on the user
request that means that with your page
for sure there will be up a file page
but the data will not be there so you
want to insert data as well so what
happens is when you send a request to
the server let's say this is ABC dot
HTML and this is profile dot HTML now in
this case your profile HTML so you are
asking for profile or HTML but let's
imagine this is not pre-built so this is
not there so what happens is your server
is responsible to create a page for you
so I will create a page for you now how
a Sawbuck data page for you now this is
your server this is your static page and
there will be a helper application here
so whenever you send a request where you
don't have that particular file you will
be having
helped an application which is your web
container okay so in on your server
you'll be having a web container now
when you send a request it will check
okay do we have a static page for that
and there says no we don't have static
page for profile so it will go to work
better and say hey I got a request for
profile HTML do you have that file okay
now your Tomcat will think okay let me
check
so in this town can't there will be them
with some codes some programming using
which you can generate a dynamic page
now why we need programming it first
place is because when you say you want
to generate a page using some data and
that data is coming from our database so
let's say this is your database here you
want to create a page by fetching data
from database how you do how you do that
we cannot use HTML why because hTML is
not a programming language it's a markup
language so normally we design a page
with above HTML but let's say if you
want to do any processing stuff or if
you want to fetch the data from the
database you need to use some
programming now that programming can do
PHP that can be ASP that can be Ruby
right but I can also be a java
application now again which one to go
for PHP is good for small applications
the moment you you know when you want to
scale your application it might become
unstable right then you have ASP okay so
if you are into Microsoft technologies
ASP is best then we have Ruby so Twitter
initiative starter I mean they they
built their website using Ruby but again
the problem is once you want to scale
your application then it will struggle
then we have Java so Java is stable Java
is secure so let's say if you want to
build
your hand per application with your palm
java then what is the option so if you
want to use Java here then we have to
use something called as solids now the
solids so sublet stands for server
component okay now whenever you have
whenever you hear this numbers let the
way we have applets we have solids we
have facelets we have what else we have
okay we have lots of let script let's
write so we have all those leads so let
means component and when you say solve
like it means server component the way
we have applets which is app component
or application component right so
servlet which is your server component
resides all server it will run also and
the output will be on the client page
right so this solid will create a page
for you so when you send a request for
profile on HTML we would have that page
this servlet will create a page for you
again it will be written in Java and you
can connect with in a base as well you
can use JDBC there but this subject will
create a page for you and that page will
be coming from this our side to the
client side right so whenever you want
to create a dynamic page we normally use
solve let's now how exactly it works so
let's say let me just remove all this
stuff okay so let's say I have a HTML
page here in which I have two fields and
there is a button here that this says
submit so I say if I enter two and three
I want to add these two numbers when you
click on this button the quest goes to
so in your application in your web
server there will be a a solid okay now
this servlet says okay if you want to
call if you want to add two numbers
the request for a dot HTML and is
possible see we don't have that page
actually we don't have any page for this
address tml but we have a sublet let's
set the subnet name so this is your
solid with the name add solid dot Java
so again subnets are basically Java port
right so you have our Java code here and
inside that you have you your mapping
with add so add dot HTML and then this
code will have this will be normal Java
code ok you'll be having public public
class add sausage and then in this
definitely a method call is add again so
this two values will be coming into the
add method and then you will simply add
those two values and you can you can
perform the operations why it is that
simple it looks simple right but it's
not the problem is how can your client
knows which started to call again we
have a mapping here but still second
problem can be kittens are tightly by
using by using a normal class because
when you say solve let the request is
coming from the client machine on the
internet so you are responsible to fetch
the values now how do we do that
so normally what we do is to create
unnormal to create a servlet we have to
use certain different steps step one is
okay let's create our sovereignty on so
you have to say public then you have to
mention plus and then if you provide
class name ok we'll remove that so let's
say if a class name is an solvent now if
you want to pay the servlet then you
need to extend your class so you have to
say extends HTTP servlet
so that's compulsory okay so anyway you
want to create a class or anyone to get
a sublet you need to extend with a class
actually we solve it again be I mean we
have other option as well we can use
server interface we can use generic
servlet class all they can use it should
be sorted class here then you need to
open the condom pack is in close
brackets so if you want to perform any
operation within methods
right so she resolved Lexi's use our
method called as solvus okay so that
means whenever a client click on the
submit button it goes request goes to
this ad solid which we'll call service
method but this service method will have
two objects one one will be the request
object in which the data will be coming
from the client side to the server side
example these two values then the
response object using which you can send
it the data from the server side to the
client side this spawns right so we'll
be having request object and you will be
having response object okay again how
exactly to create those objects that
we'll see in the package implementation
so we have public class a public class
name then extends it should be salvaged
but how it be mapped so for mapping what
we do is you need to so this request
will use a file and that file is called
as web dot XML file now this part is
also called as deployment descriptor so
when you send a request request goes to
webbed XML file and this is your
deployment descriptor in which you have
to mention whenever a user is calling
for add dot HTML call you have to call
this omelette which is adds outlet so
you can do this mapping here again how
do you do this mapping diapers say in
the practical implementation but this is
our your map it so any other XML file
you have to mention this two things for
add dot HTML requesting it to call add
soffit add submit class which is this
one then the request will be going to
the servlet but who is as possible to
map all those things so to do all these
things so this should be a part of a
software or the application called as
Tomcat now again Tomcat is basically a
web container so this is not the only
web container we have we can use Tomcat
we can use GlassFish again grasp is AB
container but we can use GlassFish JBoss
ok we have lots of
curtains available this is one of the
best at least for learning purpose so
you have to install Tomcat in your
Eclipse so that you can use it so so
that's how it works if you want okay to
solve it that's how you create a servlet
and that's how it get mapped so just to
make a quick division what is servlet
solve it is a server component which is
responsible to create a dynamic content
okay and so client sense requires
request go to a servlet but with the
help of web / XML file we have to
provide this two entries and you have to
use a tomcat web container how exactly
it will be going the step by step
procedure how to execute all these
things that we will see saying in the
practical implementation which is the
next video so that's it thank you so
much for watching and do subscribe for
