political happenings
oh that's dead right in this video we
talk about how I make videos for YouTube
okay
so you can see we have a camera stand
here with an iPhone that's not mine
using my iPhone we are recording this
video so that's we have a tripod here
which is from Bendre I guess and then we
have we have an iPhone here so normally
when I record my videos I use an iPhone
here to record the videos and that's the
whiteboard very week where I will write
the things where I display those
animations right and then this is a very
small office so that's why you cannot
see everything in the earlier videos but
you can actually have a look when in
this video so we have a white board here
we have a tripod and for recording the
voice because in the videos voice is
very important right because if you
don't have a good voice maybe no one
will watch your videos so I use a mobile
phone in my pocket to record the voice
okay so I'm using Samsung as of now for
recording this video and I have a mic
which is from rod which is this rod
Apple okay not that costly so you can
you can buy this mic on the mobile app
the mobile microphone which is the
mobile mic you can also use that so
earlier I used to use this one I mean I
used to work with samsung microphone to
record my videos or voice so you can
also use a normal head phone to record
your voice but if you want to make it
more professional you can use this Lord
Apple all apple bike okay and then let
me show you something else so now we
have we have pooja here so pooja is a
animator so if you can see those amazing
animation in my video it's all because
of pooja so using this laptop she makes
all those videos right pooja so you can
see the EBI are making a video of
multi-threading here which has been
uploaded on YouTube I guess so this is
the making of that and yeah pooja so I
say something yeah hi guys you all I
just request
buying a new laptop look yeah we'll do
that visit we'll take an i7 machine for
her now next time and now we have
another cabin here which is for
developer so you can see we have two
developers here on a two shown up today
and these are my iOS developer you can
speak today because we are recording you
today so you wanna say something that's
it I can you see we are making our iOS
app for telesco so maybe after one or
two months we'll be having a iOS app
here but that's these that's my app
under process so can you see that so
that's that's the iOS app we are working
with and we also we I also got a coffee
from YouTube on that day when I went for
the boot camps and some be shown that
some your trophy okay so one of the
better weights is Ashwini when you say
hi she is deepali yeah so they are
working on iOS and they also do this tag
and description thing so if you watch my
videos in that we have some tags and
some description thanks to these people
okay and I got this trophy from YouTube
because I'm a content creator so I have
attended their two-day workshop because
that I got this trophy okay so now let's
say you want to make your own videos for
YouTube so let's say you want to you
want to be a youtuber so now there are
different types of videos on YouTube
right so we can we can create we can
create V blocks which is vlogs we can
also create interviews right so let's
say you are interested in talking about
yourself you want to explore your life
towards to the world you can broadcast
yourself using YouTube let's say you
want to take interviews of the people
famous people you can do that or you can
also make short documentaries what you
need is you do not have to buy a good
camera you don't have to buy a good mic
because that will cost with that that is
very costly right because if you talk
about the mics from rod and all those
stuff they have these shotgun mics it
cost you around I don't know maybe it
will cost around 1 lakh rupees right the
good mics so instead of that you can
actually buy this one which is rod label
or you can also use your mobile phones
mobile microphone
right that even that will do and you can
use a normal phone because initially if
you watch my old videos which is two
years back
I used to use this phone for recording
this is Samsung Note 2 okay it has only
eight a megapixel camera so if you have
a phone which is which has eight
megapixel camera and that is very enough
for youtube videos for now since I have
learnt from YouTube so I am investing on
on those my iPhone and all this stuff
okay now why today I am making this
video is because I am this is this is
29th April and it means two years for my
channel so this day 2014 I have started
my channel so it been two years now and
I got lots of subscribers thank you so
much for that and yeah that's it so if
you want to make videos you can start
your own YouTube channel with the help
of good mobile phone with a three same
eight megapixel camera and a good mobile
microphone so that is from this video if
you have any questions how to upload
videos on YouTube how to create channel

the comment section I will try to make
another video for that okay if you want
to be a youtuber so that's it thank you
