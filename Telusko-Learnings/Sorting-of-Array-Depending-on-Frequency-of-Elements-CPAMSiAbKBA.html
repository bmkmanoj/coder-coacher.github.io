steps which is we have done with the
first and second step now let's move
towards the third step and the third
step we have to sort this 2d array in
the descending order of the aquaeden
side so if it is example if it is three
here so it should for it it should be
the first row so we have to shift this
the whole row of words then we have to
keep it here and then this six comma two
will go up and this one one will come
down okay now how to do do that what
we'll do is
so first we'll say X plus plus because I
want to know the number of elements in
the number of rows in the 2d array okay
now how to sort what I will do is again
I will use a method called sort I will
pass a be here now B is not a single
dimensional array this is two
dimensional array right so we have
already created a method for the sort
which takes one single a missionary what
I will do is I will create one more
array which is a one more method which
will take two-dimensional array so we
say public static int which will return
me to dimensional array again and then
the method name will be sort which will
take int B B and then it will return B
once done now how posh arise how to sort
the whole row okay now for this what
we'll do is we have to apply some very
basic logic let us imagine if if this
were a normal array this is the first
row or this is the first element second
element third element and port and for
that image again we have to compare the
elements and then swap right that's how
we sort and this also what my to do is
we have to imagine in a third in the
same way but for this what we need to be
in a third variable so we'll sit say
we'll take a third variable but this is
not a normal element every element in
this array is an array what I mean by
that is every element in this ad
was an element or integer but every
element and this array is itself an
addict so this is the first element
second element third element and fourth
element so this itself is an array right
so what I will do I will say C of a see
black kid which is single dimension Eric
and the size of this array will be two
right because we have specifically two
elements so we have only two elements
now to swap this or to sort this will
use same logic of I which is I equal to
0 I less than X and I plus plus so X
will define the number of rows there we
require a for loop for J now so we'll
say int J equal to I are in the same
sorting technique we're applying here
which will go till X and J plus plus now
once you got this two for loops and it's
1 now to swap this it's very simple so
first we have to check if I want to
check depend upon this value right so
this we are going to compare this values
actually this values we need to compare
this values and this values are so these
are though is X or lowest I right and
this are my columns of posture column
number is 1 so to compare will say B of
I 1 if it is less than B of J of one and
that's an idea we have to swap if it is
true we have to swap now to swap we copy
that single row will copy this single
row in C so how to copy single row
bindings by spending index number so
this low is 1 this is o is 2 this is 3
this is 4 okay so what we'll do is we'll
get a greedy find
B of I V of I is equal to V of J and
then B of J is equal to C that's it now
if you run this code it will swap it
will sort it
it will sort your two-dimensional array
and you will be getting this output so
this is what we got now and now we are
remaining the last step is printing this
elements and printing elements is damn
simple what we need to do is to print
this we to come back to our main method
so by sorting this will be got this
sorted B which is two-dimensional array
but to print this we have to use a for
loop which will start with 0 and will go
to the number of ok in the number of
columns which is X and I will say I plus
plus now how to print it's very simple I
have to check this I have to print for
how many times 3 times I want to print 3
2 times I want to bring 6 2 times I want
to print 1 one time it's that simple so
for that we'll use again because you are
working with matrix we have to use one
more
instead of using J which is already
booked I guess or we can also use J here
not wrong okay let's let's use J so into
J equal to initially it will be 0 and
the value of J will be going to max B of
I comma 1 so because we want to check
this value so the number of this value
will define the number of printing right
and then we have to say J plus plus now
once you got this loop we just will say
as out will not use newline and will
print with a space will print B of I
comma 0 because we want to print this
value here depend upon this number we
have to put in this value right and
that's it this is our code but what we
want after need new line so we'll say
this is out that's it and we have done
with the code and let's run this and
boom so we got the output 3 force double
3 6 6 &amp;amp; 1
because so this is what we need to do to
sort the elements as per their frequency
cool again if you follow these steps so
if you if you want to go for a decaf
just go back to my first video we have
talked about the theory of it then go
for the second part we talked about the
first two step and the third part we
talked about the last two steps cool if
you still find it difficult I will
recommend you to learn single
dimensional two dimensional array and
sorting techniques so if you clever with
these three concepts this example is
damn easy cool so I hope you like this
video so if you liked it just do a
thumbs up there and do subscribe for the
further videos thank you so much for
