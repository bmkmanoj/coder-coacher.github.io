for people to join the session okay okay
so how many people are watching there so
three people are watching that's great
eight people are watching now okay
so 20 people are watching and only three
likes okay so my auntie will write
perfecter there everyone so the number
of likes is not matching with the number
of views come on
okay so let me just start this session
okay so this is not a QA session we are
going for a project so let's be without
wasting any other any extra time restore
this session but before the Antechinus
do some ancient setup I have shared this
link on each cube let me just check if
everything is for the okay roll down so
we got 45 people here just wait for one
minute we'll start in us in one minute
there so to say
and now we are public so okay so we got
46 vivos okay so great just hold on just
I'm doing some setup here and here we go
let me remove this window okay yes we
are going to build it the backend part
so that you share my screen with you so
that you can see what's happening okay
and I'm sure there are people who are
new to this session they are coming for
the first time so just to give you the
introduction what exactly we are doing
here is we are building a project so in
the last so this is the second the
coding second second session for life
coding in total we have done with these
four sessions the first two was the
theory part how exactly they're going to
do this and from last two sessions in
fact the last session and this session
we are going to design our feedback page
so just to show you how my feedback page
looks like so if I go to if you go to my
website which is pre build website which
is already built here and okay bye
okay so if I click on feedback okay
so if you see on feedback you can say
this is this is what you are we are we
were building here okay so so can we see
the last session yes you can so the
video for the last session is uploaded
on YouTube you can watch that video and
or6 says make a video on spring badge
okay let me just let me just add that in
my work least due to do tasks okay so
what do I do now is so let's complete
the project let's go back to my STL so
for software which we are using here is
STS and the framework which we are using
here is spring MVC bring a misty here
and here we go let me just go back here
everything seems perfect record index
page okay so what we were doing in the
last session is when I when I assigned a
request for the feedback page I mean
when I request for feedback page it
should it should call the feedback torch
ASB and I have created a design for
feedback feedback JSP okay let me check
if it's there so let me just I got a
mail here just just give me a second let
me open that feedback RJC page
okay so if I open this which turned on
okay so I got this page and one of our
members contribute this page and his
name I guess a little okay I guess the
name is does shit let me specify that so
this is the page which is given by our
one of the contributor again we can we
can do some changes and this this is the
basic design which is submitted by one
of the member okay so so this big white
page will well we will ask for the name
we'll ask for the email ID we'll ask for
the website
sure so this this is submitted by ocean
and I was watching this on online now
okay so mom if you know hibernate you
can start with spring as well okay so
you can see we got name we got email ID
and then we have done some addition as
well so example if I say Naveen Anthony
bloody as even idea but you can see it
says invalid email address so we have
done it I mean Russia has done some
validation for here for this and we say
gee Mel calm and then so feedback avoid
feedback what's our website feedback for
my name ice for my training and feedback
all course if feedback is for the
training for all the for the corporate
training we have to enter a code we'll
say once in a while that's my code and
then they have to give a feedback so we
can say any message here I was I will
type anything which you watch and you
can provide reading as well so let's say
if you say three star this something
will be you I so you can see if I say
three star of four star okay and if I
click on Sun right okay and you can see
the request goes to add feedback this is
what we want to do right so the quest is
going to add feedbacks what do I do now
is I will just copy that view here so I
will go to my downloads I would say
right like
open bet come on what is going so slow
let's stop sublime here and let copied
this just copy this all this beta and I
will put back in our JC page so I want a
JC page here which is called as feedback
dot JSP and you can see in s honestly we
have made inside the main behave a path
and inside this web app I'll be getting
a feedback feedback page we already have
that page here and let me just replace
this design which is there in built
there just replace this all this time
from here let's thing okay so let's see
if it is working or not
initially okay let's verify which is
working why we got L HTML that's weird
okay so let me run this code right click
and run as run on server I'll click on
finish bridge is yes if you have a basic
knowledge of Java you can start with
spring as well okay people who have just
joined this session we are making a live
project here we are building a project
using spring MVC so if you have to do
the session just click on the like
button if you want if you want if you
like join this ok so I will say I will
request for feedback dot JSP if I click
on grass you can see we call the
feedback P so whatever page you have
created
you got that page ok so we have there is
some problem of the design but that's
fine you can you can imagine this is
star 1 star this to start is 3 star so
you can see that's that's it's working
but okay so but putting is working you
can see we have a a a so if I select
this we got 3 star okay so if I enter my
name here I hope the evaluation is
walking here your valuation is working
everything is working fine
okay so we will try to write a code for
this so let's go back here and if you
want to write a code so now we got a UI
part okay so we have done with the UI
part let's go for the controller so this
is the place where you have to actually
fetch the values without multiple ways
of matching the values you can cite the
XS and the values here okay so the way
you can send the values is with the help
of liquid this special object okay so
now people who already knows you already
know sublets you know how to face the
values right so in sublets what we do is
we use request dispatcher to face the
values it's not liquid dispatcher we use
the quiz don't get parameter to face the
values right so we use liquid shortcut
parameter and in solids in spring spring
provides you or extra feature using
which you can fetch the values and that
feature is sure which I will also share
the design so I'm also thinking about
making a project on data for this for
sharing the codes okay so what I do now
first of all it is always a good
practice if anyone you want to have
anywhere you want to accept the values C
we have feedback rights of course since
we are working with Java we can create a
POJO for this now it is POJO Pocho
basically stands for plain old java
object so whatever data I am getting
here this data will be stored inside a
POJO object and the way you can do that
you can accept this the accept those
values is okay let's accept that Pujo
values data let's accept the first value
so first I will accept the name so I
will say string name and the next thing
I will accept here is email address I
will search string email and we have to
accept here is the website or will say
regarding feedback I will select which
is regarding and then we also need a
code will say string code and then we
need a feedback message so I will say
string message this is not this
not a live project on kochava this is
spring MVC which flip style kochava
concepts are you man
so we have we are fetching this four
values right here we are also fetching
the waiting so we'll say and ready
because we think we'll be ending is a
format but then how can you fresh the
values from the client page is it easy
is it that is it to face the values oh
we don't have to face the values here
this is feedback right it should be add
feedback oh I then I don't mistake here
it is for calling the feedback page not
for adding the feedback see for when you
send a request for when you send a
request for feedback dot HTM then we
should be calling this page okay this is
a DC page which we are calling and that
is done with the help of this method now
when I click on the submit button when I
click on the submit button it should
call and feedback to our JSP example you
find to my name if I enter the email id
something some anybody here and if I
enter for website no code and if I enter
the feedback and if I provide a greeting
when I click on submit okay this is what
we want so it will send a request to and
feedback we have to send all this values
there okay yeah we can also use post
here but just for time we will use for
time and we'll use get okay so what we
do is we'll create one more method Yahoo
is accept request I will say public
friend and we'll name is method as add
feedback does the method name I'm using
here again you can use any method name
but your method name should make sense
right in fact whenever you work with
feedback which is a good practice to
create a feedback controller so in soft
okay let's try to right click here let's
move will will move that later in a
different controller this is for add
feedback or h2
knowledge dear we are not using STM
there so let's say I'd feedback so when
you said add feedback this is the values
I have to set to add feedback so add
feedback will take all these values and
afterwards it will say it will bring a
beta which is we'll call a page and we
call that page as welcome to our JSP now
again we have not greatest created this
page here that we will be creating later
but the important thing is a user is
adding of feedback by passing all these
values right so what do you think the
values which is coming in the address
bar do you think these values will be
assigned to the variable correctly it
doesn't happen that way we have to use
some annotations to make it work the
first annotation okay the only nitrogen
you have to use here is request mapping
because mapping it is request Python and
this equation alarm will be coming with
a name so B beta which is coming in this
name attribute will be assigned to this
variable name you can see we are getting
name here right in the address bar if
you see we are getting a name the same
name value so this value will be
assigned to this name so to face the
value we use the quest by Ram now if you
if you are coming from sublet background
you know about okay so when you use
request but on what you get is you can I
defies the value inside let me use
request so you don't have to west your
number of lines doing that okay so we
can use the same thing everywhere so
just copy this code and let's paste it
here
okay will do for the issues as well and
this should be right I don't know these
are coming as a right so we got named
regard email then we got feedback option
oh this is not all like this is feedback
option what do we do is I will just
change the design I want to like there
so in this index magnetics page in this
feedback page the in the design where
you have feedback option will change
that to rag okay where is that okay so
the name is feedback option I will make
hit like oh is it this way let's make
both thing as right okay so we will be
getting right now know what feedback
option okay once we got back record we
got drag then we need code a request by
that will work of both get and post both
okay okay so we got dragged and then we
need a code and then we we need rating
Oh where's the message yeah message is
also there so you can see we got message
so yeah everything is coming and we have
to use this thing will say paste and let
this ask code this is code and this one
is message and this word would be
reading so it's a copy-paste and this is
reading okay and before continuing I
hope you are doing I hope you have you
are doing this project so how many of
you have done this on your machine after
tomorrow said yesterday session
okay I don't know something okay anyway
so yes we can also use request dot
getparameter wish all it's just that
using request by laminate see this is a
since we are using spring framework it
gives you that feature if you're using a
request dot getparameter you have to use
eight lines right so one line for name
one line for email one line for the
illustration one line for rating so you
will be wasting lots of lines it is
better to do in this way now once you've
got all the values I want to show these
values inside the inside the database
now normally when you one-to-many where
you want to store the data into database
we use certain layers and the layers
will be using here is it out layer so
what do I do here is in this controller
I mean regard this controls we got our
controller here right let me create a
doubt layer here so I click new let me
create a package or the just create a
class will in that my class itself will
measure the package I will right-click
and we say class now what is Dowell they
also the other is basically our layer
which deals with or which deals with a
database okay if you don't have HT is
down to this years people who are joined
just now you can click on the like
button if you like in this session
coming and going I don't I'm not getting
who is coming and I was going there no
no so uncle now will not create a driver
for us we have to create we have to use
a driver the Dow is just a extra class
we're using which you can enjoy with the
database because in future if you want
to change something you just have to
change the dowel rival name is as a
feedback Tao I want to keep this in
Thirsk dot tau so all my dau classes
will be inside now package okay
I will create a method for less public
and will say void and we say add
feedback okay I feel like this is the
method we should be using now how do you
send okay so first of all I got this
method and I will be writing all the
beta based code here but I have a
question here how can I send the values
from the controller to the feedback Tao
okay so first of all we have to get
object of feedback tau right because
that's how you can call the method so I
will say feedback tau we leave it as f
tau equals to new feedback now okay we
got the object of feedback down here and
okay I will simply call F tau dot add
feedback okay I'm just trying to call it
okay and in this feedback now just to
verify just just to verify it is getting
called and that's how you should go you
know you should be you should check even
a twitch each with each and every step
so we'll print here in add feedback okay
let's restart the server next one is
once again let's see what happens okay
and if i if i go back and if i refresh
this page with the same value spectrum
onsubmit Oh
if I click on submit oh we got an error
it says welcome to a JSP is not there
that's fine we told we had not get a
welcome to JSP here but you can see we
got the output as in add feedback so we
are getting that so we can see we have
reached to this point but then if you
can observe we are creating the object
here right and this is not a good
practice we should not create object by
ourselves when we are using Spring
Framework right so Spring Framework also
provide you a feature of dependency
injection so what
can actually do here is instead of
instead of using this concept we can
actually use spring dependency injection
which is spring coal how we can use that
just above your class okay before doing
that what I will do is instead of
cutting this object here I will just I
will just cut that part and I will
create object here it is always a good
practice to make your objects as
instance object so you can see all this
could be object outside the class I mean
outside the method inside the class and
you don't even have to use a new
keyboard because new keyword is not a
good practice to create object so we
simply use feedback dao and now will it
work grass is no this will not work
because we have not created the object
yet right
if you have not created the object and
just let me show you how what what what
problem you get here if it on this good
and if i go back and if i defense this
page and if i click on submit it will
say thank you but can you see that we
got an error the error is don't know if
you can see the error the error is null
pointer exception which means when you
when you don't create the object it will
give you a null pointer exception okay
so we have to make sure that you create
the object but we will not get the
object what do I do here is I will use
at the rate component
whenever you want object of a class just
use an equation for this I do it
confident and just about your object
just use auto wire and that's it you are
done with this the moment you say what
do I owe you are done say control space
auto wired any not solved okay so this
will automatically will create the
object you don't have to use a new
keyboard okay because new keyword will
create the object every time you don't
want that so you can ask spring to give
you that object so you can say Auto
wired and you just have to use component
so whatever the object you want just
right at elite confident on that and
whenever you want object
that just use auto wire anyway it is not
composite you can also use neo keyword
again so let me just do this once again
now and if i refresh this page refreshed
click on submit and you can see we have
not got that null point exception and
the in the output window we can see we
got in ad feedback so of course this is
better right instead of getting the
object by yourself we can ask Spring
Framework to give you the object I mean
there are lots of advantages of doing
this okay there are lots of advantages
of using spring cool first of all it by
default implements singleton design
pattern now people who don't know about
simple design patterns of design pattern
where the number of objects will be only
one object so using auto wire will save
your memory I forgot
according today I later started
recording so let me just repeat what you
have done till now so that if people are
watching this later they can table have
a recording now so let me just talk
about what we have done till now we have
so I am just created this feedback page
we tried our JSP and the design is
submitted by one of our member or one of
the contributor and the group and this
is the page which we which they have
created and the page looks something
like this
now this page so page looks something
like this when you have a feedback form
where you can enter all these details
when you click on the submit button it
will call add feedback so how get to
this page and I have pasted I have
written all this code in feedback dot JC
page now how do we call a feed by the JC
page in the index controller whenever a
request for feedback on it dot HTM you
will get feedback dot JSP and this is
the awesome thing you know as a normal
user you will see free back dot HTM at
the end but actually what is going on
the back end is dot JSP okay this is
what we have done and then we have also
added one more thing which is add
feedback here so you can see we have
added add feedback here the method this
is the method which will actually take
the request if you if you click on
submit by entering the feedback this is
the place this is the place where you
will wait it will it will accept all the
all the values so using you can accept
that with the help of request by Ram
okay so using refresh button you will
get name you will get email so request
parameters to press the data from the
client machine and then we are adding
data database so we can do that with the
help of Galileo so all your database
code can be can be written in this in
this class ok now I got some questions
here every query it's a new object or
okay so it will be one object will be
used by all the threads
yeah so it will be available in the
application layer so it will be
available for everything I mean we are
planning to use hibernate but then let's
see how it goes
nothing confirm how about Hibernians
but let's see we started we'll start
with JDBC and then if you think you know
that's the advantage of using a towel
layers in future even if you want to
implement hype at night you don't have
to change lots of code you just have to
change your dowels okay this is a point
so we got a point from which all what if
you get multiple requests because every
request will having to defend data right
and in total if you have only one object
then how can we use multiple different
data the the object of F now is only one
but then the values for every object of
feedback object I mean values are
different so this value will be stored
anywhere so okay so let's go ahead and
let's write data based code so we'll be
I need a database code inside feedback
doubter dot Java so this is your
feedback down here which is this one so
feedback now in at our package okay so
what do I do now is okay so how do you
how do you send all these values how do
you send all these values inside
feedback Dao so there is one way you can
pass all the values like this you can
say comma name email Rama you can pass
all the variables all the best way would
be to create objects coming to it first
of all to get a class classes as entity
classes so we're going to asked here and
the class name would say we say
feedback
oh I have forgot to change the package
so I want this in a package name which
is package arm dr. disco dust dot
entities have to make sure that you put
all your classes in entity package okay
so let's move back here
okay so what do I do here is I will quit
so in this feedback I want those
variables I will say private basically
we want to be able to make obtain so
this is private string name we say
private string
email will say private string regarding
is it is it regarding and private string
you know I'm thinking from next time I
will already make some codes and we'll
see the codes in the live session was
just taking like lots of time to type
everything is a live session so next
time we'll implement drag and for this
we need greater sectors will so right
like those getters and setters select
all okay so we got get us at us and also
need a constructor here in case if I
want to pass all the values in the
constructor so I will right click and
we'll say souls a constructor
okay soz constructor with all these
fields taken okay and you call the
constructor as well
okay so we got a constructor here so God
greater settles record a constructor now
what next so we'll go back here and okay
now so we got the feedback class I want
to put it on set of feedback class here
again we can use okay so we can use I
can get a bit of feedback so I would say
feedback let's say feedback but we just
have one issue here again we have we
should be using okay we have to put the
package first so second show space
they got feedback okay so we should be
using admitted component so if I say
under that component based one issue for
every four different people we have
given a different feedback object right
but then how can I use it here okay so
what I will do is I will change this
come off this okay how do you change how
do you estranged the scope of operant
okay so we have to use a scope and we
maintain the scope as rut right now the
advantage of using prototype is it will
create a different object for different
for different requests in one object for
for feedback right so every person will
have a different feedback so I'll just
make a prototype and here also will be
using a trait override what everyone
okay okay so now what we do here is
let's create our bit of feedback and I
will save oh we got an object Lloyd and
I want to assign this values so I will
say feedback oh I should be using
construct right here right because okay
let's let's not do it over here
well you will create the object by
ourselves because I want to achieve okay
let's not use that feedback there so we
create a new object because I want to
pass all this object I want to pass all
this values for myself so the name comma
email comma registration comma and then
we require a code and rating so it's a
code and ready we got the feedback our
big deal right and that feedback optic
will send in add feedback so what about
eita I am getting from the user will
will print will be sent acts here and
the same feedback we have to accept in
this I will say feedback FB but that's
not Facebook like us feedback control
space okay now just to verify if I'm
getting a proper feedback with this in
feedback
I will also print FB but then this will
print the hash code white I don't know I
don't know attach what I want to print I
want to print the data so Dom I also do
is I will implement the pushing method
so that I will get the data not the hash
code so when i click here and i will say
to shrink source to string and will
select all the values click on ok so we
got a two string method now and
everything should everything should work
now I'm printing that object here let's
restart the server
by the time you can share this video
with your friends on Facebook if you're
think it is helpful for them as well
okay so let me just enter when you see
oh I will say Naveen and I will use if
an ID as whatever week is available here
and then we this is for the online
course no code of enable or let me just
also mention the code I will say one
through four and then and then let's
message back the message with the
converse and we consummate okay so again
you will get you will not get the page
there but you can see in the feedback
and getting all these details right this
is what we wanted so we got all this
data in the feedback Tower now this is
the time to say this data in the
database again we can use hibernate here
what time it will not use hibernate or
we got one more suggestion instead of
instead of using all this thing we can
also use three just come in this part we
can also use more active attacks for the
same right so we'll use public string
and feedback so there is one more way
which is that in spring MVC which is
called as model attribute okay more
attribute and we have to use feedback
does it work here
maybe it will one battle cry
I guess what attribute to works with
springform or let's try let's try let's
enter and you got an error
Oh for this we have to provide our
default constructor so we also need a
different character here click feedback
and use let's use the default
constructor on some of the starch is it
happening there automatically yes
so it started yeah it does work let this
work so we can also use motor attribute
so the advantage of using pada attribute
is you don't have to write all this data
you can write it in one line so you can
simply use maharajah to route whatever
whatever data it is coming from the
request bag directly is that awesome
okay now we can also mention the name
here so that we can we can use it rated
as well so we can mention feedback so
that we can use it later and the module
scope in the session scope okay let's
try it is working let's say enter it
does work okay perfect so we got a
feedback and now it's time to store this
on database and to store this in a
database whatever I do is I will use a
database code but then uh okay so what I
want now I want you people to complete
this goal and send me the code using
using using JDBC I mean complete this
code and save the data into database
that will be assignment ok and that is
that is very easy right you can watch my
video on youtube how to save that in a
database what I want to do now is now
this is the code is very simple right
you can write it out database for you
and you can store the data in data bits
okay but now
so saga says we can avoid the parameters
I should say yes we can avoid the
parameters constructor okay so you want
my thing right but by tomorrow I want
you to submit this this code so the
unaddressed years make this project do
all the configuration and complete JDBC
and submit it by tomorrow you can use
git repository to share it okay now why
I am NOT comparing the code because I
want to do some important thing which is
more which is more important than
completing JDBC code the important thing
is what if you complete this module
because once the module is complete
which we'll be doing which will be done
by tomorrow of course where do we deploy
this and you even if you're completing
all this thing where to deploy this so
as we have planned that we'll be
deploying this on Google App Engine but
then we have not seen how to how to
install Google app I mean how to work
with Google App Engine right okay so
we've got a question on my notes why we
are not using a spring boot is because
and we are we are facing some issues
with spring boot on - on Google App
Engine
but once we figured out how to rectify
that we'll we'll use spring boot as well
we can also use that okay so what I do
is this now let's talk about how to
deploy this application on Google App
Engine so we know how to complete this
code and now you also know how to do
this right everyone just say yes if you
agree with me you complete you this code
is now very easy you can just simply use
adb Sikora it will be done right okay
okay so now let's see how to create a
Google App Engine account so we'll
create a Google App Engine account with
my with my email id which we are using
for this for the humanity which we are
using which is that is coli project so I
will open my chrome here my Chrome and
in this Chrome I will say or let me use
Firefox because I already have so many
accounts on Chrome
I will go to Google office Google
website it is Google App Engine so just
go to Google and search for Google App
Engine if you want to use Google app
here okay so just go to Google App
Engine so you got a question from shape
how how spring bootie differs from
spring MVC making spring boot project is
actually very easy you do not have to do
lots of configuration and let me repeat
if you are joining this session now if
you have just joined this session do
click on the like button every one so
that I will know that you like this
session okay so okay so I already have
my account here I will just change it to
a school I project so many one you want
to go to okay if you want to create a
Google App Engine account just go to
google search for Google App Engine on
browser and it will take you to the
Google cloud platform okay and it will
ask you for the login whatever gmail
account you have you can do that
whichever gmail account you have okay so
I'm using that is coli project as my
email account here now once you login
you can create a project here you can
click on the start language and you can
click on Java it will give you a Java
project but then I want to I want to
link my Eclipse with top with this
Google App Engine right now how do we do
that so the way you can do that is first
of all we have to okay now Google App
Engine is free for 12 months you can see
Google App Engine is free for 12 months
and body for it will give you 300
dollars of credit so if you are using
any of the service which will which is a
paid service
you can use it for $300 okay now since
it is free I will click on the sign up
for free trial
okay and it will ask you some basic
questions let's ignore that and depend
upon which country you live in
so you can select whatever country you
live in I mean India now so I will
select India and then I would say I
don't want any special offers and I'm
accepting all the terms and conditions
even if I don't agree with that and this
is awesome you know there is no auto
charge after three trial ends even if
you are providing your credit card
details they will not charge you even if
you are crossing the limits so you click
on I agree and continue
okay so it will ask you for some details
it will ask you for the account type you
have to mention individual or business
and then you have to mention the project
name you have to mention the address the
city the postal code because they they
might come to your home to give you a
gift right and okay so now they will ask
you for the credit card details you have
20 upgrade packages here okay and you
can ask for anyone for credit credit is
and once it is done you can click on the
start my free trial okay now once you do
that Google App Engine will give you the
platform but then once you got the
platform once you got the account how do
you link your eclipse with this because
that is important right how can you be
linked with our STS will be Google App
Engine so for that you have to go to
hell and you have to go to actives
marketplace where you have to mention
again the active marketplace you have to
you have to search for Google App Engine
like some time to search ok so you can
see we got Google App Engine you have to
install this plugin so you have to
install this particular plugin so if I
click on install button it will take
some time for the installation ok and
you don't have a choice you have to
accept your except in terms and
conditions the confidence
downloading you can imagine how slow my
internet is so let me just make it run
in background so that we can continue
with the thing Oh what is that oh we
have to restart our STS Leslie Connie
yes we don't have a choice we have to
restart the STS
okay so when you restart you can see we
have an option here of creating our
project but then you can do I think a
not even if you create a project you
have to make sure that you also deploy
this on the server right so this is the
option you using which you can deploy so
even before creating a project and
deploying it on this server what you
have into us you have to click on manage
Google accounts and you can see I
already have an account here so you can
if you if it is not there you have to I
don't account you have to click on add
account you have to provide your
username details here I will not do that
okay so I want you have an account I
will use that particular account here I
will use that is for training as the
account so you can see I would do you
have an account okay once you have an
account you have to create a project you
have to say a mavin based Google App
Engine product a project and okay say is
Google SDK is required but cannot be
found that means you have to also
install Google Cloud SDK now how to do
that and that will see if I will make a
video on this how to install a Google
Cloud SDK
maybe maybe today or tomorrow I will
upload this video and you can watch this
video and you will know how to install
Google cloud in fact I already have
Google car even in this machine okay I
guess I have not done be the setup here
okay I want to have a Google SDK
installed let me check see okay we do
have Google SDK oh but I have configured
for the desktop one
it is working so Google SDK is accepted
so I will make a video on how to install
google eyes how to install Google out
SDK you have to make sure that you do
have Google Cloud SDK in your machine
I can ask you about the group ID I will
say conduct a disco and the IP fact ID
is task one right will create a new
project ok and you have to make sure
that you copy all the complications from
your project to this project what we
need here nothing we just need a package
ok let's select this one Google App
Engine API and click on next and finish
it will give you a basic project which
you have to replace
because I guess I have asked you for
your name in the last live session you
have not given your name you have a two
different names here so you can I we can
see big balls about that how do I know
your facebook name okay and you have to
convert this project into spring MVC now
how we can do that we can add this bring
configuration we can add a spring
dependencies here and you know how to do
that while so we have that in this first
session you have to convert this project
and if you make any changes in this you
just have to click on this click on this
link and say deploy the moment you say
deploy the the project will be deployed
on the Google App Engine the project has
some errors that's why it's not about it
right
well now after solving this you can do
that so now we have seen how to create a
Google App Engine project and then we
have also seen the problem here as it is
not able to connect a tomcat
okay either gone or not or dumbbells not
started yet
there are some others okay it was
because of Tom Cal but now I have linked
a target here which not yet linked let's
see the properties once again the Tomcat
is lent
now you can see where the spiders are
gone now what you do is you have to copy
all this thing from tusks and you have
to paste that in task one and that's how
you can configure this project with the
VD project which we have done till now
and once you do this just have to click
on this and say deploy to App Engine and
this will be deployed so you have to
deploy okay this is the Asya project
we'll go for a new project first of all
you have to get a project there right
and then you can do it again how to do
that once we complete the project so
tomorrow we'll tomorrow we'll copy all
this thing in this first one will make
these changes and we'll deploy this on
the App Google App Engine and you'll be
having the first project deployed so
that's it we have done with the section
four where we have still not complete
the code you have to complete this
feedback page by tomorrow but it's
taking more time then I have assumed it
is taking one a session is not getting
it up I guess we have to dot you have to
go for two or three hour session
tomorrow I don't know how many of you
watch it if you if you go for two or
three-hour sessions so you have to make
sure that you send a JDBC code by
tomorrow yes I was ready design on the
Facebook group so do share this
with your friends guys let them know

Facebook and use a hashtag called as
hashtag is po and if you want to be a
