private resources now if you look at
this code here I mean we have it don't
try and then we try either we need
catch-all beneath finally I'd example if
I the move catch it will work because we
do have finally with that but if I they
move finally you can see tries not
working right try says other it needs a
finally block odd catch block so let's
talk about finalists let's say we are
not using try we are not using catch
block because our intention here is not
to handle the exception our intention
here is just to close the resource so
when you say a try block for this code
here we are not handling the exception
our only focus here is to close the
resources so just to close these sources
even if you get an exception here it
will make sure that your resources
getting closed if I print something if I
say closed and if I run this code and if
I say some weird number you can say when
you are getting an exception it is
saying closed that means it is closing
your resources and that it was it is
giving you some exception the thing is
when you talk about try and final block
here it is only to close the resource
right so in the new version of Java
which is 1.7 it is not compulsory for
you to write when a block what you can
do is instead of using this syntax what
you can do is inside try block you can
give around brackets and you can define
this object there itself now what is the
advantage of this earth in fact you have
to also mention book for reader now if
you do this there you don't have to use
finite block so as soon as your object
goes out of scope it will close the
resource automatically so as soon as
your object has done its work it will
close this source even if you are
getting an exception here it will close
the source automatically okay so I fire
them if I say 97 we got the output so we
can write a try block without using a
cache block or without using fire block
we can do this with the help of this
syntax and this syntax is called as try
with the source so that's it about this
video we have seen
how to use private the source and the
next video we'll talk about try to
create a one on my own exception</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
