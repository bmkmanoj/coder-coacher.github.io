we have talked about collection and
generics right so in that we have seen
how to work with collection how to add
values into collection the problem is
that relation is an interface and then
we have to use LEDs to work with
interface and we have seen how to use
iterator we have seen how to use an
ounce for loop to face the values but
there was one problem in the earlier
video the problem was let's say if I
want to so if we have done with remove
right so let's say if I want to add
element so if I say values dot add and
if I add a element which is nine and if
I run this code the output is nine will
be seen the last so it will be at the
Android what I want I want to show this
nine after three so we need to add nine
after three so we need to specify the
index number right so if can I say one
comma nine and the answer is no because
collection interface does not work with
index numbers so if you go to your
definition of collection interface you
can see it doesn't mention anything
colors index number anywhere right you
can you can search the whole document
you will not find anything what does
index number there so what we can do is
in show off using collection we can use
something as least because least user
interface okay so from Java util so
least is the interface which extends
collection which means least we'll have
extra features okay which is not then
collection and in this you will be
having a extra thing called a soak let
me show that so you can see we have one
add method which takes one parameter and
then we have one more add is that add it
will be there somewhere okay we
searching for that okay so we have one
more add here which will add the element
in between right so we can specify the
index number and we can add the element
so we can simply say one common line and
you can see there is no error and the
awesome thing is this eldest class
itself implements this interface which
is
right at least extends collections
indirectly at least implements
collection and Isis also implements
least right so we can use lists to add
the elements now for on this code you
can see we got the output so we are
getting 3 9 77 and 88 right so let me
just go back to collection once again
okay just for the demo demonstration so
have a collection here so of course we
cannot use this thing but let's say if I
add 7 element in this way if I say
values dot add and let me specify let me
specify a value which is 99 and then we
have one more let's say values dot add
and we'll mention here too and if I run
this code we will be getting all this
output as 3 99 77 2 and 88 right because
least or collection they maintain the
sequence so they maintain the say the
sequence of the insertion but let's say
I want to sort this elements as per the
number so what we can do is we can say
collections so there's an interface
course there's a class plus collection
in which you have ethical as sort so
will say sort and we can pass the object
of collection here so we can say values
right and there is an issue so if you go
to sort it says the method sort only
takes list it does not support
collection so that is the problem with
collection interface you cannot add
values in between
that means it doesn't work with indexes
and that's why we cannot even sort the
items because we don't have indexes and
that is why we need to use list so when
you want to create a simple collection
always go for collection interface but
let's say if you want to achieve this
thing of adding values in between you
want to achieve sorting of elements
always use list and that is what list is
so popular amongst the developer they
always tend to use list interface
instead of using collection interface so
you can see we got the elements sorted
in sorted format right so we can sort
the elements if you have the Laois
interface now there are lots of methods
we can use from this interface we can
say value start so there are lots of
methods we can use we can also use
get so this time we don't have to use an
ounce further we can directly use our
methods get which is which was not there
inside collection interface we can use
methods like nothing else nothing else
so that's how we can there are lots of
methods but this is what we require in
the code right - on this code we got two
three seven seven eight eight and nine
nine right so this is how you print the
elements but it is not just the only way
of printing right we have one more way
of printing the element so let's me let
me just come in this part and let's
print those elements after sorting let
me print the element so what I will do I
will say values dot a for each I will
say system dot out colon colon print Ln
so you can see in off using iterator
measure of using ants for that we can
simply say values dot for each system
dot out
colon colon print alone if I run this
code and we caught the output awesome
right now your question will be how it
works so let me give you a hint here so
this is a stream API
oh okay which uses which uses lambda
expression so it was used it was
introduced in jar 1.8 so if you are
trying this code inside jar 1.7 it will
not work so using this also you can
print the values from the collection or
the least now question arises how it
actually works what is for each what is
that double color operator that is a
different topic so if you want to know
about this stuff you can watch the next
video which is a which is your least and
which is your lambda expression and
stream API okay which is very important
for this thing so yeah so do wait for
the next next video thanks so much for
watching and to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
