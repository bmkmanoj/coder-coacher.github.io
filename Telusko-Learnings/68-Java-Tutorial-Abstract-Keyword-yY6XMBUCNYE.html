abstract keyboard so we can use abstract
in the class and abstract in the method
so we talked about this concept of
abstract class on abstract methods we
have to understand I mean what exactly
it is and why to use it so in this video
we'll talk about what it is and in the
next video we'll talk about how to use
it so what exactly abstract class is so
to define that let me create a class
here I will name this class as human and
let's say in this class we have a method
called as eat then we have some method
like public void walk let's imagine we
have two methods and if I create object
of human if I say human obj equal to new
human and now I can call those methods
right but as you can see I don't have
any implementation for this here I just
have defined those methods and nothing
under it so why do we need abstract
class so let's say if you have a class
you don't want anyone to create object
of this class I mean this class is
basically built so that in future
someone will extend this class I mean I
don't want to create object of human
let's say there's another class called
as let's say men so class men extends
human right or class women extends human
so this human class is basically created
is just two so that in future someone
will extend this class so I don't want
anyone to create object of human
directly so that's why we can make this
class as abstract because as you can see
if you make a class abstract you cannot
create the object of it and you can see
we are getting an error here which says
cannot instantiate the type human so
once you make your class abstract that
means no one can create object of it I
mean it you cannot instantiate the class
human okay so when you make a class
abstract you cannot create the object of
it
that's one let's say I don't want to
define this method okay if you can also
declare methods so instead of defining
methods you can also declare methods and
we can name this as abstract again why
to do that why anyone will declare a
method as a different thing right but
let's say if you want to
declare a method you can create an
abstract method so you can see abstract
and you can write the method name again
you cannot do that without a strict key
but if you remove that you can see you
are getting an error because when you
declare a method it is compulsory for
you to write abstract keyword there so
this method here will be called as
abstract method and whenever you have an
abstract within your class it is
compulsory for your class to be called
as abstract class as you can see if I if
I see this you're getting an error here
it says type human-machine abstract
class define abstract methods because if
you have an abstract method in your
class your class should be abstract okay
so it should be abstract so point
remember whenever you have abstract
method in your class your class need to
be an abstract class and I mean it is
not compulsory to have an abstract
method to create an abstract class but
if you have the abstract method you need
your class to be abstract so you can use
abstract keyword with class and with
methods so this is abstract method and
this is abstract class you cannot
instantiate the abstract class so we
have talked about how to use abstract
keyword but let's say I want to create
an object of it so what we can do is we
can create a class called as men and a
man let's say man and which extends
human okay so we have this class man
which extends human and in this class it
is compulsory for me so if you if if
your class extends abstract class it is
compulsory for you to define it so you
have to define that method here will say
public void eat it is composite to
define if you fail to do that as you can
see if you if you don't write this thing
it will give you error there which says
that this abstract method is abstract
here when you when you extend an
abstract class it is compulsory for you
to define it if you fail to do that your
class will also become abstract class
and now I cannot create object of human
right you can see that but I can create
object of man so I can create a
reference of human so there's no problem
in creating the reference of human but
when it comes to the object we need to
use man okay so we have human reference
and we have man so even if you are if
you're a man you I can refer you as
human even if you are a women I can
I can refer you with human right both
are humans right so we can refer the
object with human but the actual object
is man I hope you're getting the stuff
here so we're only talking about how to
use it I mean why exactly we need that
we'll see in the next video
so point remember when you don't want to
define the method you can make it
abstract and if you have any abstract
method in your in your class that class
need to be abstract
whenever the class extends abstract
class way to make sure that we are
implementing that method again we don't
have to touch a walk method because it
is already defined but it is something
we have to do have to define right so it
is declared here we have it defined here
and then we can create the object of
human like this we can say human obj
equal to new man we can create a
reference of abstract class and we can
create object of the main class and this
class via man class is called as
concrete class so human class is
abstract class and human and man classes
correspond to class so that's it that's
it that's how you use abstract in the
next video we'll see why do we need
abstract class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
