scanf will remove this for time being
and let's focus on different operators
in C now we talk about operators you
have automatic operators you have
logical operators and you have register
operators so to start with the ultimate
echo operators so what we'll do is we
will use these three variables int I J
and K and let's first do the addition
operator so whenever you want to do
addition operator so for addition we
need to use our operator which is called
as plus so plus is for addition operator
and when you print the value you will be
getting addition which is 17 now let's
do one more operation which is K equal
to so let's say you want to subtract two
numbers and I forgot to give the initial
values so let's provide initial values
so initial value for I is nine and J is
three okay so when you say nine plus 3
you will get 12 so when I when I run
this I will get 12 let's do one more
operation now once we have printed we
don't want the the last value of K so
we'll replace it so we'll say I minus J
so which is it will give you the
subtraction so let me use the co of so
let's reuse the code here and if I print
instead of addition will say subtraction
okay now next we will be doing is I
equal just K equal to I into J so when
you want to when you want to multiply so
you have to use this hash trick sign
which is star and again will print and
will say multi-location of this two and
the last one is which is K equal to I
divided by J so anyone would say you
want to do by two values we have to use
slash unfortunately we don't have any
symbol of divide in keyboard that's why
we use slash and we'll say this is
division so that's why we that's how you
use a automatic operators let's run this
so you will be getting this output here
so addition of nine and three is twelve
line and subtraction 9 minus 3 is 6
multiplication 9
three is 27 and 9 divided by 3 is 3
right so this is how we have to use
arithmetic operator so in the next video
we'll talk about different types of
operators so that's it thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
