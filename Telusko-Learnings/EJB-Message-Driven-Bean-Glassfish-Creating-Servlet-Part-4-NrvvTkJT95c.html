we need is we need to create a JSP page
using which I will send a name so for
that you have to go to your VAT logic so
this van is your web archive and this is
your R which is enterprise archive so
click on your bar and go to your web
pages so you can see we'll be finding a
St ml page when we can use this channel
here so instead of getting JSP we can go
for HTML so we'll use the provided
inbuilt HTML let's say let's remove all
the extra tags is to make it simple
I hate those all this extremal tags so
let's create a form tag and in this form
tag what I will do is I will call action
and we'll call a servlet and will name
that servlet as my servlet and we'll ask
a user to enter enter your name give a
colon and we'll use a text box here so
we'll say input type text we'll ask for
name which is t1 that's it and we'll
provide a break here once this break
we'll go for input type next is submit
so we'll use the submit here and we'll
give a value as ok I will use proper
send so once you click on send it will
call this solid which is my solid simple
now once done with this step now wait to
get a sublet so I click on your project
and click on servlet will give this
servlet name as my sublet and package
name will go for blank click on next
I don't need to include into web tour
XML I will go for an annotation based
servlet here let me remove all the extra
things which is there just to make it
more simple I will even say
of all this thing even this part will do
mister we'll start from scratch so what
will what we need is public void to get
as we know that the object I'm and the
request I'm going for is get requests so
the first thing I should appease so that
request will say req , then next year
the should EP servlet response this is
our es okay now let's see what next
so once you got this you need a title
object so for tighter what I will do is
I will I know it's - it will throw some
others will say throws servlet exception
comma IO exception no ok we go for try
catch that will be better because I'll
be adding some code in which in which I
will be using try cut so why not start
with try catch only now in this try
catch what I need is first thing I need
a catch also say catch exception e now
so we have a try catch so let's go with
try bring the catch state me which is e
now in this try first step is we need to
create the object of printwriter so
we'll say print right out equal to r e s
start get writer next will print some
data to the user will say println and
we'll say this is demo okay so this is
how way to get a servlet right but hold
on are we done with our work now we have
to achieve we need to send that theme to
my JMS server so in order to send that
name to the GMs server we need to add
some statements now what exactly those
statements are that we'll see in the
next part but i hope you remember this
thing which is
if you remember this vpt so we need to
achieve this step in to create a
connection factory object we need to
create a connection object then we need
to create this session message for you
sir I don't have to sign okay so to
achieve that that we'll see in the next
