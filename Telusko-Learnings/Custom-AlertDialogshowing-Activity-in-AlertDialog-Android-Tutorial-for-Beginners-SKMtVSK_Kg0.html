reading from today's colonics and in
this video we'll continue with the
example of a load dialog so what we
expecting from this video is so let's
see if I click on this show button it
will show my name if I click on this
show but I until show my account number
and if I cloak if I click on this show
earlier we were getting a prompt are you
sure but let's say if I'm using my
application I want to so if I I want to
make sure that only I will use that only
I can show I can see the balance not
everyone else so what we'll do is we'll
ask the user to enter his username and
password if user in passwords right then
if you click on this login button it
will show you the password otherwise or
it will show you the balance otherwise
it will not show the balance it will
show some other balance example in my
account let's say if I have five
thousand so what I will do I will login
with my username and password so what
I'm checking here if username and
password same so Nevin is now in an
average is my username password if I
click on this login button so if I click
on this dog eight-point button it shows
my password but let's say in case of if
user enters our wrong data ok so let's
say this this this thing doesn't match
and if I click on login so it will show
the balance as hundred so the main
intention of this video is to show you
how to show an activity as well as a
dialog color dialog so you can see we
have an activity here right so let's see
how to do that in this example ok so so
before starting with us let me do some
let me show you something so I have
already created our activity here and in
this activity I just created to edit
text which is username and password
nothing else no buttons as you can see
we just have username and password right
and for this XML we also have a Java
file but we are not doing anything in
the Java file so it will be not using
that so the in total will be using only
three files the first one will be the
XML of main which is this this is what
we have created in the last video we
have created two main for this and
the XML for username and password okay
so we want to include this one into your
activity but how to create this activity
so what I have done I have created a
blank activity in which I have added
edit to edit text
quite simple right we have already done
this in many of the videos but there is
some change I don't want to create an
activity which will cover the whole page
I want to create an activity which will
take some small size so I have made sure
that I am using a linear layout in which
I have set I've specified the layout
width as 300 DP and height also 300 DP
you can change it according to your need
here and yeah so that's your XML which
is which will be shown on the other
activity so let's get back to the main
now in earlier video we have used
builder design pattern right so we have
seen how to use build a design pattern
so if you are still not clear with that
I would recommend you to watch my video
you don't have to do much you just have
to go to Google or your general you just
have to go to youtube and search for
builder design pattern in Java and you
can just mention that my channel image
is the disco so that's the video you
have to watch okay so that's one video
the first video on the second video okay
so first you have to was the theory
which will take your 5 minutes and then
it detectable which will take your 8
minutes so this is not just 13 minutes
it will it's what it's worth watching ok
we understand how how it is a design
pattern works ok so yeah so now come
back to this so we have so what have
done here so this is what we have done
in the other video right so let me just
make some changes here so whatever
changes I will make the first change
what I want here is let me not set the
value here okay what I will do I will
just cut this part the whole part ok oh
ok let me just cut it here what I will
do is set everything
after the builder objects crater so once
we got the builder object later we'll
say build oh ok so it is built out dot
and then we'll assign all those things
so we have to say set message so built
outside message
said positive button all the stuff right
okay so on this thing we don't want if
we want to show any message okay so
we'll see we will show a message the
message is not are you sure the message
is login right so you want to show login
there and what next we want to change
the positive button too okay what will
set the positive button we'll say okay
the positive button is all so let's say
this message has login here and we'll
set the positive button is login and the
negative button we'll keep it canceled
for this example and I'm also using set
cancelable false which means if I click
outside it will not it will not cancel
the dialog okay so what other things
require here so once you click on this
positive button wattage what should
happen is it should call the Act it
should call the view right but to do
that we have to first set the view so
once you set the message which also set
the view so we'll say set view now what
we have to set here so it is asking for
the object of view but unfortunately we
not we have not created in view right
because it is not a normal dialog box or
it is not a normal other dialog it's a
other dialog which will show an activity
for that we have to first create object
of view so we'll save you V equal to now
here we have to include or fill our
dialog box with a view right so we want
to feel our but fill we have to fill our
dialog or with the help of this activity
right for that now we use is inflate
okay so inflate means feel so we have to
use a term called as inflate which means
feel which means fill okay now how to do
that so to use inflate we have to use
layout in filter which has a method so
on which activity so we have to mention
it isn't on the main activity have to
include that activity so it will say
main activity dot this then we have to
mention then what we have to mention
what we have to inflate so we have to
say inflict you need to include this
this alert this this view okay now to do
that we just have to mention the first
parameter as the view name itself so we
have to say
dot layout dot activity demo alert so
that's my real name and then we have to
mention null because what was the
parameter there we just checked okay let
me just
when you fight once again so it's asking
for two parameters from not wrong so it
asks okay so let me say once again it
say okay so it asked for two parameters
one is the resource name which is r dot
layout dot demo alert it is also asking
for the view group and unfortunately or
fortunately we don't have any view group
here so we'll mention it null so we say
inflate the second parameter is of
course null and the first parameter is
odd dot okay it's our dot or what's
happening you
so it's r dot layout dot activity I'll
demo other oiseau does the activity we
have to show here okay we V is already
booked so we'll take view and here
instead we will pass that V object
okay so we have set the message and then
we are setting the view so after setting
the view we are setting the view we are
setting the positive button and negative
button so the other dialog should show
should show the message after the login
right so once if you call this login
button which is there so once you click
on this login button what it should do
is it should it should check the user
name and password right now to do that
what we have to mention is we have to
first take those two variables which is
entered by the user
so we'll say okay before that we need to
do some more things the problem is we
have to provide the object for username
password right so for that we'll go here
and the we can do inside this click
itself so here we'll create the object
of username and password so we'll say
edit text and we'll say this is username
which will be entered from the user
well the I hope you know the object
nation right so we'll say find view by
ID and here we have to mention it as r
dot ID dot username okay now we need to
create this
after the view it's because this the
username is not inside your main
activity IDs it is inside activate demo
alert so we cannot say fine view by ID
we have to save you this object view
then fight find view by ID because this
user name belongs to activity demo alert
right in the same way we have to create
the second one which is for password so
we'll say instead of username we'll set
the password and we'll change this to
password right now once we have done
that we once we got these two values
let's fetch the values from that so
we'll say string u so we can have any
any variable name right so I'm
specifying string u equal to we'll say
username so that's username so how we
need to fetch the value right so we have
to say username dot gate text dot to
string so once we got the username let's
fetch the password we'll say P that is
password dot get text dot to string now
once we got username password now we
have to verify the username password so
we'll say if if use u dot equals if it
is equal to Naveen and so we have to
apply and and P dot equals if the
password is let's say let's say this is
o o or zero zero four zeros so user name
is Naveen and password is four zeros if
that is the case then only you have to
display balance as 5000 otherwise you
can fool the other user we can say else
txt will not show any you a different or
invalid login or something which will
just show the different data let's say
hundred rupees or gives me we have five
thousand or hundred okay so that's a
simple right let's try it out let's see
if it is working or not and lets me run
this code on the emulator so it will
take some time to load let me just pause
the video for the time so it's opening
it will take some time to load again and
okay come up come up okay so we got our
layout here so let's click on show or
it's working economy is working as
click on this show but it is asking for
the username password let me enter
Naveen and the password is four zeros
and if I click on this login button it
shows the balance right and if I again
do something else if I enter some
invalid username and password so you can
see it is not showing any error it is
just showing a wrong balance so that's
how we can include the activity on as an
allowed dialogue so yeah that's it from
this video and the next video will talk
about some different views so thank you
so much for watching if you have any
doubts any comments just comment in the
comment section and see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
