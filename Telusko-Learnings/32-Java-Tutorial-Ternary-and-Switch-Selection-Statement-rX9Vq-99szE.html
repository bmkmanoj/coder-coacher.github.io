so now once we know how to work with
if-else let's talk about ternary
operator so let's say you have a
variable which is int I and the value of
I is H and you have one more variable
which is in J initially the value of J
is zero and now what am I do is I'm
going to check if the value of I is
greater than 6
if this is the case I want to assign the
value of J as one else I'll assign the
value of j s2 so if your value is
greater than 6 which it which it is then
the value of J will be assigned as one
otherwise the value of J would be
assigned as 2 and if I try to print the
value of J here and if I run this code
of course the value of J would be 1
right because the value of I is H which
is greater than 6 so the value of J will
be assigned as 1 and that's you are
printing here just to assign a value to
J based on the value of i we are writing
four lines of code right so we can
replace this code with only one line
with their popped under your operator so
exactly it looks like so totally
operator looks like this so we have to
use a question mark and a colon so how
it works so we have the condition if
that condition okay I'm giving the
example for this if that condition is
true then it will execute expression 1
if this is false if the condition is
false it will execute expression 2 so if
this condition is true it will execute
expression 1 if that condition is false
it will execute expression 2 so let's
write that here so ultimately what I
would do is I want to assign the value
of J right now the J value can be
assigned as 1 or 2 based on the value of
I so I can simply say if I is greater
than 6 if that is the case question mark
I want to assign the value as 1 or I
want to assign the value as 2 so you can
write you can write this if else in this
one line with the help of ternary
operator so we use caution mark and
colon operator here to assign that value
and if I come in this part if I
recommend this if else and if I am this
code you can see we got one if I change
this value to 5 so my Y value is 5 now
and if I on this code you can see we got
two so that's how you use ternary
operator in java
so once you have done with if-else and
ternary and let me add an example to
demonstrate the next topic which is
switch so the example is let's say we
have a number and let's say the value of
n so we have a variable N and the value
for n is 4 now in this case when your
value is number 4 you have to print that
number 4 in a Word format okay that's
the way typical example which we take
when it comes to switch case
now when you say n equal to 4 so if we
have to print if it is for will print in
double quotes will print 4 and if that
value is 3 we'll Planetree when your
value is this let's let's start with 1 2
7 that's it or not 31 7 let's go for 1 2
5 so if I pass the value as 1 it should
print oh and E 1 if I pass - it should
it should plain - if I pass 3 it should
print 3 so for that what we do is for
sure we need those four statements
alright we need so let's me just copy
paste the code here so this is not 4 but
this is 1 and this should be 5 if I a
value is let's say 1 I want to print 1
if I value is 3 I want to play in this 3
not other statements now in this
scenario what we can do is we can check
with the help of if-else right so you
can say if n is equal to equal to 1
that's how you compare two things right
with your double equal tools if it is 1
then we'll print this statement which is
system to order printer is 1 then we say
if else if else n is equal to equal to 2
in that scenario made to print this
statement and then if you have as safe
again which is n equal is equal to 2 or
3 and then you have to print this one
and for for this one and then if nothing
of this matches will go for else part 4
5 we can do that right but instead of
doing this by yourself what you can do
is there is one more thing called as
switch block so we can write switch and
inside this switch you can pass a number
which is N and since it's a block will
write a block here and instead of
writing F will write a case if case is 1
if your value is 1 then this will get
executed and if your value is 2 so it's
a case - this will get executed we'll
say for K is 3 this will get executed I
mean this 3 statement or the third
statement here then we'll go for K is 4
will execute this part and you have to
use a colon at the end and we'll say
case five I want to execute this part
everything seems good right and if I say
five now and you can see it will skip
all different cases it will taxi jump to
five it's because when you pass five it
will go here it will check okay one is
not matching with five two is not
matching with five three is not matching
with five four is not matching here five
is matching that means we'll print this
block and if I done this code you can
say we got five so problem solved right
so we got five there there is then one
more thing of ice type three now it
should print three right but if I lie on
this code you can say it is printing
three four and five it is printing
everything now why is that the case why
it is able to print all the statements
it's because when you say when you're
passing three it matches with one not
matching with my choice try to matches
with two not matching as soon as your
three matches it will execute this block
and subsequently it will execute all the
remaining statements so after three it
will execute four and five also and
that's not what we want right so what
we'll do here is after each case will
simply say break because if your case
matches we need to end this statement
and how to end the block by using a
break statement so what this break
statement will do is it will likely jump
off the art of the switch will write a
break here and will reach a break here
and I've run this if you type plea you
can see we got the output only as three
not other statement so we have to make
sure that in your case we have
mentioning the break statement there
quite simple right now we can also pass
so it you can pass in okay we have one
more thing let's say if I'm passing a
number which is sick and you can say in
this case we don't have any value as six
and if I on this code we got nothing
because we are not executing any case in
that scenario I want to print number
doesn't matter okay for that we'll write
a default case so default is a special
case so if now the case get executed it
will execute default we say we'll say no
matter and if I run this code with six
you can say it says no match quite
simple right that's how you have to use
switch statement so let's see if I'm we
can pass in can I pass CAD and you can
see there is no issue we can also pass
CAD we can even assign a CAD value as a
and you can match it with a now why
character works here because ultimately
the character gets converted into
integer right that's we have that we
have seen in the when we have talked
about datatypes
so you can convert
datatype or you can convert a character
into n so I can use character there is
no issue with that can I use doubles if
I say double 5.5 if I say D and you can
see we are getting an error which says
cannot switch on our value of type
double so switch doesn't support double
okay what about if I use spring will it
support string let's say if I say ABC
here will that will that be supported
and the answer is okay it is still
giving an error and you can if you focus
on the ni it says cannot switch on a
value type string for this source table
below one point seven that means we have
different versions of Java right the
current version of Java which I have
installed in my machine now it is one
point eight and you cannot pass string
in switch below one point seven that
means even if I have one point eight in
my machine I have done this setting off
of my compiler as one point six you can
see that I did it intentionally I made
my compiler what one point six so that I
can show you the error but if I make it
one point eight now which is about one
point seven so you went one point seven
does support switch you can see now you
support it and we can pass if it is ABC
print one if it is speak you are playing
- I will go for a little - block here
because I'm lazy so if it is ABC it will
print one if it is PQ I will create it
will print two and if I run this code it
works so that means you can also use
string in switch only in one point seven
this is one of the into our famous into
your question they ask can be used
string in switch and the answer is yes
you can use string in switch in one
point seven and later so yeah that's it
from switch in the next video we'll talk
about some awesome things so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
