dot JSP
let's create this action so this action
here the name is hello Sturtz so if you
if you're familiar with web technology
of Java which is servlet so in any form
if you are creating a form you have to
provide a servlet name all you have to
provide a JSP name since a storage to
follow MVC two it will say that you
cannot directly use a JSP you should be
before you should be using a saw blade
but since we are walking on a starts
framework instead of creating yourself
let's create a action so to create an
action we can simply say will create a
new normal Java class is my Java class
over here and we'll give that class name
as hello start is because I have
mentioned there hello starts I will give
a package name as comm dart no bean
finish so I can say it is my package
name here so this class is comm dot
naveen dot hello starts let me remove
all the extra comments here now once you
have done with this now so this is
normal class right so this is hello
starts but what if if I want to create a
action so in order to create an action
you have three ways to create upgrading
in our action first way is to create a
normal class and that class should have
a method which is public string and the
method name is so this method will
always return a string and the method
name is execute because when you click
on the button it will execute something
so the method name should be execute it
will return something a string value so
by default the string value should be
success know exactly why exactly success
that we'll see later
okay and all your coding which you want
to achieve you can do here in this in
this method okay so in at last either it
can be success or failure or error so
what are the options we have that means
later so in this bracket here you can
write all those methods so this is one
way of wait in action what else I can
wear third way that we'll see later so
this is one way of grading in action
right now what I want I want two
variables here one will be username okay
and second will be the message now if
you compare this so this username here
is the same username here this message
here in the same message here so what
what I want to show here is let's say if
it is a penis outlet to fetch the value
of this GSP element which is username on
this action or this if it is servlet
then you have to use request or get
parameter but starch 2 says don't worry
you just specified the same name if it
is username here so it should be
username here if it is message here it
should be message here I will take care
of passing the values now how exactly
pass the values there is something
called us so if you know the theory of
storage - so there is something called
as intercept intercept so there's
something called as interceptor so it is
interceptors responsible to fetch you a
value from this username and assign that
value to this username but unfortunately
this username is a private variable so
what we need here is our getters and
some setters so to insert getter setter
so you can have a type get as a toes or
you can simply say right-click insert
code and you can select getters and
setters for both the variables and click
on generate so it will generate all the
getters and setters you require now the
only thing what I would do here is I I
got the username what I want to show
here is I want to change this message so
I will say message
equal to so this message will be
greetings let's say greeting as hello
plus and the username that's it so once
once a user click on a button it will
just change the message which is hello
with username and that's what this is
this is how we could you create an
action but so this is first we write
what are the other way the second way is
you can implement the claw interface
called as action so using if you
implement this with action you have to
select this one open symphony dot X work
two dot action so if you if you
implement this action in that interface
you have this method called as execute
the only advantage you have is if you if
you just blue go to this action
interface here if you click on this
interface you can see in this interface
we have only one method which is execute
and it has some constant it have five
constant which is success none other
input and login so instead of using this
success string what we can use this we
can use the constant so the only
advantage what you got what you get
using that interface is this constant
but if you don't want this constant if
you have to define your own message you
don't require that interface so first
ways you can directly give it a class
second way is by implementing action for
the third way so third way is by
extending of class which is action
support so action support is a class in
Bill class which gives you some extra
features so if I go to this action
support class you can see there are lots
of methods and you can use all these
methods for validation for the sauce
bundle so if you are working on i18n
which is internationalization you can
use this action support class so it has
multiple methods example you can use
validate for validating your fields so
you have lots of extra methods here if
you are using action support but since
we want to make it simple you can either
use a normal
class implements action or exchange
action support everything will work in
the same way okay so this this is how
you create an action so all the values
from this field will be mapped with the
action so this message is mapped with
the action message and this user name is
mad with action message actually user
name okay now how to make it work or how
how will this this page JSP page will
search for hello starts that we'll see
