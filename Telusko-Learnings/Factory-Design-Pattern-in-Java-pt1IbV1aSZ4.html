telesco learnings and in this video
we'll talk about factory design pattern
now what exactly factories and pattern
is so let's say you have an interface
and you have multiple implementation for
the same interface okay example you have
an interface called as OS and we have
the implementation as Android OS we have
Windows OS and then we have iOS right
now if you want to create an object or
if you want to instantiate that OS you
have to use some one of this OS right
either you can use Android you can use
Mac or you can use iOS or you can use
Windows now how to mention that which
one you want
so depend upon your requirement you will
you will if a user 8 object of different
class white maybe Android or Windows or
iOS now what we want we want to hide the
logic of object creation from the user
so in order to do that we can create we
can use a pattern which is these are
factory design pattern now how to do
that let me get a class here this will
be our main class so we'll say this is a
factory main ok in which we'll be having
a main method so let me say it is a
public static void main in which we'll
be having a string parameter again so I
just misspelled it now what I will do I
will create one more class and not
closet this time we'll quit interface
and this will name this interface as
pause which will be having in a package
which is comm dot phone so we have an
interface which is a prompt dot phone in
which we'll be having an interface which
is OS and every OS will have some
features let's say public void will
print this specs of this OS so what are
the specs of this voice ok so we have a
method here which is void spec ok
nothing so nothing much fancy here now
what I have I have multiple
implementation of the
same oils so let me read a class and
this class will be lets say Android so
we have the first Android and we'll say
public void spec if I if I run this code
the output it should print is most
powerful oh okay
next will be your one more class this
will be your i/o s and this also will be
having a method which expects and we are
going to also implement our interface
which is a OS here in this case and we
need to implement all the methods of oil
so we have to say implement any
unimplemented methods and in this let me
print most secure OS okay and here also
we need to implement also we have to say
implements OS so we got two classes and
let me get one more last class which is
Windows in that case so let me get a
class which is Windows right and for
this again I have to say implements OS
and way to implement all the methods
which is a luckily we have just one
method here which is spec and we'll say
spec we're going to say that for Windows
I'm about to die okay so so that's the
implementation for Windows so we have
three OS which is Android iOS and
Windows and then we are providing the
method which is spec now in order to
create object object of this class or
this interface so we have interface
which OS and we can say obj equal to not
obj we'll say this is a ever capito VJ
and then if I say new Android so if I go
for new Android if I say obj dot spec if
I call this method okay we got an error
okay we need to import the package here
so package import it and if I run this
code now you can see with the output
we'll be getting as spec which is most
powerful worse if I change it to Windows
it will print oh we're going to import
the package so if I run this code it
will print I'm about to die right but we
are providing the implementation here
itself right and if in future if you
have to change it from Windows to OS you
have to change this code you have to
recompile it that means your client
knows that which which classes you are
working with because you are exposing
this Windows key word you
now what factory pattern says instead of
creating directly object what you can
create is create a class and we'll name
this class as a operating Factory will
say operating system Factory so this is
a factor which will give you object of
those oils so in this we'll be having a
method will say public void get instance
just get instance okay and okay get
instance while spinning of intense
instance maybe this one so let me go
with a keyword will say get instance and
it will return the object of not fact
with it will object of course and here
in this you have to mention the type of
the warm-up type of type of your OS so
we can say string STR string and will it
turn an object of oils now depends upon
what type of string we are passing so if
your string is if you are string dot
equals if you want to run a open source
OS which is Android so if I say open it
should return the object of new Android
okay we need to import the package again
so it an object of Android else if this
is a type of mistake else it will return
or else if to be specific if it is STR
dot equals if this is equal to closed
platform which it will return new iOS
okay
and we'll say else if nothing matches
we'll return new windows okay and it
like Megan import the package so we have
a wiring put the packets so we have a
factory class here which is operating
system factory depend upon the string
you pass if you pass open it will give
you object of Android
if you pass close it will give you
object of iOS if you pass if you pass
anything else it will give you Windows
now then question is how to get object
of that first object we require is
operating system factory will say this
is OS F equal to new operating system
factory and here in show up saying new
Windows we can say OS F dot get instance
Wow I think the spinning is wrong right
it is instance in strengths ah so that's
right so we have instance and then we
can pass a string so if I pass a string
like open I want an open OS and if I run
this we got the most powerful OS which
is Android and if I pass close and if I
run this we will get IOS which is most
secure lowers and if I pass anything
anything which is not open and close it
will parent I'm about to die okay
so since we are using a factory object
so what is factory which manufacture
your object right so this is a class
which gives an object that's what is
called as factory design pattern now
even if you have extra class in future
it will not change your client
application it will change it will
change this class but not the client
application and that's the amazing thing
about factory design pattern and this is
one of the most amazing design pattern
which will be used a lot when you when
you when you are doing Java development
okay so I hope you have cleared the
concept of about factory design pattern
so make sure you subscribe the channel
because we were discussing about more
fact more design patterns in the further
tutorials so yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
