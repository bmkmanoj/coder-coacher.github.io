can call a frame from another frame so
this is the example we have turned so
run the file
or you will get this ad from if I click
on this ad form it will open a new file
and it will the old file will get closed
right so if you don't know what I'm
talking about you can watch my video on
how to call RJ Flynn from average a
frame so if you have already seen that
this is for you in which I will call the
same form but after some time so let's
say after if once I click on add form it
should show some progress bar and once
the progress bar reach 200 it should
call that form so what is progress bar
focus wise something like when you run
an application that safer on this
application you can see somewhere down
the down this this is your progress bar
which is running here right so we can
use the same concept in Java but to
implement progress bar what we need is
we need a J progress bar object so we'll
use J progress bar and we'll name this
object as P with equal to nu J progress
bar and if you see the constructor of
focus bar now it will ask you for two
things first the starting point and the
number of tickets so what we'll do is
we'll say the starting point is zero and
the number of texts it should jump is 20
okay which means every tick will be of 5
so it is like something like a hundred
divided by 20 which means every tick
which will jump for five now next what
we need is will we'll just add this
progress bar to your Jim frame so we'll
say add be like once you say a dot P
let's run this code and if you run this
code now you can see we have two things
one is add form second is this focus bar
but to make it work that just like if I
click on this add formation of calling
this form it should first complete the
progress bar then I should call right so
for that we need to write some coding
here that means the two progress bar
should
right and for that we need something
called as timer so without time we
cannot do that so we need a timer and
this time our class will belongs to a
Java X dot swing package will say time
as T equal to new timer now in timer it
will ask you for the time or delay will
say delay should be of thousand
milliseconds which comes out to be one
second and after every delay it should
perform some action so you can see it
was asking you for the object of action
listener right so after every second it
will call the object of accent action
listener so will say new action listener
so we need to remove this override code
just to reduce number of lines and here
now so we need to write the code which
should execute after every one second
and the code looks something like this
initially I need a variable which is int
I the value of I will be 0 now once I
come here I to check if my value of I is
equal to equal to 100 so once your value
of I reaches 100 it should call new
addition right so from here I don't need
to call the new addition and when once I
call new addition I should so good let
me just write both code here so cut and
paste it here so once my once my I value
reaches 200 it should call this new
addition right now and after every
increment or after every value I need to
I need I need to increment a value of I
okay we are using anonymous object okay
the problem is whenever you work with
Animus object by default all the
variables becomes your all the variables
become constants so what we can do is we
can we can we can't do this so what
we'll do is we'll say extend
implements action is no censure of using
anonymous class we'll use a concept of
implements here and then after this
method let me define public void
actionperformed and action event so why
we are doing this is because whenever
you work with this concept of anonymous
class so this is your anonymous class
right and and on in anonymous class all
your variables which are declared
outside your anonymous class it should
be final ok so by default this I here
they are treated like a final since we
are I'm changing the value it says local
variables effort in a net last must be
final or effect Union final ok so this
this will not work so we need to write
this code this code inside your this
method ok so we were doing some mistake
there and it is all now so we cannot do
this not work with this so I mean to say
this this is the object of action is no
year so whenever I click on this
whenever after every 1 second it will
call this action perform and I need to
define that action int I outside my
method so we'll say int i/o so now what
we can do is after
yeah after every second it shooting
giving the value of I and we need to
change the value of progress bar so
we'll say P dot set value and the value
of I will change value of 3 focus walls
will change to I and since we are using
that progress bar outside the
constructor so we need to use me to
declare outside so we'll search a
progress bar P and so we don't have to
declare inside okay it seems quite
complex but once I have done with this I
will just make a quick revision so that
it will understand what we are doing you
and that's it so now when I click on
this action perform it should call the
timer so we said T dot start so let's
let's run this let's see its is it
working or not so if I click on start
it's fact that this court if I click on
add form you can see its increment
rewrite so that the value of this is
changing so after once you complete all
the values in fact this is time slow
let me just increase the value or just
give the speed so we can just because it
decreases this time but if you say 100
let's say we go 50 so after every 2 2
milliseconds it will call that I should
perform I let me run this now so if I
say add form it's getting executed they
are done so once you complete or
everything it should call that function
is not working oh it's not working
it's because where's the code it's
because the number of ticks I'm
mentioning is 20
it should not be 20 is it - 20 okay
something is missing since we make edit
20 it should be 5 ticks
verax
it should work now and bingo right so
once you complete everything it should
it will call this form so let me make a
quick revision what we have what we have
done here what I want once I click on
that button so once I click on this
button it will call is that good it will
call T dot start so what is T here T is
a timer which starts with which call
which which executes and event after
every 50 milliseconds and what is that
event it is this now what is this this
is the object of action listener which
will call a method for Direction perform
after every 250 seconds so initially the
value of i we are using is zero so if we
had to go from 0 to 20 so once it
reaches 220 it will call this object
which is new addition and it will
disperse itself now how to reach to this
20 is because initially the value of I
will be 0 so every time we need to
increment that value with of with I plus
plus and then wait to set the value to I
now why it is the increment it by 5 is
because we're defining us as 26 so 100
divided by 20 is 5 so every time you say
I plus plus the progress bar will
increment with 5 right so how do you
specify me to define an object of
progress why what could you find the
number of checks and that's it you just
have to define a method of action
perform which will get called after 20
seconds so where you can use J progress
bar you can use J progress bar for your
projects where you need to load a
database because loading a database will
take some amount of time maybe 5 seconds
10 seconds 20 seconds so in that
donation you can show a progress bar to
your user so that your user will feel
some process is going on right so you
can use J progress bar in your project
or in your economic projects so yeah
that's it from this progress bar I thank
you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
