from that is called learnings and in
this video we'll talk about views so in
the last video we have talked about how
to configure Android studio we have
talked about how to run the emulator so
in this video what we'll do is we will
try to understand different views in
Android so that whenever you work an
application you should know what you're
doing now just to show the output which
we have done the last example if I done
this code I have already have a running
emulator here if I click on OK so that
emulator will be loaded in this emulator
now so it will take some time to load ok
it is Gradle innovation location
finished it should load in the emulator
yeah so we got up we got something
called as hello void here right now what
we'll do is we'll just okay so let's
understand what our view 0 so every
everything on this palette is is one
it's its views so we have textview we
have large text we have button we have
radio button we have checkbox we have
focus bar then we have edit text we have
all these things and this our views now
I am saying this our views is because
whenever you use any of this component
maybe if you are using text view or if
you are using radio button this thing
indirectly exchange or directly extend a
class which is view so these are
subclass of view class right so anything
you anything you work with this they all
are views so let's focus on one of the
view which is available here which is
hello void so you can you can see this
is one view here which is a text view so
you can see on the right side we have
text view here and this text view will
have multiple properties so we have lots
of properties on the right side so this
is your properties tab here ok so it
says the layout width which is verb
content so we have option of wrap
content or you can make it match parent
so it will take the whole area so if you
keep it web content it will take it will
only take the area for your content so
let's say if your contents hello world
so it will be it will take small area
let's say if your text is my name is
1120 so it will cover lots of area right
so you can also do the same thing for
eight if you mentioned this is match
parent it will take the area below let
me make it again drop content so that's
one one of the property you have you can
use we also have a property which is
background so you can change the color
of your background okay or we can yeah
so you can change if you let's say
you're selecting a right here and if you
click on okay so you will get a red
background this looks weird right
so let me you can also set a hexadecimal
code here you can mention F F F F F
which is for white background okay so
they can do that now you can also
mention the ID for your text now why we
have to mention the IDs because let's
say you want to assign the value of this
textview using Java code so then at
runtime you want to change this value so
you can use ID as the reference anyway
right because when you when you work
with Java you need to you need to assign
some values or you need to do some
operations so you can use ID as the
reference point okay now next we have we
require is text size we can mention text
size is 20 so we can text it if we can
set the text size as 20 px which will
take 20 pixels but the problem is it
will change depend upon the device so
let's say if you are working with a
device which is which has a low-density
pixels so it will be bigger text let's
say you are working with high density
phone it will be a small text white so
your pixel site size should not depend
upon the hardware size or the pixel size
so we can touch that's why we can
mention it is as DP so it will depend
upon the ratio so it is a device
independent pixels so it is depend upon
the ratio so that's DP or we can also
set it as SP so SP is scale independent
pixels which means even if it depend
upon Z it depend upon the user a font
size let's say in your mobile phone if
you change the font size so this even
this will change so it's better to go
with SP here okay so we have P X which
is pixels we have DP which is
device-independent pixels and then we
have SP which is scale independent
pixels okay so you can set all these
values from the properties tab
now there's one more way you can edit
this thing so you can just go to text so
this this is how you can change the your
design with the help of text which is an
XML format
that's why XM is so important in Android
is because when we design something in
Android we use XML and whenever you work
whenever you want to achieve a
programming let's say if you want to
perform some operations you need to use
Java now we can also change the
background color instead of saying F F F
F we can also mention a different color
and as soon as say you mention a color
here you can see we got a we got some
reflected color here okay we can even
change the text instead of hello world
we'll say hello
aliens okay so it you can see the text
has changed so you can change the
properties using properties tab or you
can use XML in fact you can also add new
properties let's say you want to change
something else so you can simply mention
text so let's say you want to change
text color so you can also do that we
can mention text color as a black or you
can also make it too red so it is we can
say F of 0 0 0 0 which is the color fall
red right so you can see we got a color
which is red and then your background
color is yellow so that's that's how you
can change the properties let's say you
have one more thing let's say we are
getting an edit text here which is this
one plain text so that's a text box here
or we can change the properties of this
text box also we can make it we can make
mention a particular size for that need
to first remove this two things okay and
here which is your width instead of
saying wrap content we'll say this is
200 DP okay which we take a bigger size
so you can change all this you can
change the properties using text all
with the help of the GUI way so you have
choice you can do it any way you want
okay so that's touches from this video
we have we have we have talked about
views now in the next video we'll talk
about layouts and then once we are
complete with layout will move towards
the actual programming part so that's it
so that's from this video so make make
sure you subscribe the channel
and wait for the for the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
