of tutorial we'll talk about spring so
in Java you can create some GUI
applications using swing now what
exactly GUI is GUI stands for its
graphical user interface so what you are
able to see now this is that beans IDE
and it's a GUI right CLI means if you
open your CMD this is CLI this is
command line interface so in this world
in this in this current world what we do
is we always use GUI example if you want
to calculate two numbers always
obviously you will have to use a
calculator so to do it to add two
numbers so that's a GUI right you when
you add two numbers let's have you if I
open a calculator here so this is a GOI
here it's a GUI very good entire sum
number let's say 5 into 6 is equal to 30
so I'm performing these operations on
GUI so if you want to execute GUI or
controller if you want to work with GUI
in Java you have to use some packages
and those package is those packages are
called as swing packages so before swing
we used to have something called as a W
d 8w T stands for it is apps try
abstract window toolkit the Y to replace
app AWT with swing is a w is the
heavyweight components and swing
components are lightweight it's because
all the components which are made for a
WT are made using native languages and
all the components which are made for
swing are made using Java so you will
see some some difference in a double
tree and swing when you start with the
actual practical so in the next part of
the video we'll talk about some basic
components of swing and we'll we'll make
some small code to demonstrate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
