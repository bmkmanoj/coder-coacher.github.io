of objects now what I mean by objects
are so let's say we have a class called
as student and this class I have some
let's I have two variables one is
private why to go grab it will directly
go with our table with scope we'll go
for a string s name and we'll have
string on our string maybe and roll
number so let's say have we have this
two details what is s name and second is
roll number and to assign the value to a
constructor will use okay we'll go for
insert code we'll go for the constructor
which will take two parameters and then
we'll also go for a method which is
tostring just to put in the value so I
hope you are familiar with the method
which is two strength so we'll go for
insert code and two string for both the
variables so if you're not familiar with
what is two string method just go to my
channel you will find a method or you
will find a video on tostring so here
what we have is let's say we have the
first student as s1 and the values for s
1 let's say student so we can have
student let's say the first value as
nubbin and it all number is 1 not 1 then
we have one more student just with can
just copy this code you know and this is
student 2 and name will be let's say
more hit and this is 2 let's have one
more
we'll say 3 and this term will have
let's say OSHA and this is 3 so now we
have these three names with num with low
numbers what happens if I find the value
so it's a as out and let's print the
value of s1 now as soon as I try to
print the value of s1 as right click and
run
so you can see it's printing a student
name and roll number what happens if I
pray into s2 so if I print or s1 easier
let
say copy and paste paste this is a stew
and s3 and if I print all the values it
will pray in now in Mohit anusha and all
those values clear but Walter you was a
use of addy so using an ax we can have
one object which is an add he will have
all this elements so how to get an added
we can simply say student this time we
are not going for a one value we are
going for adding of value so we have to
give a bracket I will say this is
students and will say new student now
what is this this is just a connection
of three values okay now how to set the
values that we have to say student of
zero a yeah so do we have three objects
now the problem is we don't have three
objects we just have three we have three
reference so this student is not a
collection of objects this is collection
or area of reference so even if your
topic is adding of objects we never have
area of object we always have area of
reference so here what we do is we can
assign student students as 0 will be as
1 then we can have a copy paste paste so
this is 1 this is 1 and this is 2 this
will be 2 &amp;amp; 3 so this is how we create a
dia of students so basically this is not
this is not adding of objects this is a
D of reference and these are your
objects s1 or these are your objects new
Neil Neil cool so even if you have to
strain to type a date don't have chance
object with AB student reference added
ok now how to print this values so we
can use a for loop we can use and ask
for loop here so we can say student as :
students students and then we can print
the value of s so this is also possible
when you run this so you can see we got
all the ops
so we are not getting we are distributed
to remove this part so when you say
you're getting this output it's all
because of this valuables here okay so
this is your add-in saw to plate a day
of reference so we have to create a
class named they can they add a name and
then we have to say a new student so
mind you once again this is not a day
off object this is a day of reference
just to make your point clear clear
that's from this video we talked about
area of reference so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
