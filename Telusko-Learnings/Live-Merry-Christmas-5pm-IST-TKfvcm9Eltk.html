odd it must be proper okay so so
everyone Merry Christmas and it's almost
a new year now so five days remaining or
six days remaining will be having a new
year and everyone will have their own
new year resolutions right so I want to

window there just enter your resolution
what you want to do new new in this new
year right some people they want to go
for gym you know I have seen many people
they start thinking about gym in on 21st
dissent by itself and all they will go
for one week one month and then okay I
done you know we got a fit body yeah so
there are people who are looking for Jim
and okay what are the resolution you
have in your mind maybe you want you you
want to improve yourself you want you
let me know your resolution in the chat
window will talk about that so five
people are watching now okay I guess
five people are watching there so I have
a laptop here where I can see a yard
your chat so let me know your resolution
will talk about that okay what is my
solution for this year I want to improve
myself learning new technologies are
working on some projects some new
projects this time I want to change one
thing about myself which is you know I
want to be better at time management
because you know I have 24 hours but i
am not able to manage my time properly
okay i am working hard I am trying to do
as much as possible but i am not able to
you know i am not able to provide i'm
not able to do their proper time
management so that is something i have
to look for let me just read some works
on time management
and we'll see some videos on YouTube on
time management and i will surely
improve myself in time management that's
my solution ok so we got other window
here who say is he want to go to gym yes
alvin ok go to gym that's that's perfect
but do it for 10 I mean don't stop it
after seven days or one month ok can't
do it cut because health is very
important because he'll if you have
health you have wealth right so health
is very important so we got dipti she
says because you want to become a
professional in web development all the
best dipti you can do it again I guess
you can start with PHP that will be easy
for you again what you suggest ok next
Amina trying to configure apache and
netbeans deployment fails help ok so
what you can do is oh ok so deployment
feels there's something wrong with your
web.xml file or there is something wrong
with the or your tomcat make sure you
run your tomcat first before deploying
your project if your tomcat get started
generally deployed and if something goes
wrong on the deployment you are there's
something wrong with the web dot XML
file okay just just check that
okay then we have the next person here
trying to configure okay become okay
want to prepare for ocjp java
certification that's good Naga do that
get certified learn as Scala and improve
myself skills in Python in fact ants I'm
thinking of learning python now as well
done with Scala that's something which
is the meaning in Scala as well we'll
try to complete that in fact I hope you
have seen my videos on Scala it is not
complete yet I mean it just complete
only for java developer so if you are a
jar java / and if you want to learn
Scala you can take my play list but you
know if you want to learn it from basic
that's on the way I will again start
preparing for skull our videos okay want
to be a software developer improve my
logic in programming that's perfect you
know you have to improve yourself daily
that's very important in fact I believe
in a concept of improving yourself
because if you don't improve yourself
daily then you're lagging behind okay
work hard on your skills because that is
something which will take your head
there are lots of people they think
about it I think about success right and
the thing on the lucky people get
success but the thing is the more you I
mean though ha how do you work you look
here the luckier you get the luckier be
so work hard and you'll become lucky to
get success so work hard ok and there's
something more I want to talk about
today so you can see this is my new
office so it is Sunday so hardly any
interns are there only one or two people
are there working on the project and so
again I'm time planning to move to so
you know I cannot trust YouTube anymore
you know they are you know right on
December November twelfth I cannot I
cannot forget that day so december to
another by 12 I lost my youtube channel
I mean
lost I put it back they terminated my
account for two days and of course
recorded back now but and I can't trust
you two anymore so I'm thinking of
putting some of the important videos on
my own server okay so so we try to put
some of the videos on my own server so
maybe I have to buy servers and data
tech is very costly so I'm still
figuring out I mean figuring what should
what would be the cost of my of the web
server if anyone knows how to do online
strange streaming how to build their own
media server just help me out because I
have not done that earlier I can do that
but you know it will take lots of time
lots of learning so if you know that
stuff it will be helpful for us for our
team again the cost is also a problem so
I know from where I will I will raise
this point forward for having the
because my plan is to change the entire
education system not entire but I'm
trying to know trying to build with a
platform where people can learn right so
for that I guess I need a platform where
I can stream my videos online life but
the thing is for that there should be
lots of funding I need I need lots of
money for that so I'm trying to invest
from my sight but let's see maybe if
that doesn't work I need to look for
funds maybe I will look for donations
that's the what a thing about deletions
in oh should i ask for donations online
let me know what your thoughts are okay
okay so so I'm bit in doubt I'm doubt
bsci to second year in ug is enough to
grow higher nitey if I have good skills
yes vignesh what you can do is improve
yourself complete your graduation in be
a CIT do a good project and while you're
working on projects upload all your
projects on github okay so the more
justly having github I know the the
module organized so when you go for the
introduce they will ask you for the
github projects not a big company but if
you go for startups they will of course
we'll check your skills so yeah do that
okay there's a question from legend why
don't you upload asp.net videos again
asp.net is a web is a microsoft product
okay and i hate microsoft okay so yeah
so that's that's the answer for you how
do you use github it's very simple go to
github Kreator Kreator Kreator account
there will be option of uploading your
projects I mean it's not that easy to
work with go to youtube search for how
to use github and you're good to go okay
it's not that difficult just of course
but it's one time learning you know it's
one time learning okay so i'm planning
to again i'm trying to build my own
media server let's see how it goes
anything else that's what i wanted to
wish you happy merry christmas and new
years coming make sure you get some
resolution which will i mean which will
which you will implement okay don't
don't take any resolution which which
you cannot do okay next is the question
from venkata ramana why you hate
microsoft okay it's a big question I
don't hate microsoft is that I don't
like Microsoft I don't like their
strategy of implementing stuff I don't
like their way of marketing the way they
build their products ok so I'm a big big
fan of Microsoft given a choice i will
always prefer google amazon not even
facebook but google amazon then what
else Apple so these are some companies
who are actually building something new
so so I'm a big fan of them okay so my
gonna say is it a big companies ruling
the ovoid okay which world are losing
mass I don't know at least earth not
they are not
okay there's a question from kiddin oh
I've seen your Android videos they are
awesome thank you but can you upload
more videos okay them I was knowing some
off I mean I was going some concepts in
android and I made a video on that so I
don't know android much so how to learn
QA a contig you happy to are talking
about interview we yes you have to
improve your aptitude skills is because
attributes skills defines how much how
fast you are and you're thinking power
and your way of calming are solving the
problems and all the stuff so it will be
or q as well some more tips on how to
learn java it's very easy go to youtube
and search for one of the best channel
the world political earnings and start
learning you java that's the best tip I
can give you but you know while you are
watching my videos do practice because
there are lots of people the only watch
videos they don't practice you have to
also practice that's what we make that's
what you will will make your perfect
right so watch my videos do practice and
do your own project and that's why i
started with these post right the paid
courses where i will give them videos
then i can i will give them assignments
give them project because if you don't
work on assignments and don't work on
project then you know learning java make
make no sense so do practice
okay no it will not be used in the
company of course I mean no one uses
aptitude skills and companies but you
know any when you are working for a
company you might come up with some some
weird problems you know some some very
different difficult problems so you need
a right attitude to solve those problems
and how would i judge person how good
they are in solving problems if they are
good with attitude skills so maybe
ninety percent chance is there that they
are good with problem solving as well
okay ninety percent oldie okay because
there are people they only you know they
practice all those a period questions
and the same questions comes I interview
they could they they cross the interview
that's what happened to me I don't know
so I'm not that good with attitude so I
saw in some questions I went for the
interview I cried it that doesn't make
that doesn't make that doesn't mean I am
good at aptitude okay but I'm good at
problem solving another the aptitude
okay so which is better going which is
so a more idea okay so this question
from Joe she can you do a video on
apache spark on Scala okay and I have
just learned scholar it will take some
time for me to learn Abacha spark once i
do that i can make videos on those
things okay and so if you like this
video click on the like button i can
only see your dislike dislike that so 1
dislike feeling bad for that okay so you
want to know so venkatesh you want to
know about s 0 a when I don't know about
that is it is service-oriented
architecture or something I don't know
night is fun neither okay I don't know
how to pronounce your name okay so you
want to know about cybersecurity big
data and cloud future technologies the
future is cloud of pores you know
companies are moving towards cloud in
fact every company is moving towards
cloud so if you want to learn about
cloud learn about
amazon web services learn about google
app engine how those things works I wish
is suggested to get a professional
course if you want to get your career in
that but it's an awesome thing getting
your cloud certification okay about
cybersecurity if you want to be in
hacker BS I mean get certified get
certification in cyber security security
expert you can be when i say hacker and
i'm not talking about those black hat
high cuz i'm talking about white collar
hackers who actually provides security
so you can also go for that i provided
your match is good because if you want
to be a good hacker you should be good
with at matts okay and yeah so the
question from large where what training
do you provider ok ROG I provide online
training I take online courses kochava
courses at van Java courses those are
paid courses okay so most structure will
be of course if the more structured way
of learning so if you if you think you
want to learn java in a short duration
and in a more structured way you can
join the course ok videos on restful web
services yeah on the way websites web
services are on the way vignesh
answering questions in Stack Overflow
does it help to get a job maybe maybe I
don't know I've never tried it I only
use tackle factory dancers I've never
answered any questions there you try ok
how much time it takes take to be
perfect in Java your lifetime so your
lifetime you need to suspend your
lifetime to be perfect in Java because
no one can be perfect in java at the
moment you think you know Java you know
there is some other guy in the world
they update your java version you know
so you know what cha 1.7 great jawan
point is that 1.8 is there you know 1.8
great in some time i'll be are getting
java 1.9 so you cannot be perfect in
java but let's say if you want to learn
java it may take two
three months and also in two to three
months you can say you know Java ok so
yes rest api videos it is that in the in
the course also and then i am trying to
make free videos for youtube as well so
we called chin to hear who say is very
bad at programming i'm doing MC a second
year 3rd sem ok ok so what should i do
to improve very fast practice my boy
practice you cannot learn programming by
learning you have to you have to learn
programming by doing ok you have to
practice lots of assignment questions go
to hacker rank there will be having lots
of questions try to solve that and
that's how you improve so you have to
solve more questions ok so that's that's
about the things so if you have any more
questions that's about the right station
i don't want to go in that today I'm
very hungry so I can see I can see some
food there so maybe next time the next
sunday again I'm going live but this
time would be in the night time maybe
