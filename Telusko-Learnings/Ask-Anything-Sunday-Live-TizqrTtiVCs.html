I don't think when I watch people are
busy watching IBM here and so yes
because because nine people are waiting
out there watching I don't know and I
can see people are still waiting for us
there okay so let's get started
so as you know this is a scary thing
Sunday night you can ask any questions
by the way
and we forward to store attack think so
welcome back aliens and this is the yet
another Sunday life okay so let's start
with question itself nothing Christmas
it by majority have to my announcement
about the back of the question there so
yes we have a hyper bath meter and on
the first week
I'm here to be cited eight because I
will be living Mumbai on 19th apart
I have some work there so maybe I will I
will to a meet up before my actual work
for five to six there is there so maybe
I will do a meet up before the work all
after the work so it is before the work
it will be his second Apple after the
work it would be first week of May so
that's the announcement so yes we have
either one recap on the way maybe soon
will be also going for a bangle meter
let's see how that goes but first we
have a high thermal meter which is April
end on May first week so if you if you
are any college and if you want a signa
will be available I guess second P
because I have caught some nails in fact
intact and let's see how they go so send
me I mean the thing is going good so I
can see why today people are watching is
and Twitter and likes come on guys come
on think of night but if you are
enjoying these obsessions
I know I missed the last week such
because I don't know if everyone knows
about this I shifted to a new place so I
was then we moved by first and now I'm
living in Korea
same with I want one of the question
I'm coming to contact so I'm in Catania
and very young so and we'll be doing a
meet-up a Mumbai Hannah meet up soon
because I can now take both the both the
cities right okay so that's the
announcement and let's start the
questions here we go okay so Siobhan say
sir please start applying EVs ok
Superman was busy with all the shifting
but we can see my dick stop my
workstation is not going to set up yet
you only have pointed without any wires
I'm sorry I'm still trying to move my
workstation and I'm looking for a good
office so the creation time for me to
get back to my work I have announced to
these bag and waiting back on book but
you do sifting work I was busy so who
started going for that okay so we got
another question here which is so please
tell me one thing that PHP is best or
JSP they both have their advantage for
the drawback so you are introducing boy
if you in because they were context of
course you can go for PHP but if you
talk about Enterprise projects they
normally prefer Java and if you have a
job of course you will be using JSP in
fact nowadays we don't even use JSP
videos different blue technologies
because ultimately it's all about MVC
now so when it's a few fuzzier people
you should use JSP and but now they are
using something else like velocity V
marker then we have kingly
so they're using those things but
suppose mother so we got a question from
shares any land for python tutorial a
Python know it as of now because I am
doing something else maybe you can
expect spring ok we expect spring to
complicated structures solve let's go
Java and blockchain
but now by the way ok so Big Shot says
when you will be learning to program
oh that's a questioner and so excitement
and ah ok the next question
how do you learn cloud computing it's
very easy just go to Amazon which is
able to us and just explore you can look
and watch some videos I do have some of
my videos on AWS and watch them and I
feel it's more about you exploded you
know the more you explore the more you
will learn about AWS in fact they give
you one year for the subscription just
because they want you to learn it in do
it so that you can walk on it that's the
text eventuate will done cloud computing
otherwise what you can do is it in by
online courses there's just going to be
used on YouTube on computing
justification know them and otherwise
you can just buy some courses or you can
buy some books
the only drawback of mine books or
courses AWS the cloud computing is is
you know expanding in a big way this
every new week we have new features and
if you if you I have booked you are
getting you know limited to the older
features not a bad thing but I would say
go for online courses which is on
YouTube because they to update it you
can also buy the course next one ok next
question next question would a meet-up
Pune Meetup
I have done am putting it up way back I
guess in of Jan yes okay so the next
week up plan is at the path and Bango
let's see how it goes
maybe from traveling from Hyderabad to
Mumbai I can take a one-day
gap in between let's see son can I go
for our machine learning of course you
can go for machine learning it's very
hot topic by the way the only thing is
machine learning is not that easy to
learn is not just learning basic emotion
that he will be enough but yes learning
basic will be great for you but it will
not be enough this is a long way to go
for machine learning for the AI if you
want to make a penny and machine
learning this is the time you have to
start start with basics and but you know
one thing one thing it's a very huge
field it's not like you will complete
because in three months and you will be
caught you'll be exploiting machine
learning you can call yourself as a big
knowing on the one year so yeah but it's
a good time you anyone can
start machinery now okay so nobody says
what next after codes are about to
become soft of Kujawa I would say go for
it one spot which is non-stop the GSP
spring training for iPod night both
other things have to go for it
okay next Apple and Google and I know
Google is trying to compete with Apple
in either one as well using pixel but I
feel make comes to hardware ample as the
best you know the type of validation
deep end I know they're falsely pipes
even go in even mixes it fix it is
costly but f7l s9 is costly so if you
don't know what all these huge companies
like Samsung they have flagship phones
they are positive right you cannot just
say after is costly when Sam say it's
costly when good is costly now in terms
of software Google is way ahead with the
e is bi features Apple is also working
on AI thanks Siri but Google is way
ahead in terms of software the amount of
data which Google Apps is much more than
much of an apple you know so the better
way different one is in software what is
information it is the ready okay so next
question what is bit low is it was it no
I think this topic because I'm just
using my phone here which is very very
near to me okay oh boy Tom Boyd Delhi
beat up so yes I made to Delhi last
month and I was a perfectly Mita
but God's merchants work so I came back
to Mumbai
okay internship for the disco I'm
waiting for that okay internship yes so
I will be put in turn ship from the
month of May of May and so forth a month
end of me
me month and I am doing
attention so I would let you know I will
take us away to be on that how do you
how do you get qualify for the
interviews and all those stuff so it
will be me angel okay so I have a
question I have no question because you
clear everything in your topic but
that's doing one two three four five six
that's a good name the pathetic Jose is
things to do during MC and off with
economics I would say if you are going
against ei this is the best time within
you can dance on the radio because
people who are 20 factors they are there
you to ID and the learning new things
that AI but if you're doing NC a master
course I would say go for AI or machine
learning or a blockchain so these are
the hot topics nowadays so do one thing
you don't need certification as of now
but if you can learn something new your
makeup project and that's a good way so
I would say at least two to three
projects in next six months in any
technology you want will be purchasing
blockchain ability two to three projects
if you're going for machine learning
none other things something using
machine learning that should be good so
then that's what you can do while again
see if you want to be a coach to go for
certification may not be for the AI but
for something else would be I enjoy it
maybe Java technologies maybe JavaScript
so that will give you a job match if you
want to do something new I would say AI
of the object okay
could you tell the best approach for
Java speed within 2 days 2 is a Java
speed well okay so you already know in
Java and you want to revise I would say
watch my videos in 2 X and also watching
that in 1x it in version 2 X and that
deviation in fact I do have one video
which which gives you the code of
everything I guess I forgot to think so
just search for the video which I have
for one are complete oh I guess I have a
video for ops again watch children
entire rose-red even X by that ok
okay so next question is is it late to
start a program in Korea in 30 years
yes I would say you are it is just that
you know companies will not take for
such a huge gap but yes if you are
joining us start up if you see it's all
about the problems on your skills if
it's not about how you tackle to use
stock up they don't care about your age
they care about your skill set so if you
have a good skill set if you would know
programming so spend two years because
you take some time it's not that easy to
be a rapper so spend one or two videos
learn something new when projects to
ability to work please other projects
and go for struggling to use it should
be helpful because then you look for age
I think I have seen people who start
program to create or 35-40
I don't know how well they were doing it
but they started their career as because
we have different levels right we have
good program we have come Rama's we have
good programmers we have gained great
programmers and then we have great
software developers it's not just about
coding and songs about the overall
things know the software jegi skills so
this is never too late ok does home
automation is a good idea yes it's a
good idea I will not say in India but in
the u.s. yes it's a good idea because a
lot of people are using that but maybe
in future you can expect that in India
as well
tips
ok stay is Indian Nevada that's great
but just because of my hair style is it
ok next question next question more than
what appointee ok I don't do that
unfortunately so ok are you going to
start click it to do the reverse no I am
not good
designing so I don't want to start right
now because last time also I got the
same question is surged about freedom
and I'm not going with you I so you're
not going to be something don't take
others
at this point I want to focus on those
things that would act ok scope of
development we have a great scope
because people are still using more
we're compatible Zeenat Aman was a give
us more time but if you don't work
YouTube there'll be the point of I can
I've been talking about my YouTube stats
I get 50% um oh mylanta it wasn't
software so people asked producing
better it's not that people only focus
on Tobar nowadays we have a good scope
of development I would say if you want
to be able to the per week food Android
and then because when you build an
application you will be for both for the
user so I Tibet users and the mobile
users okay so okay so next question next
question
come on where is the question running up
OK machine that big big Java you can
start with it but I feel well all the
other courses which is already but now
they are waiting for watching that he
will fight them so because Python has
none of my beliefs for machine learning
Java also has it but then now people are
going to clean up the whole fighting
people get remote and that's why they're
getting famous
ok so Stan Python is a pilot
ok so questions from interview ok did
you questions ok I would say go for so
just go to the website and search for
d2d questions you'll get a lot of
questions and not about the required
question at this point maybe I will make
a video on that that's a good idea
no make a video on vibrations
ok so next question from Big Shot oh I'm
in Konya I don't oh ok so Big Shot says
it don't come it's fun with me I don't
want people who are degree I want people
who have a good skill set so you can
compensate with you and
if we can't prove useless of course it
can do internship at the school okay
okay you want the banking project on
insolvent to think about it
should I go cup cotton then Java
okay that's a good option if you have to
be but nowadays you can cook Oh Carmen
it's a good idea but I would say postmen
Java don't skip Java because see I
typically you would if you're walking on
cotton cotton gets compiled it would
bite which works on JVM so if you learn
Java you will understand how JVM folks
understand how bite good works and it
would be easier for you to learn cotton
as well so I would say not job basics
and that cocoa rockledge please make to
Twitter so spring boot yes bring boot is
on my list for making videos okay where
is the scope of and Cee MC is a good
scope you know because there are some
because if you are doing normal degree
if you're not doing engineering some
come is better fit for Bachelors which
is be a CIT of easy example but there
are some countries which where I was
giving training range 23 for engineers
and MCA people they use some highest BCD
people but not for one doesn't work but
for support work so if you have done
your BAC ID music rock science at CCA
you might get a job and be company but
it wasn't right
okay I'm not saying somebody's bad but
then building excel file every day you
not get excited because of that so if
you only pay another power will say cope
let me see if you have done your
bachelor's
but you can you can do engineering you
don't need to do Master of Science no
emphasis a good course all the thing is
you are spending here three years you
can use it wisely that's a good option
okay so Judas is an highly thankful to
you because of your videos I can easily
answer
- oh that's great that's something which
gives modification automation okay
just mix up two things I guess what does
a good boy do you know
but pinky she gives you motivation okay
so next question okay putting some
experienced job developer should I start
with Scala of course you get started
Java Scala I will see that a scholar
will not replace drama and Daddy because
somebody replaced by not one language it
will be replaced by the - sweet
you know we have quadlin we have Scala
so we also have Ruby
so everything is covering some part of
Java feels like cotton is coming
shadowing a chihuahua in Android then
you have skyline Paquita and we have
global power of their projects so Scala
me replace Khan will just replace
passion of Java so I would say none
Scala like a new pond in enterprise
world if you have one thing on your
equipment big eater so skies of adoption
okay next question after that I'm going
to web all blockchain
see if you thinking about rock should go
for it because in next one year will be
having so many vacancies from the off
chain and we will not be having much the
other person so much people who would
those drop shape so this is the best
time you can learn doctrine and get into
great interest rate and as for research
there's so many nice to the server
there's so many companies they are doing
a proof of concept of it is POC on
blockchain if it is good for them they
will bring to my ticket and the moment I
implemented it went along people who
don't put no stock changes so I would
say go for adoption
the only thing is it's not that easy to
learn because we have adoption of the
Polynesian a lot of things but you can
learn those things it will be awesome to
know ok
for the next five minutes maybe 10
minutes long because we have almost
every obsession witness the 10
min mom okay so where you use your
office in Korea okay not so I get to
take an office at all ability taking it
office at me so so they still so after
shifting I still have some other work I
have it reading I have some other work I
have to go to different cities for the
awesome work so after all these things
are we I love in office and that would
be some bad okay okay so if you're
feeling I am big big off today because
I'm not feeling well okay today okay so
as laptop of programming yes the way
would have okay nurses which one if you
are talking about gave machine it's
awesome
in fact I do have my exes machine here
the cable machine and program is awesome
I am not sure about other machines if
you are buying anything about either
three maybe I need a little information
that will be going okay generally WETA
okay so I don't have any plan to come to
generation for the next three to four
months but let's see if I get feeding
each other and surely come
do internship make easy for getting a
job in a campus yes if you are doing
internship and get with a meaningful
work because see some people they do
hire interns but they only hire
don't fall in a mixture of work like
putting itself off then providing a
support but if you are really doing
something also for them like designing a
system then making databases into
software if you're doing this thing's
internship of course it will be easier
for you to be a job okay so we should
book I prefer to shop my skills dipping
upon what you want to not be used for
Java I would say accomplishments it also
the first Java those are the awesome
books ok so Sean says watch my lawn
before no genius I would say learn
JavaScript because node.js is JavaScript
and also be how web works with on the
banking system works learn about MVC the
basics of MVC
how blindness how it works so then of
all those things that would be good
okay so Gmail sees again here from
mashing it up a notch in my student
about you I mean do you get shorter
pieces do you couch you teach coaching
for Java II see I used to take online
courses before so last year they
completely are watching online courses
but now I have stock online courses
because I want to focus on what on
videos because I was not getting enough
time to make videos because of my online
courses so so yes I don't take one and
purses off now
the choice a is also get emails from dr.
puzzle and yes I do
I don't know it okay so you might you
say I'm a novel
good deal or not yes it does have a good
yeah quite a lot about th divide it has
a good career so that's what I I don't
have that people when you say thing on
PHP okay so the next five minutes a
village five minutes and then we are
closing so can you uploading videos yes
the spring videos are on the way okay
not now because everything will start
this is just what you say I'm trying to
set up everything so a new office
community registration that so many
things which are on the way so once I
come take another thing I will be like
regular videos this time you can watch
my own job we use because of putting new
videos on kochava every day okay so two
last questions let's say okay so there
is a question which topic I'll learn
first Jesus the subject of spring fever
okay the steps is first and kochava then
solve like JSP now once you know this
code of it and you can go for spring
code because spring code is the
prettiest injection if you know
Coachella fight will be easier for you
to the spring code and then go for
spring MVC spring bash so in that steps
so first kochava stop in the jails
because secrets go Chalmers of JSP and
then go for spring : spring MVC oh okay
so when Thomas is reacting you know I as
you know I am NOT into designing so I
cannot commit on that okay please upload
hibernate mode videos okay you go ahead
once which is hyper night
yes so I will not be making videos on a
high but night but I'm making video on
spring and hibernate
making a project using stick and however
that's what I'm thinking about
okay scope of large portion scope of
doctrine we have
with scope of blockchain because none of
industries they are moving towards an
option to the technology device
okay so I put through for every company
because some company have rejected
locked because of these now a different
requirement you know they are not having
the option but if you say 80% of
companies they love the option they
asked a little POC state which is no
consent once they feel it's working for
them they will make the winning it and
once the shuttle particularly you know
they have a good option okay so my pcs
do come like chant ribbon is sauce yes I
would write every Sunday's last time is
because of should think so I should - -
me so I was doing some setup and I was
20 when you find my five forward I was
not able to fight my charges but today I
am addicted side saying there's two
things which are way to complete but I
will invite index today as well so
that's a remark so not that feeling
I'm not putting into it today I got it
in person but how do we like a key so
Sunday evening maybe five six that's our
time like oh like we should be setting a
good time in fact I'll be algorithm poll
on my You Tube community that will ask a
question which day and what time is
perfect and you can put and based on
that I was going like so so much
everyone see you in the next life
session I hope okay try to answer as
many questions as possible I know I have
not completed all of the questions but
we'll do next week yeah so that's it
thanks for joining
we'll see you next week coming Sunday I
that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
