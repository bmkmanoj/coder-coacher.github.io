want to print this pattern in which you
have four rows and four columns but this
time we are not printing stars we are
printing numbers and that too in this
pattern so in the first row we have 1 2
3 4 in the second row we have 2 3 4
which is simple to do but the problem
starts when you want to print 1 again
same here you can print 3 4 but what
about 1 2 then we can print 4 here but
what about 1 2 3 so we'll divide this
example into small chunks so what we'll
do is instead of printing something in
this way we'll print what will print 1 2
3 4 1 2 the littlest try let's try let's
let's do something for this what we need
is we require 2 variables so we'll use 2
with 2 variables here okay so I guess
taking some extra space here ok so we
require int I comma J so we require
these 2 variables and whenever you want
do you want to print this pattern we
have to use a for loop so we'll use I
equal to 1 I less than equal to 4 and I
plus plus now since we require a block
structure which is of matrix type we
require a nested for loop as we have
seen in the last video so we require it
to go to 4 and then J plus plus so this
block will make sure that you are
getting a matrix format provided you are
printing a new line after every block
here perfect now in this for loop what
we need is we need to print way to print
something but what's something what if
if I print here if I print I so let's
see what happens if I print I so if I
print I it will print all once I also
need a space just to make it more
visible so you can see it it prints let
me just close up the code and okay so
now if you can see we got an output in
this format so we got first row as all
ones because I is responsible
of the number of for those right so it
is spending all once here then all those
all these and all foes what if I print J
so if I run this now it will print one
two three four one two three four one
two three four one two three four
because of fall every row J is
incrementing from one to four but what
happens if I print I plus J let's try
this so it prints two three four five
something in this format let's start
with two so you can see it the value is
getting incremented in your column so it
we have two three four five we have one
two three four but you just ahead by one
so what if if I subtract this number by
one let's see and yeah we got something
similar so we got one two three four
then we got two three four but it's not
one it is five in the output then three
four then again it is not five which is
five not one so we need to do something
for this so again we have different
different logic to do that one of the
logic we have is we'll take one more
variable which is K so we have a
variable K here and in K will store this
value so we'll say I plus J plus 1 oh
sorry not plus 1 it is minus 1 so
instead of printing this formula here we
have just have to print K so you will be
getting the same thing again which we
have got in the last output but what we
need is instead of printing 5 we want to
print 1 instead of printing 6 we want to
plain to ensure printing 7 you want to
plain 3 so if you observe instead of 5
we want we want 1 right so it simply
means 5 - 4 instead of 6 we want to with
simply means 6 - 4 instead of 7 we want
3 which means 4 7 minus 4 so in so
before printing we can check if my K
value is greater than 4 in case it is
greater than 4 then I will subtract K by
4 simple
so again if my K value is greater than 4
I will supply that number by 4 so if my
5 is greater than 4 I will select 5 by 4
and I will get 1 and if it on this code
you got this output which we want it
simple so that's how you have to think
about patterns now one of the advantage
of learning patterns is it will improve
your order what is a logical power so
whenever you build software's in future
you need a strong logic right and this
patterns will help you to increase your
logic so that's it practice more
patterns thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
