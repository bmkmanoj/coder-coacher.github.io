seen how to create the object of a being
inside GSB but since we have the option
of jst L which is GSP standard tag
library we can use something called as
use bin so in order to use use bin
before that let me do some modification
so if you can see what we are doing here
we are using the roll number right so
what I can simply do is I can just cut
this part from here the whole part and
say cut instead of assigned their own
number here we can just assign the value
directly so we can just we can just
reduce the number of lines required why
I'm doing that is because when you use
use being this this concept is very
powerful so if I just cut this part and
paste to it here so you can see I have
reduced some number of lines here so we
can directly create the object and fetch
the value from the user and assign now
let's say how to implement this using
use bins so I will just after this part
after this part let me just create that
object okay now one one more thing one
more change I will make instead of using
t1 will say roll number and we'll use s
name here okay so we have to make sure
you are using you're giving the proper
name t1 also works but we'll we'll make
it more proper will say the whole number
and s name okay stick it so now what
next now let's use you've been here now
how to use use bin we have to say since
use bin is the part of gstl wait till
you specify that it belongs to JSP
prefix and we'll say JSP colon use bin
now now use bin says we to provide this
this this things here now what are these
things these are first you have to
mention the name of your object you have
to mention the class of an object and
then you have to mention the scope so
what we'll do here is
eeny Meeny one more thing before
starting with that sorry for these
confusion what we'll do is we'll try to
make it more the tractor you know will
create one more GSB and we'll call that
J switch from this GSB so that we can we
can see the real power of used in okay
so we'll say request dispatcher and
we'll say it equals dispatcher say Rd
equal to the quest dot get the quest
it's the quest dispatcher in this will
mention the file name as display dart
GSP I guess we mentioned this part which
is equal to our JSP and we'll say Rd dot
forward by passing this to object now
since we are calling displeasure JSP I
don't have a file here
so we'll get that file also we'll say
new JSP and we'll name this as display
dot JSP and from here let me fetch that
data so if I try to fetch that data
unfortunately I will not be able to use
that bin of course is because the by
default when you Mary create object it
belongs to only that scope right so I'm
creating this bin object inside service
so the scope of that service will stay
there so in order to use that object
here so example if I say in my body of
this if I say a tag of JSP I don't want
to create a new object I want to use the
same object so I don't want to put in
this value here I want to print those
value on that page so I'm creating the
bin here and I'm assigning the values
that's it I want to print those values
on that page on display page so in order
to do that what we need to do is we need
to pass the object from this page of
that page so in order to pass the object
what we do you have to do is you have to
say request dot you have to say set
attribute and in this you have to
mention a name we'll say that name is
say sto bj is st and
ASD okay we can have any name you okay
so once you set the name there go to
display in order to fetch that will
fetch as st equal to now in our to fetch
we have to say the quest start get
attribute and then in this get attribute
you have to mention the name of the
object you need that is st this is the
key value pair and since we are finding
this we have to import the package so in
order to import the package we have to
say it is the highest percent at pH
import and the package name is comm dart
nubbin thought student okay and we'll
finish this now once you say Steve now
now the problem is this gate attribute
will give you the object what object I
need here is an idiot student object so
we have to specify the class name so
what we are doing is we are going for
the conversion okay we are going for the
typecasting here now once you've got the
object we can put in the values we can
simply say it's print Ln and we'll print
a street or to get roll number you don't
get roll number and we'll say out dot
print ellen will say street art get s
name
okay now once you've got these two
values we are done with the display page
we are done with load page and we are
done with index page let's let's run
this now in this application it will
open the same view which is it's a six
and this time we'll go for a new name
Palace Rahul and if I submit you can see
the answer is six and Rahul and this
page is displayed because of this which
is display page okay so we are passing
we are printing values here so that is
six and Rahul now instead of using this
will try to use use been here so what we
are doing here we are setting the object
we are creating the object and we are
setting the object into the quest
parameter in fact you can also pass
eight this into a session attribute
so we can use the quest attribute we can
use the quest scope or you can also use
session scope so we have to mention that
with scope we are working with is it the
request session on a page verify it with
a page or or you can also use
application this time we are going for
session just for the confirmation let me
redundant code just to make your I think
Leo let's I can go back to for and we'll
say this time Mahesh and submit query it
is for my so I just working right so we
are doing all this updates and it's
still working now instead of using this
object finally we are going to use use
bean so here instead of that let me just
come here and how to use use bean so you
have to say JSP : there's something less
use bin first thing you have to mention
is the ID so ID is like the object name
which is HT here so we cannot use st
because we cannot create two object the
same name with this time we'll say st
one then you have to mention the class
name which is calm dot knowing dot
student so we don't have to import the
package because we are going for the
qualified name here and then you have to
mention the scope the scope I'm working
with this session here so you can see we
are using a session scope here so we can
use session scope here so mind you I'm
going for the replacement code for this
thing here I get this part in fact the
whole part now once you've got this
session object let's finish it so this
is how you have to create the object of
use bin then question arise so we are we
are done with this part okay now what
about this setting values so in order to
set the values what we can do is we can
use GSP : there's something called as
set property and this set property have
to mention the property name which is
roll number and the value you will be
getting here is from this part so this
is your this is this is where you from
your video getting the values right so
we'll we'll use here something called as
expression tag so we'll use the
expression tag here and using
expression tie we can fetch this value
so we can just copy bait this code so
copy and paste and for next property we
need to set the property with for pass
name forward to close here let me given
enter so that trick it will be visible
in fact it will walk in the same line
now so now if I have mentioned the value
let me close the GSP parameter here
which is GSP set property close okay set
Robert is close now
now let's set the next property which is
excuse me that said I'm a missing
something here like it is closed into
joy pass and still gives another what is
that here it says remove surrounding
tags
I have a tag here okay so JSP property
close it should work now okay I'm
getting an adult so let's sort it out I
think I don't need to convert here is
that the problem saying
so that's the expression tag I'm using
okay so I don't think there's an arrow
here it's something else
so let's calm down and this time we'll
say this is s name and we're getting
will get we're getting the value for
first name will be from this so now once
you got the name we need to provide the
name also so name the of the object will
be the object name here is s t1 and the
name of the object here will be also s
t1 so this is something this is same
like this part so a straight out set
roll number so we are saying s t1 dot
set roll number s t1 dot set name and
this is the value simple so the
placement for this code is here simple
right
so now when once we are done with the
set property now we had to use the same
thing yeah well if you can observe I'm
not setting any value on this side I'm
not setting any attribute but still it
should work and we'll will write this
code after you spin so we'll say you've
been tagged the plate will forward it
and we'll call JSP dot sublet so once
you use this thing we don't need to
mention this part okay so I will just
comment this part the whole script ID
part let me just comment it okay now
let's get back to JSP here displayed now
if we saw if you see this display
instead of using s t1 I had to use
instead of using STI to use s t1 but
since I'll be using a scripted tag here
also you've been tagged we are going to
mention that I can simply die simply say
J SP :
use bin again if to mention the ID which
is we'll say this time it is this is s
t1 name of the class which will be calm
thought now in dot student and will
mention this scope which is session okay
and let's finish this so once you got
done with the JSP now we to just fetch
the value how to fight
value so to face the value we have
something called us get property will
say get Robert II here and will mention
the name of the object which is st1 and
the name of the property on to fetch
value is roll number okay and same thing
you have to done do you have to complete
4s name so we'll say this is s name and
that's it this is this is how we to use
use bin since we are using use means we
don't need this comment here we'll say
come in this part okay so what I'm doing
from index dot JSP I'm calling lo JSP
though I am setting the value and here
I'm just instead of using a normal bin
object I'm creating I use bin in which
I'm specifying the object so when you
call this object it will search for this
session in this session do we have
object sg1 if it is there it will use
the same object if it is not there it
will create the new object so this line
is very important when you call a use
bin and in that if you have an ID which
is s t1 it will check for the rest e1 in
this session object if s t1 is there in
session object it will use the same
instance it will not create new instance
but in case if s t1 is not there it will
create the new instance for the first
time in session I don't have s t1 so it
will create that instance it will set
the property using this code and then it
will forward the request in this
scenario once you when you call it you
already have s t1 in session scope you
already have that so it will not create
the new instance it will use the same
instance and the value for those
instance will be the value passed by the
user so we don't need to set any
attribute here which we have done in
this scenario okay so if you can reduce
the number of lines required and this is
more HTML friendly code okay so let's
run this just to confirm the code if you
London's it will ask you for it's a nine
and let's say Archana
and if I say submit the query
so the other is line number 21
Oh so we need to pass to said to convert
that into integer yeah
is that the problem it's let's verify
once again this is the page it says an
exception or Co was the root cause
argument type mismatch
so when you say type mismatch it so it
is it is expecting a number also I have
to convert it so I have to say integer
dot pass and I will have removed that in
the earlier scenario when I was getting
the other so okay so if I run this now
and if I say 9 I know China and if I see
submit query and they're here answer
right so we can also use use bin instead
of using the object creation directly
now in this next part what I will show
you some shortcuts so that it will
reduce more number it will reduce all
this line so in fact we don't have to
write this two times in fact you can
write this one time how to do that
exactly that we'll see in the next part
of the tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
