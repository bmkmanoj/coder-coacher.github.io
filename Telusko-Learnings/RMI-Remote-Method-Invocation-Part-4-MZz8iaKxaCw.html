talked about the implementation of this
remote interface this is your class so
what we have done till now is we have
created our ad interface as an AI then
we have created the implementation of
this as the class name was at C now the
next step is we have to compile this
class and we have to compile remote
interface that will do after we have
created the server so that we'll see in
a sink now it's not always compulsory to
follow these steps we can have our own
steps here so what we'll do we'll I will
not start the server I will just create
this server and it will just create the
client okay so the first step we have
the next step we have we'll do is we'll
create the server okay and for that will
require one more node five notepad file
now to implement this server what we
have we have to create a class a public
class as server and then in this class I
I want to run this class independently
so that for that we have to do public
static void main our main function we
required because it will run
independently and then we have this
arguments now as you know we will be
defining those methods we will be
calling that method add which which
throws exceptions so by default this
main function need to throw the
exceptions or exception okay and for now
the next step is now we have to add we
have to create object of that add C
we'll name this first we'll save this
file will say server dot ciao now we
have to create of that add C because
this ad C this implementation will be on
server side so we will say add c equal
to new ad c this is one of the JVM
now the next step will be now we have to
link this object obj as we seen here we
have to link this object obj with a are
a malicious tree right so we have to
register this name here
and to resistor that name we have to use
something a function called as we bind
so the amount is responsible to to
assign a caption to an object and we'll
say the caption is add or we'll say
capital add and we'll say object name is
obj so this is your obj and this is your
caption add now this remind method is a
static method which belongs to a class
called as naming so we'll say naming dot
rebind that's it and once it is done
we'll say this all started so system dot
out dot println what we'll do is we'll
say server started ok that's it we have
done with the server but since we are
working with this class naming dot
rebind we have to import a package and
that's why what we'll do is we'll say
import we'll say import Java dot RMI dot
star it will it will fetch the packages
okay that was yourself will not run this
file once you will create a client
machine so that we'll see the effect of
this now to create a client machine will
required one more will required one more
file will one more note by file I until
now we have created or three of Java
files this is fourth one so this is your
client dot Java this is your fourth Java
file now to create a client machine we
required again a a public class we'll
name this as client and in this we
require a main function so we'll say
public static void main which will
accept or string arguments again we know
we'll be calling that method add so it
will throw the exception so to say those
exception
and the next step now we have to create
object of ad right so see ultimately
what we need we have to call that method
called as ad by passing two values we
can take input from user for time being
we say we have to add this to number
five and for the output I'm expecting is
nine right so I will take this input and
we store this variable in n so n equal
to ad 5 comma 4 now I don't know where
is the implementation because the
implementation will be stored on server
and for that we need to call this object
now see we have to create object right I
can pick a not gate object of this class
is because I don't know what ways the
class we don't know what's the I'd clasp
or add C because it belongs to
server-side what we know as a client
will be knowing the interface and the
interface in which we have this method
ad is or less ad I will name this object
as obj equal to now now I don't we
cannot do add a new ad i right because
this is your interface so what we have
what we need is within an object of that
implementation like if i create object
of at see here if i could object of ad
see here it would work but as a client
you don't know ways the ad at C right
for that we will ask for the aria method
is free to give me the name or to give
me the object so we'll say naming dot
lookup which object I need any object
with caption ad will do any object will
caption ad will do now it will give you
the object this one as we have done here
when you say ad or I've done some case
problem so this is your the caption is
ad right now here what we have in server
code we have defined a caption ad for
this object right and the same object we
need here
so what if the client will do will will
search for the caption and what
ultimately you will getting is obj now
we don't want object of a class we
require object of interface we will do
our typecasting here and that's it you
got the object and then you have to call
obj dot add now it will call that object
and then we'll print the value of this
answer we'll say system dot out dot
println and in this will print n all the
Kokomo specific will say addition is :
plus so it will give me output as
addition is 9 but again we are using
this class naming so we have to input a
package so we will say import Java dot
RMI dot star that's it now we have done
with the client implementation we have
done with the service our implementation
now let's let's follow these steps now
the steps are now the steps are we have
to create a stub and skeleton or we have
to compile all the file first
now to compile all the files what we
require is we have equal to CMV here
this hold on guys I think we have will
do this in my next part of the video so
do watch my second video thank you so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
