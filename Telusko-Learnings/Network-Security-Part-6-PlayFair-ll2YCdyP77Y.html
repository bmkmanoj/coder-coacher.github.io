something always play fair notice
playing fat is a nice technique for the
substitution so if you know it was the
last video do check that video and come
back so in this we'll talk about paper
but it's still fair let's suppose on the
time go to text as my name is no annoyed
so I have to convert this text in a
format in a format which will into a
psycho psycho format so this is the
readable format I want to convert this
into cipher format so for this you need
two things first you need a plain text
okay so to implement Playfair steps up
first get your plain text next go for
your keyboard okay so let's go for
keyword as my channel length which I
don't know let's go for the subject name
subject name is network security spin
simply so I have two things here first
I have this plain text next I have the
keyboard okay but to implement this
steps are first create a matrix of fiber
pi okay so this the matrix should be a
five by five questions why 5fi it's
because India alphabets you have 26
alphabets right so what we can do to
accommodate those 26 I will take a 505
matrix and which I'll I can have 25
blocks okay and I will instead of going
with I and J I will go with only one
cell so you should have going can go for
I or J I will not go for both so either
I or J so if you remove J from the old
system you will get only 25 characters
right so in general I have 25 cells so
let me create this blog
so this is my 25 blocks right so steps
first put video game text KKL keyword
video key metrics next step now insert
all these keywords or keyword in this
matrix so let's start so it becomes an e
P W ou R K then next remove the space s
now when talk about e he is repeating
right so this is all it exists so don't
use he skip the duplicate ones go with
next then we have C then we have you
then we have our R is done already let's
go for I and then we have T teaser
fitting so T is done right then we have
by okay so now we have done all we have
done with the network security right so
everything is there Lewis says
duplicates are not allowed okay there's
more next now in this remaining block
you have two occupied occupied it all
those alphabets which are not taken here
so let suppose a so a is not here right
so we can write a then you can use P
please note you see speaker de of e take
F G is not there then H is not there as
taken again G either you can go with I
or J since eyes there skip J then we
have key it gone L then M and is done Oh
boys done are done P P of P then Q dot
AQ s tu you Dan B then done W and then
that way basics is a mess it's n upto W
is that right or is not that so be u W
and W is done it's
and that right so while he's done so xnz
so your steps first create the keyword
invite all this keyword in your boss and
the remaining alphabets you have to fill
up okay
again if you are using I don't go for J
skip J if you're going BJ is keep I you
have to go with one either I or J so
once you've done this next step okay so
first step second step third step next
step is go with your plain text and
create pairs pairs means this is stupid
okay so we have M 1 n a m e I s and a V
I now the problem with this n we don't
have any this is your odd character
right so what you can do we can add X
here to make it a pair here's the last
is an X now not what what to do steps
okay now this is very important this
step is very important the weight of the
what M by such fine wah you have M is
here and Y is here now we have to create
a box in this so this is your box right
so when you talk about my and why you
have this box now in this box you have
to take the diagonal opposite a
character so the eigen opposite for this
M is G so in this box in this virtual
box tell you opposite for this M is G
then for Y is T ok so that we are so you
have converted my into G then n a n
easier easier so we have to create a box
here and for this n we have T and for
this a we have pi again you have to go
with I own opposite then n e M is here
easier again you have to create a box
which are box for M it is G and for e it
is Oh what next is so it is our I is
your s easier litter box for this I you
have a and for else you have our what
next for again n a for N and a devotee
combination is
i T like also it's TI so we go for tea
and I then for V I so this V vizier eyes
ero litter box so for B it's P and
thought I is a and then we go for NX now
called NX n easier X is U so this is
your box then we have by taking up we're
talking about an X so it's W and P so
this is your plain text and this is your
cipher text all right it's so simple you
have to convert your text a plain text
into a cipher format easy right
but what if if I write something here
like f L so let's suppose my name is
Naveen F L in that case if you know
about this F and L both bloom same law
right so you cannot create a box here so
what you can do we can go with this line
okay since we don't have any oppose it
we don't have any diagonally opposite
numbers or characters what we can do we
can just go with the next number okay so
for this for L again you have to go with
this circle Oh we'll go with M and for
at will go with G so we have to go with
the next okay I missing something it's
reverse right so if it is g and g n okay
so we are going with the opposite
numbers right and then what if if I have
mm its essence so if you have to us what
we'll do try to go with 2 s is Center
right so what is it is below face right
you cannot say it's next or up or down
so what you can do if you have tools
laters back-to-back just change the next
later as X okay so with this your X s is
0 X is here so this is your box so for s
we have C and for X we have V
okay so this is how you have to
implement Playfair how to go back just
know that go with this I'm going to go
with the keyword put the values you will
get the my name is Naveen X FL XS x okay
so this is how you have to implement
Playfair okay so for next concert will
be next with you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
