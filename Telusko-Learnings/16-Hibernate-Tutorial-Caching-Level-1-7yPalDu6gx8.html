from those colorings and in this video
we'll talk about hibernate caching in
fact in the last video we have seen this
theory of hibernate caching right how
exactly does caching so we have seen
behind level 1 cache a we have never -
caching let's try to implement that here
and as you know that level 1 cache you
work with sessions so every patient will
have its own level 1 cache rate and the
moment you say you have to depend
sessions then your first level cache it
will be different right for that we use
second level caching so what I'm doing
now here is we have a session with name
session 1 and then we have specially
ones on biggest transaction session 1
dot you get transaction commit which
will commit the transaction and all the
transactions should be done here so and
we are using our tables you can see I'm
using an table name as a lien table so
if I go to my mask you can see we have
agent table here remove this extra
values here so yeah so we have a lien
table here so if I 5ik what you can see
we have 3 records there 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 0
3 then we have 3 names now winds ready
now in once by the end of into ready and
Nicolas create of the matter so what I
do here is I want to fetch the value so
how do we fetch the value because if I
try to print a there if I say print a of
course the value of a is null so it will
strange null value okay you can see it
is null when I don't want null value I
want to press some values I will say a
equal to will conflict with alien
because we know that whenever you fetch
the data from the database using I would
it returns with the object awk object so
we say session 1 dot get - the method we
used to fetch the value and then use a
class name as alien dot class that's how
you specify the class name which will
map with the table of course and here
you have to specify the primary key so
when I say 1 0 1 I know one zero one is
having 20 and color is green so if I run
this query now you can see these output
which we got is the object which we
which we wanted and it has also it has
also fired of query which is a select
query right so for one setting it has
fired one query but let's say in the
same fresh
if I do this once again with a different
value so I'm again fetching a value so
after printing here if I am again
fetching the value but this time instead
of going for y 0 what if I go to
positive one they are two so of course
it will fire two quadrants while you can
see we got two values that's for sure
what is now introduced against now in
any one dot that means weren't ready but
the number of queries it as far is two
queries because one which was the one
one which was there too but what if you
fire the same query you want the values
with 1 0 1 and 1 0 1 if our Father is
put in our of you can see it has 5
equally only 1 but the output there are
two objects now what is happening is
since you far this body for the first
time if any one you fired any query or
whenever you work with hibernate it will
first check the value in this one stable
cash in and you can see this value is
not dead in difference table caching so
it will go to the second level cashing
it's not also there in second of all
cancer so it will go to the go to the
database it will fire the query for the
second time it will check ok do we have
the data in the first of all caching and
yes for this value what is the one we do
have added the possible caching so it
will fetch the value from there it will
fetch the value from the first of all
cash right so that's how it is filing
the query only once and that's how you
improve the performance of your system
because we are not going to database for
the second time right but the moment you
change your session let's say let me
just end this session here or let me
just do the commit ok coach based commit
let's do the comics here and let's keep
this part in the second session how can
we do that let's copy this code with a
copy and paste ok we cannot take well
computation we should say
code reuse that that's the awesome work
right so instead of session 2 and sheer
will say session two thoughts begin
transaction and here I will end this I
shall research session a one dot close
ok so we are we are going for a second
section here section two and here with a
fashion to dot get transaction
and with the dot commit okay and with ND
transaction as well so we say session 2
dot closed now let's see how many how
many times which files require you can
see we have the same data but this time
we are using two different sessions this
is one station which is getting close to
your this is the second session of our
to exchange attention to so this is
again station here and 95/5 is query and
you can see it is it is finding that
query two times so that means it's going
to database for the second time as well
so that means your first commerce
caching works only for that particular
session now how do we use with the so we
have to use second-level session here
they can able to cache it to achieve to
fetch the data from the second session
or the second sessions when the user is
of the first session provided your
values are then the second table CACI
which was on firstly one caches provided
by - it by default right what about
second devil cat second-level session
second level cache it the second level
cache a is not provided by default you
have to configure it as you can see in
the hibernate configurations we have not
specified anywhere that I'm using second
level cache okay and that's why it will
not use second level cache so false you
have to specify that I am going for
second level cache is somewhere here
second you have second thing F is
specified is you have to get the
providers for the second level cache
because - it will not provide you party
for so you have to get the external
files and one of the file which is or
one of the caches second level cache a
we can use here is e H cache it ok so
first you have to download the jaw
response for you you H caching you have
to download the data files for hibernate
and th cache integration then you have
to configure your ipod 8 config file and
then you can use the cannibal cache it
seems difficult right but don't worry
we'll do it in the second video
how exactly we can achieve that so
that's it from this video we have talked
about the l1 cache a if you liked this
