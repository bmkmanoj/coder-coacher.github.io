from the disco learnings and in this
video we talk about Scala so finally
here it is you know I was thinking about
making star tutorials from a long time
and now finally I am started I'm very
excited for this and today's topic would
be what is Scala and why we could learn
it now again there are lots of people
they have not heard about Scala so then
they know Java they know other languages
but they have not heard about Scala
Scala is very important very efficient
very fast it is I mean if we talk about
the world of big data Scala is very
important now why you need to learn
Scala so there are multiple reasons why
you need to learn Scala so before that
let me start let me talk about what's
color is so Scala was created by a
person called Martin I for was his last
name so name is Martin and this color
programming language is promoted by
typesafe company so type save is a
company who's promoting Scala in fact in
this series you will see we are will be
using some tools of typesafe to learn
Scala so Scala stands for scalable
language now is it this that means that
other language is not scalable
a Java is scalable pi3 is scalable all
these different languages are are
scalable right but there is a limit for
scalability for all these all these
languages make when it comes to Java as
Java is scalable to tell an extent
Python is scalable to tell an extent but
Scala is a programming language which
was build I mean the main motto of
building up language for Scala was to
make it scalable and that's why Scala
stands for scalable language so name
suggests that it is scalable so yes oh
it is one of the important features of
Scala now what next the world is
changing right in fact everywhere we are
generating huge amount of data so we
have this concept of big data and to
work with big data we need to work with
a framework colors I do and so we have
this framework which is Hadoop and we
have one more which is the latest
framework for big data as well as spark
so we have Hadoop and we have spark so
if you work with Hadoop we can use Java
we can use Scala but if you work with
spark the only language we can
work with is taller so in case if you
are going for big data on spark a
framework you need to learn Scala
in fact if you are if you are going for
the cloudiness certification for spark I
mean Hadoop spark we need to know Scala
programming language so it is very it's
that important next important thing is
you know there are lots of people they
always debate with me about their
favorite language so they like Python I
like Java so what happens is when I say
Java is good it has so many features
then these people who loves Python they
say you know in Python when you want to
print HelloWorld we can write only one
line the same thing if you do in Java
you have to write approximately six
lines of code you have to get a class
you have to create a main method you
have to create systems out dot println
then you can say hello world but it's
bit odd it's because in Java we have it
is a structured language I love Java I
mean I mean you know about it right so I
have a whole channel on Java so but the
thing is yes there is a boilerplate code
in Java because it is more structured
programming and so it has certain
boilerplate codes now scholar says you
know there are lots of job programmers
they think you know Java should be
modified we should make it less
boilerplate code so they tried to modify
Java and they came up with Scala okay so
we cannot say Java there is much
different with Scala and Java it is
Scala is almost Java with some changes I
mean that some is very important okay so
there is no boilerplate code in Scala if
you want to clean something integrator
director like write a line and it will
print for you so you do not have tried
any boilerplate code there and when it
when it comes to boilerplate code it
simply means you know those lines which
which are not important example if you
want to print HelloWorld in Java the
most important line is system dot out
dot println but still we have to write
class we have to mention the main method
that is boilerplate code what else our
Java supports concurrency now why we did
concurrence is because we are living in
an age of octa-core CPUs so in our CPU
initially we used to have one code and
now we wish then we got two cores which
is dual core machines then they got quad
core machine and
we have octa-core CPUs so when you have
octa-core CPU that means you have
multiple cores so we have to make sure
that when you write a software it should
be that efficient that it will use all
the available codes and startup provides
you that feature even if you don't know
that you are doing its color will do
automatically for you
so just color provides concurrency so we
have talked about Scala is scalable
language it works on Big Data it is it
doesn't have boilerplate codes and it is
concurrent now what else in fact there
is a code you know from from one of the
famous person so let me just quote it so
the code is from Alan J palace and he
says a language which a language that
doesn't change the way you think about
programming is not worth learning so
that means after learning Scala it will
change the way you think about
programming no it's not more about
procedures is not about objects now it's
more about functions because Java is
functional poker so in Scala is
functional programming sorry for that
Java part so Scala is a functional
programming okay so in in Scala we have
to focus on your own functions so if
Stella is functional then other language
is not functional I don't know so what
Scala is functional programming so okay
let me repeat that code a language that
doesn't change the way you think about
programming is not worth learning and
trust me after learning Scala it will
change the way your program write it it
may happen that you don't want to make
you better in big data you don't want to
do any other stuff but it's it's even if
you launched Scala
it will change the way you write your
Java codes now what is Scala is faster
than Ruby Python node.js
Java itself so Scala is partial in all
these languages now people are going for
Python they are going for node.js but
trust me none of these languages are
faster compared to Scala okay so that's
that's one thing and one mode isn't
quite to learn scholars even if you are
a Java programmer and if you want to
learn sky
the reason is if you are the job
programmer and you want to spend more
time with your family and friends you
should learn sculler because the so if
you want to do a particular task in Java
in between 20 lines you can just do the
same stuff in Scala in five to six lines
so you don't have to West I mean you
don't have to waste your much of time in
writing that code second advantage you
know when you write a java application
since you have lots of lines of code if
you have one bug it is difficult to
detect where that bug is and Scala is
very you know your code in Scala looks
beautiful so even if you have a bug you
can remove it okay it's dead efficient
so Scala is of course better than Java
or you can say Java Scala is the ability
of Java okay now question is should
should you should you leave Java and
learn Scala that means that's the end of
Java and the answer is no Java it will
be there forever
but there are certain requirement where
Scala works much better than Java
example in three years back I mean when
Twitter was made in 2009 I guess they
used rubio language to make twitter but
later on you know because of lots of
tweets because of this big data concept
because of elections because in
elections i know there are lots of
people they twit on Twitter so it was
very difficult for Twitter people to
manage all this data using Ruby language
so what they did they removed the Ruby
from the back end and now they are using
Java and Scala for the back end that
means they are using both Java and Scala
that means they work together and they
also use es Java and Scala they work
together is because Java runs on JVM
even Scala runs on JVM that means you
can run you can write one application
which is java-based application and you
can you are using Scala code there and
you can make a Stella project in which
you can run you can write Java poll so
that means a Java project supports Scala
code a scholar project supports Java
code so in Scala we can use all the Java
libraries
okay so if you know Java you can learn
Scala in one month it is that simple
provided you know Java if you don't know
Java then Scala yes it is bit difficult
to understand I'm not saying it is
impossible to learn Scala if you don't
know Java but it is yes it is bit
difficult to understand what else that's
it so Scala and Java works together okay
so so Java and Scala works together so
if you write so Scala box on JVM and
nobody loves Java okay everyone loves
JVM and Scala is powerful than Java
so Scala works on JVM so we love Scala
so in the next video we'll talk about
the setup of Scala and how to idea first
code so let me know your thoughts about
Scala so that we can continue and if you
