vendredi from Teresa learnings and the
last video we have talked about leash
flight so we have created a list of
elements so this is what we have done in
Java code and then the equivalent part
is here so this is what we have done in
Scala so we have used something called
as lambda expression right so we can
print the elements you think now that
expression also the only thing you have
to remember is in Java we use for each
as a method I mean a function here it is
also a function but we are we used a
curly bracket to define me to define the
funky fine a function here so what I
will do now is let's talk more about
least here just just two more they I
mean two more examples your unlaced
so what normally happens is you know
let's say I want to I want to reverse
all this elements so now the way you can
reverse all this element is by so in
Java we have collections dot sort right
so via collisions with we say
collections dot sort nerves so when you
say not but not sort but reverse so
let's say I want to say reverse so we
simply say collections dot reverse and
we pass the nums here so asthma as soon
as I pass numbs and if I on this code
you can see we got the output unit he
was format so we got three two seven
four so that they was order right so it
is changing the actual values I mean
when you when you say reverse that means
this collection is actually changing the
values of the least what it means is
this noms his actually I mean initial
value was four seven two three later
when you say reverse it is changing the
values of least itself that means we are
going for mutation now it is good right
I mean we are changing the value but the
problem is if you have multiple threads
working on the same list of elements so
let's say you have four threads working
on the same list of elements and due to
this due to this reverse one thread is
changing all the values which is
affecting the other threads right so
mutation is very bad thing when it comes
to concurrency or using multiple threads
so I mean this feature is very good but
the problem comes when you have multiple
threads working with it so in scala what
we do is we can also use reverse
we can say if I if I don't discord
without reversing it you can see
everything we are getting everything
into our sequence we are getting because
if you just try let me remove that print
and then let me just give a space so
that you will see in the white you can
see everything in one line is it not
walking okay
I think it's not walking let's go pop in
teller itself okay so you can see we are
getting everything in proper format
right but let's say if I okay that is it
print L in the Box all the state is not
working let's go pop into that so
printer will spend everything in proper
format right what if I say the reverse
if I say non start reverse okay so if I
say non start reverse and numb start
reverse here returns the object of least
so it is not a void method it's a method
which returns at least and that's why if
you if you if you only run this code see
the output you are getting the output
has three two seven four but after that
if I'm if I'm running a four loop you
are getting the actual values the
original values which is four seven two
or three that means when you say num
start reverse it is not changing the
existing values of noms
that means we are not changing the
existing value of these to be are
creating our new least here so what is
happening behind the sailor's it is
creating a new least for you so if I say
or reverse Nam's this is what it is
doing it is creating a new list of
elements here okay so we are not
changing the existing values it is
creating a new list so even if you are
working with multiple threads that's
okay because we are not changing the
original list and that's why Scala is so
powerful why tweed we don't change the
existing value okay that's one of the
advantage of using Scala or Java okay
let me move this now reverse now let's
work what next so let's say I have this
four elements here and I want to remove
if I want to remove talk to top two
elements so what we normally do is we
say num start we have a method which is
remove in which you have to mention the
you have to mention the index I can say
one so it I mean I guess a zero it will
remove the first element and if I run
this code you can say it will remove a
I'll be getting exception here is it is
it because this one oh we have to
specify for which will remove the first
element oh but this is not working why
is that is it because I'm using at is
not least okay what is that
I just got list gives you oh it gives me
the gist object so for that I have to
you have to achieve that we have to
create object of added is the new
analyst that's that that's that's the
way it will work okay I'm sure going for
the actual input values just imagine
when you want to when you want to remove
elements we use we use that technique
but if you want to achieve the same
thing in Scala let's say I have this
foil events or maybe some more elements
here if I want to remove some elements
here we can simply say num start drop to
so what it will do is if I say num start
drop to it will remove the first two
elements so I can remove first two
elements we can say drop two it will
remove four and seven okay so you can
simply use drop and we can pass to which
will remove first and second what we can
also do is let's say I want to remove
first two and I will so I went to print
first - I mean next - so I want to
remove first - and then I want to print
next - so what we can do is we can say
we can say dot take - so what it will do
it will it will draw first - it will
take next - okay but again we are not
changing those changing the original now
here every time you use any many of this
method it will it will return you the
object of add a list or it will atone
you the object of list so you can see
that's the definition here it returns
you the object of least here okay and so
that means Nam's is the complete values
drop - will remove the first two
elements and then the remaining elements
will be taken by take so two three eight
six will be take will be taken as an
input for take and take will take out
only two values which is two and three
okay no sense since Scala has some
syntactical percent syntactic sugar with
means that you don't have to use the dot
operator either you can simply use the
English like sentence you can say noms
drop to so what it will do is it will
act like a English to English like
language so drop will act as an operator
between this two okay so nam start drops
in bracket two we can write in an
English format so nuns grow up to in
fact we have seen on here right when we
say seven plus eight so it looks like we
have seven and then operator than eight
but actually it is a method it's a
function right so we simply say seven
dot plus eight now while I'm repeating
this same example multiple times because
there is something very different in
which is which is there in Scala I mean
which is then which is not there in Java
right so we have to say noms drop two so
it will take again we can also write
take take three it will take first three
elements now I mean it will remove four
and seven then it will take two to the
eighth and that's what we are getting
here right so Scala is more like a
Jewish language it is it has something
of a syntactical syntactic sugar which
we have used here so yeah that's about
SCADA that's how we can that's how we
can remove elements we can added immense
and all those stuff in fact in the next
video also we'll talk about lace but in
not I mean with a different with a
different intention of working with lace
so that's it thanks for watching this
video and make sure you subscribe the
channel so that you will get the
remaining updates thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
