hello without using semicolon at the end
of printf so what I mean by that is you
have to print hello world or hello
without using semicolon at the end of
printf so first you have anyone need to
print something so let's say you want to
print hello so we have to use a
semicolon at the end right so if I
remove the semicolon here and if I try
to run this code and you will be getting
an error which says expected a semicolon
right but the question is how to print
this without using semicolon to do this
we have two techniques first technique
is using preprocessor which is has
defined so we can simply say which is
hash define and we can say X and we can
say print F in hash you find we don't
have to specify a semicolon there so we
can simply say hello here right so we
can say define X printf hello and then
we don't require a semicolon and in the
main we can see we can specify X and
semicolon so now if I done this you will
be getting output as hello clear
so that's how you you print hello
without using semicolon at the end of
printf so that's one way
now the second way is instead of using
this knife or I if you remember whenever
you whenever you go for any expression
which is conditional statement so let's
say a 3 is greater than 1 so it will
give you either 1 or 0 right so this
this operator here will give you 1 or 0
and in if we write this condition
so if don't want true or false if 1 to 1
or 0 right so if needs either 1 or 0 so
this will evaluate to provide 1 or 0 so
even if you write 1 here it will work
right so if well if can take 1 or 0 so
what if if I say if and if I write
printf here and in double quotes will I
hello the amazing thing is this printf
methods returns something okay and if
needs at that number
so if prints printf prints something it
will return one and printf needs one so
it doesn't matter if it is true or false
what matters is printf or return a value
and if needs a value inside this we are
not printing anything but that's not the
main concern right the main concern is
we don't want to give semicolon at the
end of printf and this code will work so
we are going to also give a slash end so
that we can see it on a new line so if I
run this now you can say it it's bit
it's printing hello simple so that's how
you can print our statement hello
without using semicolon at the end of
printf</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
