wanted to start life stripping way you
know maybe last year when it was
launched life story in India I'm not
sure if I'm getting live stream now
okay
I don't know why the camera is going up
and down
that is awesome three people are you
people and let me just check my mind
watch the issue there
seriously I don't know what's the issue
here I mean I'm recording in a landscape
mode and it is streaming in
yeah hi Steve
okay so
any solutions guys I mean how to make it
in a landscape mode
let me stream with my MacBook is that
Dutch work
okay place on than playing that now
autorotation on and let's try
finally thank you mister
okay
so I think now you can see me guys
inaudible there
okay let me check my voice there okay
finally I'm live-streaming okay so let
me start with topic itself and today's
today we will talk about the training
tips you know what happen is there are
lots of people they like training they
like teaching and maybe there are some
people that don't they don't like it but
I feel teaching is one of the field well
dear people you know people are skipping
this part let's say you are a good you
are good with your education you're good
with something and let's say you are
good with IT you are a good programmer
you will go for development right no one
likes to go for teaching again they
think that this is not a good feel for
them you'll be paid way less and there
are certain things right if you join any
College of course you will be paid very
very very less right but thing is India
especially you know in fact throughout
the world we need good teachers we need
good trainers not just for companies but
for colleges also right example if we
talk about any education system student
claimed that they need good teachers and
does the same student who are good with
the knowledge they join companies as a
programmer I mean how who will solve
this problem right in fact when I was
entering this education system people
were saying you are good at Java then
why not be a developer and the answer
was if I become developer who we teach
right and I love I love teaching I'm
passionate about teaching I'm not a good
teacher
but I love it so that's why I'm doing it
okay and since there are lots of people
they are asking me how to be a good
trainer in fact there are people they
want to teach they want to be a trainer
but they don't know how to how to train
on how to teach in fact some of my
friends they are doing the allotment now
and they want to they want to get into
training but the problem is they are not
exposed any 20 or treat teaching
environment so so I'm doing this session
today just to you know make you
understand how to teach it's not that
difficult it is not a rocket science it
is just
basic understanding if you know basics
of teaching everything will go
everything will go good so before
starting let me let me just check how
many people are watching so now five
that's okay this is my first live
streaming so five people are watching
here and I guess Prashant and Steve are
still online they're still watching
so Prashant I'm Steve if you are still
watching just give me a high so that I
can confirm that at least you are
watching me okay anyway this after the
live streaming the same video will be
getting uploaded on YouTube okay as a as
a normal video I don't know how that
works
let's check let me share the link on
Facebook so that people who are who
don't know that I'm streaming they can
join at least let me just show it on
Facebook so yeah so we have some
multiplet Gupta we have Dhruv will be
honest this is my first streaming okay
so there might be some issue with this
streaming there might be some problem
from my side because you know when I
shoot normal videos I I do the details
right sometimes I do two or three
retakes or sometime it is one go and
today I don't have any choice it is one
go at of course I cannot make any
mistake I can but so you people you are
the my first audience are the streaming
so that's awesome so we have nine people
joining okay okay just let me just
mention it there
started
okay so I'm not sure how many of you who
want to be a trainer here how many of
you want to be a teacher I'm still not
sure okay okay
so after this there will be some other
life sessions in which are you talking
about iti can answer your questions you
can directly ask me questions in the
chat window so while you type any value
type anything I can see your comments
here like I can see now plot a mesh and
Rahul Raj the page through some Samad
pit and Prashant they are commented
something they have to have charted with
me now saying hi sir
no one is streaming online okay
so 11 people watching now right I hope
if the strength will increase not
building it will not decrease okay so
now let's start with the tips itself
let's say you want to be a teacher you
want to be a trainer so what will what
we need it to be a trainer is okay let
me just check my notes for that okay you
know I was very lucky to have lots of
lots of teachers in my in my life who
have taught me how to teach right so
when I was in my BSC ITV's to have an
amazing professor kalisch Yogesh so and
when I was envious VSI T which is with
illunga College I've done my masters
from with the Lanka so we had an amazing
professor Colossus if professor safe and
you know it is to give me some tips
indirectly not directly they were not
knowing that I love teaching so there's
to give me some tips while we were doing
this session so some of the statement
given by other teachers also not just
this this great to people there are the
teachers also who have taught me how to
teach there are some youtubers like when
cottage Subramanyam there are youtubers
like the New Boston of course
and then boss shake so I have learned
the teaching tips from them how to teach
so if you I don't know how many of you
have attended my live session not this
live session but physically live session
in like classroom training I try to make
the environment more cool so that you
can you can adjust with the environment
you can ask me some questions we can
make fun of each other right I don't
know if that is the right way of
training because there are some teachers
they say ok you should not make any
classroom training should not be like
you're making fun classroom training
should be serious wide you should teach
and they should learn that's the whole
whole front of teaching but I don't
think that I think I don't think it's
it's that way ok Prashant has only
gotten you to my session where Prashant
oh you have the same pressure on from
Accenture if I'm not sure I don't want
to go into software tell them a lot of
different fields for job okay so do
we'll talk about that first let me
finish with the training tips and then
we'll start with that ok so now we have
13 people swimming that's awesome
ok
yeah we talked about that too yeah so I
was talking about some teachers so they
believed occupation relic so there are
some teachers they claim that the
classroom environment should be a
serious you know everyone have their own
way of teaching right so I don't know
you you might have faced lots of
teachers right from last 15-20 years so
you are attending different colleges
different school or different teachers
and you love some teachers you hate some
teachers and you're like okay we are
happy with this teacher everyone have
their own way of teaching right they
have their own style and I cannot say
that they have a very bad teaching style
they have a very good teaching sternly
their own that's it's just they are able
to connect with their students no
teaching study is a bad teaching
teaching style it's just your teaching
style should add up with students right
that's the important thing
yeah so your teaching style should
should match with the with students so
what I follow in fact not just what I
follow you what you should follow not
you may follow to be a good teacher as
the first thing the first tip I will
give you is create an environment you
know let's say you out your teaching in
college or your teaching in a classroom
or your teaching in a corporate the
first thing is create the environment
example if you are a polish teacher
maybe you're a full time teacher or
maybe you are maybe your visiting
faculty or you're a guest lecturer so if
you like guest lecturer you will go for
one or two days you have to create an
environment in different ways let's say
you are giving a session for two months
you have to be different and let's say
you are a permanent college teacher you
have to be very different right so every
teacher I mean every every session
depend upon the duration you have to
change example if you're going for one
day you don't have much time you know in
that one day you have to be you have to
make an impact example if you have a
session for six months let's say you are
taking a semester so you're taking a
subject like Java for six months you
have a lot of time to make an impact but
if you are taking a session for one or
two days you have a very less time to
make an impact okay so your approach
should be different if you're spending
six months
if you're taking an approach of one day
that's not that will not work because
the first day you will impress your
students you will impress your audience
but what about next 600 next six months
right so we have two very different you
have to change according to the
environment according to time and before
starting a session take especially
before starting your topic create an
environment make sure they will love to
just listen to you now it in fact that's
what I do right doesn't matter how how
good I am with Java but at least in
first one are I make sure that I'm I
will make an impact on the student so
that they will listen to me
at least for one day or maybe for two
days maybe for two months or maybe for
six months right
so that first impression matters so when
you get into classroom the first step is
you have to create an environment right
sorry for that I just have a throat
infection from last last four days and I
just had a banana just to reduce this I
don't know if it would work or not okay
the next step so first step is create
environment now Coursera is how it to
create an environment so let's say you
get into a classroom where of course the
students are new to you there are
strangers so you will look at them in a
strange way and they will look at you in
a strange way they are confused who are
you you are confused how to entertain
you entertain these people so what what
happens is when you go into a classroom
so let's say you are spending two all
day so you are your training is for two
hours so again one of my professor they
have given me this one statement it
doesn't matter what you teach what
matters is how you spend those two hours
okay maybe you are a you are an
excellent or you have excellent
knowledge about that subject but if you
are boring your students they will not
listen to you what then what's the was
the was advantage of knowing all those
stuff right so if you know something if
you want to put the idea in front of the
students make sure they want to listen
to you right and for that you have to be
an environment so
so you have to spend those to us
beautifully and now it doesn't matter
what you teaching this to us what
matters is how you make an impact on
those students right so even if you are
giving a very good session I mean you're
providing lots of knowledge right so you
are sending the knowledge it should not
be one-way communication so you are
sending something and if they are not
able to grasp it example if you are
let's say you are from IT student and
you're going for a medical classroom and
then they're talking about some vo terms
I know those all those vo terms like
this phobia that phobia anger and
eyesight is shouldn't we don't know
anything about biology right and if
those people they are teaching very well
but if they are they're very technical
with those terms you will not understand
anything that means you have wasted your
two hours right so what you say in
lectures that's not important important
is are your students are able to
understand it okay so they will
understand only when you are you're
creating an environment there okay I
guess I'm getting lots of questions
other than TT teaching so I'm getting a
question from Dhruv and British about
programming and testing oh we talked
about that this is not this session we
will talk about all this stuff about
your questions okay so maybe another
another we'll have another live session
in which I will talking about this we'll
have a QA session we will do it today
itself after this training session we
will do one more live session for QA so
their view you will ask a question and I
will answer okay
good right okay
okay yeah so the second thing the second
thing is keep your students motivated so
whenever you start a session make sure
your students are motivated it's because
teaching is 60% motivation and 40%
training right it's because if your
students are not motivated it doesn't
matter what you say they will not listen
to your example when I so now I had I
had I had lots of you know teachers in
my be a CIT inviting me see also and I
loved some subjects I hate some subjects
the reason why I love those subject is
because I have interests second those
teachers they made an impact and I loved
that subject in fact this this the same
thing will be happen to you when you're
attending a session I'm not sure if if
you have faced the same issue but I hate
some subjects I hate some subjects from
my graduation of polarization is because
of teachers okay they they made those
subjects so boring you know so
unrealistic I used to I used to hate
those subjects right you know data
structures is one of the best subject
you should learn but if you have a back
teach of a data structure it is worth
subject you know so data structure is
best and worse depend upon who teaches
it right if you have if you are getting
an excellent teacher for data structures
you will love it right and if you are
getting very boring teacher for that you
know imagine people are explaining about
stack heap and all the stuff in a very
boring way who will love it right
I love Java I love networking I love
data bases because we had a good
teachers for that you know there's two
there's two play with those subjects and
then I used to hate data structures and
all those stuff is because we were not
having good teachers I mean they were
good but there it was not suiting my
thing here yeah so mix make sure you
keep your students motivated now how I
motivate my students so before starting
any session let's say if it is session
for six hours or eight hours let's say
if I go
for corporate training so there I spend
eight hours or six hours on the training
so first half I only talk about
motivation I mean I motivate those
people so that they are motivated toward
the day because when I teach I talk
about lots of topics and I want them to
listen to me right of course
I don't want to I don't want them to
distract themselves or their type they
are using whatsapp and handle all those
stuff so we are keep them motivated and
if you keep your student motivated they
will go home and they will learn a lot
right example when I was in my 11th
standard when I was doing for science 11
science and so there was some professors
in my classes these to motivate us a lot
about if you it so there was a video
awesome line from my Serb having so he
says this it all depend up on your next
six years so next six years will define
your next six 16 years so if you work
hard for six years it will define your
next 60 years so keep your students
motivated so that they can learn from
you in this session and then when they
go home they will do something extra so
I motivate my students the only problem
is when I motivate them the motivation
level is still on that door as soon as
they cross the classroom everything
vanishes okay so and how to make sure
that they will be motivated okay
okay the next step is yeah so your
students brain is like a ram so what
happens is every time you teach
something so every time you teach
something they will listen to you they
will understand everything but the
problem is their brain is like a ram
okay as soon as you teach everything and
then when they go out everything
vanishes right of course they said I'm
right so how Ram works
by the time you have a power they were
listening to you so there will be they
will be listening to you when you are
talking as soon as they go out they will
forward everything so you to make sure
that when when you teach initially the
data will go into them and then after
some time the same data from the RAM
should go inside the harddrive so in
your brain you have to memory when is
RAM and hard drive so you know in your
head you have to RAM and hard drive so
you have to make sure that that data
goes into hard drive how to make sure
that so earlier people your teachers
used to make you write notes right so
when they teach so they did the data
will go into a ram and as soon as you
write on the paper so you are make make
you are making sure that the data will
be stored on the paper so that when the
student goes home he will open that book
and they will read I don't know who who
do who does that who goes I know one
switching whom who open your book
I don't know but so there's to follow
this concept of making them right so
they used to teach and write but I've
seen some some teachers they only make
sure that the students will write so for
the session of tours what they do they
they make their students write I don't
know what they fill up the whole book of
writing so you should have that what you
can do is teach and give them notes as a
soft copy or a hard copy don't make them
write at least if you even if you are
making them right so if your session is
for to us make the write for 30 minutes
max don't make them write for one hour
50 minutes and then the last 10 minutes
will be only may marking the attendance
so what you can do is teach them for to
us okay give them some notes but make
sure while teaching you give some
examples maybe some funny examples some
very weird examples maybe sometimes you
have
give an example which you are not even
matching with the context so you are
teaching something else gives us some
weird examples what will happen is with
with this weird examples in your in
their brain the examples will be set and
as soon as when next time they recall
this example they will recall the topic
ok this is what I do so I take lots of
your examples in fact my students they
they hate me for this for those weird
examples but I do it purposefully so
that they will understand the topic I
mean they will recall this topic when
they listen to this weird jokes ok
so those are the tips you can follow to
be a good trainer next why teaching
don't be serious I mean have a smile on
your face and it doesn't matter if you
are this is not just for teaching this
is also for this seminars so let's say
you are presenting something so let's
say you are working in a corporate
sector then you want to present
something to your one of the actors to
your managers to your team you know you
can for the same tips make have a smile
on your face when you are talking to
your students or colleagues have a smile
you know the smile is like opening the
brain opening the heart so they will
listen to you they will understand what
you are saying they will they want you
to talk more so when you smile they will
smile and then they will smile you will
get more confidence and as soon as you
get more confidence you you talk sense
fully right so if you're nervous
somewhere you will forget all the points
right but make sure you have a smile on
your face while you're teaching ok so
those are the teaching tips I have for
today
and let me know if you have any
questions for in in terms of teaching
so I guess we have a question okay so
this this question is from Prashant and
so I will be teaching to students for be
a CIT after my exams right away
any suggestions they know very little
about programming
okay so Prashant you need to make sure
that you teach the basic idea of
programming first because you need to
start with step by step you know when
you watch a movie or any a Hollywood
movie this start very slowly slowly
slowly and then they go for some you
know bang so you to start the same way
when you start in a subject make sure
you start very slowly step by step step
by step and once you know that they are
grasping the things you're talking about
then go for it you know then you can
take your own pace but initially make
sure they know the basics of programming
I will suggest teach them syntax with
which syntax to use example let's say if
you are teaching PHP or first motivate
them like you can say you know if you
learn PHP you can make your own Facebook
because Facebook was built using PHP and
that's not true I mean you cannot
directly make a Facebook if you know PHP
but you know this is way this is how you
can motivate them at least so that take
me they believe they will start learning
because to make your own Facebook sorry
you need lots of tough stuff right you
need or you need to know about server
programming you should know about
programming but at least you can make
them make them understand the importance
of that language when you are teaching
so let's say if you are teaching PHP
make sure that then they know the
advantage of learning PHP tell them
Facebook was made in PHP you can be a
Mark Zuckerberg so they will be good
they will be motivated and then whenever
you talk about some difficult topics
they will learn they will try to
understand it so that they can make
Facebook right so yeah that's that's the
thing so okay so what we'll do is we'll
we'll stop this topic here okay the
training tips I will stop the Wreckers
to stop this sharing now and I will
restart this sharing with a new topic
which is queue a session life
so make sure you go to my channel and
click on that link so that I can answer
these questions okay and I will suggest
to repeat me these questions there also
okay so Prashant Prashant drew will
cider Sai Kumar British so do one thing
after this for the tips from a student
oh thank you so yeah so I'm stopping
this session here okay so make sure I
will create one more live session now
for the QA session you can ask your
question there so that I can answer and
in fact I'm enjoying this live sessions
it's it's easy it's not that difficult
okay okay well I was initially bit
nervous now I'm feeling confident so I
can make one more Clive session today
okay
so people are going so they are stopping
eleven people are still watching so stop
this session I'm starting the recording
there okay so make sure you join that
session so I will name it as QA session
life okay so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
