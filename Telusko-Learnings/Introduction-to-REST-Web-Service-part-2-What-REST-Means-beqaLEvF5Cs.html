very simple you have a web server with
you let's say and you can have any kind
of a client who wants to interact with
the server now when we see the usage of
HTTP protocol between the client and the
server what we need to imagine on the
server side are resources so what we
have on the server are the sources for
an example an image is also a resource
if the client wants to access the image
I just need to know the URL to download
that resource on the client side you
know there could be multiple resources
so I could have a bunch of resources
lying on the server so he exactly just
came up with the same idea like when you
see any file that you keep on the server
think about that file as a resource
which you access it by its URL well so
we we start with the same concept over
here arrest web service should just be
thought about as a resource in your
application just like any other resource
you you create a file and you save it on
the server or web service also should be
treated just like any other server-side
resource ok now this is the name from
which if I compare it I'll just give you
some quick names over here so you must
have heard about sua service-oriented
architecture
similarly now we have another name
roaaar this source over the entire
architecture ok we also have one more
name go on but oh that that doesn't have
a full form yet so you know we even need
to come out of something of this ok
so ignoring this when we talk about this
two names the second name you know this
source oriented architecture this is
another name that is now becoming a bit
popular and it has a very similar kind
of theme like what so I had
service-oriented architecture today when
you start with the design of a new
application you might start thinking in
a restful way from the beginning itself
so using Rohwer means your architecture
is based on the concepts of the rest
based web services you start thinking
about your system as set of resources
which are lying on the server and all I
need to do from the client side is learn
how to consume the same and well I don't
have to learn anything new because the
protocol HTTP everyone knows how to use
it today even if it's a plain HTML
running on the client side without any
major challenges from an HTML code also
you can easily like it's all meant for
HTML by default so forget it without any
problem on any client-side application
without any efforts we will be able to
use it if the client is a Java program
if the client is a mobile application no
matter which language we are going to
use support for HTTP protocol is
something which is found everywhere so
without any challenges the client can
easily connect to the server start
consuming of the services and go on so
think about your web services as
resources so for example there
suggestion is if you create a Java code
acting as a restful web service you
might want to give the file name as for
example product resource dot jungle now
this is how you might want to name your
files so you will start using the word
to the source in your file names to
indicate you're developing restful web
services so this is one of the theme to
begin with so think about your code as
it is sources now how do you access this
resource using some uniform methods of
HTTP protocol like for example gate post
well so he suggested who I'm talking
about Roy the name which we started with
the guy who has to be given credit for
all this concepts so he suggested that
along apart from all those methods we
have an HTTP protocol he identified four
methods of HTTP protocol and he asked
everyone in the community that any web
service that you are going to develop
stick to this for so that we will have
uniformity across all possible web
services that anyone will develop and
consume today so any developer
developing a restful web service should
not go beyond this four methods it's
just a suggestion it's not like ok I
cannot use any other method of HTTP
protocol well but he has suggested use
gate use post use port use delete don't
use anything
on this he he wrote in his PhD thesis
about why beyond these four methods you
don't need anything else he was able to
prove all the business functionalities
fitting very well into this four methods
of HTTP protocol like he said using gate
method if you know if you want to read
some data from the server so if I want
to let's say get the details of the
order that I have placed so I can use
gate method for sending the request and
I will get back the details of the order
that I have placed okay I want to place
an order so I can use post method in
which the client will send the data to
the server and the server will process
it further so post method you might want
to modify the order that you are placed
so you can use put method I want to
cancel the order that I have placed so I
can use delete method what else we want
to do any business functionality can
easily fit into this four methods of
HTTP protocol we don't need anything
beyond this so he was able to prove it
that why you don't need anything beyond
this four methods of HTTP so stick to
this if possible so that we will have
uniformity in all the possible code
which we will write which will be called
as a restful web service okay what else
he said was your restful web services
should be stateless why because the
protocol is stateless in the first place
HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol so
stick to that don't create a web service
which will store State that means if I'm
writing the school in Java can I in this
Java code use the HTTP session EPA well
if I want I can why not it's available
because this code will be running on
Tomcat for example and I have access to
that HTTP session object of Java by
default so in my java code can i use
HTTP session object and i can store some
state in the session and retrieve it
again in the next call i can if i want
to but don't do it please you are
obviously affecting the scalability of
your application over here so things
stateless don't go for a web service
which will be stateful in nature it's
not a good idea actually and there are
many other reasons if you study more
about the stateless nature you will come
to know more about the aspects related
to this that's why in spring and other
frameworks if you are aware of it you
know like they follow another style of
programming which is called a singleton
my singleton became so popular you know
single that means there's only one
object of that
and if you only have one object of a
class and if there are 10 users trying
to access that functionality provided by
that class don't you think this design
is stateless in nature it has to be
stateless the orders you will not be
using singleton at all in your code
so why singleton is the preferred design
pattern in a software that we develop by
default there are many reasons why so go
for single go for stateless that that's
how you should start with your design
when you develop web services okay then
what is now this is an interesting on
the last one hypermedia as the engine of
application state so I would like to
talk more about this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
