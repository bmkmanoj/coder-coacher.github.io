from the Salar things and in this series
of tutorial we'll talk about C
programming okay now there might be
different type of people looking at this
video so maybe you are fresher or you
are ready to programming maybe you have
your I mean C is your first language in
your college maybe you heard about
something about C programming you want
to avoid C programming so this video is
all about what is C programming and why
you learn it okay there's also a chance
that you wanted to learn Java and then
you watched my video on Java you well
you know you should know seep first
because in one of my video I mentioned
that first have to learn C and then you
can go for Java so this is this is the
right place so basically this is the
playlist of some videos approximately 30
videos where you can learn C programming
from start to end okay so this is the
first video of that this is the playlist
first video so if you are not watching
this video in the playlist
make sure you search for the players so
just so that you can watch this video
there okay because after this video will
be starting with the practical
implementation so this video is not that
important compared to those videos right
but this is base for those videos how to
learn okay so let's start with the
basics what is why they came with a
concept of C programming so it all
started in 1951 when someone thought
about let's create a language using
which you can interact with the computer
so they came up with the concept of
assembly language then you know the
problem with assembly was if you want to
add two numbers you have to say add a
comma B so it does it will add those two
values it is easy of course but let's
say if you are making a software and if
you have a bunch of lines if you want to
go back we have to use some something
else go to statement or some labels and
that was not a better way of programming
right so they thought okay let's go for
some other languages let's say if you
want to use if you want to build a
scientific applications maybe some
calculations all those stuff they came
up with the concept of for train so
photon basically means you have to work
with photo stands for formula
translation right so that means you you
want to work with scientific
applications you can go for for train
then they came up with
Sept of COBOL the COBOL stands for
common business oriented language which
means if you want to get into or if you
want to build a business application
COBOL is good for you but then in 1970
1980 somewhere there was a guy called as
Ken Thompson now Ken Thompson is very
famous he's currently working for Google
he is the founder of go language if you
don't know about him so he's a founder
of go language he is the founder of B
language so at that time so he was he
was working on a B language concepts of
B language basically and so that is
switching and cam Thompson they give
away the concept of B language but later
on they felt you know B is good so be
like it is good but it doesn't have all
these features at the same time about
having one more language was BCPL so B
language was there and BCPL was there
but then Ken Thompson was working on
Unix
he wanted to rebuild the UNIX OS but
this time using high-level language how
do you build a programming how do you
build a system on how do you build oh s
with the high-level language so B was
not perfect BCPL was not perfect so they
came up the concept of C language so C
has all the features with which is there
in B and BCPL but it is one of the I
mean this was the complete language so
when they can with the concept of C they
wanted to build a complete language
using which they can make any kind of
software maybe networking applications
maybe worse maybe some software's so
they wanted to build the complete
application and that's why they came
with a concept of C language and the
founders of C is Dennis Ritchie and Ken
Thompson okay it's not just that is
switching so and then seek out famous
because it was the complete language and
that's why they say C is the mother of
all the languages because current when
we are using Java vs using c-sharp using
C++ all this languages are based I mean
all this time which is base is C
programming so if you know C programming
it is very easy to learn all these
languages plus you know programming and
now you can proudly say you know
programming so make sure if you if you
love C watch the entire
Cirie's and let me know your comments
about the view if you get stuck with any
of the video let me know how you're
thinking about it maybe I will make I
will make one more video on that so
that's it make sure you subscribe the
channel and like this video if you liked
it thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
