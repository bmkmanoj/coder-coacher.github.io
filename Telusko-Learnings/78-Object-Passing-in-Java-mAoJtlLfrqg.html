from physical earnings and in this video
we'll talk about how to pass a object is
a parameter to the method or what
happens exactly when you pass an object
so you know we have a concept of
callback call by value in Colbert and in
Java
everything is called by value even if
you pass an object it goes in a format
of value right now an executive value is
a hash code okay
so whenever you pass an object inside a
Java as a parameter it goes it sends the
hash code off it okay so to demonstrate
this I take two take take this example
so we have a class here which is printer
okay and then we have a class which is
page or people right so normally what
happens is paper will have a text right
and you will get that text only when you
put that in order into into a printer
right so if you take a paper put that
paper inside of printer you will get the
output right so let's say if you have a
paper and then you want to make some
changes so what you have to do is you
have to create the original object of
paper create up to object of printer and
pass the pass this paper to the printer
right you will get the you will get the
same page again you will not get a new
paper okay you will get the same paper
updated right so how what happens behind
the scene so if you compare this code
here what happens behind the scene as
soon as you create object of paper you
know inside your heap memory so you can
see inside your heap memory you have a
object okay you have a box there it has
a it has a text value which is a text
string
by default it will be blank and from the
main method you are assigning some text
right so we have inside the stack it
will have obj right our paper P so you
can assign the value there so the
highest code of that at the address of
that object will be assigned in the
stack now what happens when you pass
this object or you if you pass this
object to the printer now what will
happen is it will be having one more
stack for the for the methyl print and
in that this you can if you are passing
this object it will create a new
reference and the hash code will be the
same hash code of the of that object
that means you just have one object and
to reference right and if you make any
changes with the second reference which
will reflect on the same object right
the first reference when you are
printing it you will get the new output
I mean the updated value right so let's
say if I create object for the first
time the printer of the paper object and
when you print the value it will print
hello world right
but after updating of the object you
will get the opt-out put as get lost
right so that means whenever you pass an
object you're actually achieving this
achieving something was called by
reference but it's not called by
reference it is called by value because
you are passing not the object but the
hash code makes sense right so yeah
that's how it works that's how your
object passing works in Java your pass
when you pass an object you only pass
the reference you only pass the hash
code that is reference so that's it
