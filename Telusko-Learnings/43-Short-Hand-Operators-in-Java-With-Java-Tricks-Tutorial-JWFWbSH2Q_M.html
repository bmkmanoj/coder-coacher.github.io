hand operators not exactly shorthand
operators are so they are the special
type of operators you can use for
incrementing the value or decrementing
the value or something in this way so
let's say I have a variable which is I
and the value of I is five okay and what
I want to do is I want to just you know
increment the value of I by two so what
we do is we say I equal to I plus two
right so this is what we do to add the
value of I unless print the value of I
here so if you're plenty I and value of
I there and if you like this the output
is seven right because 5 plus 2 is 7
I should have repeating this I value
here what we can do is we can just write
this plus before equal to which simply
means I equal to I plus 2 so this is
this is how it works right so this this
type of statement here they are called
as short short hands because we are
doing shortcuts today right so you
should not writing I equal to I plus 2
we can simply say I plus equal to 2 we
can also do subtraction here so let's
say if I say - so it becomes I equal to
I minus 2 so the answer for this should
be 3 and we are right we are going we
would let me say right part if I say if
I go for multiplication so it will be I
equal to I into 2 and if I done this by
getting 10 but let's say if I go with
some other values so let me just go with
some different types so this is this is
this is working right so let me move
this part and let's say we call will go
for byte so it's a byte be initially the
value of five 21 now I want to add not
add let's say this value is instead of
one we'll put it 8 okay so I will say a
white B equal to 8 and I want to
multiply this number by 2.5 it is it
possible let's try if I say B into 2.5
and you have to go we are getting a
was the error here so if you go here it
says in compatible types okay so it says
when you multiply a byte by a double
value it will give you a double value
right it is inclusive conversions so
output for this will be double value and
the double value will be 2.5 HP logano
HD 20 so the answer should be twenty
nine twenty point zero but hold on can
be stored 20.0 in B of course we can't
write even if you lose the even if you
lose this zero it will store twenty
right that means what we can do is we
can just cast it with bite it's still
not working because you cannot convert
from double to bite do we have any other
solution so what what about if I what if
you 45 I write something in this way so
after this new line I will say B into
equal to 2.5 even if you write this
thing instead of this it should give you
error right because both are same let's
try to write this so B into equal to 2.5
here we go we are not getting any error
that means this two line here they are
not same this is giving you error this
is not and if you try to print the value
of B now and if you run this then search
20 okay so this is not same it's because
whenever you multiply directly it will
actually go for the act the whole value
so the type will be the whole value but
in case of the shorthand what it goes
for let's say we have a e1 and a
operator which is your plus operator in
this multiplication operator in this
scenario and you have a 2 the answer
will be always for e 1 or the type will
be always fall even so in this scenario
your expression goes in this way it is B
into 2.5 so multiplication is the
operator here B is expression 1 and 2.5
is X
- so the type of the answer will be the
first one so type goes with E one cool
so the answer type will be even and
that's so that's that's the difference
between your shorthand and the
assignment or normal operators cool so
that's all about your short hands so
