ready from those car landings and in
this video we'll talk about hibernate
relations now if you are coming from the
data base background you know what I'm
talking about right so we have different
relations to work with right so we have
one to one we have one to many we have
made too many right so one cable can
have its record Xindi so let's imagine
we have employees and we have department
table so normally what we do is so one I
mean one department will have multiple
employees so that means they have one
department multiple employees which
means one-to-many and if you look at
look at from the employees perspective
it is many employees work for same
department that is for this many to one
right then we have laptops so I own one
laptop so which means one to one and one
laptop can belong to any one person
right so there is one to one but but
let's say if you go to a library when
you have buy multiple you have lots of
books so the same book can be I mean so
multiple people can use the same book I
mean they can you know in rotation basis
or one person can take multiple books
because multiple people can work with
multiple books that is called as made of
many right so you know all this stuff
comes from data from the database world
right so that's not the whole topic here
though the whole thing is how can you
implement those things in hyper night
because that we can do in SQL right and
we are expert in that we can create all
those primary key foreign key stuff in
SQL
how about hibernate let's try to do that
here so you can see we have two examples
here the first one is we have a class
laptop which has this two records we
have Li D and L name and then we have we
have student class here which has roll
number name and marks and these are two
different entities right and you can see
I am using a notation which is identity
and identity which means we'll be
getting two supplied tables all together
one will be laptop and one will be
student right so let's imagine this is
those tables so we have laptop table
where we have Li D and we have L name
then we have student table where we have
roll number name and marks which is your
columns here and again we have roll
number as the primary key
and then we have your lig as your
primary case of this column and this
column are your primary keys right but
let's say now I want to create a
relationship so a laptop so let's say
student will have a laptop object and
can we do that and of course we can do
that right so imagine this is the class
and again we have some Gators inside us
here the way we normally do so on both
the end we have getters and setters now
let's say in this student class if I am
creating object of laptop because every
student will have a laptop right so what
we'll do is we'll say private and that
will be laptop and then we'll be having
laptop okay by any mean if you are
thinking that we have a different font
altogether
so this thing is written by someone else
and I am writing this this stuff here so
you will find it a different points that
so now what I am doing is I am creating
one more object here which is laptop
right so we have a laptop object here
which is which is inside your student
class now how will it impact your table
so now since we have one more column
there what we'll be doing again you
guessed it right again we have to create
a fallen key and the primary condition
ship here so this class will have one
more I mean this table will have one
more column here and that will be your L
ID right so we will be having a laptop
here let's say let's imagine we have
laptop one and then laptop name is Dell
and then we have roll number one let us
say this is one zero one rule number one
name is let's say Naveen and then I am
saying marks equal to 50 and then n ID
which is your one zero one which
specifies that we have a relationship
between this laptop and a student where
this is your foreign key from your
laptop table right so so yes that's how
you can relate to that Naveen Reddy has
it has a laptop which is Dell laptop
right so that's how you can create
one-to-one but will it work directly not
exactly
to achieve this sum well here just about
your object declaration you have to
mention and
which is called as at one-to-one okay
this this Oh is capital here so you have
to use an annotation called as one to
one so one student will have only one
laptop so student table will get
affected and you have to mention that
Alya their simple right so when you have
one object one laptop object in student
table that's how you do it
now let's say I don't want to use one
laptop so in fact either student or as a
professional I have multiple laptops
let's say I have one del 1 HP laptop and
one MacBook so if you have three laptops
here I cannot use one object here right
I have to use a list of laptops so what
we do now is instead of having a normal
laptop entry here let me go for list of
laptops again we have okay that's your
paint marks but let's say if I create
private and we say list of laptop and
then we'll say laptops again when you
change all these things you do have to
change the getters and setters again
we'll see that in the in the practicals
how do we do that but time in what you
are focusing is those photoshop so when
you have one student with multiple
laptops and for this scenario you have
to use an annotation called as
one-to-many because one student will
have multiple laptops right so you have
to use annotation which is one too many
again without any space so it is act
one-to-many that means one student will
have many laptops but in this scenario
how will you update your tables because
say this will not work because one
student will have multiple laptops let's
say we have laptop 1:02 here which is HP
and 1120 buys I mean has both the
laptops how can you how can you mention
that here you cannot say 1 0 2 comma 1 0
I mean 1 0 1 comma 0 2 right and you
can't even have two records here because
zone number is a primary key so you
cannot say one naveen 51 0 2 because
none of us are prime
so it will give you error so in this
situation what we normally do is let's
not change this table so this table will
be independent so storing table will
have its own records and laptop will
have its own record there will be one
more table which will be called as
student under schoo laptop so there will
be one more table for restaurant as for
laptop in this table you will be having
two columns the first column would be
student or in fact roll number because
that's your primary key so it will be
having the old number and the second
column would be L ID now the entries
would be it is 1 then 1 0 1 then 1 1 0 2
let's say if you have one more showing
here which is one number 2 and his name
is let's say Aarthi and then the marks
is let's say 56 and then I am using 1 0
3 here which is Mac Book which is let's
say Mac Book okay and let's say Aarthi
has only one laptop here which is mac
book so what we'll do is we'll say 2 &amp;amp; 1
0 3 so you can see we have a table here
which is used for the mapping so this is
a different table called as student
laptop which has a which has all the
relationship entries right because we
cannot do that here but hold on we have
a solution for that right instead of
creating a new table what if you can
just change your laptop table I mean
something like this what if some guys
here I don't have a place to do that
let's say I am just creating a column
column you it should be at the end but
let's say since we don't have a place I
will created here
can I create a whole number column here
so this is your primary key okay can I
create order number column here and
every locked laptop will be defined so
this this laptop belongs to so number
one this laptop belongs to remove on
this laptop belong so number two simple
white so instead of having the entry in
the another another table we can have
the entry in laptop itself but hold on
how it will work because student table
knows that it has laptop entry your
laptop class don't know that it is rated
to student how will this column will be
created so you have to mention in your
laptop class that every laptop belongs
to a student so for that I will be using
private student and then we'll say let's
say stood again if you don't do this if
you don't write this the the output
would be laptop table without this
column student table and then student
underscore laptop table but if you do
this if you write private student I mean
private student stood now this class
will know that we have a column or we
have a field here of which you have to
connect a column right but again we are
fetching the whole number right so this
should know that we are going for a
relationship and the way you can do that
is with the help of act
many-to-one
annotation so when we use add may to an
annotation which means that this this
laptop class is responsible to create a
column from the student sorry from the
student table and that will be roll
number right so in this shouldn't you
have to mention one too many you have to
mention that and in laptop you have to
mention may two one now if you if you do
this if you run this code the expected
output is laptop table with this column
student table with this field there will
not be any extra table right but hold on
it will not work you will be getting
extra table as well even if you don't
want that your shouldn't shouldn't we'll
say here you asked me to create
one-to-many it is my job to create that
table laptop will say you have mentioned
many to one it is my job to add this
column
why both are doing that again ego
problem maybe so you have to mention to
your student class that the mapping is
done by laptop so you do not have to do
it now how can you mention that you can
mention here
mapped by property so you can say mapped
by and in double quotes you have to
mention the name of the field which is
stood so if you right studio you are
mentioning to your laptop
I mean you are measuring to your student
table or shouldn't class that I am doing
one too many that's perfect
but the mapping is done by laptop don't
do it by yourself that means if you do
this it will not create an extra table
it will go for in two tables laptop and
student and you'll be having the entry
at the end of the stand the end of this
table which is roll number okay so
that's how you use one-to-many a
one-to-one one-to-many many-to-one but
how about many to many how we can do
that let's say so we were having one
student will have multiple laptops and
then laptop will have one student but
what if you have many to many
relationship so one student can use
multiple laptops and multiple laptop can
belong to one student that's right so
multiple laptop can be used by multiple
students so we have many to many
relationship here to achieve that
instead of using stood or student wait
to create a list of student so we say
list of student and I say this is stood
since obvious joint will say stood now
this time we have laptops which has
multiple students and we have student
which has multiple laptops so we cannot
use one-to-many Omega one here we need
to use many too many and here as well
you have to mention many too many now
again if you like made to many and made
to many without this map by both the
classes or both the tables will be
having their subordinate table so if you
don't write mapped by what it will do is
laptop will create laptop table students
will create student table but laptop
will also create laptop underscore
student table and student will create
student underscore laptop table so in
total they are getting four tables we
don't want that right the mapping should
be done with only one table now this
will not be a this will not be
applicable because one laptop can have
multiple students so we cannot do that
so we need to use a mapping table
which is which will be called as let us
say laptop underscore student right and
you can achieve that with the help of
mapped by property on attribute so
that's how you use one-to-many
many-to-one May to mind all the stuff so
in the next video we'll be talking about
the practical implementation of it so I
hope you like this video how exactly it
works let me know in the comment section
if you if you have some issues with this
and yeah that's it thank you so much for
