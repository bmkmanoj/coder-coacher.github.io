interview question so again we'll go for
the guess the output type of code now so
what we'll do is let's create one more
variable which is I and let's keep a
value car let's say 10 okay
now if I say 10 ok if I print the value
of I and if I have this code so you can
see there on your strand right but what
happens if I write 0 and X so when you
will write 0 and X before the number
okay
let's instead of printing 10 lets me
print 9 ok so 0 X 9 and if you run this
code
the answer is 9 right so it is simply
ignoring this first two first two
letters isn't it let's try a different
number so let's try with 1 0 and if I
run this I get into a debugging mode I'm
back to a running mode so if I run this
file the answer is 16 oh why I'm getting
16 here is a test so what will be the
twist let's try to write some other
number let's try to write a now if you
write a they are size 10
okay how can you save a in end the thing
is when you write 0x before a number on
a character it will convert that number
into hexa decimal
Cemal number okay we can say a
hexadecimal so whenever you write 0x it
it will treat that number as a
hexadecimal code okay so it will be a
small code and that it will it will save
in a integer format for decimal format
so let's say if you say a it will store
so it is a in existence it stands right
and that's why you're getting the output
has done how about if you write B of
course B will be Levin right so you fill
on this the answer is Levin
what about a a or not a a let's say F F
so f F is so when you talk about F F in
existing one so f is for once and again
next f is for once
so it will convert this number into the
into the integer format so
but this number into integer format from
binary to disk to decimal it will give
you the answer as 255 okay and if you
run this does the output so pointy
remember whenever you write 0x before
the number before a number that will
become a hexa decimal number so what if
I write G again will give me errors
because G is not a part of hexadecimal
system so the magazine or you can have a
self so that is from this video for more
interview question do subscribe and
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
