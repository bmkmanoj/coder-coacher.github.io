finally our projects so maybe you are
doing BSC IT or if you are doing
engineering or complete engineering so
this is for you now when we talk about
finally our project you know you have
lots of concerns first of all this is
your first finally approaching of course
if you are not not repeating the EO so
you are doing this this poly pearl for
the first time right and we have lots of
questions I so will be doing will be
dealing with lots of questions of at
least five to six questions in this
video so the first video we talked about
is what are the X power why we do this
project now why we are doing this
project pillar will talk about any
course maybe be a CIT may be engineering
so when all these courses or maybe BCA
in all these courses what we have is we
have lots of subjects of approximately
will be dealing with 20 subjects and
then at the angel they want to test can
we make a software because of course
after completing your graduation you
will be called as IT professional
programmer so of course you should know
how to make a software since then so
they they give you a task which you have
to create a project and then you have to
submit now creating of project is not
just programming you know when you talk
about getting a project you have to
follow those seven or got seven you have
to follow some software engineering
model software element model which is
hdl-c which is software development
lifecycle so if you follow waterfall you
have to follow seven steps if you follow
it right you have to do little tasks so
it's not just programming it's all about
taking the requirements analyzing the
requirements then creating upload
degrading design and then making that or
implementing things then you have to
test you have to deploy you have lots of
steps wise it's not just typing ok so
it's all about it's all these steps so
they want to check your skills of making
a software so that was the first
question the second question is oh what
topics are you select or what are the
expectations the first expectation you
have is you need a good marks and of
course when you have a project for 200
marks or 400 marks
quite a good project right so there will
be lots of expectation from your side so
you have to build a big project so when
you say big what is big do you think
what that is big
of course not twice a small application
which not just what the application does
it's the overall features it provides so
when you talk about the whatsapp it
provides the communication between two
people it provides communication between
one to many it provides communication
between you know if you have a number of
a person you can contact them directly
so it's a you know which it's a very big
application not for this size as per the
requirements so you can have you can do
multiple tasks using whatsapp next a
which stopping up select I mean what
type of topic ever select so I will
suggest don't go for any management
projects okay to be specific don't go
for management projects because you know
it was here mm - I guess when in India
we have this post-bac IT originally come
to engineering so if you talk about that
course you know initially when no one
was knowing about IT and then these
people the students at that time they
were making this management software's
it was new everyone was happy making
that those software's in fact your
college teachers now they are those air
pass-outs
so they know how to make a management
software so they have already created
that software and then we are going for
the same generation so every every year
everyone wants to create a management
software but when I say management soft
I'm talking about with lab management
software attendance management software
maybe books management solve it all the
software it's something very new
something very different which is not
dead in the market now this is weird
when you say something which is not
there in the market what is that
something you know we when you go to
play store you know and then in your
real life you feel this is the app I
want this is not there in the Play Store
why don't you get at an example I need
an app which will write down my problem
what I want maybe I want a software
which will record this screen but from
not my laptop from a different laptop so
something in this way my one of my
creating they are working on projects so
they are making some software I want to
record this thing from my machine
something in that way there might be
some app there might be some app but
maybe I don't know what about what I
don't know what which app is that so if
you can tear that up for me I am very
happy so there is something which you
want make an app that will be your final
project make sure it is something big to
show you should show to the right of
external examiner okay so it should be
something big next which technology to
choose it's all depend upon this topic
you select so let's say you want to make
a website you want to make an Android
app you maybe want to make a is app so
of course what iOS you will not use Java
for iOS you not use PHP so it's all
depend upon which technology or what you
say what I what is your topic so if you
want to let's say you want to create a
app for and for iPhone so let's say you
want to create your own messaging app
for iPhone so yeah of course you have to
select Swift or object you see you don't
have another choice I mean you can use I
guess the name was you can use C sharp
with the for iPhone I guess it is
zomling some sort of IDE you have to use
but other otherwise you don't you cannot
use Java within iOS or you cannot use
PHP iOS so you have to be very specific
so if you are making a iOS application
so in technology is fixed you have to
work with sip a swift or object you see
on what you have example but if you are
working on Android application so for
the Android so let's say you want to
make an app for Android Play Store so in
that way you have to you have to use
either Java or we can use I guess we can
also use jQuery you can create a not a
native application but if there is a
website already present you can create a
mobile app for that using jQuery I guess
we use PhoneGap or Cordova something
maybe some there are some apps using
which you can do that but if you want to
create a native application specifically
for Android so you can use Java you can
use Java and XML
so which is combined to from Android so
if you have making another application
of course you have to choose Android
next if you want to make a website now
you know there are lots of people they
say to create a website you have to use
PHP we can use Ruby we can use Java
which is best it's all depend upon the
type of website you want to build so
let's say you want to build a banking
application so of course you have to use
some secured platform or if you want to
create a social app on your website so
you need a stability if you want to
create a normal website product aligns
where you have the requirement specific
requirements you can use PHP ok and of
course PHP is simple everyone knows PHP
you will get lots of health of your
college because all your professors will
be knowing PHP problem starts when you
want to create something very stable
because PHP is not - capable when you
compared with Ruby and Java so let's say
you want to make something very stable
so at that time you can you use Ruby of
course if you know about weight also
Twitter uses Ruby right so you can make
our website using Ruby advantage will be
the first advantage you will you will
know a new technology there will be lots
of vacancies after your graduation for
the Ruby so that will be advantage of
using Ruby but you want to create a
stable application and secure
application you can go for Java now but
a lots of drawbacks with Java also first
drawback there is a big learning curve
you have to learn lots of technology to
work with Java you know there's
something else PHP you have you have you
want to build something go to Google
search for it something you will get
exact code for PHP same goes for Ruby
same goes for Java but to implement the
same thing in Java is very difficult so
you should know the what you say or this
tax went before implementing any Java
but that one is also advantages maksim
websites in fact Google all these
websites they work on Java I'm not
talking about the front end of the
website talking about the enterprise
layer so if you talk about different
different layers so if we talk about the
enterprise level of all these websites
they are they're working on Java
in fact Twitter Twitter was initially
built on
being but now the Twitter back-end works
on Java so for future you can you can
make a project on in Java okay so that
is which technology to choose second
should we make it live so let's say you
are making an Android app so maybe
you're making this fall you're learning
maybe you're making this one up light
all you want to earn from this so if you
are making it for yourself all we are
making for it quit for a client or
making it to learn something what you
can do is create an Android app and make
sure you deploy that app on Play Store
okay because there is no use of just
making an app and not using it right you
will be getting a different level of
confidence when you host something on a
Play Store you know you can say I have
an app in play store so let's say when
you're going for an interview after your
graduation so they will ask you know why
we should hire you you can simply say go
to pleasure and watch my or see my all
these apps and just to take it seriously
and I don't show that it you to your
interview but you know it when you when
you host those apps on your Play Store
you will get that conference
if you're making a iOS app you have to
host it to Apple App Store the problem
is when you host it on Google Play Store
you have to pay around $25 $25 on Apple
it is approximately $99 so yeah so you
have to pay next week of making a
website now if you are making a website
in PHP you will be getting the free
hosting service there are lots of
websites which would provide free
hosting if we talk about Ruby we don't
have much free hosting service for Ruby
so you have to buy silver same goes for
Java but let's say you want to host it
for free so the now there there are lots
of good free services and when I say
free services for small application they
are free okay if you are creating
something very big is not free for
enterprising application no service for
is for free how about for educational
purpose if you are creating a small
application small website you can go for
free service and this this please
provided by big companies so you have
Google so Google have their own cloud
service where you can host your website
which is App Engine in fact Red Hat they
have the owner cloud service which is
OpenShift
or we have Amazon which is AWS so you
can select any of this I guess for
Amazon you have you're getting one year
for free after that you have to pay for
the paper use for App Engine I don't
think it's you have to pay now you have
to pay for extra services but for an
open shift you will be getting three
gears from free now if I don't know what
just gives it simple
oh my SQL is one gear tomcat is one gear
if you are using testing tools that one
gear so in total you will be getting
three gears for free okay so don't
there's no worry for that because for
small application what you need you
require Tomcat you require mask you all
those things now so you can host your
website on open ship for free right and
make sure when you make a project you
host it because if you don't host your
websites you know when you when you have
external example on your college for the
inspection for your checking on your
project then we check your project
because they have what you say they have
some factors in their mind if it is a if
it is something very innovative plus
then if it is a built on a good
technology lust and if you host it if it
is live you know it will make a
different impact on their money too so
you will get some extra bucks okay so
you make sure you host it now how to
host an on Android Play Store it's very
simple create account on Play Store
there will be some steps they will show
you the steps deployed for iOS no idea
have no never hosted a app on iOS so you
can just go to some video tutorials on
YouTube and check how to host on iOS but
for websites you can host our Ruby
website pH we have site and job site for
free on open shipped so are you making
videos on that also how to host our
website on open shaped in the puzzle to
toriel's so that's it that's how you
have to build your file your project so
thanks for watching and make sure you
