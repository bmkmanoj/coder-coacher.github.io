ready and in this video we'll see the
implementation of linq list in the
earlier videos we have talked about why
do we need linked list and what is
linked list so let's try to implement
that with the help of Java language can
you can implement that concept with any
language which you love in this video
we'll focus on Java we have two sections
on this screen we have on the left hand
side we have Eclipse IDE can you can use
any ID which you prefer you can use
IntelliJ you can use NetBeans and i will
be using eclipse here on the right hand
side I have a paint so that if I want to
show you anything any diagrammatical
representation of that whatever we are
doing you can see on the right hand side
so what exactly we need so just to make
a quick recap what we have learnt in now
is when you talk about linked lists we
have representation like this we have
node now these are nodes right so let's
create a first node here so these are
first node and let's say I want to store
values like 5 12 6 9 I don't know why I
love these numbers and let's say we have
8 so I want to store these 5 values
that's it nothing fancy just 5 values in
a linked list so in English what we do
is we create individual nodes so all
these things are called as nodes right
so this is a node and then we'll create
another node so this node will have a
value which is 5 and then we'll be
having another node here which is let's
say value 12 and this this node will
have some address that we'll be having
one more node here let's say 6 so this
is 6 we have one more node here which is
9 again I'm doing it purposefully
creating the objects anywhere and then
let's say we have 8 here so we have all
this nodes here so this node which is a
5 will be linked with 12 we have to find
a way to link this to nodes and then we
have to find a way to line these two
nodes and then and this node and this
node this is what we are going to do so
once we can link this node in future if
you want to add some new elements you
can do that very easily every node will
have two things of value so this is your
value and this is your address now this
is an address of the next node now in c
programming we can use pointers but in
java what we do is we create a reference
of the next object java is all about
objects right so of course this node is
also object so this is the first object
so you can say this is the first object
this is the second object so the first
object
we'll have a reference of the second
object the second object will have a
reference of the third object now again
we don't number them but then every
object will have a reference of some
other object the last object here will
have nothing it will have null right so
we don't have any other object after
that so will be having null maybe after
some time we'll add one more node the
reference of that node will be assigned
here so let's try to implement this so
what are the things we need here so
let's see what are things with knitting
Java Java perspective so of course we
need we need to create objects right so
before getting the object we need to we
need to use a plus so the first class we
need is an old class because an old
class will have two things an old class
will have a data and an old class will
have the next node so data will be of
type int again it you can have any data
you want you can have a string data you
can have any object may be 8 an object
may be a count so object may be a laptop
object your your wish and then the next
node will be of type node itself because
this will refer to the next node a node
plus so this is a class which has two
things we have a data and unknown then
what are the class we need we need a
linked list class right because linked
list class will have certain features
because when you talk about linked list
it has certain methods example we are
going to look at insert so we look at
insert now insert will add data at the
end so let's say if I specify data as 5
it will add that at the end of the at
the least
what if you want to add in between so
you will say insert and you will say
insert at I want to put specify the
position let's say I want to specify
position 3 and all the index the value 3
and the value is let's say 12 so I want
to add 12 at this location 3 maybe I
want to add element at the end so I will
say insert or maybe Ida start we already
done with the right so it's an insert
start so I want to insert at start so
you can say I want to insert at the
start which is 18 so it will add at the
start so this will add at the end this
will add at in between and this will at
the start you maybe want to delete the
data as well so you can also use a
delete method and then it you have to
specify the index like specify the index
as 2 so it will delete the element at
index value - these are the options I
want to perform in my class and then to
run this of course we need a class which
has a main method so we'll
main method in which you will be doing
all this operations so you will be
having mean and then a mean will have
all the execution it will have a linked
list object and then using that
increased object you can perform all
these operations and then oh if you also
want a show method right so show method
will display all the elements so if you
want display all the elements you can do
that so this is where this is what you
will be doing here
so in total we need three classes here
so this is the first class we want to
work with this second class we want to
work with and the third class so let's
create this three classes in our Java
code so let's do that
so I will say it right click and let me
create a Java class here I would say
this class name as note because the
first thing which we are going to do is
node now this node will have two things
as we have discussed the first thing it
will have is the index value
I guess the font is not visible it means
do that so now I would say this node
will have the first thing which is the
int DITA and as I mentioned you can use
any data you want you can go for ain't
float double alien-type I did it any any
complex type if you want and the next
thing is the node itself so the node
object which is next so this node is a
reference so this next is the reference
for the next node quite simple right so
we have public class node and we have
these two things nothing fancy here we
got just two things you can make it more
efficient you can write you can make it
display with private variables and you
can use gala setters but then just to
keep it simple I am doing a simple and
doing this code the next thing we need
is a class which is called as linked
list but what if okay let's get a main
class first I will say the main class
and the main class name will be Donna I
mean you can have any name doesn't
matter we have another class which has a
main method
now what if or maybe I don't want to
create my own list I want to use the
inbuilt feature so in fact in collection
API you do have a linked list as a class
so you can say linked list I will say
least equal to new linked list in fact
you can use the internal one as well you
can simply use this class and you can
say least dot we have an ADD method so
using and you can specify which object
you want to add maybe I want to say I
want to add five so this same as the
thing which we are going to do we are
going to use insert yeah and then we'll
be having least dot add
you can specify the next value where you
want to add let's say I want to add the
index and wait for and you can add the
element as lesser 12 so the same thing
which we are doing here maybe in the x
value 3 which we're talking about and
then you can also delete element so you
can say least or delete we have removed
so we have limo we can specify the index
value the method which I'm going to use
is delayed and then do we have a show
method we don't have a show method here
but we have size okay we are we are
missing size there we'll be doing that
later and okay we don't have the show
method here but then we have iterator
using which you can fetch all the values
in fact you can print the entire list at
least as it is that will work this is
how you work with lists but then I don't
want to use the internal implementation
I want to go for mine own implementation
so of course we need a class so I would
say the class name is linked list itself
again don't get confused with the name
which we are using and which is provided
by Java I'm going for the same name but
since they're in different package we
can have our own class names now this
class need to have certain methods right
even before creating a method here what
I'm going to do is every least we'll
have one thing and that one thing is
okay so how do you know that this is a
first node now remember we use a concept
of a head node so the first node will be
referred as head node and where do we
define it so in the list itself I can
say I have a node which is which I will
call as head node so this will refer to
the first node okay that's it so we got
that node there let's implement the
functions first of all this code is
difficult to understand it in the first
go what I would say is watch the entire
video and then try it by yourself so it
may be you'll be watching this video two
to three times so make sure that you
also practice this that's where you will
get this concept okay so let's let's
start the first method so the first
method we want to go for is insert so
let's do that so I would say public void
insert that's the first one I want to go
for and this will accept integer value I
would say integer our data itself so
this is what I'm expecting from the user
now this data I want to assign to a node
so whenever you call or insert what we
have to do is we have to first create a
node so what I will do is I will just
clear this up so let's use this
area here on this side so what we are
going to do is every time you say insert
you will be creating a new node so it's
kind of node here and this node will
have a value which is which is whatever
value we are passing so what we are
going to do here is let's create a new
node and then the way you create a new
node is by saying node and let's name
that node as node itself and we'll say
no no this is how you create object
right so we got a node there the moment
you say node node equal to new node this
is what you will be getting in your
memory the next thing we have to mention
is two values of it so we'll say no dot
data the data bit is coming from the
user so what do i user is passing let's
say every user pass five the node will
get the value five just to make it more
realistic what I will do is I will also
create in the object of least the linked
list here in the mean so it's a linked
list linked list our name this as lease
itself equal to new linked list and in
this linked list
I have only one method right which is
app which is insert this insert will
take a value let's say let's say I'm
passing five so this method will call
five I will it will pass five and that
Phi will be assigned to a node which
means this node here it will be having a
value which is five that's simple right
and by default the value of this one
will be null so we got our first node
but then it is possible that this is our
first node because what we are expecting
is when you say insert it will add the
data at the end so if you already have a
list with you it will simply add data at
the end but what if you don't have a
data itself I mean you don't have a list
itself this is your first node in that
scenario you have to check because if
this is your first node then the head
will be head would be null right because
by default the value for this head is
null so if your if it is your first
object this is the first object we are
inserting so head is null so will verify
if the head is equal to null in this
case I would say they no itself is a
head so we'll say he'll equal to node so
the first node itself is a head but what
if that that is not a scenario what if
you do it this is not your first node we
already have some nodes there in that
case we will go for the else part so the
first case we are checking is what if
your head is null so then when you say
head is null it means you don't have any
nodes in the list
so what about you
are adding is a first node in that case
we got the node by default the next
value is null in fact you can if you
want to make it more readable you can
you can assign that to null even if you
don't do that that's fine because by
default the value for the object is null
but then this looks more readable right
so you can do that so if it is the first
object does become your head but what if
this is not the first object in that
case you will create a node and you will
make it as head ok now why I'm doing
this it's because let's imagine you
already have at least so let's say if
you have multiple nodes here we got
record 6 and in fact let's go back to
the original original diagram now you
can see if I'm adding a node in between
or somewhere here so let's say I'm
adding a new node which is which is
let's say ok the value which I'm passing
here is not let's say not 5 it is a it
is it's 18 I am passing 18 now so we got
a new node and of course this is not the
first node which which we are adding so
head is pointing to 5 so in this case
what it will do is it will create it
will assign the value here which is 18
right we got 18 value here but then this
is getting added at the end right but
that means after 8 what you do is we
have to first check which is the last
element how do I know which is the last
last element and that's where you have
to start with the first location so from
the first location you will you will
travel from one first location to the
last location and now that is tricky
right how do we travel is it that easy
no it's not that easy but just try to
understand so from the first one it will
go to head first and using head will
jump to the next node so from the second
node you will jump to the third node
from the second third node you can jump
to the fourth node and then fifth node
and then but how do we stop where do we
stop so we have to stop the moment you
get null as the next value okay now this
is this looks simple so to traverse we
have to use you have to use a node write
a temporary node which will hold the
data and that is let's say n here so
we'll say while n dot next since we have
to traverse between different node so
we'll use a while loop so we will travel
till you got a null value the moment you
get a null value the value will stop so
how do we travel so what we are doing is
we are saying n dot next equal to null
so we have a temporary
we have a tempeh no deer let's let's
imagine doing that note I'm creating
that note here this is template note and
I will call this note as n now this node
will first refer to the head node so it
will refer to the head node and then
head node will check do we have a null
value who you know we don't have a null
value we have the address of the second
node in this case the reference of
second node so it is not null okay so
then if you have to jump from here to
here now how do we jump so to jump what
we will do is we will change earlier
this was referring to this node right
now we have to refer to this node now
how will you get this node it's very
easy you will say n is equal to n dot
next so now you are jumping between
nodes so if it is not null let's jump a
second node if this is not null let's
jump to third node and using a while
loop we can do that now this will stop
the moment to get null at the end now
once you got the null what you will do
is once you got this null here you have
to change this value you have to change
from null here so you do this is no not
null anymore so this will refer to the
new node which you have created now how
will you do that so to do that we have
to say n dot next is equal to the new
node which we have created that means
the value of this node because the
current end value is referring to these
this this node right again this is the
tricky part in in Java you have to you
have to work with objects so imagine
when the loop gets over so at this
location when the loop gets over you are
here at this node yeah you have you are
here at this node now we had what you do
is you have to just change this null to
the next node whichever you have so this
next this is a new node right so this is
a node in in our case so the value of
node will be assigned to the current
node dot next which is this value so
this will be replaced by the node
reference so you don't have a null
anymore and this is null by default now
if you can see the code here we have a
null value here right okay this looks
cool now this is how you insert value
can be verify now even if you can verify
we don't have a way to print all the
values right so I will I will insert the
data and also I will also try to print
it now how do I print it we can use
show method to print all the values I
will say public void show to print all
the values and how do I print the values
so we will use some methods to play we
will use some statements to print here
now how do you print the values the same
steps you have to travels from between
all this nodes now how will you travel
between all this nodes is you have to
say node n again you can say node node
not equal to head so initial you have to
start with head and then you will be
using a while loop we have to travel
right so when you want to travel you
will use a while loop so I will say n
dot no dot next is not equal to null
this is how you travel and then so while
traveling you will print the data of the
node so it will say system dot out dot
println and you will print the date of
the node so you will say no dot data
that's it this is what you are going to
do and every time you print it you just
have to shift in the next node and the
way you can push it to the next node is
by saying not equal to no dot next this
is all your shift now see this loop the
same loop so say if I look the only
thing is which the only thing which are
doing here is we are printing it that's
it okay I hope this will work but let's
try so what I will do is I will insert
not one value of insert 3 to 4 values so
it's a least dot insert and I will
insert 45 as well and I will Solis dot
insert I would say 12 ok let's add 3
values and at the end I will say least
dot show I hope this will work now so
let's run this code write like and say
run as java application and we call oh
we got the output but with one mistake
you are getting 18 and 45 that's perfect
we are not getting 12 so what's wrong
is it not hitting added or is it not
getting printed I think is not getting
printed is because you are traversing
till null right the moment you get null
you are stopping it in this case we only
have three nodes so in this case we only
have three nodes let me draw that here
so we got the first node as 18 the
second node as 45 and the third node as
12 so you got this three nodes right so
this node is referring to this note that
means this is not a null value so this
is not null even this is not null but
this okay this is referring to this
object right so this is null so this
here is null so it will stop as soon as
you get null
oh okay that's weird that means we are
not printing this one but we are
reaching to this point right so when you
say it will print data it will not print
data which has an object which is null
in that case let's just do it manually
subsea system dot out dot println and I
here I will say no dot not dot data so
for the last element you have to print
it man outside the loop because it will
not get in printer in the loop itself
now let's run the loop run the code and
you can see we got those three beautiful
values so just just to make a quick
recap what we have done we have created
two methods here one is insert and one
is show and insert what we are doing is
we are creating a node because that's
what we do every time you say insert it
will create a new node and that node
will have a value which is whatever data
you are passing will be assigned to that
node now if you want me to go for a
quick run through of this we can use a
debugger so what we will do is we'll use
a debugger here and let's apply a
breakpoint this is where I want to apply
a break and then I will run this on
debug mode always run as okay with a
debug mode let's see yeah and let's jump
to the locations so we'll say f5 and i-5
will take two enough next thing so what
we are doing is the moment you got a
linked list so I will just draw it here
so the moment you got a linked list it
will create the first element so when
you say insert so insert what it is
doing is it is saying it will create a
new node for you so here it will create
a new node okay we got a node there and
then we are saying okay it will go to
node class it will take those two values
and then you assign the data so data is
18 can you see that it's 18 and we got
18 yeah and the ID for this is 22 so let
me just write 22 somewhere so record 22
so the value is 18 and the value ID is
22 and then it is saying null so next
one is null here and then it is saying
it is null is the header element null he
has by default is null so head is null
here right height is by default null in
this case this becomes your head so
hedges head will point to this oak
location now and then it will go it will
not go to L spot because if got executed
it will jump back to the second value
which is 45 so in this case it will try
to insert 45 so the same step it will
get a note for you if I jump into this
you can see the screen and you know
and with those two beautiful values
which is data and next it is a thank
data which is 45 so we got 45 here and
then the next value is so this is null
now when you send now it will jump to
the next location is it is it head null
no it is not null right because head is
pointing to the first node here so if
will not get executed it will execute
the else part and that starts walking
now it will drive us between the
elements right so first we'll jump to
head and check if so it will traverse
the first element itself is null so it
will directly jump to the location here
and you will say the N this dot next so
this value will be replaced by the
reference of the next element which is
20 okay what is the ID for this the ID
for this is this node is 23 so this
builder for 23 now and then it will jump
back to the insert the third block and
will because we haven't we got the
object here with the value 12 the same
steps will happen now it will again go
back it will create the object assign
the data 12 and then this will be null
so the text will be null here and then
it will jump to next it will jump to
head is it so it is null no I just
pointing to the 18th location so it will
not execute the heap if block it will
execute the else block in else block it
will traverse from the head block to the
end block so is is the first block is
null you can say no it's not null so it
will execute it will say jump to the
next location so now n is referring here
now is it null yes it is null you can
see that it is null so the moment you
get null it will execute it will say the
N dot next next is this one so this will
be replaced by the id24 so this the ID
for this object is 24 this whip 24 here
and then you got a link it's that simple
the end of the code and then when the
moment you say show what we are doing in
show is we are jumping from one location
of the location so while so it will
start with the head location and it will
check is it null no it's not null so
let's print the value so it will print
the value of 8 which is which is 18 so
we got 18 there you can see the output
console window here we got 18 and then
when you say next you can see it is
printing the next
note now so it is referring to the note
23 is it yeah so now 23 and then it will
print about data of that which is 45 and
now it so the moment I go back you can
see that node ID is 24 now it is
referring to 24 and it will print the
data which is 12 so this is the beauty
of link list now you can add values
anywhere again this is a lengthy video
so what I will do is the remaining part
we'll see in the next video where we
will talk about the other methods which
we have discussed will talk about insert
at insert at start delete and show so
the next one will go faster because we
have seen the difficult part so I hope
you understood something about link list
again you may want to leave watch this
video again so it means in the comment
section if you it was helpful and thanks
