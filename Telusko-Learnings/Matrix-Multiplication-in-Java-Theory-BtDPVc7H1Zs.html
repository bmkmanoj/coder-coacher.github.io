from traditional earnings and in this
video we'll talk about matrix
multiplication then I got lots of
requests on Facebook and you took to
make this video from a long time and
finally I'm making this because one of
my shouldn't is he has an interview in
this week so this one it's you like to
do well let's try to multiply two matrix
using multiply two matrix we're using
Java now before doing this with Java
let's understand how exactly to do
matrix multiplication right there are
lots of student they don't even know how
to do matrix multiplication on paper or
using math so that you can solve it in
Java right so first you have to
understand how to do it in math so that
you can implement this inside in your
programming right so what we'll do is
we'll get two sections okay the right
hand side section will be for maths and
the left hand side section for
programming okay so let's do it
so let's say we have two matrices so
when you say matrix
it is a box format right which will have
two-dimensional arrays which will have
some of those that which will have some
columns so let me take or let me take
two matrices with different different
dimensions again we can have a common
dimension it was very easy but just to
explain you week how can you multiply or
two matrices with different dimensions
let's do it
so let's say we have the first matrices
as m1 okay we can we can give names to
matrices so this mattress is will have
two lows and three columns okay so when
you say two rows so let's say we have
these two blocks and then three columns
so we'll say this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 so this
is a matrix which has two rows and three
columns right so we have two rows and
three columns now how you represent our
metrics in a in this format so you have
to write two into three so which to
represents the number of rows and three
represent number of columns right so
that's m1 then we got em 2 which is
let's say it will have three those okay
it will have three rows and two columns
so let's say this is seven eight nine
ten
eleven and twelve okay we think the same
example in programming after after this
video you have to also watch the video
on your laptop so I will do the same
quote on a laptop animal I will upload
that on YouTube of course up to this
video so we have we have two matrices 23
and this will be of course why this will
be 3 into 2 so we have 3 into 2 right so
you can multiply two matrices so we have
a dimension which is 2 8 2 3 and 3 to 2
so you can multiply two matrices on the
event only when this two are same okay
so you have to make sure that the number
of columns in the first matrix s is same
as the number of rows in the second
metal Isis if that condition matches
then only you can multiply okay my
question is what will do the resultant
matrix or what is the resultant matrix
so let named it as as let's say it we
like it
so internet that's are okay that's the
odd is a resultant matrix here so the
dimension of this matrix will be depend
upon the input dimensions right so this
you have to check for the multiplication
but the output will depend upon the
number of rows of the first matrix and
number of the second matrix which is
this - okay so this will be 2 into 2
okay so that's 2 into 2 there so we have
number of rows here and number of
columns into is it visible that that
lock are visible right there okay so let
me just write it big up so that you get
you to leave easy for you so the diesel
10 box is it okay so this will have the
number of the 0 number of rows here and
number of columns here okay that will be
the output now how do you multiply it so
the next step would be if you want to
multiply M 1 and M 2 you have to take
these two blocks okay same to start with
this one so you have to multiply the
rows with the columns okay so you have
to start with this row and this column
then this slow this column then this row
this car
and this so this column so if you do
that you will get the edge of
multiplication that's what logic right
the another way of looking at it as just
to make it more simple in a when you
work with programming you know this
index numbers right so the index number
for this will be 0 it will be 1 it will
be 0 it will be 1 right so this box here
of course we have 282 right so this box
here has the index number of 0 0 this
one is 0 1 this one is 1 0 and this was
1 1 right so have to go in that way so
if and this one also this is 1 this is 0
this is 1 so this is 0 1 2 so this is 0
1 0 1 2 then we have 0 1 0 1 2008 X
numbers right now to get this block
which is 0 and 0 you have to take this 0
and this 0 right so 0 here and the
column here so you will get this block
to get this block which is 0 and 1 right
0 1 so you have to go with 0 and 1 so
that will be 0 though and the first I
mean if everything though one then and
the column 1 then for this one which is
1 0 you have to go with this row and
this column 1 and 0 and for this one you
have to go 1 and 1 ok so let's multiply
that so take this first row and first
column here so that will come out to be
1 into 7 so 1 into 7 plus 2 into 9 plus
3 into 11 right so once you quench once
you calculate this we will get the first
block ok now but now what about the
second block so this is 1 this is 1 0
right so this is 1 and 0 so it will be 4
into 7 plus 5 into 9 and then 6 into 11
ok so once you calculate this you will
get this block here now what about this
one so that is 1 0 1 by 2 0 1 so it will
be 1 into 8 plus 2 into 10 plus 3 into
12 and the last one this block is 4 and
this digital and this one that calm so
that will be 4 into h plus 5 into 10
plus 6 into 12 now if you calculate this
you will get an output right of course
we have a calculator here you can do
that but I already got an answer for
this
can you I don't want to calculate this
values here okay so you can do that if
you find this calculation the output
would be this will give you 58 the first
block will give you 58 okay what do you
got the answer is the answer now 58 then
this will give you 64 if you calculate
this it will give you 64 then we got one
what is the number is 139 so that's one
three nine here and we got 154 okay
again you can do that again you can find
the calculations but interesting time
add right here so this is what we will
be getting simple so that's how you do
matrix multiplication let's try to
implement the same thing in Java
is it possible of course all right
anything you can do anything in
programming right so let's try it out
now when you say you want to go for the
initial block okay so you have to go for
two matrices right to represent our
matrices in a Java format we have to use
two-dimensional adding okay so we have
our two-dimensional array here which has
two rows and three columns we got two
dimensional array here which has three
rows and two columns right so first you
have to take two arrays so we'll take
ain't adding okay so we can say end and
we can specify it as m1 which is that
since this is two dimensional array so
we'll take this add a block here and now
we'll define and matrix which is to a
divine it to last an array so the first
add inside this will be will have one
two and three will go comma the next
next one will have four five and six
okay let's end it here so that's your
first matrix the second one I guess it
will take lots of space right so let me
just reduce this space a bit of course
when you like coding it will take lots
of space so we didn't write it here
itself so I will take one two three okay
and this would be four five six so I
have taken and
okay this is two-dimensional image has
to address this is this is what we are
representing it then we got this second
and I will say this is m2 which is also
two-dimensional right and in this each
row will have two values I'd so will
take seven comma H does the first row
then we have nine comma then there's the
second one
and then we have lemon comma - al right
so we call this to add is now the how to
multiply this now for sure the output
will have the depend upon so the number
of rows here and the number of columns
here will define your your output right
so the resultant so let's say this is
our this resultant matrix the size of
this since we don't know the value will
take right here so inside in size it
will be 2 comma 2 okay again you can
make it dynamic when you can ask the
input from the user you can ask the the
size of the matrix from the user
okay you can do that but you know I want
to keep it simple I don't want to
include all the scanner that scanner
things here so let's keep it simple I
have taken the value initialized okay
now what next how to multiply this now
any way you want to work with two
dimensional array we know right we
require nested for-loops because using
nested for loops you can actually track
the number of rows and number of columns
so I talks about three to always well
let's try let's do that so we take a for
loop okay and we are going for the
tradition traditional variables which is
I and J so we have I equal to 0 right
and I will anti to because the resultant
is 2 and 2 right so it will take I less
than 2 and then I plus plus will take
one more for loop this will be J will
say J is 0 then Jane is then 2 again
because again we have number of pulses
to light if you just think then you can
make it 3 here so that's the for loop
now what next
it's not just about values if you want
to just assign the values you can do
that right we can say we can say R
of I and J you can make it let's say if
you assign a value I so what will happen
is in the whole met right in the whole
box you will get the values of I but we
don't want the values of I we want the
value which is methylation of this tool
right so when you multiply this to you
are also doing one more task you're
adding the columns right you're adding
this stuff so how you're adding it you
are adding this one with seven okay so
we have we have one more counter here
with the column and the row counter will
be the row and the column counter you
have one more counter which is
responsible for the iteration right so 1
+ 7 2 &amp;amp; 9 &amp;amp; 3 and 11 droid so we did one
more counter to count that stuff so what
we do especially for matrix
multiplication we require one more loop
here okay for the counter and we'll name
this variable as zero I'm sorry okay
okay we'll start with zero and then
kosher eyes till what point till what
point we have to go there so the answer
is till this number okay this is the
number which represents they you know
they come I can you can store all this
number somewhere so you can say this is
this is a this is B this is X and this
is y so a so your P should be equal to X
to multiply to metric to matrix and your
a and by the file will define your
resultant matrix size right so you have
to take your K till three because you
are going one two three one two three
right so your low is x column and the
size of that will define the counter
which is here so it should be less than
three and then k plus plus okay let me
repeat myself so you have to you have to
calculate this number which is to depend
up on your output window which is 2 into
2 so this 2 is this 2 this 2 here which
is the number of columns which is J here
and when you when you want to multiply
it so the number of rows or number of
columns in the first block will define
the K sighs okay now what should be the
operation here
for this we require one more variables
just to stow this Sun right because we
want we want to calculate this sum and
that's what we are storing here right so
we take a variable we just sum and we'll
say sum equal to so since we want to add
it right so this multiplication will be
added with this number and this
multiplication will add it with this
number right the addition of this too so
we take some equals sum plus now we have
to multiply this matrix I'd so we can
say m1 off I'm going up what if you want
to get this so you'll even get this by I
and K right so every time you're
changing case so I of K I of K I of K
right this is K of j KF j and k op j so
you have to say I of K multiplied by say
have to multiply this and m2 of K of J
again there might be lots of question in
your mind why exactly this pattern is
because when you go with this so what is
changing K right and when you go with
this
you're changing K I and J remains same
what changes is K right which is this
value but when you're going from this
you are only changing columns wide you
are not changing the row number that
means your K will change your I will not
change because if first block represent
zero and the second block represents
column right and in this what is
changing is only the row number you are
not change the column number and that's
one K will come first and then you have
to go for J make sense and then once you
have added that once you got this sum
okay now for the next sum for the next
block we need to make sure that your
some okay for first we have to assign
this some base I have to say R of I
comma J notion of assigning I we can say
this is some right so we have calculated
everything and then we have to assign to
the
and after every operation you have to
make some again zero because I don't
want the same some value for the next
block so it will make this sum as zero
and I guess that's it once you run this
loop we have to end this loop here so
much like once you run this loop okay it
will assign all the value so it will
assign all the multiplication or
everything and then you get this block
okay we will get an R which is
two-dimensional added okay and you will
get those values but then question arise
how to print it and printing is very
easy you can use an asked for though
because use normal for them to Pindos
stuff right and how exactly to print
those thing and how to do this you in
Java so we'll see that in the practical
video so this is theory about matrix
multiplication we'll see we'll see the
practicals we'll see the practical in
the next video so I hope you understood
something about matrix multiplication
it's been a long time I have taken any
maths topic so yeah that's it from this
