the duplicate values in analyst so to
print the values let's create an eye
list first we'll say that you have an
array list which is let's say we have a
person's so we have persons instead of
say of names equal to new add a list so
we have an added list here which is
analysts will say type of string and
let's add some values here so it's a
name start add the first one I want to
add here is nubbin and let's print some
more values so here we'll say the next
name is Mangesh and the last name we
have is Rahul okay so I have now I want
to print this value so so we have an
artist with three values to print this
we can use enhanced further up as we
have seen in the earlier tutorials so
we'll say this is string name in names
and we'll print what each name use we'll
say let's print let's print name now if
I run this loop so far sure the output
will be now in monkish and Rahul right
but let's say I just want to print or I
just want to print unique values so what
we can do is or just I want to print
into bigoted values not the unique
values but a duplicate value so let's
say if I have one more munguia so you
will say add monkish I want to print
only magesh not novel in Rahul so if I
run this it will print all the elements
right so I don't want to play in the win
and draw a line I just want to print
mangesh only one time so the way you can
do this is you can create a set because
set only takes unique elements so we'll
say we'll be having a set of string
we'll say s equal to new the
implementation of satis has set which is
this so if you don't know how to use set
and Hansard you can you can check out my
collection playlist so in that you will
see how to use set an asset it's
imported package
and what we'll do is we'll pick up each
name and we'll say if because he in this
set we have a method called as said dot
ad it will take a string argument here
but if you can see the it returns
something it runs a boolean value which
means if your values get added it will
return true if that value is always
there it will return false so what we
can simply do is we can just go here to
say if if s dot add will add a value
which is name if it is equal to equal to
false then only will print the name
otherwise will not print a name and if I
run this you can see out the output is
monkish okay let me add one more thing
let me just repeat one more name is
which is let's say nubbin so if i go
here and say Navon it will run this you
can see we haven't two names which is
monkish and i which are they getting
repainted so how it is working here is
it going for this for loop in which it
is taking the value of it's trying to
add the name inside us side so initially
it will add knowing everything goes well
good it will return true which is not
false it will not print a name it will
in term engage it will not print an
image willing to allow hole it will not
print a name but as soon as you try to
enter or insert monkish it's already
there so this set will give you a false
value when ad and once you get the false
value you have to print it so this is
what we are doing here clear so this is
how you have to print the duplicate
elements in an Ida least cool so that is
