different icicle lightnings and in this
video we'll talk about Kotlin yesterday
Google made car lane as the official
first class language for Android
development so initially people used to
make Android applications using Java C++
and also with Catalan because Java was
the primary language and in the first
class language for Android and then you
can also use C++ and Catalan but now
since sparkling provides you a better
feature compared to Java it is much
easier to learn and it is faster to make
I mean right development right codes
they are making Cortland as the first
class language which means from now you
can choose either Java or you can choose
heartening to work or to make Android
applications
now of course right when Cortland is
easier to work with people will move to
partner Android and maybe if you are if
you are learning currently now so in
future there will be lots of jobs
available for Portland but then is it
Carleen better than Java I mean can we
just compare this to or instead of using
C++ should we go to hot line so what
happened is in 2011 JetBrains the
company who is actually created Android
studio now if you open Android studio
which otherwise when you are working
with now it is made by jet brain so if
you go to IntelliJ and if you go to
Android studio and if you go through the
help menu you can see in about it is
made by IntelliJ or it is based on
integer platform so IntelliJ is a
product which is made by JetBrains so
jaden company have created this language
called hot line which is a flavor of
Java so you cannot say it is totally
different from Java so what they did
they observed out because of course
everywhere we use Java right and the
observe Java and the thought okay Java
is one of the best language because it
works on JVM and trust me everyone loves
JVM other than I mean they are not so
much in love with Java but they love it
in with JVM and since Joe walks on JVM
we love Java what if and of course what
everyone knows that Java is be difficult
to learn so what if you can have
something which is better than Java or
not in terms of performance but in terms
of coding because ultimately when you
write on line when you write a code in
cotton as well it will be cutting
getting converted into a bytecode
so when you write a Java code
when you compile the Java but you get a
bytecode right in the same way when you
write a card in code and if you can if
you compile that code you will get a
bytecode indirectly so performance wise
is not not much of difference but when
it comes to the programming part yes
Cortland is much easier to work with
compared to Java so yes if you are a new
Android developer and if you are
thinking jars be difficult for you you
can switch to coeur d'alene now so from
where you can see where you can do this
so now also be if you have a Android
version maybe two or two point three you
can you can install a portland library i
guess or maybe a plugin so just search
for the plugins and install or download
the Cortland dependency or the library
but then if you if you can wait for some
time Android 3.0 is on the way which is
Android studio 3.0 and Cortland will be
by default inside that so you don't have
to install anything right so use Android
studio 3.0 now it is not yet out I mean
not for everyone and once you've got
that you will get caught late in bed so
that's the news so maybe in future
everyone will move towards Cortland no
but don't worry if you still love Java
Java will be there for a long time okay
and even if you're using quarterly and
indirectly you're working on Java right
so the only thing which will change is
this in technical things and there's one
more thing Cortland also supports
functional programming it is not fully
functional programming but then it
supports functional programming and now
Java 8 also suppose functional
programming so there's not much of
difference but then yes as for the
coding part if you want to make
software's very easily if you want to
increase your productivity you can go
for coeur d'alene so that's it that's
for this video if you want to learn
coding from my channel just let me know
in the comment section I am planning to
make a playlist for card line so that
let me know your thoughts about it so
that's it thanks for watching and do
