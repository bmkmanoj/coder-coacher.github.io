how to create user-defined functions now
in the earlier tutorials we have talked
about printf right so when you whenever
you work with printf so printf is a
function which will print the data you
pass so if you pass hi it will print it
will print it right so printf is a
function but this function is also
predefined which means it simply means
it is the definition for this function
is all it or they present defines
pálinka so it's pretty fine and it is
defined in a study r dot h but in this
example we'll be using what is say a
user-defined function so how to do that
what we'll do is when we talk about
user-defined functions so we have to
follow three steps so we have to say
this is let me write a comment part so
in this you have to mention three things
first is the part which is called a
declaration serve to follow the steps
second you have to say a definition and
then you have to call it so if you have
to mention calling so first why we
declare it then we have to define it and
then we have to call now when you say
you want to create a user-defined
function so the what you say this steps
or this syntax for function will be you
have to define the return type of a
function now your function might return
int it might return flow at all it may
get to it or nothing so if you have if
your function doesn't return anything we
simply write void and we have to define
a function name so using a function
which is called as show so you can name
any fun you can have any name provider
it follows the rule it cannot be it
cannot start with special symbols you
cannot use special symbols for functions
so you have to give a character string
here now you can you can make it work
okay so you have to let's say you want
to playing something so that say you
want to print hi so this is what your
function is doing right so you have your
function show is printing hi but this
step from here to here this is called as
definition
but we are missing a part we are missing
declaration now a way to define so
before the main function or before the
before any function if you say you have
to define this you have to declare this
function how to declare so you have to
again mention the hidden type and you
have to say show but the difference will
be in definition you have to use curly
brackets in declaration you have to
mention or semicolon because you are not
defining it you are declaring it okay so
this is your first step
designing the method and you this is
your second step you define it now once
you're done with the first two step you
have to call this function and how to
call we have to use a function name and
a semicolon
so in calling we don't if we don't
mention the written type and that's what
the main difference between declaration
and calling so make sure you don't
define you don't mention the return type
okay so this is declaration this is the
different definition and this is calling
so if I run this you can see there's
output called as hi okay let me just
string down your line run and you can
see we got the output as high simple so
that's how you have to create a usually
fine function so these steps declaration
definition and calling now there is one
more thing what if I don't declare it so
if I remove this part and run run this
you can see it shows an error okay it
says a implicit declaration of function
show so it goes a sequence I so yeah so
during the sequence you are not
mentioned anything about show so when
your main regions to show it says okay I
am not able to find when you show here
so that's why you have to declare it but
not if you do if you define your
function before main if you define your
function before main then that becomes
that becomes optional cool so we have to
follow this three steps and you can
define your own functions so the next
video will talk about how to define a
function which returns a value so does
it for this video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
