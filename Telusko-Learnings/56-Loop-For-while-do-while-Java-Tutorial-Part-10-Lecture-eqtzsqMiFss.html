talk about for loop I in general will
talk about loops so let's start with a
new poll so we say new Java class and
we'll name it as demo loop and finish
okay so we will see why we require new
so have my class here cos dem olu
right now we need a function called as
public static void void main' sorry for
typo and this will type string a okay
now what next is like let's let's print
a value if I print a value one so what I
am going to do is let you say s out and
one simple right then you find to print
two so I will say s out and will print
two then if I am going to plain 3s out
and pain free now what's the problem is
we are doing the same thing repeatedly
right we are doing the same task
repeatedly so what we can do is if you
are doing this same task repeatedly we
can use some block we can use some block
okay and in this block I will say s out
and and something if I print one it will
print all ones so what I need is it
should start a block it will bring the
statement and once you complete the
block again it should go back to the or
upper part and you should print the same
thing right other thing what we can do
is let's suppose if I have a variable I
initially I is one okay if my eye is one
and if I print value of I here so it
will print one right again it will go it
should go back and pin it should print
the value of I but if I say I plus plus
okay so it will start with this block
then it will come inside and print the
value of I which is 1 then this operator
it is an incremental operator now this
operator means the come in here this
operator means I equal to I plus 1 so it
will increment the value this is for
this post increment so it is post
increment okay and you guess what do
they pre-incrementing yeah
it's plus plus I so plus plus I is pre
increment okay so now so now what we
have is we have I plus plus so once your
block starts it should bring the value
which would increment the I value then
look the then the then we should finish
the block again should go back it should
print this value that is - it should
increment it will I become three or I
should go back and it should print right
and for that we need to add some some
tag here so that's that this thing is
called as blue because we are we are
starting something we are ending
something again we are starting
something so this is what is loop but
the first type of loop is for us while
loop so while is a loop in which we'll
be having a block to print number of
statements now this block this while
will check for a condition right till
war - value you want to print this I so
I will say till my I is less than 10
okay till my I is less than 10 if my I
exceed the value of nine it should stop
printing right so it's that simple
so this is how you can impotent or you
can implement on loop so this type of
loop is called as while loop so now when
I run this
it's running it's running
and we have the output so it's one two
three four five six seven eight nine
see it's not printing the value of ten
it's because what we learn is we have
said I should be less than ten so when
you say less than ten it will let's see
how it works
so we have I equal to one right then it
will come to this while loop and say is
it one less than ten yes so it will
return you a true value so while loop
always check for the true value so it
will check for the true and so it's true
then once your while loop gets true it
will come inside and check okay we have
to print a value of I which is one it
will print then it will increment the
value when we go back it will check now
it is the values to write I so 2 is less
than 10 yes again we'll run 2 and this
goes on till we get 9 so now in less
than 10 yes equivalent now 9 plus plus
is your 10 bytes if you go back now 10
is less than 10 no it will return you a
false value so when 1 once your while
loop gets the false value it will come
out of the loop okay and that's the end
of the code that's why it's been
printing them but it's printing the
value till nine what if we forget value
10 also so what we can do is we can use
equal to so it is I less than equal to
10 it means it will print from 1 to 10
so as we can see we have the last value
stand
it's one two three four five six seven
nine ten now so what next we can do is
let's suppose okay now what is if I now
go for infinite loop I want to print all
values from one till end values so what
we can say is I want to I don't want to
check any condition here I want to I
want to run this block every time so
what we can do is I can just pass here
true because while loop always checks
for true value
now this true value is a boolean value
so you have a data type in Java for this
boolean and we can say it is as B and we
can represent - true and we can also
pass here B it's the same thing right
so believe the type is a did arrive in
Java so this is this is how your while
loop works so let's remove this now see
when you talk about while loop in wine
look what we have done is while loop it
will first check the condition and then
it will run this code we have one more
loop which which will first print the
value it will first execute this thing
and then it will check for the condition
okay so in while loop what we have is
first it will check for the condition
and then it will print this statement so
it will execute the statements now we
have something called us do-while loop
now do-while loop what it does is it
will first execute this statement and
then it will check for the condition so
when I say while I less than
so is the same thing difference is while
loop first check the condition then
execute the statements do-while loop
first execute these statements and then
it's check for the condition now if I
done this so the value is again out to
the same right but the difference is
let's suppose my value of I is 15 okay
so it work no because see we are
checking for the condition is 1 I less
than 15 I less than 10 which is which is
false right if I run this if I was i
okay now if I run this the output is 15
right it should not work but still it's
working it's because we are checking the
condition afterwards
first it will come it will execute and
then it will check the condition so when
you work with while loop it will first
check the condition then it will print
do while though first it will execute
this state maintain it will check for
the condition so this is your type of
second type of loop one is do-while loop
I'm going to go back to while loop go
back to our load okay so now we have a
while loop right now if I can focus here
we have these steps so whenever you work
with loops the first step is this one it
will this step is called as
initialization this step is called as
condition and this step is called as
increment right so if you're working
with a loop why don't we have a loop in
which we'll be having all this thing at
the same line right now we are using
three lines first line second line and
three line is third line right so what
we can do is we can just replace this
while loop with a new type of loop
correspond to so in fourth of what we
can have is we can have or dated I equal
to one so this statement we can
move then we can add a semicolon and
then we'll say we have a second
statement which is I less than equal to
10 and then we'll be having a last
statement called as I plus plus so we
don't need this statement so now you can
see we have all this statement in the
same line and this is your for loop
simple right so now I'm getting this
speech sorry okay
now if I done this okay so we're getting
the same output but this time we are
working with the for loop okay where
should we work with while loop where
should we work with for loop we will see
in subsequent tutorials
for time main hope you have understood
the topic if you have any doubts please
come in - thank you so much for watching
