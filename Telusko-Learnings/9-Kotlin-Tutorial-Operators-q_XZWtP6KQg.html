how to create class and object and how
to use all those things let's go for the
second code now if you remember if you
if you have learned any other
programming language before maybe C C++
or Java the second code we always write
is addition of two numbers right now how
can we implement that thing here how can
you add two numbers in Scotland is it
anything different not exactly it is
almost same I just want to show you how
it is similar with Java in terms of
additional addition or maybe some other
operation so what I will do is I will
create a variable here I will say this
variable as num1 but then how to create
a int variable here because in in java
we use int which is i is small but in
case of Kotlin if you use int in small
way it will give you an error as you can
see that it is giving you in red color
that means it is it's saying unresolved
reference int so in case of integer i
mean we have to use i as capital okay so
then we have to create a second variable
we say num2 and this would be int again
now what happens if I print if I power
not sis out it that's a Java thing right
so we print here I will print the value
of num1 let's try to understand what
happens when you plain num1 now in java
as well we have two types of variables
right we have instance variables and we
have local variables whenever you create
a variable inside a method it's a local
variables right and if you don't assign
the value to a local variable you can
see you are getting an error here now if
I go to this error it says variable num
1 must be initialized which means 2 for
your local variables you should enter I
this variable so I will say this is 4
and this is 7 now since I am coming from
Java background of course I am putting
Seneca at the end right but as you know
this is optional so we can remove that
so we got num1 here and if you want to
perform the additional operation is very
simple you can simply say now 1 plus
num2 the way we do in in normal
programming right ceecee just does the
use plus operator don't expect anything
else here it's almost same let's run
this code and let's see what happens ok
so as you can see we got the output
which is 11 in the console window if you
can see that so once you add these two
numbers 4 &amp;amp; 7 you will get 11 right can
we use some other operations here if I
use subtraction it
work in the same way let's run this and
we got minus three in the output window
right so that's how you can perform
addition subtraction we can also use
mode operators here we can use all the
operators which we use in Java as well
now let's say I want to print in up to
in a particular way so I want to perform
addition operation but not I don't want
to print in such a way so we can also
print we can also use a variable we can
create a variable outside and we can
assign the values there so against a bad
result equal to and we can we can say
now 1 plus num2 we can do that as well
and we can simply put result here so we
can just remove this and we say result
so let's run this code and of course
when you run this code you will get the
same output which is 11 ok I have not
running this code yet but then this will
work so if you say if you said is right
oh but then ok let's verify will it work
because I have not mentioned the value
for the result right so let's see what
happens ok and execute you can see we
got the output which is 11 here so we
are able to add these values now what
else ok so this is how you you you
perform the operation here right now
once we know how to add two numbers how
to subtract two numbers let's go for
some other other concept well I want to
print this values example I want to
print result in such a way that it
should print the addition of the
addition of 4 and 7 is 11 how can we do
that so I will not write something like
this I would say the addition of 4 and 7
is 11 but in I'm signing a static value
right how do I know that value will be
11 so I want to find that answer from
result so I want to print the same
statement but by assigning the values
but if you assign the values if you say
num1 here and if you say num2 here and
if you say result of course the output
you'll be getting is num1 and num2 is
result we will not get 4 and 7 is 11
right so yeah that's how you can perform
this operation but in the next video
we'll see how exactly we can replace
this num 1 with the actual value because
if you run this you will get num1 plus
num2 is result
right so yeah that's what that's how you
you walk with us in the next video we'll
see how to replace this with numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
