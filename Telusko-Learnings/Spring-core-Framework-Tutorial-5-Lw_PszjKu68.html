file where we from where we can just
read the data what we want so to create
that file just go to your package within
your SRC and just say new and we need to
create our XML file so it's a XML and
then we'll choose XML file we said next
and it will leave this name this as
spring dot XML we can give any name
doesn't matter and then we'll be using
some tags here so the main tank we have
to use is beans tag okay and everything
will be in this beans tag so the base
tag will be the root tag of your XML now
since we need a bean so you can see we
are asking for a bean okay so way to
define this bin here
so to define this be in use we have to
say beans admission ID equal to now that
ID should be the idea I'm mentioning
here so if you are mentioning vehicle so
it should be very clear so we have
vehicle okay and then we have to also
mention the class so from which class
you want to create that so we have to
create from comm dots
I've been dot that is Co yeah and then
we have to close the bean tab and that's
it so once you do this you will get your
the your bin file or you will you're
getting your object of vehicle whether
we have we have not mentioned the class
names of it will mention the class the
mass car okay that's a plus now you have
to mention that file somewhere so in
this application context in just double
quotes you have to mention it is spring
dot XML so that whenever you call for
whether we could object of this context
which will go to the spring dot XML file
just to load all the configure
configuration so now you know whenever
you call for the vehicle you will get a
car amazing right and but there is one
problem whenever you work with XML XML
always go for the user-defined tags
right or pre do or what you say custom
tags and this custom tags needs a
definition
now you cannot write any tag on your new
key you can just move out
even ever you use a tag you have to make
sure that tag has a definition now from
where you look at the definition so you
can look for different projects or you
can just go to spring website for the
definition I have already have a
definition with me and this is
definition I have so just copy this
definition and paste it here so you can
get this from you can just google it or
you can just you you can go to the
spring website and you can download this
definition okay so this is the
definition for the beans tag okay this
one since I'm working with the spring
4.0 version so I'm using 4.0 sake you
are working with 3.0 libels you have to
mention 3.0 444 is the latest what do
you say they just watch your for spring
here and let's run this now
so I find on this boom so if I'm getting
children and that's the magic right in
this I'm not mentioning anything I'm not
mentioning car I'm not mentioning bike
it is totally independent I am injecting
those objects from extra location so you
can see if I if I change this to bike
okay and if I run this and then I'm
getting bargain I which is for bike
right but you will say what's a big deal
if only for if I want bike or car I have
to change something right but hold on in
the earlier version we were changing the
source code of Java so anybody to say
change the source code for Java you have
to recompile your files
this time we are changing the XML file
we don't have to recompile we just have
to say save and that's the advantage of
using Spring Framework okay so that's
the basic idea of how to use spring code
how to achieve dependency injection if
the further videos will talk about how
to set different properties how to use
multiple objects and object inside an
object so how to do that that will say
in the further tutorials so I hope you
have liked this video so please thumbs
up that will that motivate me for the
movie that motivates me for the more
videos and do subscribe which increase
when you increase my subscribers I feel
like
my work is what so yeah that's it thanks
for watching and just stay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
