ready so today we'll talk about
something called as DSC DHCP and DNS now
as you know we have already covered the
spectacle of DHCP but now in this
tutorial I will talking about DHCP and
DNS okay so it's much easier than the
large practical because in large
practical of DHCP as we have seen it's a
router configuration right in the router
we have configured a DHCP but what we
can do here is we can we can create a
DHCP server so that which will make our
work easy so take a machine here and you
can take a switch because we need to
connect this to machine and sober so
take a switch take a switch here and
again we need a router because again
maybe we have to connect our network
with different network in future not for
this practical so still will take allow
so that I can assign a gateway also so
this machine is connected and this one
is connected again I want a network as
it's my network should be wanted to do
dot one sixty eight dot one dot zero so
I want this network right so my gateway
will be one dot one so go to your
configuration where the facet under it
and here I have to assign I need to do
dot one sixty eight dot one dot one and
your mask is this you have to earn it so
once you say on this channel is on now
now what I need in this practical is
when I click on this machine and when I
go to add extra configuration I need a I
need a dynamic IP so when I click on
DHCP it's showing me wait it should be
feel yeah it should be forgot because we
don't have a DHCP server you so what I
need you to I need a DHCP server so go
to your machine go to add extra servers
and yeah so now what I need from this
server if this should this server should
be the HCP server ok
and go to this go to your desktop and
what is this first we'll connect this so
that it doesn't make much work easier
what is this go to this again I need IP
address for this machine so when it to
dot one sixty eight dot one dot two
because I've been gateways used for 1.1
we will assign this 1.2 and DNS do you
fall you get Wiggly one and two dot one
sixty eight dot one dot one dot yeah
will assign it as 1.1 and DNS server let
it be DNS server I wanted to dot one
sixty eight dot 1.55 so we can go for
any DNS so so this is my IP for DNS
again you can go on you can go for any
DNS IP close it now what - on your DHCP
server first you should make sure all
this default services or off obvious ADP
and on your DHCP before on go for pool
let me name at this pool as Naveen as my
name and here default gateway
I will go for default gateway as its
money to do it out one sixth year dot
one dot one and this is one eighty two
dot one sixty eight dot one dot 55 and I
need to start from let's start from to
start on three whatever they used
let let it be from one only so the plus
sign I people just require which is
which it will get then dear TV we know
we don't need the FTPS oh we need
details
oh we need we need all this we don't
need I guess everything is set up so
whatever indi recipe it's starting is
it's starting
I'm not mad at you Oh again I have to do
it this the same thing make sure you add
your DHCP when you do it so when I two
dot one sixty eight dot one dot one and
if you wanted to do dot one sixty eight
dot one dot Oh just 55 start you can go
with to any number and you have to say
this is important you have to add what I
missed earlier and then you have to on
your DHCP so once you say your DHCP on
wait for - or what for five seconds and
then you can test your connection so go
to your machine configuration when you
say ID SCP now we are getting their CPAs
1.3 because 1.2 is used for DHCP this
DLC is 1.2 this is 1.3 so what I got
from this machine is wonderful to do
about one sixty eight dot 1.3 now what I
need is I need a DNS server if I do
letlet for let's create our the HTTP
server first
so this server is my HTTP server because
to access any web page okay so this is
my I should EP server I'm not connected
yet what we need is what is this machine
this browser I need an HTML page with
like hello or hello world or
hello maybe let's suppose or let click
create a web page which will print hello
Lavigne okay to do this if I type Naveen
dot-com so if I fit I have in comm it
should give me that page it's not giving
now because we don't have a CT P server
so to set up HTTP server create a should
be serve vertical default so one name it
has to be server and
Connect this once you connected you have
you need a IP address so we'll assign
this IP address money to dot one sixty
eight dot one dot for because it is not
not used default is one into two dot one
sixty eight dot one dot one and Genesis
1 e2 dot one sixty eight dot 1.55 this
is the IP in a sign again we can do with
the help of DSP also you can click on
the NCP it will get the IP but I made a
make sure there is no such problem here
now what we need to do is we need to we
need to create a web page so again I can
use the default web page or I can create
my own page here so what can I do is I
can just delete all this mess and guys
you know it is we have some HTML tags to
work with so body body pushing off yeah
and this I want to display as h1 tag as
hello
Navid look likes that h1 close and then
we have to finish it and now it's your
all-day we have I should be serving as
on audience there should be only we are
using HTTP now close this has been as as
you can see this is on now to access
this go to a web browser now you cannot
access it with the above-named Unicom
because still it is we don't have a
domain name so what we can do is we can
access the same thing with the help our
IP address 1.4 I guess yeah you can see
it's hard I mean so there that that was
the IP address of neo has to be server
but what I need is when I type name
in.com it should give me that means I
need I need to create a lookup table
alright to create a DS DNS server here
so DNS are responsible to connect my to
cutting my IP address and domain name so
this is my DNS server again DNS server
will need an IP address where she will
connect this using
to connect this first so connect your
server and this one oh now this is the
basic problem with the order switch
because switch provides you hundred four
ports whatever switch to put off and
connect extra ports so one all quotes
are free so you can use any no clothes
on it to take some time it will take
some time to get on okay so it is very
slow so connect this to this now it look
at it get connected now go to this
requires an IP address again you can use
DHCP but I'm making sure it's not it
will work so perfectly one dot let's
give it as oh yes our was 55 right if
you remember and the default is going to
do dot one sixty eight dot one dot one
again DNS is one eighty two other one
sixty eight dot one dot 55 now close
this now you have to on the NS server I
don't want this hour to be active HTTP
server make it off
I don't want this should be DHCP I don't
I want this to be a DNS server so now
first you have to assign an IP I'd name
which is Naveen comm an IP address one I
mean dot-com is wanted to do dot one
sixty eight dot one dot for once it is
done you have to say add and on that's
it now as you can see we have configured
our DNS server also so check it which it
is working or not go to your web browser
now typing dot-com and you can see we
have hello Navin
so this is this is how you can work with
your practical of DHCP and DNS I hope
you liked it and if you have any doubts
please make a please comment and please

you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
