sterilize an object in XML format in
this video we'll see how to digitize it
so in order to say lies it first we need
a mate function and what we'll do is to
give us allies we require the XML so for
encoding we have used or to save it we
have used XML and coda this time we'll
use XML decoder which is X ml decoder
from Java dot beans package we'll say
the package are the class name is again
X or object name is X and we'll say new
XML decoder
ml decoder and this we have to pass the
object so in case of strolling so if you
can see in case of encoder we have to
use coffered output stream now since we
are taking the input we have to say a
neo buffered input stream okay and in
this in this scenario if you have used
final output string this time we have to
mention find input stream so if it's a
new file input stream and in bracket you
have to find mention the file name and
the file name here it is my college dot
XML so you have to make sure your file
name is right so there's a chance that
this file is not there it will give you
a door right so to handle this header we
have to use triquet so we'll say it's
around to the straighten bit try catch
okay we'll say and this so once you got
the object of X what we can do is we'll
say we have to create object of college
so we'll say College C equal to now we
don't want to create a new object we
have to fetch it from the files of its
the X dot so there's a method called as
write a lead object so in case of
storage we use write object in case of
fetch we use lead object but this read
object will give you object format what
we need is college format so we have to
use a type custom of college
now once you got the college now this
great let's print the let's print all
the values so what we can do is we can
take a list here will send list of
students and what we'll do is let's
input the package first so once you
cordially stop student will say s equal
to and this students will get from the
quasi object with the gasps students
okay now once you've got the object
let's print all the values we'll use a
for the option type student with a
student friend value in s and let's
print all the values so we say but now
since values the object of student and
which in which I'm using this method
which is to string which will print the
student the roll number and the name of
this road so if I run this hope so it
will work and here we go so we are
getting this data which is one not one
Mangesh and one not too shiny
cool so even if you change even if you
change the structure of student class it
will not affect the output and that's
the power of XML format well so this is
what we have to use or we have to see
lies and TC lies the object in XML
format so thanks for watching and do
