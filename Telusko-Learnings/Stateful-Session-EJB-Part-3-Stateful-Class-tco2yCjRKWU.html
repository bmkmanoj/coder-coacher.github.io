of interface what we can do is now we
can move towards a class implementation
now so in this interface what we had we
had three methods first is add element
second is remove element and third is
get elements use so using add element I
will add the element in the list using
remove we can remove an event and using
get elements we can just of you can
print all the elements now in order to
add element we need to pass on a limit
to your right so we'll say int e so e
will be the element here and we'll say
int Eve for the removal and what we can
do is we can just and this get get
elements it will just fetch all the
elements so we don't need to specify
anything there now once you have done
with the creation of the interface let's
create a class so it's a right-click ejv
and click on now we can click on this
session bean but this time we have to go
for state full instead of stateless and
we can name this as the interface name
was these elements so we'll have least
element so these two elements remote
user interface name and these two
elements is my class name now once you
click on finish it will give you a class
which is annotated with this stateful
which is added with the stateful now
what we can do is now first thing what I
need here is a least so in this let me
get a list so it's a list and the type
of elements it will be integer and we'll
say this is values equal to a new add at
least and the type of values will be
integer sorry so as we are working with
the jar 1.7 in fact I am working with
Java 1.8 so we don't have to specify a
type here so this is a update in
genrich's in version 1.7 so let me just
import the package if you simply say
control shift I it will import the all
the required packages now once you got
the list now what I want here is I want
to I want this class to
implement my interface which is the list
elements remote so I will say it is
implements list elements remote now why
I need this is because your list
interface here is a remote interface and
when you want to work with stateful your
class should implement a remote
interface a remote interface okay now
since we are implementing a interface we
have to define all the methods which are
there so what we can simply do is in
fact you can type all those methods are
you can use this a feature of NetBeans
you can simply click on that a error and
say implement all the abstract methods
it will give you certain abstract
methods and you don't require a through
here so we'll delete that part you can
simply say go to that line and say can
shift delete and if you did it so now
let's say next okay now here what we can
do is in this add element the only thing
you have to specify here is if you say a
value is dot add since since we want to
add the elements we can say values dot
add in bracket you can pass e the e you
are gues getting from here and remove we
can use values dot so there's a method
called as remove but the problem with
remove here is remove us remove have to
two methods so there are two methods of
the same name which goes for method
overloading one accepts object of a
parameters object and second as a
parameter of int now if you pass a
parameter of end the problem here is it
will treat that parameter as index I
don't want it to read as index I want it
to treat like an object so what we can
do is if I pass e since e is an integer
here or int variable it will create a
sit on it will treat it as a variable or
index so what we can simply do is we can
simply pass your integer or you can make
it end because in diff in the interface
itself we have set it is end so we have
to say it is new
integers this is one one more way since
we cannot change this is because we have
already defined interface that it will
be int now once you're done with the
demo or remove now let's go for least
and layer you to just say it is it will
return all the values and that's it this
is your the this is your implementation
class okay so we have created the class
which implements our remote interface
which is laced elementary mode which we
have created in the last video this
interface it has three methods so we
need to implement all the methods
important to be considered here is we
have to use an addition which is
stateful since you are working on
stateful ejbs now this a delayed
override here is just annotation which
provide it which says this method here
overrides a method from interface then
you will say what if I remove this it
will work right but what if you make a
mistake here like example if you say it
is by mistake if you type as an integer
you can see there is no error in this
method but there is an error with the
implementation but if you write over
right here it will help you to solve
that problem if you say override it will
say there is no method which overrides a
method with this integer so now you can
verify this is end so we can go there
and we say it is in C yeah so you can
either use override annotation or you
can remove it's not compulsory but for
this stateful it is compulsory now since
we are done with the class next we have
to create a JSP file using which we can
add or remove the elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
