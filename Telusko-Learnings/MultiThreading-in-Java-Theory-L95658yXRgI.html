different political earthlings and in
this video we'll talk about
multi-threading now what exactly it
means you know when you work with two
different applications so let's say we
are living in a world of multitasking so
we can run we can work with multiple
tasks at the same time right so let's
say you're typing the document on MS
Word and you're playing a song at the
same time so let's say you're listening
to a music of maybe any pony person at
the same time you are typing the
document now so you're using two tasks
at the same time but it is called as
multitasking right but let's see if we
talk about one task which is ms ms word
now that's one process right so we have
task which is process and in ms axis
also in ms word if you're typing the
document or if you make any spelling
mistake so panel e while you are typing
at the same time it is checking for the
spelling mistakes right so that means
inside your ms of ms word which is one
process we have some small units right
we have some sub processes right and
those sub process will be called as
threads so it is what is thread it's a
unit of a process so let's say if you
take a process break that process you
will get threads okay now what ago I've
exactly we need threads here is so we
have three different application of
threads again we'll talk about how to
implement threads how to create a thread
how to run a thread but before that let
us understand why we require threads so
the first reason we are living in a
world of multi-core processors right
initiative used to have have one code
processor then we have dual code now we
have quad code we have octa-core white
so what is octa-core CPU it means you
have eight cores so instead of having
one single code we have eight goes now
right and when you could run an
application when you create any java
application you only use one thread okay
so even if you have not created any
multi the application now so let's say
if you have created addition of two
numbers if you are writing a code for a
ssin of two numbers you have already
used or threatened so when you run any
when you get an exception in Java well
what exception you get you
as exception in thread main that means
main is a threaded so by default in
every java application in every Java
code we have at least one thread which
is mean right so let's say you have you
have let's say you have 500 elements
okay you have a collection you have an
array of 500 events and you want to
multiply each element by 2 okay so it
will take at least some time maybe let's
make it 5 seconds or not 5 seconds let's
say it will take 8 seconds so it will
take 8 second to process your to process
your 500 elements right because by
default if you have these elements it
will take only 1 core so even if you
have quad code machine even if you have
a cortical machine which have four cores
it will occupy only one code but let's
say if you want to use all the photos
you have to use four threads so by
default by default we have only 130
which is main so we have to create three
extra threads all we can what we can do
is we can create four different threads
and main will call all these threads so
we have t1 t2 t3 and t4
okay now since all these threads are
walking at the same time on four
different cores which can run badly you
can complete the same task in two
seconds
because in short wasting eight seconds
now we are using all four cores we can
we can do it in two seconds and that's
the power of multi-threading so that's
one use the second you so let's say you
if you if you have ever used Android
phone or iOS phone or maybe any smart
phone including Windows so if you have
if you have used any of this phone you
use you might have use Amazon app on
that so let's say if you are going to
Amazon app and when you click on a
button let's say if you are searching
for a product at that time the request
is request going to this server okay and
your app is waiting for the response
from Amazon so let's say you're
searching for a product late so you want
to buy a new shoe we will search for a
shoe on your app when you type shoe and
search request ghoshal server right and
then you will be getting the response
right now in this scenario it will take
some time maybe
one second so in that one second your
app will be your app will be freezed
what you want you want to use the app
even if it is bad in that it is going
for the request so your main thread will
not send it a question if you create a
new thread hood sent a request again we
have to use two threads here one thread
you will interact with the user and the
second thread will be going for the
server request okay so if you are ever
going for Android programming you know
you will be knowing what I'm saying now
so we use something as async task there
so that is I can use the third use is
let's say you're creating a web
application in Java and you have sublets
as you know so you have servlets in java
using which you can create web
applications so when you send a request
from client to server using servlet so
what you do you send a request so serve
it will process your request let's at
the same time we have five users who
want to access the same servlet so what
your server video it will create five
different sawblades okay it will create
five different threads of the same
subnet okay so we use threads there also
so there are lots of use of threads okay
the first one we can use all different
course second we can send us synchronous
requests and the third one we can create
we can we can access web applications by
using multi-threading okay so there are
there are multiple use IAM and even for
game development let's say you want to
build if you want to be a game developer
threads are very important right example
when you are playing counter-strike at
the same time you are running at the
same time your partners are running at
the same time opposition team is running
so it's everything is happening at the
same time right so again we have to use
multi-threading there now personalized
how to achieve threads so let's say we
have we have an object here so this is
the object of thread okay so thread is
an infinite class in Java so I just have
to say thread t1 equal to new thread you
will get a new thread here right it's
that easy
but hold on this will not do the stuff
you want so what you want this thread to
do is this series is responsible to
convert the Alex
we have we have an area of five elements
you need to multiply each element by two
so we need to ask this thread to do it
for you but the problem is this thread
doesn't know what you want right so what
you have to do you have to create a
class okay in which you will specify
what you want okay so you will create a
class let's say let's name that class as
my thread and in that you will be having
a method which is public void one so
every thread needs or methods one method
okay
so one is responsible to do this stuff
you want sounds good now in this one
method you can take the ADI and you can
multiply each item in by two it's that
simple right but to achieve the true
power of threads you cannot make a
simple class your class should be a
thread so you have to say my thread
which is pub class my thread exchanged
thread that's compulsory right so we
have to say ik strength exchange thread
okay so that's one way and then we have
to create the object of thread again so
we have to say thread t1 equal to its
new might thread now not just thread it
is new my thread okay now when you say T
1 dot run it will call your method but
hold on to achieve parallel if you want
a new thread so by default we have one
thread which is main right so you have a
main thread here but badly if you want
to start a new thread you have to say
start so if you call run it will not
create a new thread for you you just
have to say dot start because start will
create a new thread it will call a
method one so you don't have to call run
it will automatically call one when you
call a start method okay
so that's one way so threads has
multiple methods you can also use method
like sleep so let's say you you are
running a thread and you want to wait
for 2 seconds or 3 seconds in that
synergy you can apply you can use a
mythical sleep so sleep is a static
method which takes milliseconds all
right so you want to sleep it for 2
seconds you have to specify to thousands
of parameter so 2,000 milliseconds one
is 2 seconds right so that's one method
we can also use weight and 95 so there
those are two methods we can also start
stop the thread we should not do okay so
thread will be stopped automatically
yeah so that's that's how you use thread
but hold on let's say we have so in
order to create a thread we have to say
new thread right but there's a problem
here
we have this exchange thread but let's
say we already have a class for this a
and my class which is my thread 1 to X
times a now now since in in Java we
cannot achieve multiple inheritance
right so we cannot say a comma thread
right that's why we use an interface
which is runnable so there is one more
way of creating a thread Escalus
runnable interface so now this time
instead of using exchange thread what we
can do is we can say class my thread
implements runnable the advantage will
be runnable as a method has a method
called s1 ok
so using which you can achieve the same
properties of thread ok so you have two
ways of feeding thread the one way is by
creating a thread class or by extending
Authority class the another way is using
runnable interface sounds good so let's
say now we have this 50 elements okay
not 50 elements let's say we have this
80 elements and I want to double each
element here so what I will do instead
of creating one thing I will create 8
different threads because I am using
octa-core machine a loop I will create
eight different threads and each thread
will have ten elements so so from one to
ten
first we're from 21 to or 11 to 20
seconds way 10 21 to 30 third day and so
on right so it will consume less time
compared to one thread so
multi-threading consider is very
important when you go for software
development when you go for game
development like when you go for app
development so make sure you understand
the theory part so that will you can
work practically so in the next video we
will be talking about the practical
implementation of thread by using thread
class or by using an able interface so
that's a Datchet from this video do
