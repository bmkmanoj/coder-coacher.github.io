installation of open shaped in your
Eclipse we have also done this
application on server now let's make
some changes on the client side so in
your local copy instead of saying
welcome to open shift I will say welcome
to the disco learnings just to see the
effect if it is changing on the server
or not even if I save this application
on this on the client side and if I go
back to my server and if I reference the
application you can still say it is
welcome to your JBoss AS application to
open shift
oh sorry I have changed unfortunately
instead of changing this I have changed
the title let me change this title I
want to change the data which is here so
welcome to is that ok now if I save this
on this side even if i refresh you can
see the same thing welcome to your JBoss
I want to change this okay to for that
you have to send this copy to the server
now to send so we have to use something
else push but but before pushing we have
to commit now this is the funda of get
here so we have to right click and this
option of team and in team this option
of commit so first you have to say
commit and you have to enter your name
and email ID you can enter in any value
there click on OK now it will ask you
for a message I will say this is the
first commit and then it will show you
the files you have changed ok so you
have to take all the files or anything
you want which is changed now don't just
say commit say commit and push so it
will commit it it will commit the
changes so you can see it will send your
data to git repository so just don't
just commit also say push it will send
your data to the open ship server so it
will take some time for pushing so now
I've just fast forward the video so that
you will it will not waste your time so
once we once we have done all the
changes it will show you the the commit
number
so this is my first commit and simply
say okay now your server is been changed
if i refresh the page now you can see it
says welcome to telesco learnings so
that's how you make changes to your git
server but he will say okay this is just
a stable page right what if you want to
make a dynamic changes like say you want
to make it as JSP page so what we can
simply do is Internet clips let's create
a new page so you can just right click
on this web app we'll say new ok so
let's say new what we want to get a JC
page so just say new JC page and we'll
name this page as maybe calc dot JSP
well we'll add two numbers a typical JSP
epic JS for example
so we'll say a scriptlet here and we'll
take two variables one is int I call to
sex equal to 6 and then we have one more
value which is int J equal to 8 and
let's add these two values we'll add it
and we'll also print it so we'll say
println and we'll say I plus J so it
will print this value of the server side
which is I plus J which is 14 all right
so once we have done the changes let me
just show you this output on the server
side if I if I don't push just say index
not index it is calc dot JSP if I say
enter so it will say a statistics
straight is for not 4 because it's not
still still not there on the server side
go back to eclipse right click against a
team and then you have to say commit and
push we'll name this as second commit
you can you can give any message just
for the verification you have to select
the file you have changed which is calc
dot JSP this time say commit and push
okay so after forwarding the video we
have this which is second commit we'll
say ok and the changes is be done on the
server side now this time if I say slash
dot JSP if I say enter and we should see
14 so you can see this out
but here which is fought in simple
that's how you makes changes on the
client side and yet every time you have
to push on this our side now the
advantage will be if you have a friend
who want the same project he can just
open his Eclipse he will log in with
your account open shift account and then
you can simply say pull now we have this
time we are pushing right you can say
pull he will get the same project if he
makes it he if he makes some changes and
then again he will push on this our side
you can't pull it and you will see all
the changes which friend has made and
that's the amazing thing about gate okay
so yeah that's how you change is change
your code on the server side so that's
from this video in the further tutorials
we'll talk about how to create a spring
application spring MVC application with
database Mahara SKU and we'll deploy
that on the server side which is on top
on the OpenShift so thanks for watching
and do subscribe if you have liked it
