inheritance now what exactly Natan says
let's say we have a class called as
let's say ad and in this class ad we
have a method called as let's sum so
we'll say public public void some now
what this method some is responsible is
it is responsible to add two numbers now
when you say you want to add two numbers
first we require two variables we say
first variable is now one and second
variable is num2 so now we have two
variables and the result of this
addition will be stored in result so now
we have three variables no 1 num2 and
num 3 now if you want to implement this
sum method what we need to do is we'll
say first way to assign the values to
assign values we need to go to the main
function or your main method to use this
variable since they are instance
variable we need to create object or we
have to instantiate the class Adam how
to instantiate we have to use a class
name and we'll say obj equal to new add
so once you got the object you can say
it's obj dot num1 sorry to say assign
the value for num1 which is let's say 5
and we'll say number obj dot num2 and
the value for this will be 4 now I want
to sum I want to add those two numbers
not to add what we can do is we can use
a method called as sum in this sum I can
simply say it is result is equal to num
1 plus num2 okay and the default value
for result will be 0 so in case if if
you fail to add these two numbers the by
default the output will be 0 right and
let's try to print the value for result
so it's a obj dot result so what I'm
doing here is I'm creating the object of
add and then ascending the value of
assign the value 5 to number 1 and 4 to
num2 and then we are printing the value
of result now if I run this code
obviously we are not calling this method
for a sum so the output should be 0
right so if I run this code
take some time yeah and the output is
zero is because we have not called this
some some default value for result will
be zero even if you remove this zero it
will give the same output is because
result is a instance variable and the
value for instance variable by default
the visit if it is painte between the
zero okay we don't have any garbage
value like in c programming so if the
value will be zero but since I want to
add those two numbers what we need to do
is way to say this obj dot way to call a
method well as some so once you call
some it will add those two numbers and
then you will be getting output as
dessert or the output as a nine so if we
run this code see the output is nine
right so in future if you got a client
and he says I need an object in which I
can add two numbers you can very proudly
you can give this object called as obj
so let's say you get you got a client
who asked you about an object which can
add two numbers you have given this obj
but let's say after one year he come
back to you and say okay and I need one
more object all I need one object in
which I need two features what will be
add and second will be subtract but the
problem is you cannot make changes to
this classes because maybe this class is
created by someone else and that program
is not available now and you don't have
you don't even have a code of this what
you have is dot class file so that means
you cannot make changes in this class so
obviously you have to create a new class
called as add sub in which will be
having two features one is addition and
a subtraction so what I mean by that is
I first I need three to three variables
will say num1 num2 and result okay and
then the inverse will say public void I
need two features when his sum and I
need public void sup
so in sum I will add two numbers and
serve will subtract two numbers okay now
how to implement with say it is reserved
equal to num 1 plus num2 and here we'll
say result equal to it is num1 - num2 so
now we have two methods in which I in
first I will add two numbers in second I
will subtract two numbers now if I want
to use those two features instead of
creating object of add way to create
object of sub and same goes here way to
skate object of sub right and then we
can call both the methods we can say so
we'll first what we'll do is we'll
calculate some we'll print it and then
again we'll call obj dot sub and then we
can print that data so we'll say it's
obj dot result and the output we are
expecting here is one should be the
first output should be nine and second
output should be one right yeah so you
got the output but the problem is if you
can see we have created a class in which
I have to method two methods but don't
you think we have a method some already
we have already declared this variables
so why to do this thing again what if
this features are this members which is
variable and method if it directly comes
from this class and it's not possible
because of something called as
inheritance now to use inheritance we
can simply use a key one called as
extends add so all the features of and
all the non private features of the add
class will come to this adds up and you
can use some and num1 you can see there
are no errors and still we are able to
call this sum anyways if we don't have
some in add sub right it is it is
calling that sum from add method because
add sub extends add so if we run this
code now there are pins 91 and this type
of inheritance is called as Simpson
single level single level inheritance
okay simple right and in the next video
we'll talk about multi level and
multiple
inheritance in Java</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
