we will talk about something called as
exceptions now question is what
exceptions are now angel will may talk
about exceptions they are though those
are arrows nothing about it now when you
want to work with any programming
language we see that it bc /
specifically java all this programming
language has something in common and
that common thing is called as ellos now
when you work with any programming
language the first thing you do is it's
not you don't check the output what you
check is the number of errors now if you
are a start-up programmer if you if you
are just starting to learn a new
programming language so if you try to
implement any new logic you will do
something you will write up code and
then will you compile it so first thing
is not what the output will be what our
concern is how many errors we are
getting right so we talked about others
we have multiple types of errors we have
so we talked about pedals so we have
multiple types of errors we have we have
first call as same text item now what is
syntax error whenever you like any code
right and when you do some mistake in
spelling so it went like example if we
talk about system so in Java you have a
key value system it's a class actually
if you write a spelling of system
incorrectly like if you write s I ste M
so if you miss bye-bye I so if we give
you an error and that error is your
syntax l then we have something called
as runtime error okay
and then we have logical error now my
talk about logical and I like something
like if you have when you compile your
code it's working right it's working but
when you run your code and you do you
give some input like you give input like
two and two plus two what you expect is
for right and if you getting answer as
Phi into logical error you are getting
the output but you are getting the wrong
wrong about so syntax is if you are
doing any spelling mistakes in tax if
you are doing any logical mistake
before I think any any logic which is
drawn so we will get logical error main
problem arise when you have length time
helps because compiled time ago if we
talk about syntax either those errors
will come when you do programming it
will not come on user and logical error
also comes and comes with when you do
programming I do get test fit but run
time error may come in user site on user
site right so if you create a scold and
if you submit that code to your user to
use it and suddenly do you do something
wrong and in that case you will get the
runtime errors an example of one
diameters like a user want to read a
fine okay so he try to read the file
and unfortunately that file has a dog so
you cannot open that file right so your
cone will generate an error and that
error will be runtime exception so for
this you have to handle your runtime
exceptions so that's why our topic but
topic is so our topic is exception
handling we have to handle this Pelham's
right now question is how to handle the
first thing whenever you work with
exception handling you have to focus on
these statements right now whenever you
write java code you you like multiple
statements right now this statements
there are two types first type is called
as normal statement second type is
called as critical statement so first
one is normal statements again is
critical so first is normal statement
and second will be critical statement
now so if you like a patek suppose a let
me write a code so if i write a code in
this way let suppose this is my public
static void main
PSM publisher avoid main okay and in
this i will write some statement my
first statement is int i equal to 5 so
this is my first statement right this
statement is a normal statement but let
me like all this statement what I do is
I need some value of J - then I need a
value of K which will be i / J simple
right and finally I will say as OB which
is system dot out dot think Ln into I
can't I will pass K okay so code looks
so simple so you have four statements
and when you execute this type of
statements it will give you some output
right and output is - right
because when you say PI / - it will give
you a - as your quotient and one as your
remainder so what we'll get is your
quotient which is here - but your
problem is this statements are two types
in this statement you will find some
statements as normal statement and some
statements as critical statement now
question arises how to guess which
statement are critical which statement
of our normal let's think about it when
you execute this statement everywhere
this statement will work right if it is
int I equal to five simple statement in
work second is in J equal to it will
work third statement is nth K is equal
to I divided by J it looks normal white
which look normal but it's not normal
it's clearly good thing about it when
you execute this part what will it will
do is it will divide I by J simple but
the problem is if your J value is 0 Inc
it's if your J value is 0
you will do i / J it means Phi divided
by 0 it should be infinity right but in
programming language it will give you an
error so you have to handle those else
okay so to handle this error this is
this these statements are normal
statement but this statement is critical
statement so so what programming
standard says what programming standard
says you have to write your normal
statement normally so my I have three
normal statement in this way I have s o
P and in bracket it is K
right but I have one critical statement
and that political statement is paint
okay let me declare int or K opposed we
have one more declaration much my body
is k equal to I divided by j right now
this statement is critical so that's why
this statement should be enclosed it
should be enclosing a block and that
block is called as frylock so your
critical statement will be enclosed in
try block and then we'll be having
something called as cash book is this
try block if it just give me one sec so
if this try block gives you an error if
it toes and error you have to catch the
exception right so for that you have to
write exception and you have to date
object of exception as P and you have to
open the basis and close the bishop's
you can write some statement here also
in this places so what normal you have
is whenever you work with any critical
statement the a critical statement
should be in a try block okay so this is
your try block so that statement should
be in car lock if that statement goes
normally with execution normally it will
continue for SOP will skip this
sketchbook but if your critical
statement generates or closed and error
in that case you have to catch so it's
over your time will throw your cash will
catch and it will catch the exception
wise so this is how you have to handle
the exceptions simple right so we will
do some practical implementation in the
next example okay so do watch my next
video for a clear example
but now we have this code now there is
one more short clip if you don't want to
go for try and try and catch what you
can do is let's suppose you want to go
for now one thing only you can you have
to
go in this thing it's i / g but you
don't want to I try catch so we have one
more thing call us those exception okay
so you can also use a keyword or closed
exception so for a particular statements
you can apply try-catch for the whole
method you can apply those exceptions
right so we have number of tax exception
so we'll do something we have lots of
exceptions we have exceptions like
exception this is your this is parent of
all the exception big exception then we
have a day index out of bounds exception
so this is one of the exception then we
have they have number power exception we
have number format exception and this
goes on we have lots of exception but
the main exception is your exit okay
exists is the exception is your main
exception then we have also a SQL
exception we have file not found
exception we have lots of exceptions
right so how do you use the exception
the same way we have done prior catch or
you can use closed so for the practical
implementation check out the next video
and do subscribe for these other videos
thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
