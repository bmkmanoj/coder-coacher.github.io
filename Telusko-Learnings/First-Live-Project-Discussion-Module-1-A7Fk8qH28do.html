we go
so okay so the star very first thing now
normally when you have anybody build a
software you have to follow as DLC in
fact when you join any any you know IT
course I because it might be IT comm
signs maybe of MCA so if you when you
want to join any articles this Sun so
they will teach you about SQL so right
they will teach you about software
engineering okay so yes Ola
okay I know you can't see me I'm not
sharing my face I'm sharing my screen so
you can't see me so currently I'm
Johnson are you okay so alright so so
yeah so we talked about any software
development thing so they will teach you
about HDL so right now sgfc is very very
important because if you want to build a
software you need to understand the
condition different steps so as your
stands for software open life cycle and
this is how it goes so whenever you get
whenever you want to build a software
first of all you have to plan about we
have to plan it then you have to define
the requirements you have to design it
now when you say design I think it's not
about GUI okay normally when you imagine
designing you always imagined about UI
that's not the case every time or you
can't see my screen every one so you can
see a
this cause I think they are just click
on that just click on the discolored
thing you can see the screen then okay
so normally when you build a software
you have to follow all the steps and
designing is something designing is not
about you are designing is about
creating different diagrams like DF D
and E are diagrams and all those things
then we actually build the project it it
includes UI it includes the backend part
and later we go for the testing phase
where you actually test this software
and ultimately will deploy the project
this is your normal as DLC now the
different there are different ways of
implementing guest you'll see one of the
way is using waterfall model so people
do use waterfall model I mean no one
uses now but then people earlier used to
use waterfall model where you have to
follow all the steps initially you have
to take the requirements once you get
all the requirements you have to start
with designing phase once you have done
with all the designing you have to start
with implementation once you complete
the entire implementation you will go in
testing phase and then you will go to
deployment phase you will go into
maintenance phase now what will go wrong
here is you cannot go back example if
you if something goes wrong with the
implementation and you went into testing
phase you cannot go back then okay so
once you reach to a particular phase you
cannot go back that's the drawback of
waterfall model okay if you want to see
my screen just click on my name there
either it will be telesco or something
so just click on that name
you're meeting me so who will talk okay
so okay so so you can see so once you if
you get any problem in this testing or
development or deployment you cannot go
back that's the drawback with waterfall
and most of the time you know when a
client gives the requirement client is
not sure about the requirement
okay so client is never sure about the
requirement and they based on that
requirement where client is not sure you
are designing these system you are
implementing it and the first phase
itself is wrong and you're building
everything but everything will be wrong
right ultimately it's something like you
want to equal out but the requirement
you have given you are given to the chef
is for biryani of course you will give
you being period right and you don't
want be done you want below so yeah so
the first phase itself should be proper
so the government can
is very important if this is perfect you
will start the designing of the system
if something goes wrong there then you
will be having issue with the
implementation okay so you have to make
sure that every phase is perfect and you
can never be sure that your face is
perfect and that's where we will not be
using waterfall model now in our project
because if you follow motor for model
what we will be doing is we will be
doing everything together we'll be
taking the requirements together we'll
be building it together so we'll not do
that and this will be using agile model
so this project will be built using
agile model now agile is very new now so
instead of building the entire project
in one year what we will do is we'll
break the project into small small tasks
so it goes on iteration will be having
iteration 1 iteration to iteration play
something like that and in each
iteration we'll build the entire thing
example planning so let's say or the
first iteration so the first situation
for this project would be a feedback
model because since this is our first
first time so we'll build so instead of
building the entire website together
we'll only focus on this feedback module
beside you have a feedback module right
where you can enter your name you can
enter your email ID the execute name
here and message and you can select
whatever whatever you want you want you
can acknowledge innovation into action
communication and overall and if you
select that when you click on submit the
data will be stored into database ask
again I've taken the easiest of all
because since this is the first time so
we'll go for the easiest iteration and
whenever you anyway select the iteration
it should you have to make sure that you
are selecting the first one which is
easy to work with so the first iteration
will be building only the feedback model
ok and again we'll be doing this life
now okay when I say live what it takes
what exactly it means is initially will
be ok for all let me check the comment
in this ok I'm also getting some
comments in the YouTube video so it says
hi the okay it's fine anyone there yes
you can keep updating committing changes
after view the changes yes you can also
use guitar for for making the changes
whatever you have done that oh yeah so
okay that sounds good sunday in the
phone equation will be building the
feedback page so what I'm expecting now
is live coding on Monday so Monday
evening will be doing the live code of
this okay first of all let me check what
is Monday it would be I guess
17 April yeah so it will be doing Monday
or the live so what we were doing is so
we'll be doing the coding part of this
well we're doing the coding part of how
to do the requirement so how to take all
these details and save that into
database and we'll also deploy this in
the first wicked cell we'll start with
the deployment so we'll make the module
and we'll deploy that on the on the
server so that you can actually see how
to make a project how to I mean not a
big project but in a small module how to
deploy that on the server then that will
give you enough confidence so that you
can continue and by the time you can you
can learn Java you can learn spring MVC
you can learn spring good okay so this
is what you have to build now I need
your help here I want this page to be
created so if you love HTML CSS
JavaScript just redesign this page with
the same fields I want username I want
your email id I want I want Institute
name I want here and then I want a
message with all these fields and you
have to also implement bootstrap here
because we want to make a responsive
website okay whenever nice a responsive
it means if I open this website on the
laptop its look at lip skirt but the
moment you open the same web site in the
mobile for example if I go to inspect
element if I save is this will
eventually say more tools again not here
right like and if I say inspect element
if I change this layout to I move our
layout you can see it still looks good
so when you make a when you make a page
you have to make sure that you
you for the bootstrap okay everyone
right whatever do so by Monday this
now this video is live now if you are
watching the same video as a I mean on
YouTube because this video we will be
going public after half an hour if you
are watching this on youtube make sure
that I mean you can also send the page
if you know if you if you have better
designing so design the same page and
we'll try to use the uniform colors so I
want a white background s up now so the
background should be white we'll use the
same logo in fact we are applying to
also change the change the logo and the
links will be something like this so
just design this page once again so that
on Monday I will use your design to make
to write the Java part of it make sense
everyone here okay
so yeah that's it that's it about this
session if you have any queries you can
also pose that in the group so you are
the part of the other members of the
Facebook group congratulations for that
let's just build something awesome and
we're building this we'll also learn new
things even it will be a learning curve
for me as well I know will not be using
JSP and servlets in this project we'll
be using JSP but cannot serve this will
be using spring MVC I don't know it's
not difficult to learn spring MVC so so
you can just watch my videos on YouTube
so go to youtube and search for telesco
spring MVC and you will get the playlist
watch that latest and you're good to go
also learn about mask you'll because
we'll be building a mask will be also
building database for this so monday
itself will be building a database for
this and about the on the live session
thanks for joining people who are so
watching this on youtube or thanks for
joining us on monday same time around
4:30 p.m.
where we going live thank you
because initially you have torrents on
the build yes will be also using mavin
here okay will be building the project
using mavin so try to also learn mavin
and what else we care we're going to do
or say what yeah you have to only design
the page the back end pipe will be done
live and if you want you can also send
the the back end so if you want you can
also do the back again part of this let
me know if you have done that and upload
your project on github and do click on
this like button if you liked my idea so
I have clicked on this clicking on your
own thanks created on deposit clears up
now and let's see how to how do how I
will create a now how do I share with
you so time is let's create your own
repository okay anything say is what if
a person is not with a design that's
fine if you're not going to design in
don't tend to design it but only work on
the backend part at least you should be
something you should be good at
something right the last last day would
be Monday morning or not Monday morning
how many money will do what is called
very fine body designs a Monday morning
will do so mark a if you are from us
make sure you submit in is t-zone okay
then that's it stopping the broadcast
ring see you on Monday completely design
so that we can we can we can do the live
coding I hope it will be a wonderful
experience for you as well so that's it
stopping the broadcasting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
