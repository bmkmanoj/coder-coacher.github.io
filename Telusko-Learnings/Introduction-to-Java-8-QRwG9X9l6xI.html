the up in 20 and probably talk about the
new features in Java H now in this whole
series so if you if you watch the whole
series are talking about different
different features which is available
for Java 8 now if you think this is just
another update for Java then no this is
not just yet another update this is very
different now from 1.1 to 1.7 we got
lots of updates right example if you
know what 1.2 we called conditional API
in 1.7 be caught we can use underscores
between numbers we got some memory
management stuff but in jar 1.8 we
caught something very very very new for
Java now this something new is not
actually very new for the programming
world but this is new for Java it was
there in Scala it was there in Haskell
it was there in all the languages which
works on clouds but not Java now Java
took some time to implement that
technology but you know it's there now
and that something is called as
functional programming now functional
programming is there from have a long
time in fact Scala
Haskell in fact c-sharp they all support
functional programming but not Java but
in Java one point H we got functional
programming so we got three very
important features so the first one is
functional programming the second one is
something called as lambda expression
and the third one is which is my
favorite is stream API we got other
updates also but is very important so
this will start with the small update
the first update we got is now we can
define methods and interface are you
hearted client in till 1.7 we can alter
define methods we only declare methods
in interface right but in Java 0.8 we
can define methods but how can you do
that that we'll see in the when we start
with the coding so time being in Java 8
it supports where we can write difficult
defined methods in interface now the
second update we got is functional
programming now we talked about object
oriented programming in effect in
if you talk about object-oriented it is
there there from nineteen all right it's
there from 80 it is approximately in 80s
we got this transom it is object and
from 80s to till now we are implementing
objects right the main the main thing is
object but now the main thing is not
object the main thing is the function it
should have focus on focusing on the
object you have to focus on the behavior
of the object all right when you talk
about behavior it is a function right so
you define a behavior by its function
so initial focusing on objects now we
will focus on functions now there are
two techniques one is imperative code
type of coding and seconds declared a
type of coding so when we have
imperative programming and then we have
declarative programming they imperative
programming you specify what to do and
how to do it in declarative programming
we mentioned how to do it we don't have
to focus on how to do it okay I think we
see that when you start with the coding
so we got this two updates first one we
can define interface we can define
methods and interface the second one is
functional programming the third one is
something called as lambda expression
now it is lambda expression this is
important for those people who are who
are going for Android programming
working for or working on a platform for
Android studio on people who want to go
for head you which is Big Data
programming or if you want to update
yourself from Java 7 to Java 8 the first
thing you should know is what is lambda
expression now when you write up code
you know anyway you type up when you
whenever you write anonymous inner
classes what we do is we write lots of
boilerplate code okay so in lambda
expression we have to remove that what
you say boilerplate code and you have to
focus on the main thing so in lambda you
only mentioned in the main thing not the
boilerplate code and I can how to do
that we'll see in the coding part so
this does the interaction for all those
things now the fourth one what you
fourth update but the fourth update is
your stream API now it is stream API you
know when we talk about programming like
so in Java we can define methods and in
those methods if you don't define a
lecture you are using some variables and
those variables are mutable variables
which means you will change the values
of those variables now if you are
changing the values that means if you
have multiple threads working on the
same method so two threads are trying to
use the same variable which is shared
variable right and whenever you have
mutation on or what you say we have
concurrency on shared variables now it
create problems and to solve those
problems we have Shiv API
now using Shiv API you can do the same
thing but you don't have to debug your
code stream API will make sure you don't
have bugs in your those type of work
where you have mutation okay especially
when you work with collection API I have
subsidy when you work with database
connections and anybody walk with stream
API it will help you for all those
things okay
stream API helps you to achieve
concurrency it helps you to achieve
functional programming so in this using
stream api you can focus on what to do
instead of focusing on how to do it so
make sure you watch all those videos in
the further tutorials and once you learn
everything you will be having you will
be knowing something new in java which
most of them don't know okay which will
be helpful when you go for the interview
or maybe when you join a company so
thanks for watching and make sure you
watch all the tutorials thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
