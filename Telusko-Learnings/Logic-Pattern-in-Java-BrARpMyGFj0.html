patent and this is what way to draw here
now we have already seen lots of
patterns right now what is different in
this so till now we are walking with
stars hash dollars but it is the first
time we are walking with characters I
guess now in this characters what do I
want to print us we want to print in the
first time you want to print Java the
second line will be a b8 and we have V a
and a now there are multiple ways of
doing this right so we'll be looking at
this shortest way and the best way to do
this now whenever you have a looks like
we are going to print a string so we
have a string variable which is s and
the value of this s is let's say Java
which is this keyword here so we have a
value as Java right now before starting
with the actual code
let me just print something here so I
want to print only J now how to fetch J
from this string s we can simply say s
dot so there's a method of Alice care
act in which you can pass the index as 0
so if you pass an index 0 you will get J
because this can it function or Garrett
method will fetch the character at that
particular location so when you say 0 it
will fetch is J and if I run this code
we got J right if I mentioned it has not
0 but 1 and if I got this cold
we got a right so that's how it works so
we whenever we want to fetch a single
character we use care add function now
once we know about that now let's start
with the implementation now before
starting with this let's print Java Java
Java Java will print all Java here to do
that since we have a tabular format we
can use a for loop we can use nested for
loop okay so we can say I equal to 1 and
then looking go for for and then i plus
plus and inside this we have one more
loop which will which will take care of
the columns which is j here so I will
say J equal to 1 and then J less than
equal to 4 and J plus plus
now in order to brand us we can simply
say sis out without the Ln part I will
say trend default print the characters I
will say s dot CAD at J since J's J is
calling counting the column right but
the problem is your string starts the
index and up string starts with 0 right
so this is 0 J is 0 this is 1 this is 2
and this is 3 right so we cannot go till
4 so what we can do here we can mention
J minus 1 ok and after every inner for
loop will simply print a new line and in
fact we also need a space here so that
we can see that J after J we have a
space here and if I have this code
because Java Java Java Java right but we
want we don't want all java's what we
want is we want some spaces initially
and depend upon the number of columns so
number of photos so for the first row
the the the printing should start with
the first first column itself in the
second row the printing should start
with the second column and in the third
third row the printing should start with
the third column so you can see a
pattern there so what we can do is
before printing this thing we can check
if if my J value is less than I if that
is a situation I don't want to print the
character I will
I just want to print this space ok else
I want to print the character and if I
run this code that's it we got the
output right it's that simple
so if you're just striking the code
number of columns so you if your column
number is less than your door number it
should print space atom I should train
the character it's that simple right so
that's it that's it from this video so
this is how we can print a java pattern
with the help of four loops so yeah
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
