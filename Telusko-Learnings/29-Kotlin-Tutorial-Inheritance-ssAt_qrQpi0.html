different ethical Earthlings and in this
video we'll talk about inheritance and
Cartland now we have talked about class
where you can have a class and we can
also create object of it and then we
have seen how to use constructors so
let's try to understand how to do in
height in sphere because again when you
when you are coming from Java background
you know what is inheritance right and
we also know that in Java we cannot go
for multiple inheritance again when you
write a code link code as well
ultimately it will get converted into
byte code right so somewhere you have to
for the same rules so the rules we have
in Java the same rules is applicable
here as well but then how to achieve
inheritance
so for that let me get a class here
another clock I will call this class as
human we all are human spheres right and
this is our class which is human and now
I want to have a metal here let's say we
all human think right so we say public
or what was that so we say fun and we
say things since we can think right okay
and then we will print it is a so we'll
say print Ln and will print every human
thing and they do real thinking right so
this is real thinking so humans think in
real world right so whatever they think
is real but when it comes to a virtual
world we have VR aliens right we we
don't think in real world we always
think in virtual world so I mean let's
let's go with a normal class here so if
I create object off human here and if I
say the first human is let's say let's
say we have we have my uncle now that's
my nephew name so let's say Bank and
then if I say human okay so if I'm
creating an object of my I mean human
here and then I can call things right so
mine is only three years old what I
don't know what he thinks in his life
but then let's say if I say mind dot
think anyone on this code you can see we
got the output as oh what's that is the
previous output I was doing some
experiment there okay so let me just run
this code and as you can see that it is
printing real thinking now so this is
your normal class right now what if I
create one more class let's say if I
create a class and let's say this is
alien and now when you say alien alien
also humans right so any
we are we we all were humans and then
once you get into this IT world and when
you learn this programming stuff where
you can create what just watch yourself
first
so after learning all these things you
became an alien now and you as an alien
you also have I mean you let's say if
you don't have any properties here and
instead of creating object of human if I
say now mangle and things like language
23 years old now and let's say after
after two years when I when I teach him
Java of course he will be an alien right
and now if I say my link you are an
idiot now and if I say my name dot think
now of course right you can see there is
an error now mine cannot think because
we don't have a method called let's
think in alien so normally what we do in
this case is we in height right so what
we do is we use a concept of inheritance
now it is in heightened so we have a
class alien which will extend or what
you say inherit human now if you are
coming from Java background we know that
we use a extends keyword there but in in
Kotlin we use : now again the same colon
concept is there in C++ as well so I
will use a human so this is how you
extend or what you say you inherit and
as you can see there is no other here
but then we got an error here itself now
what is the issue the first issue is you
have to use you have to call a primary
constructor of of a human that's how it
works I mean whenever you inherit your I
mean you of any class you have to make
sure that you use a constructor but then
still we are getting an error now why
error because by default inheritance
should not be allowed I mean this this
concept is there from a long time in the
programming world or the software has
been boiled that when you get a class
make sure that you make your class final
see if you want to make it if you want
your class to be in hated by other
classes which it should show your
intention right so by default even if
yours is working in Java Java world we
should make our plans final why you
should allow anyone to ask extend your
own class right it is your features so
when you when you work on real project
you normally make sure that whatever
class you create you put a fine
in front of them so we can stop in
hydrants with the other final keyword
right so that's what we should do in
Java
now Courtland says when you know that
all the class should be final by default
if you want anyone else to extend your
class it should show your intention I
mean it it should be from your side by
default all the classes in Cortland are
final even if you don't mention that as
you can see I have not mentioned
anything called as final here by default
everything is final I mean all the
classes are final in Cortland and that's
why you can see it is giving you an
error it says this type is final so it
cannot be inherited form now how can we
solve that do we have a you we do we do
we use a keyword called as non final
here no right we don't have such
keywords but we have one keyword which
we can use and that keyword is called as
open now what open means open means that
you are allowing your class that it can
be united by some other classes as well
so if you if you know that you are going
for inheritance just use open that means
if we don't use open open by default it
will be a final class which means if we
not you cannot extend that class or you
cannot inherit class so inheritance
I mean if you want your class to be
knighted it should show your intentions
and that's why we have to use open
notice compulsory and now if I say Mike
dot thank if I don't this code okay
everything for the output and can you
see that we got the output now that
means even this is working so that means
your inheritance works in this way now
what if I what if you have multiple
inheritance let's say if I create one
more class and if I this I will take
this class as maybe computers or maybe
let's say let's say any class here
doesn't matter and if I say human comma
computer let's see if it is working or
not
the moment you do that you can see we
are getting an error it says only one
class may appear in this super type list
which simply means that you cannot
extend more than one class so yes you
cannot go for multiple inheritance with
classes in Kotlin as well okay because
of course right when you convert when
you compile your code link code it gets
converted into Java and enjoy
it doesn't support multiple items now if
you don't know what's the reason what I
would suggest you to go to go to my
channel and search for why multiple
inheritance is not supported in Java you
will get an idea from that video okay so
we have class alien and the gods human
and everything is working here that
means this is how we can use inheritance
so all these classes all these all the
functions which are there in your
superclass will be will be a part of
your subclass as well now we just have
one issue now Mike is an alien right of
course Mike will not think in real world
so what I want is I want to say think
func fun thinking or think now you know
right what I'm doing here I'm trying to
override this method and I will print
here virtual thinking because of course
we are programmers or we are IT
professionals and we think in in virtual
world
now the make the moment you do that you
can see it is it is giving you an error
it says think hides member of super type
human and need to override modifier okay
so that means whenever you go for the
method overriding it should show your
intention that you are intentionally
overriding it normally what happens you
know let's say if you have a class and
in that class in that class you have
multiple methods or functions and by
mistake you are overriding one of the
method which is very important and it
may happen that you know by mistake you
can do that so if you if your intention
is not that just don't I mean just
flight override and it shows your
intention that you are powerful
purposefully overriding our method okay
now again we got an error right now see
you might be thinking Java is much
better right because we don't have to do
all these things in Java but then in
software industry in software
development thing this is commonly known
problem so the way the one way to solve
it is to make it compulsion for
developers to write this right now we
got an error
it says paint in human is final oh that
means this method is also final knife we
remember in Java if you have a method
final it means you cannot override it
and by default all the functions or the
methods in coddling are final that means
now it guessed it right we have to use a
open keyword now
open key word it means that you are
allowing someone else to I mean you are
allowing someone else to override your
method and now as you can see you fall
on this code
okay waiting for the out but you can see
that we got virtual thinking right so
that's great so we know how to in each
class now and we also know how to
achieve method overriding so this is
overriding right you have to remember
this thing so by default all the classes
are final even if you talk about this
aiding class this is final now if you
create a new class here if you create a
new class which is a programmers and if
you try to enter it alien it will not
work because alien is a user final class
now if you want to open it just write a
open keyboard right so this is open this
is an open class and you have to make
sure that you give a keyword open same
applies to the method overriding you
cannot do that you have to keep it open
so that anyone else can override it and
then you can print the all thinking in
humans we got virtual thinking in alien
so I hope you enjoyed this in fact yeah
before going ahead I would just want to
leave one more thing what you can also
do is you can let's say in in Java what
normally we do is let's say if we have
two classes human and alien we can
create a reference of human something
like this we can say human and we can
say edge equal to new age and this is
what we do in in in Java right but in in
if you if you see this we are not
mentioning e-type anyways right how do
you mention that this is a human only
even if you got the inclination for an
alien how can you make it human so what
we can do is we can give a colon and we
can mention human right
so if you want to achieve this thing so
we can use we can also use colon here so
by specifying colon we are specifying
that our intention here is to create a
reference of human and object of alien
right and that's it that's how you do
you do in heightens in heightens in in
cotton so that's it from this video in
the next video we'll talk about some
more concepts of object-oriented till
then stay tuned and make sure you
subscribe the channel because there are
lots of videos on the way
so thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
