video we'll talk about where args so
before starting with way last let me go
with an example let's say we have a
class here and the name of the class is
Lai we have display so we have a class
here which is display ok in this display
class I have a method called show simple
but the only work of this method show is
to accept a parameter from user so let's
say int a and just to display the value
so we'll say this with the value that's
it you know it's we kept it very simple
so we have a class display here which
has a method show it takes some
parameter they'd say 1 which is a here
and it prints it that's it now in order
to call that display we have to say
display will say obj equal to new
display here and let's call that show
method so we can say obj dot show and
here we can pass a value let's say 5
cool so if you pass this value 5 it will
send this value 5 in a and we are
printing the value right let's run this
if I run this you can see the value is 5
but let's say I want to pass two values
so 1 is 5 second is 6 so in that
scenario we don't have any method which
prints which takes two parameters so in
this scenario what we'll do is we'll go
for method over loading in which we have
two methods with the same name by
different parameters so what we'll do is
we'll say int a comma B and we'll print
both the elements here so it is out and
B so we are printing a and we are
printing be simple well let's say I have
three three parameters here so again we
have to repeat the same task right so
the problem here is if you don't know
how many values user will be sending
then we have to know we have it is very
difficult to predict or we define all
the methods so let's say if user passing
only one parameter so you need a method
with only one parameter if user pass two
arguments
you require two parameters if user
passed three arguments if we have to you
know depend upon the number of arguments
you have to specific number of
parameters zero so Java came up with a
concept called a so instead of writing
all this thing we can use something
called as well arc so there is something
called as where arms now where arcs
stands for it is variable variable
arguments not it says is if you don't
know how many parameters user will how
many values will be sending so you can
just use and add it right so you can
specify end and a with an array so this
an a a will occupy all this values but
hold on is not working right you can
still say there's an error if you can
pass these values in array format in a
it will work right so even if you pass
one element it will accept it when if
you pass two elements it will accept it
when if you pass ten elements it will
accept but it's not working here the
problem is if if Java says okay we I
will work with this then how about if
you are passing an array from there okay
so it will be confusion it will be
confusing right and that's why Java came
with a new syntax which says after this
ain't just specified three dots so if
you specify three dots here which simply
says I don't know how many parameters
these will be sending so except
everything which is which is coming but
make sure everything will be of same
type in cool so if you send five six and
seven
everything will be will be coming in
this a now since we have multiple values
in one element here so this is not a
normal element it's an arena so in order
to print values of array we can use the
enhanced for the PIO so we'll say for
int I in a and we can use a curly
brackets here okay I'm sure fainting AI
will print I now if you pass three
values this three values will be going
to a and then from a I'll be fetching
one element at a time
and if you run this now so if I say run
you can see the answer is 5 6 &amp;amp; 7
cool how about if I pass eight values
and if I run this so you can see we have
sorry not 8 values for value so it will
print those 4 values and we are passing
values as 5 6 7 &amp;amp; 8
let's join XM and what about if I pass
8.0 so if 8.0 is double so we don't have
anything double here cool so it will not
work here so it was it only needs or the
similar type of elements now let me do
some experiment let's say if I define
one more method for method overloading
so it's a public void show and this void
show except only one value with say a ok
and it's print the value of a here cool
and with a let me print n in show a so I
have just printing this message which is
in shove a knife I pass four parameters
which method it will call the int array
or a so let's try with this so if I run
this of course it will print int add it
I it is because we are passing four
values how about only one parameter now
what it will print since even if you
write one even if you do not have this
so if I come in this part and you fill
on this now so it says 5 that means it
is running this code here but how about
if I remove the comment and if I don
this it shows it shows 5 in show a that
means if you pass a value initially it
will search for a method with the exact
signature if it is not there then it
will search for the where arcs
ok so point I remember whenever you work
with verax it will always give priority
to the exact number of elements and then
only then only it will go for the where
arcs cool so that's how we can use where
arcs then your question will be where
you will implement this or where arcs so
there is something called as you know in
the class called as a day so they
the coolaser method called aztlán
arrays there is a method called as as
list so if you can see this as list
method which takes the number of
elements as you can see there's three
dots here which simply specify this as
list method is it suppose we're arms
okay so there are lots of implementation
of error so you can you can implement
this in your project also cool so that's
that's all about we're out so I hope
