use this methods which are map and
reduce now in this video we'll see we
will do some modification and let's go
for a new logic here okay so what we'll
do now instead of having this values let
me change the value we'll say the value
is 12
20:35 46 55 and 68 so I'm going for this
kind of values and let me go for one
more value which is 75 so these are my
values which is twelve twenty
twenty-five 46 55 68 and seventy five
now what I want to do here is I want to
add all the elements or I want to add
all the elements which are divisible by
five but that means I want to add this
25 55 and 75 or even 20 so all these
numbers are divisible over five and
that's why I want to add these numbers
now in order to do this with the help of
collection for the logic of collection
what we can do is we can use a for loop
in fact we can we need one more variable
here we'll say int result initial value
of result will be 0 and in this what we
can do is we can apply a for loop will
say int i in all the elements of values
or all the values which is a list here
and fetch one value check that value if
that value is divisible by 5 how to
check we say I mod 5 is equal to equal
to 0 so by this you will get all you can
check the number is a divisible by 5 or
not once it is once it says true it's
usable by 5 what you can simply do is
you can say result we can use a
shorthand here we'll say result result
equal to a result plus I now since this
is we can also use a shorthand here
instead of writing result equal to
result less 1 what we can simply do is
we can just remove this part and we'll
say a plus on this side this is a
shorthand for result equal to result
plus 1 result plus I
okay and then that's it but by doing
this what we get is a result which is as
out if I print the value of result here
so I should give me 20 plus 25 which is
55 55 plus 55 which is 110 110 plus 75
it is 185 so the output I'm expecting
here is 185 okay so let's run this code
to check if we are getting the right
output and okay yeah and the answer is
185 right so we can use this logic or
since again if you if you're doing in
this way this is extra iteration and we
have to apply all the logic now the
problem is this type of codes are called
as imperative coding which means you
have to focus on both the things is it
what to do and how to do now if you use
if you do the same thing using stream
API stream says you only focus on on
what to do I will take care of how to do
it so what we can do is we can just
simply say s out and instead of using
external for loop we can use our
internal photo we'll use a for a values
dot these are again there's a method
called a stream it will convert your
list into a stream then from this stream
now I want to remove all the values
which are not used well five I want to
do I want to remove this 12 I'm going to
remove this 46 and I want to remove this
68 now how to remove so this is there
something else fritto now filter is
again a method of stream we takes a true
or false value now how to represent a
true or false value here I can simply
say for every element of I the body will
be I mod 2 is equal to equal to 0 it's
not - it's 5 so I mod 5 is equal to
equal to 0 if this will remove all the
elements which are not divisible by 5 so
it will only it will only forward those
values which are developer
by five now once you've got the filter
NAR going to add how to add we have
already seen that using reduce operator
or the deuce method we need to pass two
values one is C comma Eve carry and the
element and we'll have will apply C plus
either either you can use integer colon
colon some which we have done in the
last video or we can directly use this
thing and if I run this I should be
getting 125 2 times 185 2 times yeah so
this one answer with this logic and
second answer with this logic much
simpler right and the advantages this is
internal iteration clear now how what is
how this filter works that we'll see in
the so it's now see we know how reduce
works right we have seen in the last
video it takes our object or by the
operator what about this filter now to
understand filter that will that will
see the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
