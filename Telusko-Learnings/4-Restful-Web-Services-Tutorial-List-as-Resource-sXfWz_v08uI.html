return this list right inside let me run
this code one second just to show you
what we have done in the last session so
let me just run it as colonel server
let's send next and click on finish so
by the time it runs in running state let
me just say okay demo rest we have to
mention web api three members right and
then we have to request for the aliens I
would say aliens on it you can see we
are getting one alien what are expecting
now is it should return multiple aliens
right so let's see if I create one more
object here so the way we have Naveen
here and let me just copy the ID let's
paste it here
and this time we'll go for a two and
let's assign this is a two and A two
let's set it let's go for a different
name let's say the name is r2 here and
let's say the value is let's say 70 so
we got Naveen sixty point are 370 points
and now I want to return a list I want
to return a list so what I will do here
is I will say leave stuff alien I will
say aliens equals U and I will say new
at least or maybe I can simply say
arrays dot as this we do we do have
these two objects right so we can say a
1 comma a 2 and got them at least let me
put the package for list and let me just
do that or something it is building
automatically let's say control-shift oh
and yeah we got our list right now once
we got at least let's return a list so
instead of returning a a 1 okay I should
be taking this window somewhere down
right it will be better at least I will
not be getting the pop up every time
okay so instead of returning a a one I
want to return a aliens right so I want
to return a list of aliens but the
problem is here also we have to mention
it is a least of alien right and now
everything gets set up I think it will
work now okay so I have to restart my
server let me just do that and I don't
have a server tab here let's say oh it's
getting started
let's go back to fire fork and now if I
say aliens now that makes sense right
you can see we are searching aliens and
regard to aliens regard alien and regard
aliens regard the first alien as naveen
second alien as RT and that's the beauty
about xml right so we are only seeing
now how to fetch list of alien but what
about if you want to fetch only one one
object now maybe I don't want to fetch
all the aliens and by the name for this
would be get aliens okay so let's say I
don't want to fetch the are all the
aliens I want to be very specific now I
want to fetch the first alien with name
Naveen I want to fetch a alien with name
RP something like this if I say aliens /
Naveen it should return Naveen if I say
a RT should return RT but it's not
working now how exactly it will work
that we'll see in the coming video we'll
also see how to create a resource I want
to create a new resource and there's one
more thing you know normally what
happens is you get this data from the
database and as you can see we are
creating our own resource here
statically so it will also see how to
create a separate class which will give
me this object maybe a demo what you say
I dummy database or maybe a mock
database you can call it as so yeah I
will see that in the coming video so I
hope you are enjoying this session but
make sure that you subscribe my channel
and do share this with video with your
friends that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
