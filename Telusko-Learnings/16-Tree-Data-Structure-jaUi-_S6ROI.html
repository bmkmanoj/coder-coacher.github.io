Freddie and in this video we'll talk
about a tree data structure now we have
talked about link last stack and Q
naught 3 is another ADT now if you talk
about tree it is basically a structure
where it's similar to linkage you can
say so in English what we have is let's
say if you have a node and you have B
node so what happens is a node will have
a reference of be no Dwight and then B
node will have a reference of C node so
we have this in linear format in tree
what we have is we have two almost
similar structure but then with a
difference in tree we normally create a
structure like a tree but you can
imagine a mirror image of a tree
normally in tree we have roots we have
branches we have leaves in the same way
if you talk about a tree here imagine
this is a root node this is a root of
the tree and this a instead of having
one reference may have multiple
reference in this case I'm going to
references so a will be knowing about BB
will I mean a will be knowing about C
and then D so after a we have these
three nodes
maybe this C itself will have some other
nodes let's say we have X and here we
have Y and maybe this D has one more
node here which is maybe K so k so we
have all this all this nodes here now
this is the topmost node right okay
everything every box here is called as
nodes so this are nodes here and this
the line between this nodes a parlous
edge so I would say this is edge so we
have this as node B X Y C it all our
nodes and then this is edge and the
topmost is called as a root node because
this is where your tree is getting
started this is your root node now if
you talk about this a so a has a node
which is B a a has a node which is C and
a has a node which is deed right
the same goes with CC has x and y but
what about this K what about this Y and
X we don't have any other further nodes
here and in fact B as well we don't have
other nodes so this nodes are called as
a leaf node because we don't have
anything at the end of that so the
topmost is called as root node this is
where you will start your travel cell
if you want to store data as well you
will start from the root node and then
you will go down and down and down so
this is your node and then the end nodes
I call this leaf nodes so these are
normal nodes in between but then a has a
special name is dot node now this is
about tree this is so you can represent
this with different languages using Java
C C++ Python now with this we have a
very special type of tree which is
called as a binary tree now what does
binary tree means now binary means to
write so if I know it so let's say if
you have a node which is a and if this
node has two mode nodes like C or D so
maximum if you have two nodes this is
called as a bunny nodes so we have two
nodes the binary nodes and that's what
the tree is called as binary tree where
every node will have max to my ex two
nodes so either you can have a zero node
or we can have one node or we can have
two nodes and not more than that so this
is how you represent your binary tree
now in fact in binary tree as well we
have that in certain types let me just
write it here so we have certain types
in binary tree so first one is strict
binary tree so we have the first one
which is strict binary tree nowadays
panic-stricken a tree means a tree where
and every node will have two sub nodes
or no children so again we have one more
term here so the C and D are less
children's so if I have a here and if a
has two which is C and D then this is
called as a straight mana tree in fact
you can also have inside C we can have
two more nodes let's say we have X and
we have Y this is also a strict binary
tree now you might be thinking about D
so yes we so when it when you say strict
it means either two or no children so
here you can see we don't have any
children to D now how about if I say we
have let's say X has one more child
let's say K now in that so now this is
not a straight binary tree because we
have only one element or one children
node for X so this is not a strict so
let me remove that so this is the first
type the second type we have as full
binary tree now it is full binary means
where you have an you have a tree where
every node Idol either has two I mean
they will be having two sub nodes the
example we have C and D again and D has
two let's say let's
we have x and y and D should also have
two more notes so that they will come on
the same so let's say we have P and Q
here right
so we have D also has two more notes
which is P and Q so a has C and D and C
has x and Y and D has P and Q so all the
leaf nodes should be on the same level
so you can see they're on the same level
so this is what you call as a full money
tree where all the children's are on the
same level the third one is called as a
complete binary tree when do you say a
binary tree is complete it's very simple
where you have a tree where all the
nodes are on a level so let's say if I
if I define that C and D again and here
if I say X and Y and then V so this is
also called as complete binary tree
because you have all the all the leaf
nodes on the level so let's say this
level is let's say I will call this
level as L so either it should be on a
level all l minus 1 now which means if
you have one mode here or two mode here
let's say we have K and we have C now
this is not a complete binary tree
because the leaf node on the or not on
on L and L minus 1 because if I say this
is L then this is L minus 1 but this is
this will not work so there should be
two more nodes here then it will be call
as complete binary tree right so this is
not a complete binary tree so if I undo
so this is a complete binary tree now
let me draw a simple simple tree here so
if I say we have a and then we have B we
have C and then we have inside B we have
D we have E and inside a we have F and
we have G and then I will draw a line
here so these are all my notes and
inside this F also we have two more
nodes here let me just draw it let's say
this is X and this is y so now looking
at this tree we have certain terms here
so again this is a root node right so
this is your root node and this C G Y X
I mean x and y and D those are your leaf
nodes now we have to remember two more
terms which is height and depth now what
it means
so that means
see if you talk about this e so what is
the depth of e it is a B and E so that's
a depth of this e and what about the
height of e so height would be it's the
the children's of e so we have F and we
have X right
maybe this X has two more two more two
more sub parts here let's say we have K
and we have L so now for for e it would
be F X and K so this is the height of e
so when I say the depth of e would be
two so we have so we have two because it
is a and B right so a and B those are
the two two two notes we have what about
the height of e it would be F X and K so
it will be three so I took three height
is three now what about the depth of a
root note it's always zero right because
this is the first element so we don't
have in depth what about the height of a
root note is again you say I have to say
a B P so we have to go over the longest
one so it is a be e F X and K so it's
one two three four five so height of
this tree is five oh that's a new term
now so we know the height of the root
node right so height of the root node is
same as height of the tree or you can
say height of the tree is same as height
of the root node so that's how you do we
have this tooth these two terms are
important when you go for the coding
part so yeah that's it that's what your
tree func tree thing is so we have
talked about what is tree we have talked
about binary tree now we're doing the
implementation of this using different
languages so I hope you enjoyed this
