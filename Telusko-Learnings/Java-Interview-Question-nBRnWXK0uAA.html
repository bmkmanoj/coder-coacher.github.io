question so in this what we'll do is
let's create a class and we'll name this
class as a so we have a class here
called as a now what happens if I create
the object of this class which is a new
a and if I try to print this so what
will be the output this is one of the
interview question so if I have a class
which is empty or doesn't matter if it
is empty or not there are lots of
variables or methods if I create the
object and if I try to print the object
or get the obj what will be the output
and now if I run this code so it take it
to take take two seconds and you know
try to against the answer you can just
pause the video think about it and come
back so once you have answer in your
mind let's run this code and here we go
that's your answer now this is not the
answer you can you you have to give to
your interviewer right so if you enter
your ask you what was the answer of this
code and if you say blah a and something
something something so he will say okay
you got something something something
not selected and that's the problem
right so you have to explain this in a
proper way why you are getting this type
of output so to demonstrate this what I
will do is we'll talk about this class a
by default all the classes in Java they
extend that class called as object so it
doesn't matter if you like this extends
here or not by default every class in
Java extends object class now if you try
to try to use this if you try to print
this obj what happens is by default this
obj will call a method polish to string
even if you don't write to string here
it will call the method to string okay
then the question arise Oh PJ is the
object of a and in class a we don't have
any method called a to string and as the
magic since we don't have to string in
your class it will go to this parent
class which is object and when you go to
object class here so you can say in
object class we have a method called as
two strings so let me search tostring
here
okay so there's a class scholarship
there's a method called as to string
okay so whenever you put in the object
it will call to string method which is
this method here and what is printing
it's printing the class name okay so we
are saying get get class dot get name
which was it is the class name then it
is a trait so you can see the output it
is your class name which is here a dot
interviewed is a package interview is
the package dot a it's a class name at
the rate and then it is also printing a
hash code so it is hash code it's
basically a number for every object okay
so in your heap memory there will be
lots of objects and those objects will
be in a container so there will be lots
of containers and each container will
will have different different objects or
maybe multiple objects can belongs to
the same cut inner so in this scenario
you will be getting the hash code which
is a unique number and that hash code
will be in a binary format so you have
to convert that money format into
hexadecimal format okay so we can do
that with the help of two hex string
okay so you can see this is a
hexadecimal format of the binary string
okay so this this should be your answer
so if interview ask you what will the
output you have to say it will print the
class name with a qualified class name
which with which means package name and
class name at the rate hash code cool so
that's it from this video so in the next
video we'll talk about how to override
to string method so thank you for
watching and do subscribe for further
