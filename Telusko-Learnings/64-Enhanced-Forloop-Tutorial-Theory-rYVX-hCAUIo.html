different Eliska learnings and in this
video we talk about enhanced for-loop so
this is a theory for enhanced for-loop
and we also have a practical after that
so why we require a new fog loop and you
already have a for loop right so I know
we are we are coming from C C++ and
everybody use for loops right so this is
a main one of the best loops we have
nothing what with the for loop so that's
how it looks like right we have a for
loop in which you have to specify the
initial value you have to specify the
condition and then we have to specify
the increment or decrement operator now
let's say I want to fetch the values of
an adding so I thought you can use an
added or you can use a collection but
since we have not covered collection yet
so let's talk about adding so let's say
we have an adding here and this a days
off at around six seven elements let's
say we have six element added here now
how to fetch values whenever you want to
fetch the values of an array we have to
specify the index number right so let's
say your array name is values so to
fetch the first value what we'll do
we'll specify values and in bracket we
have to mention 0 right so it will give
you the first value you have to specify
values in drag you have to specify 1 it
will give second value or second index
number so it's like a second value with
the index number one so when you want to
fetch the values of an array you know if
you have seen the example where we have
talked about arrays so imagine a day is
a tray of cups right so whenever you
have this tray of cups why you have to
count while providing the let's say you
want to take out some cups from the tray
so you don't count why this is for you
this is for you what we do we take out
the cup and we provide we give it to
those people right in the same way if
you have an array here why to specify
the index number while fetching the
value can we do something but you don't
have to specifying the index number
directly you can use it in factor when
you use this index number this for loop
it may generate bugs so in order to do
that we in order to solve that problem
we have the enhanced for-loop
well you don't mention the index number
right so we have while searching the
values of an array in this for loop is
specifying the index number in enhanced
for loop we don't specify the index
number then question arise how it works
so this is syntax well announced for
though we just write for then
mention the data type which is int right
so let's say we have integer values if
it is string values you can provide that
string then you have to mention the
variable name and we have to specify :
and the add a name so what will happen
now so let's imagine we have an added
something like something looks like this
so from this array we have to fetch
values right so let's say the first
element is 5 and you want to fetch that
value 5 now so when you work with this
for look at you specify values in
negative dimension 0 right or I which
will fetch the value here this enhancer
for loop will itself will go to the
array and it will fir it will fetch the
value 5 and it will put it into our that
I variable right so now the value of I
is 5 so we are printing the value of I
in the next iteration it will fetch the
next value of your array let's say it is
7 so it will fight 7 now so the value of
I is 7 so I there is not a index number
I is the value ok it's the value from
the array so that's the main difference
between the normal for loop and
announced for loop in enhance further we
don't count the index numbers which is
the values and print so from today we
have to use which should be using and
ask for the right not normal for loop
but hold on announced for loop only
works with arrays and collections right
and you have to fetch all the elements
you cannot say I will fetch only first
five elements you have to fetch all the
elements using an ask for loop but in
normal for loop we can specify how much
value we need right so depends what
which what's your requirement if you
want to go for limited values go for
normal for loop if you undergo for
entire array you can go with enhanced
for loop so that's how you announce for
the works
we'll see the implementation in the next
video where we have the practical so
