ready from fiscal earthlings and in this
video we'll talk about hash map hash
table okay we also talked about linked
hash map and then we'll talk about map
interface so I start with it now let's
imagine you would you want to create a
phonebook so application which look like
phonebook so in this we have we have two
things right we have list of names and
we have list of numbers right so we want
to map a number with a name so let's
imagine you know about a des least so in
one a dish we can have list of string
right so we can have names there and we
can have name of the list of numbers
time beam let's cap the phone number as
string okay so what we can do we can
create two at least one for numbers and
second for name so I just imagine we
have two energies to you one with
numbers or one with names and second
with numbers and now you can map so we
have some names here so we have Naveen
we have pooja we have Ali we have Mahesh
we have Archana so we have all these
names right and with those names we have
numbers so with the name so for a
particular name we have a pretty good
number right but what if if I they move
one of the name in between so as soon as
I move a name so the other names will go
up right so we have a mismatch for the
other the remaining elements in there
and that's why at least creating two
arrays for a phone book is not that
suitable why we require a name is
because to recognize the number right so
in your phone in your phone book of your
mobile phone why we have a name so that
we can search the number right so when
you have this type of relationship where
you need our element for the which will
act as a key for the value right so your
number is the value and your name is the
key to search a number you require a key
right so instead of using at least we
can use something else map interface so
using map you can you can have or you
can have two values in fact two things
one will be key and secondly value so
this is how it looks we have map in
which you have to specify two things the
key and the value right
and again we have to use genrich's to
specify what type of key and what type
of value we have so in our example both
are string but it may be integer it may
be float anything you want and in this
if you want to add value so you have to
use a medical as put so using put you
can assign two values one is the key and
second will be the value right so which
is your value key and value pair now
each entry in the map so let's say if
you are entering Naveen and the phone
number so that one thing is was one
entry okay because in map interface we
also have an interface for entry
interface which will hold one entry
again we'll talk about that later so we
have a map and the entry interface but
the problem is map is the interface
right how can you create how can you
create the object of interface of course
that not possible right so we have to
search for a class which implements map
and we have four classes which implement
map in fact we have I guess yeah we are
we have four classes so the first class
we have as hash map then we have hash
table then we have a tree map or tree
hash map so we have tree hash map and
then we have linked hash map okay so
let's start the first one we have hash
map here so using hash map you can
create the object of map and you can add
the elements right that's simple now
question arises how to how to add values
we can simply say m dot put you can pass
two values one through two things one
will be the key and second is value so
nubbin is the key when mobile number is
the value so let's say if I say puja is
the name mobile number so that's that's
the value all right so the key and the
value pair so let's say you have added
all the values so you have five values
there now question arise how to print
this values in case of analyst we can
simply specify the index number and you
will get the name right put the problem
is with with map you need something
extra to fetch the value we need a key
right so let's imagine I want to fetch
the number of puja for that I have to
pass the key as pooja right so in map we
have a method called as get so we have
to say map object let's imagine this is
phone book so we have phone book get in
bracket you have to pass the name which
is a key you may
awesome right so if you know the key you
will get a number so that's very simple
right so if you know the if you know the
key you will get the number but it's a
problem here the problem is what if you
want to print everything start to end
how to do that to print all the values
we should know all the keys right if you
know the if you know all the keys you
will know all the all the values because
in the get method you have to pass the
key it will give you the value but
question arise how would we know the key
I want all the keys right so in this
scenario what if asked map give me all
the keys is it possible yes a map has a
method or a ski set okay which will give
you all the keys now you have to take
the set it rate this side so you can use
you can see the code here so you can
just iterate this set okay with the help
of Finance for loop and when you iterate
you will get one key at a time pass that
key for the method which is get and you
will get the value all right so that's
that's awesome that's how we can you can
fetch all the values from the map so
this is one way the second way is using
map entry now this is very this is very
interesting if you are going for a Java
interview this is the frequently asked
question what do you mean by Java or
what is what do you mean by map entry so
entry is the interface in map
ok so map is interface inside that we
have interface so this is necessary
interface can you imagine interface
inside interface so that's entry
interface inside map interface okay so
in your map you have a method called as
entry set ok which will give you this
set of entries and what is entry key
value pair is one entry ok so you can
see we have a map and the first the one
box is one entry so you will get the set
of entries and of course you'll be
getting the hole hash table right now
what you can do you can iterate this set
and when you fetch the value one one
value you will not get single string you
will get an entry and in that entry will
be having two things value and the key
and the value right and you can print
key and value with the help of get
negate key and get value right and
that's why this entry map entry
interface is so important ok so that's
how you can fetch
all the elements so this is hashmap but
what about hash table then
what's the difference between hash map
and hash tables so hash table is same as
hash map okay working is almost same but
there is some difference hash table is
there from 1.0 so it was there from Java
I know when JA was introduced hash table
was there
what about hash map it was introduced in
1.2 wasn't so hash map is new newer then
hash table a second difference hash map
is not thread-safe hash table is ok that
means every method in hash table is
thread-safe because that that means they
are synchronized in it hash map is not
synchronized okay of course when it is
not synchronize which is more faster of
course hash map is faster than hash
table because hash table is synchronized
and that byte is slow so if you want
speed if you if you know that you're
working with on this one thread in your
application always go for hash map but
if you are working with multiple threads
at that time you should work with hash
table okay oh these are some more
difference one difference is in hash map
you can have one key which is null
but in hash table you cannot have any
knowledge keys okay you should have all
the elements here that's it as a
difference between hash map and hash
table okay but then we have one more
which is linked hash map the defense
this difference is if we talk about hash
map and hash table in both insertion
order is not fixed okay it may change
but if you want your order should be
fixed the insertion order should be
fixed always use linked hash map okay
and let's say if you want the hash map
which is in solid format you write it
guess we we have we have three hash map
in which you have all the elements which
is already sorted with the help of
pre-sorting okay so this is all about
hash map hash table linked hash map and
tree map again we'll see the practical
of this in the next video so that's it
thanks for watching and do such
therefore for the videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
