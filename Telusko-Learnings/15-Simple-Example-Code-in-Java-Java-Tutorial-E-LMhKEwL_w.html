type a simple Java code now this code
the main aim for this code will be to
print hello right now when you say we
want to print hello so now we can see we
have an output for a sprint ello but
what we need is we don't want to type
every time hello hello hello what we
need is when you run a code when you run
a software then output the software
should give us hello so for that we have
to instruct our computer that I need a
output colors hello right so whenever
you want to instruct your computer you
have to write some code which will be
understandable to your computer so now
computer basically don't understand
English language it understand only
binary digit right so you need to begin
to do something you need to write some
programming you have to use some
programming language to instruct your
computer to print hello now for this you
have to use some particular type of
keywords alright so when you whenever
you work with any programming language
you have to work with some keywords so
now whenever you work with Java code now
remember the steps before starting any
code make sure you save the file it's
because when you type a code and
suddenly something happens with your
computer everything vanishes right so
make sure you write you you save some
code you save your file before running
it so what we can do is I will use my
videos my let me create one more Drive
you a folder called as Java do you have
a folder name it as Java okay and in
this folder I will name this file as
first code dot Java now whenever you
create a Java file you make sure you say
with it dot dot Java file okay so as you
know you might be using C language so
you have to store it as dot C when you
worry work with C++ you have to say CPP
and in Java you have to say dot Java now
this is your file right so we have
always saved it so whenever you want to
type this code now now what we need to
do is we need to just print hello right
now when you want to print hello now in
Java you have to use whenever you work
with something any way you want to a
specific task to be completed
you need methods right so when we talk
about methods
let me just minimize yeah so whenever I
talk about methods so to print a content
in Java you need a method called s print
so print is a method ok and we want to
print hello right now hello is a string
string means it's like a normal a string
literal so it's not a keyword so since
it's not a keyword you have to save it
in of you have to quote it in double
quotes so now we have to print right now
Java is a purely object-oriented
language and whenever you want to say
you want to print something you need
method right and this method belongs to
some object now you will not find
methods you know in global space mean
you will find methods in in particular
like in particular object so the object
where you find we will find print is
called as out object now in out object
you have a print method now this out
object is a in Bill method which is or
you know we can say it's pre-build
method
so a prebuilt object so it is saved in a
class for the system so system is a
class in which you you have object
colors out in this out object you have
method for a sprint so print we are
printing hello now that's right right we
have done with our tasks but let's
suppose when you compile this code now
when you compile this code after
compilation you have to run a code void
when you run this code your your your
code will run on JVM and when you talk
about JVM JVM always accept a java
application and whenever you talk about
JVM it will ask you for the function or
a method the default method it will ask
you for is called as a main method so
when we talk about execution of a code
on JVM it needs a main method it means
you have to enclose you have to enclose
this statement in a main method now when
you talk about main method you have to
specify main now as you know main will
do some work for a site whenever I talk
about methods methods are there to work
to work and it will give you some output
now main says I will I will do your work
but I will I want some parameters so it
will ask you for a string addict not
exactly a demeans we will see in
subsequent tutorials but time being main
method will ask you for a string adding
now since all methods will return
something and this main method will will
be done on null value so we have to say
void okay now then now when we talk
about Java language you have to work
with objects right now in
object-oriented programming methods are
of two types
first method type is static method and
second is non static method now exactly
what static and non-static means if we
will see in subsequent tutorials
but time being remember methods are two
types static and non-static whenever I
talk about static static belongs to
class okay and non static belongs to
object
okay but what we need is we need a main
function which will belongs to a class
not an object why it's not an object we
will see we will see later so we need a
static method static main method and I
want they I want to access the this main
method from everywhere so we have to
specify public so this public static
void main in brackets you have to
specify string adding and then system
dot out dot print okay that's it now the
problem is when we talk about Java Java
says everything should be in a class so
if you do not do something you need to
create a class and we will name it as we
will say first code now again it's a
convention that your file name should be
same as class name so class name is same
as file in right now we will use some
indentation noticing it is sort of
indentation because you have to specify
proper format so we have use indentation
okay now that's it we have come we have
typed our code right now now next we
have to compile this code now to compile
this code we can compile a code in CMD
so in command prompt now in this let me
just increase the font
okay now what we need to do is we need
to type a code here so like so we we it
would we need to compile this code how
to compile this code you might union you
remember I have saved this file in my
DVD drive and currently I'm in C Drive
right so I have to move towards D Drive
so to move to Detroit we have to say D
and we have a folder called a Java tubes
so we have Java tubes now to compile to
check we have a file is we have a five
RS first code okay now to compile this
file we have to use something with Java
C now you can see that we have anyway
when I say Java C and when i say enter
the the thing is Java C is not
recognized because Java C is stored in a
bin folder right so we will find that we
will find Java C here so what we need to
do is we need to pick up that file from
C Drive to do Drive and to do this we
have to specify a path for it so we have
to say set path and in this set path we
have to specify the whole path so I just
seen C Drive Program Files its Java JDK
and bin so we have set the path right so
whenever you want to work with Java code
you have to set the path and then now we
can we can say if I say Java C I am
getting some list I will be adding some
least I got the least so if you get this
list it means your Java C is working now
so to compile this code we have to say
Java C and first code dot Java enter
it's compiling it will take some time
here so it's compiled now to run this
code what we do is we have to say Java
so this is this specify JVM so Java
space and you have to mention the class
name this time you do not have to use a
file name when you compile a code you
have to use file name when you run this
so you have to use class thing so class
name is first code enter and you can see
we have an output called as hallo so
simple right so this is how this is your
first code and remaining part will see
in next session thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
