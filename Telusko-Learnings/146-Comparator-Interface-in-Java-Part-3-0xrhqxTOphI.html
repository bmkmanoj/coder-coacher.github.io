add elements interlaced using values dot
add and then we have sorted those
elements and then we printed that with
the help of this statement white now if
if you want to understand how this works
so just go to go to YouTube on my so you
can search for my channel on YouTube
just go to youtube and in my channel
just search for the disco learnings here
if you go to my channel I have a
different playlist all to our new
playlist for Java 8 so if you can search
for Java 8 here so we have Java 8
features and if you go to Java 8
playlist
you will find you will understand how
that thing works it just watch this
playlist you will understand what I mean
by that may not be this playlist but I
would have to please for Java 8 okay
this one so you just have to watch this
place is to understand how that thing
works okay so let me just I will paste
this link in the description area now
let's come back to the topic so we can
print in this way and we can print in
the enhanced for-loop way right so we'll
be using enhanced for-loop let me remove
all this stuff and we'll be using and as
product to print the elements so we have
a list of elements which is a number
zero and you can simply sort those
elements with the help of this concept
right with the help of collections dot
sort but let's say if you want to print
the reverse order of sorting so let's
say for on this code you can see we got
all the elements here it is solid format
if you want the reverse order I meant in
descending order what you can do is once
you sort it that elements just say
collections dot reverse so you can see
we have reverse method and mentioned the
values here so what it will do it will
reverse your values and if I run this
code you can see we got the order in
it's a designing format but let's say I
have a different logic here so let's say
I have the element as three zero line we
have nine nine eight we have seven seven
four we have to talk to the and we have
of 8 a 8 8 1 so we have this numbers now
how I want to sort I want to sort these
elements as per the last value so this 9
8 4 3 1 so I'm going to sort in this
format so the output should be always
already in sorted form at designing
audio format let me just change the
value to 6 and this 1 2 5 so it should
be 1 4 5 6 8 so that's why it should
print the output but when you fire on
this you can see the output is not that
with what we want right I don't want to
do the verse see I just want to print in
a sorted format but sorting should be
done with the respect with respect to
the last number or large digit of the
number now how that possible the problem
is whenever you work with Corrections
dot sort it will take the value as it is
right so it will compare two objects so
it will use a sorting technique so if we
talk about a sorting technique doesn't
matter I visit a bubble sort quicksort
doesn't matter right it will what we are
getting this all sorted values and every
sorting techniques takes two values as
input right so what we can do here is to
achieve that we need to mention so if
you if you can go to the sort method you
can see it ask you for two parameters
the first one is the so the first
parameter is the adder you want to sort
and the second parameter if you go to
sort so the second the first method it
takes a little collection the second
part in the second method sort it takes
two parameters one is the least of a
list of values the second one is the
object of comparator so if you want to
change the logic of the comparison so
let me just mention values so you're
going to change the values of the earth
if you change the way you compare
elements you need to pass the object of
comparator which will define the logic
of sorting okay so let me let me repeat
we need to mention the logic of this
sorting technique and we need to mention
that in the object of comparator now
question is how to get object of
comparator so we can see we have
compared to interface in Java
okay we are walking with integers will
specify the gender ik there and we can
say we have a comparator we say this is
comp equal to the problem is this
comparator is not a class it's an
interface right so unfortunately we
cannot use a class we cannot create
object directly so what we can do is we
can create one more class in this
package I will say the class name is a
comparator in pull ok we can give any
any class name for that matter and let's
click on finish so what this class will
do this will implement the interface
comparators it so that we can create the
object of this class for value of type
integer okay so since we are
implementing the interface we need to
define all the methods which is inside
this comparator okay and the methods are
so we have this method which is compare
it compared so you can see we just have
one method okay and that's the advantage
with one method not a big headache here
so how this function of this thing works
you just need to parcel initially will
not sort according to the large digit
will sort in in general so how it works
so we have to say oh one is greater than
Oh two if that is the case we'll return
1 return means you have to you have to
exchange the bets otherwise we'll say
return 0 okay in fact we don't have to
mention that we just have to say turn 0
or we can even say it 1-1 in order to
mention 0 there and here so once we have
created this class which is calm impulse
employment scamp a later let's go back
to this class and each and then we can
say new comp imple which is calm in pull
here right and then we can mention calm
so they are going to pass this object
here and if I run this code you can see
we got the sorted values so we got to
236 5 0 9 4 3 0 5 this is possible with
the help of this thing so it passes 2
values it passes to two objects
initially so initially it will pass 3 0
5 and 9 9
eight to this to this method it will
compare those two elements if the first
element is greater than the second
element then we have to swap how to
mention that we need to swap there is
return minus 1 so minus 1 means swap
mark
so if plus 1 means swap minus means
minus minus 1 means do not swap it ok
but what happens if I change the logic
if I change the logic it will sort it in
the reverse format right so that's
that's how this thing works but hold on
we don't want to sort it with the help
of the first digit ok we want to sort it
with the help of last digit right for
that which we will just say percentage
10 now it is this percentage 10 it will
give you the last value right the so
whenever you divide a number by 10 or
whenever you use percentage sign with
the help of 10 it will give you the last
bit right the modulus and if on this
code you can see we sorted with the help
of the last digit so simple right you
can do it anything you can do anything
now we can we get sorted with the help
of last two digits so we can just say
more 100 and more 100 right so it will
sort with the help of last two digit
digit now so let me just go back to my
class one so you can see we call 0 5 we
got 3 6 we got 74 we got 8 1 and we got
9 9 9 8 right so we can apply any logic
here so depend up on this logic it will
sort your class so you can sort a string
according to their number of the length
of the string you can sort the
collection with the help of anything you
want right and your logic can be
anything the important thing is if you
want to implement your own logic we need
to use this method compare which is
inside comparator interface and in this
sword technique you have to mention the
object of comparator simple or we can do
one more thing instead of mentioning the
the new class what we can do is we can
use the concept of anonymous class Y so
if you're familiar with anonymous class
that's great we can simply say
comparator if you don't notice in our
anonymous class again you can go back to
my channel you can actually search for
a anonymous class in Java and you can
also mention my channel name so you can
see you can just watch this playlist of
inner classes in which one of the video
you can see oh that's me so one of the
video is anonymous class working you
will understand how anonymous class
works okay
and if you like that video just make
sure you like the like button here okay
so how to do that so if you are
implementing I anonymous class just copy
this code we just do it we don't have to
do much just we can just copy this code
and paste that code here okay so now I
need to mention a new class altogether
right so we are not using any class wipe
and if I on this code which still works
right so we're starting with the help of
large digit but if you know the concept
of lambda expression again what is
lambda expression you can you can also
watch the last video here so this last
reader deals with the lambda expression
so if you want to convert this thing
into so I will suggest just pause this
current video go back to this channel
and go back to this video and just watch
this video of lambda expression you will
understand how lambda expression works
okay and come back to this part so you
can do the same thing with a cog lambda
expression is because this stuff here
from here to here this is extra stuff we
do not require this thing so we can
remove that and we can also remove one
bracket which is extra and since we are
using lambda expression so after the
method if ik method a method way to
mention the arrow symbol here and in
lambda we get an advantage you do not
have to mention the the type of elements
you are walking with you can just simply
mention o 1 and O 2 right and if you can
run this code you can see we got the
same output we can also reduce the
number of lines here right so we can
just reduce the number of lines okay
remove that okay now so we got we got
they are getting compared to object here
itself right there is one more thing
instead of using this concept we can use
ternary operator now turn it operator
works we can say return
if oh one Oh or not this Oh one mod 10
is greater than Oh 2 mod 10 then return
1 else return -1 so we can write it in
one line right and the awesome thing is
whenever you walk lambda expression you
don't have to even mention the return
type or the return keyword so since we
are working with ternary operator we
have to mention written operator
unfortunately let's let's go on this
code now so you can see we got the same
output right now the thing is we can
also use anonymous object here so we can
just copy this code cut and we can paste
it here so we can write anything
everything in one line we don't have to
write multiple lines here you can see
still works and if I run this code here
we go we got 1 4 5 6 &amp;amp; 8 okay so it's
that simple if you still want to
understand in depth again I will suggest
go back to this display list and search
for this video which is inner classes
with lambda expression so that's it how
you sort the elements with the help of
comparator so we have actually we are
actually using here something called as
comparator interface so that is from
this video thanks for watching and do
