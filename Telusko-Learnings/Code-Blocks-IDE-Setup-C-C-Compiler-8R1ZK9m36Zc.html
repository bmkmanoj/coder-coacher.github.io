Wendy and in this video we'll have a
look at code blocks now if you want to
write a C code normally we can write C
code for data structures if you want to
build an application using C we have to
use certain ideas write on an editor
normally we can do that with turbo C++
there are a lot of ideas available if
you just go on google and search for
different IDs available for C it will
give you a huge list in fact you can
write your C code in eclipse you can
write your secret in that beam so you
can write your C code in in visual
studio or you can use the traditional
one turbo C++ or Borland C++ in fact we
have dev C++ but the nowadays when one
of the ide which is quite famous for c
which is called as code blocks so we'll
go here with search for code blocks and
if you search for code block this the
website they have the awesome logo by
the way or this name itself yeah so if I
just click on this code blocks here the
cloak code blocks IDE and if I go down
and first of all it is open source and
free yeah so if I go to downloads you
can see it will give you the different
option we want a binary version of
course if you want to see the source
code as well you can get the source code
but we don't we don't want that so we'll
click on bundle easier and now based on
which OS you're working with maybe your
the windows level you will go for
windows version if you using linux you
can go for linux based version here and
if you're using mac we also have option
for that so let's go for the windows
version so in windows of course it does
support XP luckily if you're using XP we
still have some some Sophos available
for you and it supports Windows 10 as
well so if you are using any version but
in between it will work now out of this
five or six which one to choose now if
you already have a compiler with you
normally if you have let's say if you
have Linux and then in Linux we already
have this is a compiler if you don't
want a compiler if you just want an IDE
with you you can go with the first
option in fact in Windows if you have if
you already have your compiler you can
still go with the first set up but then
in my machine I don't have any compiler
so I want code block with a compiler so
I will choose this option which is min W
or GW now me and GW simply means it's
min GNU for Windows and we'll go for
this one again if you have
a compiler with you code block supports
different compilers if you have those
with you you can go with the first one
it will work I will click on force for a
force force hub yeah and you can see it
will give you an option of download I
will save this now it will take some
time I already have a setup with me
available so if I go to my Windows so as
you can see I already have a setup here
which is code blocks sixteen point zero
one and I will try to install this I
will double click this ok so it is
opening my code block sign it will try
to install now so again the traditional
steps which we follow will say next I
could we next install again you can
customize if you want but then since you
are doing it for the first time I will I
will say go for the default setup so it
will take some time to install ok so it
says do you want to run code blocks now
I want to say yes I want to try it once
and will click on next click on finish
ok so it will open code blocks now
hopefully change some time ok so now we
got a we got a window here this is code
dogs again awesome IDE if you have
worked on different ideas before example
if you have worked on eclipse or Visual
Studio or NetBeans this will look
familiar to you right we have in section
here which is workspace or the projects
where you can create your projects here
and this is the place where you can edit
your code this is where you will get the
output if you are building if you can
see the log files and a few different
stuff I want to create a new project and
remember I have downloaded the mint DEP
GW version so it already have a compiler
if you don't have you have to setup it
manually so let's click on create new
project and it will give you lots of
options I don't want to work with all
the stuff we just want a console
application because we want to work with
see where you will print the output on
the console or the terminal for you and
I will click on go now it will it will
ask you for which version you want to
work with I mean C or C++ I want to go
for C will click on next it will ask you
for the project name I will say project
name is demo I love that project name by
the way so demo and it will give you the
project name as demo dot CBP well click
on next it is asking you for the
compiler now if you just drop click on
it will give you a huge list of
compilers of enable okay not not the
compiler which are installed but the
options so you can see it gives you a
list here unfortunately I don't have
other compilers I only have GNU GCC
compiled in this machine I will go for
this one if you already have a
borderline compiler you can just connect
it and it will work I will select GC GCC
compiler click on finish and regard our
compiler and we got a project you can
see we got a demo project here in which
you have sources and if in this sources
we have main dot C now let me just zoom
it bed yeah so you can see we got our
code here which is int main and then
printf simple code how do we run this
code if you right-click we don't have
any option to run this from here maybe
we have but then the best option would
be you know we we have a build option
here so if you can click on build here
it is building your project and then
once you have belt that you can simply
run this code click on this one and you
can see we got the output on the inter
terminal again so if we got hello world
and it says press continue to press any
key to continue is enter and we got the
output not the simple code you can write
any complex but if you want the
important thing here was to how to set
up a code block so that you can write C
code again you can write C++ if you
choose the other option
the photos sessions on data structures
will be based or will be used will be
using this particular IDE which is code
blocks I can try out your own ID that's
fine but I'll be using code blocks thank
you so much for watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
