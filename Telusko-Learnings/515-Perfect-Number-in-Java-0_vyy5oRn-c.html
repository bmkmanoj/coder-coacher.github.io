write a code to check a given number is
perfect or not now what do you mean by
perfect number
so the devotional perfect number so
let's say six so first you have to find
the factors of six so the factor of six
is 1 then we have 2 then we have 3 so
these are the factors of 6 so we have to
exclude itself so 1 2 3 or the factor so
when I add 1 + 2 + 3 the answer is 6 so
when you add all the factors of a number
and if you get the same number that's a
perfect number one my example let's take
28 okay so the factors of 28 are 1 that
we have 2 then we have 4 then we have 7
and the - wanna it's 14 so these are the
factors for 28 so when you add 1 + 2
which is 3 3 + 4 7 7 plus 7 is 14 14
plus 14 is 28 right so when you and all
this number you will get 28 the same
number so this type of numbers are
called as perfect number so to just
demonstrate this let's first have a main
function so we have a main method here
okay and let's take a number so we'll
say we'll say n equal 28 will go for
this number and we'll use a boolean
value if which is a perfect number
we'll get true otherwise we'll get false
so we'll say boolean be equal to we'll
use a puff we'll use a function called
as is perfect and then we'll pass n so
if that number is perfect number then
this is perfect function or a method
will return you true otherwise it will
return false then it will check if it is
true so if it is B if B is true then
we'll print it's a perfect number
otherwise we'll print else in fact for
one statement we don't require this
curly bracket so we'll just we'll try to
save the number of lines okay
and then here we'll print ah that's not
okay it's not a perfect number
but the question arise what is this is
perfect it's a method right so we have
to define that method now how did you
find that method we'll say public our
since I don't want to create an object I
will use a static method which returns a
boolean value which is true or false and
the name of this method will be perfect
which will take on number parameter
which is N and now what next will return
by default as false okay so if I run
this code now I will get false for sure
so it will print it's not so we have to
do some processing here now what the
person will require so first we require
a variable called stamps which will well
will we will keep all the calculated
values since we want to add this value
so we have to kept it somewhere so we'll
take a temp variable or we can even take
a some variable for that matter so we
have a some variable here now since we
need to find the factors so we start
with the first number so we say int I
equal to 1 and in less than so we have
to go till till number less than 1 okay
I mean the number is 24 28 so we have to
go to 27 so we will say n less than n
and I plus plus and then we just have to
check so to check here so we'll use if
if if month n mod I F is equal equal to
0 that means we are it's dividing the
number in that case we'll say temp equal
to 10 plus I simple is not time it's
something available below some right
okay just some plus I and that's it and
then once you get this some will check
if my n is equal to equal to some in
that case I will return true otherwise
it will return false clear so if it
returns true it will go again the focus
will go to the main method otherwise it
will return false simple and if you're
on this Court now and it's a perfect
number right if I change this value to
27 and if I done this it says it's not
the same thing goes for sex if I done
this it says it's a perfect number now
there is one more thing so if we don't
have to go to the last number so if we
can just go till 1/2 or graph of the
number that will do so as we see in 28
if we can't check till 14 that's enough
for 6 we can check to 3 that's enough
simple right we can also use a shorthand
here so sure of saying sum plus equal to
or sum equal to sum plus 1 we can simply
say sum plus equal to I which is a short
fun shorthand for the operator yeah
that's it so that's how you find a
perfect number so thanks for watching
and just a scrap of other videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
