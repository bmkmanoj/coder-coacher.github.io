Wendy now once they have talked about
the theory of gate it's time to
implement gates right but it's Oliver's
how do we implement gate so first of all
we need some software's to work with
right now when we talk about gate we can
work with gate using command-line our
favorite option right so what you can do
is you can open CMD and you can search
for gate or you can or you can perform
some commands here I'm going to do that
it gives you an error because you have
not installed giving your system yet if
you're a Mac user formula you already
have get with you
but for Windows all for adjusting to
have to install it that's one way the
another way of working with gate is by
using some web-based get tools of these
platforms so one of the famous get
platform is github now if you have seen
the videos if you have seen the title of
the video you are sure that we are going
to use github but then do we have other
option other than get up candy use
something else now if you can see we
have some more options as well we have
get lab and we also have big bucket so
if I go to get lab inside for let's
explore the github first now as for the
tagline it says build for developers
right so awesome platform where you can
work you need an account here again even
if you don't have an account you can
actually search something here and you
will find the source code of that ok
what it says so from open source to
business you can use you can use github
anywhere so I'm open source for business
business and if you scroll down you can
see some what options now if you click
on pricing this is where you have a we
have mod interest right now good get'em
is free but then why they have this
price rising skin here so it says github
is free for to use for public so if you
are making a open source project where
everyone can access that code and if you
everyone can contribute of course you
can go for github which is free but then
let's take you what if you are working
on a project which is specific for your
business you don't want to live in your
source code then you can go for private
repositories now for private you have to
pay some amount right again this is not
a big amount if you are actually working
on of this
project but then yet you have to pay for
it
do we have another option yes we have
get labs as we discussed if I click on
get lab this is the get lab is a
platform for modern developers now you
can see there's a competition can you
see that github says it is built for
developers and get last is a platform
for modern developers there was a
district's first term here again get a
geek lab is also famous and we have
third option which is from Atlassian now
all developers or programmers they know
about Atlassian specially you feel
Alfons our world in fact so many world
doesn't matter
so Atlassian gives you lots of what you
say a product for developers example we
have JIRA we have we have some other
tools as well example for for your kit
itself we have so screen which is built
by Atlassian and now they are also
providing you get big bucket now big
bucket is also a web-based gate where
you can get all the things in fact they
also have an optional sizing it's like
and get ladder also you have pricing
somewhere you sometimes here you'll find
a depriving skin but you can see that
get lab is used by most most of these
companies here inside github is also
used by much most of the companies and
same goes for big bucket so it says for
small teams it gets free and they also
provide you free private repository so
if you are thinking about making your
own storage repository you don't want to
pay for it of course you can go for big
bucket so we have guitar we have get lab
and we have big bucket so we have lots
of other websites available but this are
quite famous
ok so what else we have here in fact if
you don't want to get a count on github
if you still want to use it
let's explore Linux if you search for
Linux because the leader is open-source
now and it is open source Marlowe coming
from the database and the source code of
Linux is available on details again you
see that we have towels
repository here so we have tall void who
is the founder of Linux and you got
Alina's course or score against can you
see that we have all the newest being a
source code here but you can you can
expose this once you get time and see
the contributors so there are
18,000 people who have fought this
position will talk about this walking
calls it later and we have a 6000 and
almost always what is this count is
eight point six point seven billion of
commits that's also numbers right okay
so this is so this is your the options
you have much other options as well let
me create a count on github of course
you need account there right so this we
call sign up here and it will ask you
for username so let's enter username I
will say that is code training as my
username and I will mention some users
in it so they say against that I already
have an account here so when you make an
account make sure that you use a unique
username unique community and unique
password and that's it now I want me to
click on create account you will get a
get a bit of account even if they can
give you some word options I forgive you
choose or to Z of plan example if you
want to go for a paid version or a
little Isis let's try this I will say
this code waiting one this is code
training one at the rate gmail.com and I
will set any password doesn't matter
create an account because that I will
not be using this thing later okay what
it says organisation mean what's wrong
with this okay
yeah buzzer cannot be Blanche let me say
the password and if I create a in fact
like on create account it will ask you
for the plan so we are going for three
plan because I don't want to pay for it
now and of course if you are making a
business project you can then you can go
for the page repositories click on
continue and it will ask you for the
experience what who are using new to
programming so they want to know about
know more about you then who are you a
project manager or a developer or it's
both what why you are doing call your
student you're a professional or your
abus'd all those things and then click
on submit you will be getting your
github account now once you get your
github account you can do lots of stuff
again we'll talk about those things
later so in this video we have talked
about different web-based option you
have in fact they are starting with the
best option and later once we become
comfortable with gate then we will see
the command line
Thanks how to use get on command-line so
