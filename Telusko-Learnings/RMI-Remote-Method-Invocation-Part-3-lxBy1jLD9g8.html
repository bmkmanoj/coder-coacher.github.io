our am I in this will see the actual
implementation of our mi now see we have
in the second part we have talked about
these steps now will implement these
steps one by one so for that the first
step we have to create a item very
important of his white so for that will
open a new notepad file we have to open
notepad file not be int ok in this
notepad path we had notepad file we have
to create the implementation right also
we have to get it interface for that the
first step is you have to create an
interface so we'll say public interface
will say this has ADD now we'll be going
for the add application in which will be
having add server which will add two
numbers for that will say this is my add
interface in this add interface will be
having a method called as public and so
we'll say we'll have a public it will
return me an int value the method name
will be add it will ask you for two
parameters int X and int Y that's it so
this is your interface but we don't want
to create a normal interface we have to
create a remote interface right again
not in interface also we have to create
or the amount of weights and for that to
make it a remote interface we have to
extend it with a remote interface so
when you extend it this interface we add
I with remote interface by default this
add I becomes a remote interface the
concept of inheritance now since we are
we are extended this interface remote
excuse me yeah we have we are extending
this remote interface what we have to do
is we have to import the package as Java
dot our mi dot star again we can just
write here or remote to make it more
efficient so this the package name is
Java dot RMI since we are working with a
remote implemented there are chances
that we will be getting an error so
that's why we have to say this closed
the exception so that it will handle the
exception
okay and that is here this is how you
have to create a interface right let's
save this interface will create a
package here in my folder we'll say new
folder as RMI okay we'll name this as re
my folder and here I will store this
with add i dot java
okay now the next step we have to go for
us we have to create the implementation
so in order to create the implementation
we have to get a class so we'll say
we'll go your new file now not new
notepad file and this this is
responsible to implement the interface
and we'll name this as add C this is the
class of your interface right so this is
the add see a name doesn't matter you
can have any name so we'll say at C and
let's see how we have to implement this
first thing is we have to create a class
because we are implementing the
interface and we'll name this as add C
now this class need to implement that
into the mode interface and that is your
add add i right then what next we have
to we will say public int add this is
the implementation it will take two
parameters int X and int Y and this need
to return this will return of X plus y
so this will return X plus y now the
thing is whenever you work with this or
add C C ultimately we have to if you if
you see these steps we have to create
stub and skeleton after of this from
this add C to make it happen we have to
extend this class with unique OSH remote
object so this will be removed unicast
remote object so that you will get the
features of a remote object here now
since we are extending this class with
unicast remote object we have to import
the package and that package is your
java dot RM
my dot server dot star alright so this
this class Unicode remote object belongs
to us a package called a server now
other thing is there are chances that
will be getting errors for this unicast
remote object now as a class at C we can
handle the exceptions right but we have
to we have to implement this this we
have to handle the exception of this
remote unicast remote object and to do
that we will define a constructor at C
will define this at C okay this is your
constructor now and to handle the
exception by a unicast remote object
what we can do is we can say throws
exception okay and we'll call the the
constructor of this unicast remote
object with the help of a method call a
super so how it works when you create
object of this add C now it will call
this add C constructor it indirectly
will call super which will handle the
exception called a throws exception
right so ultimately we are handling all
the exceptions and this is how you have
to implement a class now the remaining
two steps we will see in the next part
of the video so do subscribe and do was
the second video thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
