enhance for dough for two-dimensional
adding now so now you're clear with
one-dimensional adelinechan the last
video we have done that and this will be
discuss with two-dimensional arrays so
this is the this is the two-dimensional
array we have so we have a P which is
two-dimensional array in which you have
three rows and four columns so this is
the normal fall that we have used to put
into all the elements what I will do
this time is I will just come in this
part so that you can refer it later and
let me give some space okay so now to
use an house for though let's say let's
say I want to print the values of X
again so let's say if I use an ass for
loop here so if you have to say int I in
X that's how we work with an ass for
loop and we'll print such tab and we'll
print the value of I that's how we print
right now what this loop will do is it
will this I will going to X it will
fetch the first value which is 5 I get
will go to the next element which is 6
and then 7 and then 8 so that's how it
works but if I talk if I say this is
speed let's just let's say this is not X
now this is P so when you walk with X it
will return a element of that array
which is 5 but now when I say P it will
return the whole array so this I cannot
be a element it should be a array so
when I say my I is going to P so it will
it cannot fetch first of a normal
element it has to fetch the whole a day
because add it's an element for the P
now can I print I here of course not
because when I try to print I it will
print at a address or the d hash value I
don't want that what I want is I want to
print the values of this array now again
the same problem if so if you imagine
your I is same as X what you will do you
will use one more for loop which will be
J and J will fetch its value from I
and then instead of printing I we have
to plain J as simple as that again we
have to use they can use curly brackets
here so if you compare this if you again
let's go let's make a few divisions so
we have a P here in P we have three a DS
which is a two-dimensional array which
has multiple ad is and then we are
fetching values so when I fetch the
first value from P it will not be a
element it will be an array second array
and the third and so when I fetch I am
fetching the array and every time I
fetch this array I have to again run a
loop which will take this value of J
from I and then we are printing J again
we have to do some formatting we have to
use a will print a space here just to
make it a little better and then we'll
print the extra line so if you compare
these two loops now this one and this
one they are they will do the same thing
so if I run you're getting the same
output but the differences here we are
using enhanced for the wedge where you
don't have to count here we are counting
the values from start to end
clear so that's how you use enhanced for
the for 2d array so thanks for watching
