part of the collection teamwork
now in this we'll talk about more about
collections this last time we have done
with collection interface then we have
used list interface with integer values
then we have used genrich's now in this
what we'll do is now if you remember
this example we took some random numbers
approximately hundred item numbers and
then we have added all those engine
numbers which should be less than
thousand into my collection and then I
have sorted those values and printed all
these values right if I am this now
again you will see we will be getting
all the outputs in a sorted order so I
can see all these values are sorted in
ascending order now what I want I want
to print all these values in is not
ascending order depend up it should it
should sort depend up on the last value
which means if your value is one it
should come first if your value is five
it should come in middle if your value
is nine example if you have this value
let's say this one so it should come
last doesn't matter nobody 45459 what
matters is it is nine that means I want
to sort they sort it in my own way to
use that technique what we can do is we
can use ah we can use some example if I
use a sort method yeah it has a two
signatures this overloaded function
first is sort with least that's what we
are using now
the next way is sort list that is
comparator compiler says you can have
your own logic here that means by
default this sort method the above one
will sort in ascii using ASCII values or
ascending order you can see it's
specified as ascending order but I what
I want here I want to sort it in my own
way okay
so we can use something called as a
mutually comparing okay so how to do it
first you have to pass the collection
and next year you have to pass the
object of comparator or you have to pass
the instance of a comparator now
question is what is comparative so
comparator in Java is
interface so you can see we have a
compared to interface belongs to our
package util then let's get object of
comparator here let's see if it is numb
compare now now since it's an interface
if you go to this class it's n it's a
functional interface which means it has
only one method and it's an interface
which also generates it takes a type T
and then it it has a function or a
method called as compare taking two
values T 1 T and O 1 and O 2 now now
what we can do is we cannot create
instance of 4 compared to right so we
have to create a class that class will
extends not extra let's give it a class
name as number compare them compare and
this should implement they should
implement our interface called as
comparator okay and in this since we are
implementing a comparator interface
which should compare integers since its
box with genrich's now of anybody
implement our interface you have to
define a method which is there in this
so we as a method name is public int
compare which will take two values one
will be integer let's say i1 and integer
I - okay now how to compare this two
things we have to say return or we can
use if s also we can say let's say let's
say we say our difference so what we can
do we can just we can sort it in this
way if you can check if let's say by
default the value for difference is zero
we can check in this way if I one mod
because we have we want to leave large
all right if I one mod is greater than I
to mod tan it will pick up the last
value if this is the scenario a
difference should be minus one or
differential be 1l save if your I 1 mod
10 is less than I do I do
mod then write the difference value
should be minus 1 because while sorting
this compare method or this sort method
will check for the positive values and
negative values else you can specify DF
is equal to 0 again when you do not have
to specify this also because if this to
not execute we have a difference by
default which is 0 right and then we can
say return diff simple and then here
what we can do is we can say new Nam
Kham because we have a class now which
implements comparator and then we can
pass here something called as new comp
simple right so this is how you have to
use comparator and if I run this you
will see the output is we have all these
numbers and they are sorted with their
last value so you can see it is 0 0 0 0
then 1 1 1 then all twos then 3 then 4 &amp;amp;
5 &amp;amp; 6 &amp;amp; 7 right so it is work it's
working now if you see here we are doing
this if else a part I can do the same
thing with something called a study
operator how do you study the operator
we can simply say it is Dave is equal to
if my I won let me use these the code so
it is Dave equal to I 1 mod I 2 if this
is the scenario then question mark it
should be 1 otherwise : device : and
then we use this condition if this is
also this works it should be minus 1
right I missing something here it's :
push and then we have to say else it
should be 0 so we can die go define
ain't deaf so it is same like if else if
and else now if you want to define in
this way you can also remove this
variable div so I can directly say
return this value okay so this is how
you can reduce the number of lines in
your code and we have to send upon its
eye symbol right if I run this code now
it will still walk I do one other now
this is how you have to use comparator
now if you see the only reason why we
are creating this glass here is just to
implement comparative right so what we
can do is we can simply instead of using
this num comm we can simply create
object of compare data using a inner
inner class so they can create object of
we can we cannot greater all the
instance of interface directly we have
to use something or is in your class so
after this constructor of comparator we
have to give a color base open and close
to define the implementation in this
implementation we can use this method so
you can say cut and paste so we don't
require this class here right simple
it's giving you a little using compare
I know whenever you use this type of
integer the problem is when you say
comparator and when you say compare so
it should match a signature by default
the signature here of this comparator or
this type of comparator is by default
object which means this should also be
an object they should also be an object
right but you want to compare int of
integers right so that's why we have to
mention this should be an this should be
an integer right will work and here also
we should mention it should be integer
okay so now if I run this it's working
that means we can reduce the number of
lines with the help of in your class now
if you observe the only reason why we
are creating this enum calm is to pass
here right that means we are using that
reference only once so if in this
scenario we can just copy this code
since we are using your own date only
once we can paste it here this is called
as anonymous inner class because this
inner class here doesn't have a name so
this is anonymous inner class right so
you can reduce the number of lines again
now what next now if we talk about this
part if you can't focus this comparator
here it's a it's a functional interface
and Java 8 says whenever you have a
anonymous inner class of a function
interface you can use lambda expression
what it means this boilerplate code from
here to here we do not require this code
is because by default collection will
ask obviously it's asking for a
comparator object so why we have to pass
this and obviously in comparator
interface we have only one method which
is compare so why to mention Java and G
now JVM is smart enough to guess this
value and this value so we can remove
this part we can directly mention we
want to variables and in this we want to
objects and in this method this is the
signature of your compare in this method
we require this this definition
okay so we can okay and we can simply
write this case right so we have reduced
the number of lines again what we know
what we know is this collection this
collection is of this C is a part of it
is a type of integer so why we have to
mention integer here again your jayveer
JVM is smart enough to guess the type of
the values right and you can write this
this thing that's it so this is how your
comparator work so if you can see we
have reduced the number of lines like
lots of lines and as the advantage of
Java 8 so this is comparator and next
part we'll talk about compatible thank
