generics so let's try to understand what
is what exactly generic generic means so
basically we talk about Java one of the
best thing about Java is type safety
right which simply means that whenever
you want to work with any variable it
should be first declared example let's
say if you want to work with a variable
to call as a value now we should be
knowing the type of the value first
before using it let's say if I specify
the value as five but before you want
that we have to mention the type of it
so we normally say int value so all so
this the type of this value is int right
so we are achieving type safety here so
the type of the value is known at
compile time itself you're not waiting
for the runtime to get the value of the
Phi and then you will assign the type of
it again there are certain languages
which supports that but Java says no it
is type safe language right so yeah
whenever you want to use any variable
first you have to make sure that you
have the so you have the type of the
value I mean type of the element now so
if you talk about this variable it is
compensated if I the type right but when
it comes to collection API again we have
seen one of the video of that so when
you talk about collection collection
framework so let's say if anybody
working with list and when you say list
of elements so let me just remove that
it's a list of values this time and you
add a list now this list will have can
have any type of value example if I say
value start add so you can see it is
asking you for the object so that means
whenever you create a list
it is list of objects right again object
is a base class for all the classes
available in Java example when you work
with integer double float these are
classes right and the object class is
the superclass of all these classes so
when you say you can you can have a list
where you can say where you can save
seven and you can have a list where you
can store even a name right so a string
and a number both are supporting the
same place so that that means we are not
achieving type safety here and we do
want to achieve type safety then how can
we do that how can you achieve type
safety is with the help of gender
so you can specify integer and here also
you can specify integer so this is the
syntax we have to use to specify the
type of the element and you can see now
string doesn't work since we wanted to
achieve type safety so at the compile
time itself you are you are getting that
you are working with you are working
with integers because what happens is if
you don't use genrich's here if you
don't mention genrich's and you have
added all this elements your intention
is not to add string your intention is
just to add numbers but let's say by
mistake you have added a string and
later on what you are doing is you're
creating or into object and you are
saying int I equal to value values dot
catch from the index 1 which is the
which is this value it will work for
this one first one and then you just
have to convert that you have to say
integer because by default is everything
is string I will say integer % okay so
okay first you have to convert that into
string yeah so because the type is
object wise I have to convert that into
string and then you are passing it now
if you try to print the value of I
everything will be it will it will give
you error now it because you are
expecting so it says number format
exception so you're expecting a integer
but you are getting a string so you are
getting the error at runtime right so
that's that's not a good thing when you
say you have so expecting value should
be numbers and somewhere by mistake you
are inputting a string and it is making
all those mistake for all those problem
for you so to solve this problem they
have introduced the concept of genrich's
right so we can we can put integer here
which will make sure that it will give
you error at compile time itself because
handling the errors at compile time is
way better than handling the errors that
come at runtime right so let's say let's
try to understand how exactly this
concept of generics came I mean how they
implemented the backend so if I just go
to a list and if I say least integer
values and if I jump to the list
implementation okay let me just jump to
list implementation
okay so you can see these two sign
interface which is having a I'm gonna
bracket there and E so this e means
element okay so this is how you define a
generic so you have to define the class
name or the interface name with a
generic type there so you have to
specify a Miller brackets any symbol
will do maybe you can I mean you can it
supports any of the character starts
from A to Z let's try it lest I do that
let's let's try to implement our own
join break so whatever I do here is I
will create my own plus I will name this
class as container
okay provided is not that in yeah
so we are Kenya class was container and
so how do you specify the type of this
container there before that what we can
do is yeah so the how to specify the
type of the container so we can say
angular bracket and you can use any
character even a will do okay what about
small a it works but convention says you
have to use all the capital letters so
you will use capital a but the thing is
when you say e it represents something
it's a type of element right E is
element so normally we use this letter T
for defining type so you are working
with so this container will be working
with this type so this T can be replaced
by integer it can be replaced by a float
value any class any class when even
student class can replace the steam so
you can use anything you can also use I
you can use o but t represents type
right so it is more readable compared to
other other letters so we have defined T
so what we can do here is let's say I
want I want to create a variable colors
value here okay now this value can be
anything it can be integer it can be
float it can be string but at a time so
when I create the object of container I
will specify C I want to work with
integers so this value type should be
integer because if you if you are
working with integer if you specify
integer here false sure it will be
integer throughout in future if you want
to create a container for float this
will not be supported because you are
mentioning integer here so what we can
do is we can make it object but that's
again not a type safe language wise
because type say we have to mention the
type exactly so what we'll do with use T
there so when you say T now
value it means you are so whenever you
create object of container if you
specify integer this value becomes
integer something like this when I say
container obj equal to new container
first of all it will give me some
warning if I don't specify the generate
there you can see it says container as a
rod type so that means when you anybody
don't specify the type it becomes a
third type okay in fact if you even if
you specify the angular bracket with
question mark does that work yeah so
does it still works so we can use a
question mark itself even this is no we
have to specify the actual thing there
so you want you can use custom question
mark when that is a rod type now okay
that's a lot type but what you can do is
you can specify the integer here so when
to you once you specify integer now this
T becomes integer and this value even
becomes integer okay just to show you
the proof whatever goes I will say
public void show okay and I will say
value I mean I will print the type of
value there I will say a value dot get
class dot get name so if you specify a
teacher here that integer goes here in
this T that T replaced I mean this trip
this T replaced by integer so the
integer value will be I mean by the type
of value would be integer so when I'm
printing something here that will be of
type integer now was the output or we
have to call show right so obj dot show
okay and if you on this code you can see
we are getting nullpointerexception
that's fear because we are not specified
any value there oh okay let me just say
this is zero that's not possible
Oh what we can do is we can say obj dot
value equals show any value will do yeah
and it should work now so you can see
the type of value it is integer okay so
that's how you can specify the you can
specify the value that's how you can
specify the type of the element okay
now the type of limit is not defined by
this nine okay just define bartha's
integer example if I replace this by
double okay
and okay we have to specify that value
there okay we can do that yeah I mean
you have to trust me now it was that way
it was that way so you have to so this
type is defined by the double thing
there okay let me piss this now
so what else we can do now okay so yeah
so let's say for this for this element
you need some getcha sector so what we
can do is we can right-click here and we
can specify a sources and when you say
get a setter so the type of get us a
table when you when you work with it
that even would be T so you can see this
gate value returns T and the set value
will be accepting T so when you say you
are walking you are working with a
container of double so this T would be
double and this T would be double there
is one thing you have to remember well
so whenever you work with genrich's it
only supports wrapper classes I mean it
only supports classes not wrapper
classes butts classes you cannot use
ain't you cannot use float as a data
type example you cannot say you cannot
say ain't here like it is compensate to
work with integer I mean a class okay so
anyone you work with generates it is
composite to work with class even you
can create a student class okay so
continuous student well why did you have
a certain class so this T would be
replaced by student okay so that's how
it works
in fact in genetics we have some more
stuff to understand first of all example
let's say I want to use T but this T
should be of type I mean it should be
only of type number example if I say
number if I say T here so this T issue
so i can see i can i can write student
here also right but i don't want the
container to hold student it should only
hold number now what is number if you
talk about any class like integer so
integer class double class they all
extend one class for double class
example or number class so we have this
class integer which extends number class
even double class extends number class
so all these classes the extends our
number class right so what I want is
this this collection here this T should
support only numbers so integer should
work double should work bye
not student so what we can do is we can
say this T will extends numbers so only
that class can replace this T which
extends number so example if I say
double even that works as you can see
there is no error in fact number will
work itself number itself will work but
if you try to use student here you can
see you are getting an error because
that that bounded type is of type number
or the subclass of number it will not
support student what if what about
object when it will not support that it
will support integer it will support
double it will support float because
they went float extends number okay so
it let me show you a demonstration if
you go to float float even exchange
number right so that's how you that's
how you use this so we have T exchange
number let's say I have just to give it
a monster in let's say I have a method
which is demo which accepts an added
list okay and this ArrayList accepts
only in them all the integers right so
we can use a okay we can say obj right
and put the package so now if I want to
call demo there so if I say obj dot demo
of course we have to pass an added list
only of numbers or also you only have
integers right I cannot pass anything
else I just have to pass with integers
but let's say if I if I want to support
even numbers so we cannot do that right
because it accepts only integers so what
we can do is we can say question
question mark extends number so we have
a different syntax here so here we use
here we use T here we use question mark
because we can replace this T I mean
numbers with T because this T will
become a T here and that class will
extend so if I creating a if I am
creating a number and then if I'm
passing a integer even that will work
again these are different syntax for
word methods so for methods example if I
if I am creating a number so T becomes
number but the elements I want to pass
this up individual so we have to use
question mark extends T
that's one of the syntax you have to
remember in fact we also have super
nowadays super is let's say if I'm
creating a container of integer so this
T here is an integer right in that case
if I am passing an integer that will
work so this super will support all the
super classes example if I pass number
even that will work so super means if
you are passing a number so number is a
super class of integer it will work but
if I use any class which in which
extends integer that will not work so
the subclass of integer will not work
here in fact we don't have a surplus for
integer but let's say in case if you
have a subclass for integer that will
not work so super means so this question
mark can be a superclass of T when you
say extends that would be so this would
be the subclass of T so you have to
remember that so that's it that's about
that's how you use genrich's in java so
that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
