now in this will continue with the will
continue with variables but let me do
some changes in my code now so goal is
my code yeah here now so we have
demonstrated our code with int variable
right so we have a variable called as
noun 1 which is of type int but what if
I make it as float okay so floats
suppose decimal point is similar points
like you can say it's three point four
or six point four or three point three
okay and let me just remove this line
now what should answer should be it
should be nine point seven right so we
have a float which is six point four and
we have something called as three point
three now if you if you know about C C++
it supports a default note format right
so when you add this two numbers the
output should be it should be yeah it
should be a error right it's because it
says possibly lossy conversion from
double to float it's because by default
in Java by default in Java any real
number is double all real numbers are
double so when I say it as double and
now if I compile this now it's getting
compiled right because by default all
decimal values are double now if I run
this is Java add and are getting nine
point seven so I'm going to talk about
double double take sixteen bytes right
so it'll take eight bytes right so the
problem is double this it gives you lots
number of zeros after your decimal point
right so if you don't have a decimal
lots of zeros after your decimal point
you put some with zeros right so
unfortunately you're wasting your memory
but Java supposed to double by default
Java goes with double but what if you
have to use what if you want to useful
in case if you want to use float you
have to use something or less F here
it's which signifies don't go for double
it will signify this number don't go for
double it's a float value so when you
want to save it in float format you have
to use something else F here now if I
compile it
skating is getting compiled no errors
right and I if I done this it's nine
point seven output will be same the
difference is the amount of memory it
will take is four bytes if we specify
double it will take eight bytes if I'm
specifying float it will take four bytes
I try the advantage of using float
okay so this is this is about float and
double let me do some experiment where
with with something new we will talk
about cache now CAD is a type of data
type in which you can say if you if I
create a variable called as C in which I
can store a character write a character
can be any keyword on your keyboard so
it can be a capital eight can be a small
it can be a dollar it can be a number it
can be everything right so let me store
a value a now all this character should
be in a single quote and let me just
print this value here so if I plain C
and if I run this Oh boots okay let me
clear the screen to compile it's Java C
ad dot Java
and the output is a right now question
arise how did this number its value this
this value gets stored in your computer
now when we talk about computer
computers transition only one language
pulse binary right so there is some
there's some logic of converting and
character into a binary digits or you
can say bits and that conversion takes
with the help of ASCII code right there
is something - ASCII code now to work
with ASCII code what asking what exactly
is it's a it's a well it's an integer
representation of your character okay so
if your guide is a capital A the ASCII
conversion of character a is 65 if you
are checking it it's very simple let me
just let me just do some exposure do
some magic now what we can do is we can
convert this cat into int so there's
something else typecasting so if I cast
this character with int it means when
you print this value of C it will try to
convert that like that value into
integer value so if I say if I compile
this and if I done this now you can see
the value of 65 what it done is this cat
this value a is converted into the equal
representation of its integer value so
we have a mapping of character and a
value and that value for the capital a
is 65 if you have check for smaller
let's just compile it again and well
it's 97 right yeah you can even check
the character for 74 number four
semicolon so when you compile no others
running is 58 right you have a sky value
for everything in fact for space you
have a sky value so that's the amazing
part right I'll show you - right so for
all these characters we have some a sky
value now a sky value normally starts
with zero it ends at and at 127 I guess
so what do the two depict occur to
represent this what we can do is we'll
do some reverse part what we can do is
we can say 124 I want to get the Oscar
or character value of 124 so what we can
do is we can specify your care so we are
going to are doing the diverse part form
value we are getting the R square value
I am NOT using this part this time I'm
not using this part right still we'll
keep it there no harm
so compile
no other output is pipe so this is just
a straight line or you can say PI so 124
represented by pipe if I have 67 it
should be C naught from capital C let me
check it out here is capital C right so
so you can convert this asked I value to
character also but if I represent a
number like 564 and if I try to do that
as output is question mark
oh so it's getting repetative so it's
getting repeated but you have when you
talk about question mark
let me use question mark here
for question market is 63 right so as I
simple as diets you have a number for
every character so this is about some
variables remaining part will see in
next session thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
