been Wendy from political learnings and
in this video we'll talk about async
tasks so in the theory we have already
seen what is a sink task right so let's
say you want to you are using an app in
which call you are creating an app in
which you want to send a request to a
server and you want to get some data
from the server so of course it will
take some time to get the response right
so what we'll do is we'll ask another
thread to send you the quest and that
under the thread is your async task
right so how we can achieve that is if
you have to get a new project and in
your project you have to get it activity
activity really use async task but
before going for all the stuff since I'm
making this video after a long time
compare the last video I have updated my
Android studio so if I check my Android
sugar now so I am using 2.1 okay which
is the latest release now so it is
released on April 22nd ok so you can
also get your Android studio if you have
not done yet so we'll create a project
we'll name this project as demo async
okay and we say next we can select
minimum jck as 4.4 that will do it will
cover 70% of devices both enough right
we can click on next and here I will
create a empty activity so let's select
an empty activity here and we'll click
on next we can create a main activity
okay so what we'll be doing here is
what's our main intention here is if I
go to my if I go to google.com or if I
go to my website so I website telescope
comm slash I have or I have created a
Saugus here which is addition of two
numbers so I can say addition dot HTM
and if you can pass two values one is T
1 is 3 and T 2 is 6 and if I say enter
it gives me the response which is 18 so
we are getting or not this is not
addition this is a multiplication right
that's that's different so so that's the
mistake I have done so this is not
addition this is multiplication so the
name is addition and so as you can see
the name is addition but it is doing
multiplication that's the mistake I have
done here so this is a racing request so
what we'll do is we'll create an
application in which we'll ask
user to enter two numbers and will
provide the multiplication of those two
numbers okay and the logic how it is
multiplicative lying the number that
doesn't matter right because we are
sending a request to the server server
we'll multiply those two numbers and you
will get these points
now logic can be anything doesn't matter
what the logic is right what's important
is you are getting some data from the
server okay so we want to demonstrate
async task here so we will try to
demonstrate this with the help of we'll
send the request to this website or to
this link by passing two values right
and then we can get the value we can get
the output right stood on open your
under studio first we'll create a design
here okay so we have to create we have
to use two text field or V to edit text
and one button so when you click on this
button it will it will call the it will
send a request right on so for that what
we'll do is I have already created a
design so that it will not we will not
waste any time here and this design is
very simples not a big headache so I
have just taken that's weird
can I format it refactor how to format
this we'll say we had an optional format
right so let me just okay so I'm done
with the refactor of or the formatting
here so we got this two things here
which is let me just verify if my
recording is working it's working
so yeah so now we can see we have to
edit text which is in which you are
asking for so this will ask you for the
first number so this is our credit edit
edit text white nothing much here I just
created a form in which I am creating to
edit text so we this is the first one
this second one we have an ID which is
num1 we have num2 and this is the button
this is not add now this is
multiplication like this is
multiplication right that's a very big
name right and then we can give any
number doesn't matter all right so we
can say any name here and yeah that's it
that's it from the view so what we'll do
is we'll try to add a hint here which
will act as a placeholder I will say
this is first number so that it will
know that we have v2 entire number
and this will be hint second number okay
so we got our design here now to work
with this we need a Java file right in
which you have to do lots of stuff now
so be mentally prepared is a very big
code so start with the first thing so we
required two text field right or to edit
text so we'll say edit text noun 1 comma
num2 so we have to take two numbers and
we also require a button so we say
button BTN so once we've done done with
this required if we attend put the
package control space that's done now
need to first realize those objects
right so going to initialize num1 num2
end button so what we'll do is we'll
come here let's say num 1 equal to how
to fetch the name so we'll say fine view
by ID r dot ID dot number 1 so I think
but by this time you have we have been
expert in now your expert in this stuff
right
we are doing this from last I guess 7 to
8 videos so what your same thing will
say edit text find V by ID and we'll say
r dot ID dot num2
ok we got those to stop here num1 num2
and then we need to create object of
buffer button also we'll say this is BTN
ok
bTW and equal to this is will this will
be button right and then we say fine
view by ID in which you have to mention
our dot ID dot this will be bTW and add
actually a multiplication but that's ok
and then we need to add a listener to
the button white so we have to say
button dot so when you enter these two
values we have to click on a button
white so we'll say this is on set on
click listener in which you have to pass
the object off on click listener and on
that one on click that's view this is on
click listener not from the dialog but
from the view right and then we'll call
okay that's good
Oh Oh give me to give the brackets and
then we'll say enter so this is where
you have to create or we are forgetting
one thing here which is new in fact I
should write everything from start
so as we will get the exact thing so we
say this is new on click listener this
is what we want right so when you click
on this button which is a bt an ad which
is multiplication it will call on click
right so don't get confused with this ad
it is actually multiplication but since
I have taken a design in ads so we're
going we are going for ad here so when
you click on this button it should fetch
those two values right so the values
which is entered and the first one and
the second one now how to find those
value will say this the first value will
go into I will say this is integer so
that it that is integer dot pass nth in
which will specify this is num1 dot get
text that's how you fetch the value
right not just one but get text and then
to face the value with a two string
which will actually fetch the string
value out of it and we can do the same
stuff for the second variable which is J
so you just copy with this and we'll
paste it here and we'll name this as
William this as J okay and this will be
coming from them too okay so now once we
got those two values now what next we
have done all the possible things we can
do right we can also add those those two
values here so what we can do is we can
say int k equal to I plus J and then we
can show the output right we can show a
toast but that's not the actual
intention here we don't want to or not
add we need to multiply right so we do
not want to multiply those two value C
or we want to multiply those values on
the server so on the server side we have
already created or created a service by
passing two values we can just get the
multiplication right again how to do
this we can just you can use a PHP
project you can use doesn't matter which
technology you use for software you can
use PHP you can use JSP you can use what
you can use ASP doesn't matter you can
you can have any
in fact uh insert when maybe if you feel
if you want I will create one video in
which I will explain you how to create a
server ok so if you if you want that
thing just comment in the comment
section if you want that server putting
all so I will do that for you
okay so timing we are getting the output
right we are getting the value which is
on the web browser but we want that
value here so how to fetch that thing
for that what we'll do is we'll create a
async task now question arises how to
get async task so let me say enter so
async task is created with the help of
subclass or the inner class so we'll say
public class we can give any name here
so we'll say this is multitask that's
multiplication multiplied task okay
that's what we want to multiply two
numbers right and this class need to
extend to something called as a sync
task which will ask you for three
generate values first the type of
parameters second the progress for
update or what's your do background will
our send and the result the type of
results right so we have to specify for
this example I am taking all string I
mean the output will be spraying the
update with the string and everything
will the string here okay so now there's
an error here what the error says is a
do bag so async task is a abstract class
so that means you need to override all
those methods right so what we can do is
we can just click on this bubble with
the bubble and we'll say it's not coming
okay let's do it by ourselves let's
let's define those three methods here so
those three methods are okay so we can
type or we are we have one more way what
we can do is we can ask for the
generation so we say generate okay we
can go for override methods so we have
to use three methods here one is on pre
execute on post execute and we'll be
using doing background okay so what this
on play execute does is so whenever you
send a request or when you want to say
request to the server if you had to do
some housekeeping stuff before start
before sending the request if you want
to say if you want to do some stuff you
can do it in on the execute after then
after getting the response you can use
on post execute and when you want to
send a request you can use doing
background so most important method is
this one doing background so what we'll
do is doing into it in do in background
inside this method we need to send a
request to the server right so how to
send a request now so before sending a
request you have to specify the URL name
so what we'll do is we'll say this is so
we can pass the URL from somewhere so
we'll say this is so let's store the URL
somewhere so we'll say this is STR you
are L equal to let me just copy this and
we'll paste it here so that's the URL we
have we'll keep this in double quotes
right okay and then we can simply use
that URL here so how to create that URL
object so you have to say URL which
comes from java.net package and we'll
say this is URL equal to new URL in
which you have to mention the URL so
observe this is string URL okay so you
have to mention the URL here so it has
some exception it method exceptions will
say this is so I'm going to handle the
exception okay let's use try catch so
we'll say try and we'll say catch which
will handle all the exception okay and
we'll print the error in case if you
have an error let's print a e right so
we have to specify the URL the next step
is a way to set we need to send a
request using HTTP URL connection I will
say this is the object as con equal to
so don't in order to send that we need
to use this so we have to say you are el
dot open kind
okay so we need to use this method so
this URL object has a method well as
open connection and it will return you
the object of HTTP so that's s UDP URL
connection that's done so this is where
you have specify the URL this is where
you have to open the connection the next
step is you have to specify the type of
method you're walking with you are
marking with a get method or you are
working with the post method so how do
you have to mention that you have to say
a connection con which is gone dot set
request method and in double quotes we
can say this is the type of get request
and then we can simply say con dot
connect now once you are getting once
you are connected so you're saying yes
you have actually sent this request to
the server okay and now once we have
sent a request normative now you want to
get the output also right so to get the
response from the server we will use
bufferedreader okay so use be use before
you got to get the output if you don't
know this buffer heat or you can just go
to my channel that is called adding and
search for the video on bufferedreader
so you can actually search for let me
show you how to get that so just go to
youtube and search for
buffered reader in Java and just mention
that is square at the end so that you
will get my video so it is you can just
see see this video to understand how
before heater works and we'll say this
is B F equal to a new buffered reader in
which you have to mention new input
stream reader and in bracket you have to
mention this is you or this is con dot
get input stream so we just specify from
where you are getting the input right
now once we got that let's fetch the
value from the user or from the server
how to fetch that we can simply say
string value equal to bf dot read line
because I using real time you confess
the input from the
you can fetch the response from the
server right now once we got the value
let's print it so first type will we'll
just print it just to see if you are
getting the output will say result is
will print the value here okay so we are
not printing anything anyways we're just
printing on the console now I think it
will work
let's try but before how it will work
because we are not yet calling this
multitask right so we need to call this
multitask first and how to call that we
just will just get the object of
multitask and using that object we'll
call a method which is execute so
execute is a method using which you can
actually call something we can actually
call a um you can actually send a
request to the server right so you have
to say execute so this is the method you
will send a request which is 8 async
task request and in this you can you can
just mention nothing that will work so
if you call this executes it will
automatically call this all these
methods in including doing background
which we send a request to the server
and then you will getting the response
right let's try let's see if it is
working or not
let's run in Nexus 5x ok it will take
some time to load let me open mics Nexus
phone here ok is it loading it's just
loading they're taking a lot of time so
it should open now it is installing apk
launching activity and here we go it is
yeah so we got this view right so let's
enter two values let us say this is 4
and 3 click on multiplication button ok
something is happened here or we to
specify the permissions also right see
we got an error here which is missing
internet permission how to fix that you
just have to go to manifest and here we
can just mention a user's permission ok
and here we can specify that's weird
we can specify internet permission and
why it's coming we just have to specify
the interconnection now internet
permission right now let's run this
loading loading loading
okay here we go we have let's say four
and six if I click on this
multiplication request is sent to the
server and can you see that we got the
output as 18 so the input values are
four and six
oh why are getting 18 when you are
sending four and six
let's because if you see the activity
here see the values we are passing we
are passing here three and six so of
course you'll be getting 18 right but
the thing is doesn't matter what input
you are giving we are getting the output
right but I want to change this now how
to change it we can just copy this here
okay and once you set the value so once
you got two values we can replace that
you are string URL here okay whoops a
control V we could change this from
three to I so we said this is so it said
I here and this should be J right so now
what we'll do is we have set the numbers
right let's run this like once again
just to prove that it will work now it
will take some time to load again okay
so let's send these two values and let's
search for result is it loaded I don't
think so let's run this once again so
now let's try that let's enter two
values that say six and eight which is
48 right so if I click on multiplication
you can see that we got the output as 48
right because it depends it will now
depend upon our input values right so
this is how you can fetch the value from
the server okay so what we'll do is
we'll have already set the value in
value right what we can do is we can
data set or we can actually show our
toast but I want to show a toast once
the processing is complete totally so
for that what we'll do is we'll create a
string variable which is result usually
the value of result will be blank and
once I caught this value here when when
you send a request
we'll set this value service a result
equal to value right and so when you say
you are completed that means I want to
use post request in this post request I
will use a toast I would say toast dot
make in which you have mentioned this is
main activity dot this that's the
context next will say the output is I
will say plus which is the result and
then we set the last value which is the
dish duration right so we say this is
toast
and we'll keep it long because we have
done lots of hard work right so let's
see the output for a longer time and
let's see if it is working or not I
think it should work now so we are
waiting for that they started the
application here we go let's say nine
and twenty three is a bigger number
click on multiplication and we are
missing something and we missed that
method which is dot show let's run this
again I don't know why I miss this
method once again and it's been so I had
to count next time you know how many
times I'm forgetting this show method at
the end of toast
ok did I run it after that's wrong this
okay good where's the app
the 92.1 we have this feature of
launching the activity as soon as you
have made the changes so let's make it a
th multiplication and here we go can you
see the toast the output is 440 and
trust me that's the real answer right so
that's the multiplication of five and
eighty-eight so this is how you can
achieve async task so not just this we
can fetch the data from Facebook server
you can fetch the data from what's at or
your Twitter so it does that they should
subject it provide you the the text
format in fact let's do that let's let's
fetch not the my website let's let's say
I want to fetch google.com data so we
say this is google.com you can fetch the
whole website right the texture of the
website and if it will work or not let's
try so let's say I'm pausing this values
oh we are getting some I think we are
getting away big data a protocol not
found google.com let's say this is HTTP
colon slash slash now find it
okay applied how can you see that this
is the Google page and how much have you
seen that so this is the Google page
they complete Google page so you can
fetch any data from the server and while
fetching the data even if it is taking
some time to give the response Y of your
app will not get freeze because we are
using a new thread altogether okay let
me just just to undo undo here okay so
that's one way the another way is you
can actually pass this string from here
itself we can say this is string URL
because there are some websites which
prefer to send the US here and the
advantage will be in this balance you
have that you have that STR now so shop
specifying STR URL here you can actually
use patterns from patterns you can fetch
the first index value which is 0 right
or the first the first value from the
Panem's that is one way you can do one
more thing instead of returning null
here you can actually return the
salt okay
now this result so this result will go
to a this s here and instead of printing
result here we cannot actually send s
might even this thing will work let's
run this let's see if it's working or
not so changes are applied right and if
I click on multiplication we got 440
right it's that simple so yeah that's it
from this video so we have talked about
async task so when you work with async
task you have to create a class which is
inner class in which you have to
exchange with it's in task class and you
have to work with this three methods
play execute post execute doing
background and all the stuff so that is
from this video thanks so much for
watching and do subscribe for further
