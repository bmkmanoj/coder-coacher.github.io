output once again if I on this code you
can see we were getting an error right
and that error is it says hibernate
dalek not set so the problem is we have
not specified the configuration right
because when you want to connect with
database we have to provide certain
certain details right we have to provide
the DBMS which you are working with you
have to provide a database name you have
to provide username and password now how
do we provide that this is one way you
can do that with the help of XML file
now to do that let's right click on your
project and we'll say new and if you
click on others you can see we if you
search for hibernate it will give you a
file which is hibernate dot C of G dot
XML so that file name is hibernate dot
CFG dot XML click on next it will ask
you for certain things so the first one
is the dialect so if you are working
with MySQL I'll be selecting mask you'll
here and if you're citing with Oracle
you can select Oracle then you have this
like for your grabber class and I'm
selecting comm dot MySQL JDBC driver not
depend upon which DB which dry way you
are working with so if you are working
with Oracle you have just managed
mention or like--all there if it is not
then in the in this drop-down you have
to type it by yourself ok next you have
to specify the connection URL so I can I
can take the template from here okay I
will to place this thing with I'm using
the same machine which is localhost so
local host then you have to specify the
port number which is 3 to 0-7 and then
we have to specify the database name and
this database name is neon here okay and
then we specify the username I don't
have a password for MySQL so I'm not
mentioning that but if you are if you
have a password for MySQL you have to
specify that as well if I click on
finish now and you can see we got our
CFG file which is hibernate dot CFG file
with all this configuration and that's
why I love IDE is very very we'll get
all this thing by default
ok and that's it we have specified our
configuration file here let's go back to
an application and if I done this code
now
and you got an other it says connection
cannot be null our gate is saying it is
not set the problem is even if you say
configuration chronicled a new
configuration it is not actually going
to this file even if you have this file
now how to mention that you have to go
for that file is by saying configure now
if you say configure it will use that
file okay and in this configure you can
also specify the the name of the file we
can specify hibernate dot CFG XML but
since we are using a default name then
we don't have to mention that but let's
say if you want to change the name if
instead of having hibernate dot C of G
dot X emulation of that you want may be
hibernate XML then you have to mention
that file name here now let's run this
and okay now we got a different error or
not the same as at this time we are
getting a different error it says
unknown entity which is form dot the
disk or dot demo hype dot alien oh it's
not an entity I don't know let's verify
the problem is we are trying to save an
object right which is of type alien in
order to do that we need to specify that
this class is allowed to store it to
store its object inside the database
okay so we have to use certain
annotations to do that we can use at a
rate entity we can say control space and
you can see it belongs to a packet which
is Java X dot persistence so this is
basically JPA which is java persistence
api now once you have mentioned the
entity let's go back to an app and let's
run this now and you can see oh now we
got another error or the same error it
says unknown entity now even if you
specify the annotation there while still
not working it's because your build
factory or when you create this
configuration you have to also specify
which classes you are walking will
satisfy we have to say add analytic
class in this you have to mention the
class negative to say alien dot class
let me repeat to specify that you are
walking with alien and that's an entity
you have to specify at a data class
because we are using annotation
right right so on this once again and
yes now we got another error
it says no identify specified now as the
what is the issue now the problem is
every table in hibernate should have a
primary key right in this table if I if
you creating this table for alien you do
not have a primary key mentioned right
so I have to mention the primary key as
well now do you mention the primary key
it's very simple we have to use one
annotation called as @ ID and if you say
controlspace
again you have to input the package once
you do that the package is the package
is imported and you got an annotation as
@ ID we specifies that you are getting a
primary key let's run this once again
now and okay something has happened I
don't know what what went right or what
went wrong let's go to MySQL and let's
see if you got that table okay and let's
say show tables let's verify how many
tables we have now and run we got
nothing but don't we have we have not
got any alien table that means we have
to create that or not exactly however it
says don't worry I will give you a table
but we don't we have not we are not
getting the table what's the issue there
the problem the one the problem is
whenever you say you want to save the
data into database you are making some
changes right and whenever you make
changes you have to follow the acid
properties now as a property means
atomicity consistency isolation and
durability so to maintain that you have
to make sure that all the - all these
changes should be a part of the
transaction now how do we do that it's
very simple create an object of
transaction so that you are a part of
transaction so we'll say transition from
hodgiedot hibernate will say TX equal to
new session dot begin transaction okay
and
then at the end after saving up to say T
X dot comment okay so we are studying
transaction and then we are committing
it now let's run this I hope it will be
done now and oh we got an error it says
table neon dot alien does not exist now
what is that problem now the TV is not
getting created that means you have to
create a table no what we'll do is we
have to specify in your CFG file that I
don't have a table create a table for me
now how to do that that we'll see in the
next video thank you so much and do
