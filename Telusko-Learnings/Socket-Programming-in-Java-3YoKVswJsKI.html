telesco learnings and in this video
we'll talk about socket programming now
why exactly we need socket programming
so let's imagine you have two machines
we have a machine here which is your
client machine and we have a server
machine now you can connect these two
machines with the help of sockets right
so you can write your Java code to
connect your client and the server so
what we need here let's say we have a
client here and for this client we to
connect this server we require a socket
okay on the server side to work with
each client we require a socket so just
imagine we have two clients now so we
have point one and client to client one
has a socket and client to also a socket
right so you can see that now both this
socket will be connected with the server
so server needs one socket for one
client so in total for this application
we require two sockets there imagine in
future you have multiple clients this
will be having multiple sockets on the
server side but roll down how much
sockets you need on the server side that
will be depend upon the number of
clients you have so initially if you
have one client will be having one
socket there if we have two clients they
will be having two sockets if you have
ten clients if you have 200 clients you
will be having 200 sockets on the server
side but who is responsible to create
these sockets and that's why we have a
server socket there this server socket
is responsible to create socket to
connect with declined so every time a
client sends the request to the server
socket server socket will create a
socket inside the server if if you've
got a new request it will create one
more socket if you create 10 requests
you will get 10 sockets on the server
side that's how it works right but for
this what we need a socket should know
the IP address of the server because in
this world we have thousands of servers
hold on we have billions of servers so
we require a unique IP for each server
of course right but there's a chance
that in one server you will be having
multiple process write multiple
applications and you want to target a
particular application for that we need
a port number example in your machine
you might be having Tomcat you might be
having mask you might be having
the application and all the all this
application will have a different port
number right so we require two things
for the client but one is IP address and
the port number to connect it with this
elbow right so whenever you put an
object of socket you have to mention
these two things now once you got the
connection established now you can send
data with the help of Java code again
how to do that that we'll see in the
videos in the for subsequent tutorials
so make sure you subscribe the channel
