recursion so in the last video we have
seen how to call a function so we have
to first declare the function then you
are we define it then and we can call it
right so in this video we'll see how the
question works so in nutshell what is
the question so recursion is so it is
recursion so recursion is calling a
function or we can simply say function
calling itself okay now what it means so
let's say you have a function called as
ABC so this ABC function calls a
function which is also a ABC and that
function calls a function which is ABC
so that that means this function is call
itself and that itself calls itself this
is called a recursion right and to
demonstrate how recursion works we'll
see an example of factorial so let me
just remove the earlier code so if I
name of this part and a function here so
we'll start with basic so what we'll do
is we'll open sorry we'll create a
function which is called as fact so fact
is fact we'll represent of factorial
here we can have give any name and
here we'll mention it will take a
parameter of type int it will take it
will take int value it will return an
int value so here we'll create a
variable which is int n which will have
your value let's say I want to find the
factorial of 5 and just to let you know
the logic of factorial so it works on
something in this way so we have int n
equal to 5 we have to apply a for loop
again we can use fact function but time
we will do it in main function so I
should so in case if you don't want to
create a new function you can utilize
your main function to find a factorial
so we require a variable to count so
we'll say initially the value of I will
be 1 so we'll say I equal to 1 it will
go to the last number which is n so n is
5 right so it will go till N and we have
to say n plus plus or sorry I plus plus
and this we have to require one more
variable which will hold the value of
factorial so we'll say in fact or one at
fact let's say F so the initial value of
F will be 1 and we'll say F equal to F
into I so everyone so what is fact what
is factorial basically 2 when you have
let's say you want to find 5 factorial
so you will get a 5 into 4 into 3 into 2
into 1 right so doesn't matter if it is
5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 or is it
is 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 into 5 right
so answer will be same so I guess 5 ecto
it is 120 is it 5 and 20 maybe so you
should get so after printing after after
this loop since we are doing the same
thing we are just doing Y into 2 into 3
into 4 into 5 so what we'll do is let's
print the value of Fes we'll say printf
and we'll say % person person person D
will give a newline /n and comma will
say F so it will print the factorial
value so let's run this so if you run
this code you will see the output as 120
right so that's how you have to find a
factor of a number
now we'll do this with the help of a
function so we'll create a new function
here we'll say this function has in fact
and this will return a value so we'll
say it will take a value first I address
it will return a value so time min let's
return a value which is 0 just to make
sure we don't get an error while typing
and then we can just copy this loop we
also need all this variable so I so
we'll start with this we'll copy this
values and we'll paste it here okay so
now ok so it should have returning so in
returning 0 let's return value which is
f so it will turn you the output so if
you pass so we don't have to write this
here all right so we are we are taking
this value which is n equal to 5 and we
need to pass that value in fact by
passing it using a parameter then the
value of F will be 1 and then you have
to run a loop which will find the
factorial
by multiplying and then it will return a
value which is F okay let's call this so
we'll say fact and then we'll pass n so
if you pass and it will now find the
factorial and it will return the value
now since it is it returns your value
will say paint result equal to fact and
and here we'll print the value of we'll
say fact s percent D and we'll print the
value of result right so since this fact
will return you the value we have
destroyed a resultant we have to print
the result okay and if you run this you
got the same output right which is fact
is 2120 so that's how you have to call a
function to do your task so and now we
have to convert this into a recursion
mode so I think that will do in the that
will be better if you do in the next
video so that's it from this video so do
watch the next video for to find how how
to convert this into a recursion way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
