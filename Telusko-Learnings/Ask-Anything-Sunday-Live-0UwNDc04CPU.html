that's bad about YouTube you know
sometimes it doesn't display the current
we were perfectly I cannot see any
message I see why people are watching
this to like so that's great
that means I went live and people got
notification okay it's a lot of people
got a good unit notification now - great
okay so many questions are jumping on so
just hold on guys we'll try to answer
all your questions now first of all as
promised we are back with Sunday live
and I hope I'm not properly audible
there I'm back with my phone so I'm not
using the old phone now I'm using the
iPhone and it has a good quality
compared to the last week session ok so
let's take out some questions in fact
I'm support I was about to make one more
video this week but I'm busy with some
other stuff there are so many things
happening in a personal life so so it
will take some time and soon we'll be
having more videos on YouTube as you can
see I'm uploading the old videos the jar
videos again with the proper quality
once that is done I'll be continuing
with the Soviet sadie's I'm trying to
make a spring series and I'm waiting for
one of the best series I love which is
blockchain so this series on blockchain
may be on a theorem awesome other
auction implementations will be using
edge konjam I'm looking at a theorem
let's see how it goes if I like it I
will make videos on that on that
technology odd or something else but a
blockchain videos were they will be
coming for sure mostly I'll be are they
hitting most of my time in the month of
May because next month as well I'm going
out of cities so I have some other work
I'll be coming back in May so that's
where I'll be working in the actual
stuff ok so I can see a lot of questions
on the way ok all the questions are just
going up I was having the questions now
all the question which went up I cannot
go back so I'm starting the questions
now
ok I'll use my left hand today because
questions are on this side
okay so this is the first part the first
one is from Carol it says hey just
wanted to say expression for oh thank
you so much you're saying my videos okay
next question is which is the best
source to get updated Nike industry like
new technologies of an industry ok this
there is no one place where you can
learn everything as as you can see
YouTube is a big platform now so what I
prefer you know when I was in my college
what I used to do I should read
magazines because at that point YouTube
is was not that famous for education I'm
talking about year 2008 or 2007 when I
was in my garage when I was doing my
graduation so yeah so what you can't do
is nowadays we we have YouTube we have
Google just search for some technologies
read news articles about technology and
then we talk about some new terms
example that let's say when Bitcoin got
famous everyone was talking about
Bitcoin but some people you know they
were ignoring bitcoins now if you want
to learn about new things just talk just
learn about Bitcoin and see what is
running behind it like blockchain Athey
them all those things maybe we've talked
about IOT
just just think about the search for IOT
see if it if you talk about different
technologies we have in technologies you
know just if you can just learn about
everything a bet that's how you can you
can learn so there's not one place where
you can learn everything ok if you say
one place I would say YouTube ok ok so
question from Moorhead will you provide
videos on web development okay when you
say web development are you talking
about HTML CSS which designing part or
talking about the back in part because
if we talk about the backend part I do
have Java back in technologies you know
I do have videos on server JSP some
spring videos as well but if you're
talking about PHP no PHP videos on the
way up and not even designing okay I'm
not good with HTML CSS part I'm not that
great videos so I don't work on
designing side I work on the back inside
so you can expect job just for me not
other technologies
okay pheasants say sighs what if I'm a
long time Oh - so normally we go live
every Sunday the timing is not yet not
yet fixed I will be scheduling the live
sessions for our future because I am
shifting from this place to a new place
or new office once I cut the new office
I will I will plan everything you know
you're getting the exact schedule
because I'm trying to post videos every
day
may not be every day by to day once in
you know maybe three videos per week and
that to be scheduled videos you know you
can expect on which day at what time we
can expect my new video that's what I
was thinking from a long time because
lot of people have suggested me to do
that you know keep your people updated
about the link about your neck next post
and I'm late I was lazy to do that but I
will doing that soon okay next question
is Prince a Sergey can you tell why
equals method cannot override in
stringbuilder class or that's a good
question I'll making a video on that so
your question is about doing buildup
okay I have to remember that that's okay
so let me just take it down somewhere
that's a good question actually equals
in spring okay so let's break it down
somewhere equals in stringbuilder okay
done
I have taken that on a mobile phone okay
so next question is how to become how to
become a corporate trainer like you okay
that's a good question actually when I
was doing when I started my career as
developer then I went to some college
training I mean I used to go to colleges
for sessions and I wanted to be a
corporate trainer so I was having the
same question how to be apartment winner
so luckily I met with some corporate
trainers who are giving trainings so
through them you know you just have to
increase your what you say contacts so
the more contacts you have in the
industry so talk to one person who is
what we support between now and maybe
the next person is a corporate trainer
and there is a guide you know they will
give you steps and maybe they have so
example what happened with me is I
wanted to be a part of a trainer and I
was waiting for the opportunity so one
day one morning I got a call from one of
the consultants
see that they want a carpet cleaner and
I was like okay I have not I have not
done any training before they said okay
there was there was a mother trainer who
was who supposed to take this training
and he's not feeling well so you have to
take that charge I was like okay so
that's I was ready for then you give me
the opportunity so I got the I got the
training so that's how you do it so
first of all improve your twinning
skills by joining some classes by
joining some colleges and talk to some
corporate trainers example I am a
perfect winner so you can you can share
your materials with me if I get any
training I can forward that training to
you I just share your you know your
profile with me I forgot the name okay
so next question from give me a break
what's the biggest skills for Java
programmers to learn to get a job I
would say go Java you know if you want
to be a chartered upper your kochava
skills are very very important people
well I don't know why people are
skipping all these things that actually
focusing on the framework but they are
learning something James but without
having good kochava skills I would say
kochava
is the most important skill in Java as a
job developer okay oh okay
just all the questions went up pratik
okay next question is from Shalini says
please upload videos on selenium the
thing is I'm not into its ally in iam I
got a lot of requests for sodium in fact
every week I get some males only for
selenium you know that I think I know
selenium but I don't I don't know
suddenly I might have not worked on
selenium yet because what I do is I work
on only one thing which is job
development the back end but the testing
part and buy some somewhere else
the designing part was done by someone
else but it's not difficult for me to
learn selenium I can I can make videos
but you know lack of time there are so
many things on the way I think I should
focus on those things which I know
example spring
hibernate blockchain I don't know talk
too much
I'm excited to learn that so you cannot
expect that any videos from me at least
maybe I can talk to someone else they
can help me with the videos let's
okay so money says why Android studio is
too slow it's all depend upon your
hardware speed buddy see Android studio
provides you so many features it's a
development framework VPS making
something in it and when you say an IDE
like Visual Studio Android studio maybe
family they all are bulky in fact the ex
is often a my father this often named
the Xcode or for Apple
even that is bulky so if you don't have
a good configuration machine it will be
slow but if you even if you have a fast
machine I feel and your studio is damn
bulky because you install all these
things you know you have emulators as
well and that will take out of space in
your RAM so I would say try SSD hard
drive and a good amount of time to
actually improve your speed okay next
question is best framework for Scala a
big now I would say framework I would
say try play framework that is good I
feel because I'm not worked on all the
frameworks for Scala but this is good
okay for fresher Scala is good I would
say okay it's not it's not best for
freshness because it's it is difficult
to learn I would say first be a
developer and think about shifting to
Scala don't be a scattered I agree
okay so anvil says I'm 14 and learning
and it takes please I would say blunt
something which is easy for you at this
point like Python try Android because
the thing is if you learn all the
technologies you can see the output
instantly because when you're starting
your career at this age in ID I know you
want some motivation because if you
lunch are white will take a lot of time
it will take one year and you will at
the end you'll say okay I don't want to
learn Java but if you'll not buy that if
you learn Android you can see the output
you know instead you can make an app
instantly you can deploy an application
but that's not the case with Java so I
would say learn Python not Android and
maybe if you love hacking try I can do
is because that's how things motivate
you because at this age the most
important thing for you is motivation I
know you are motivated but still at one
point you might lose moti
if you are going for Shabbos I would say
go for Python go for Android in fact for
idolize well you need to know Java so
let's see so start with Java basics and
move towards move towards Android okay I
lost all the questions what we can't do
in summer holidays I also want to earn
some money so try internship you know I
always say dry internship if you want to
learn new things and if you want to earn
some money because internship you will
not pay you much depend upon your skill
set but learning you know nothing is
good because in some of what you do is
you enjoy I'm not saying you should not
be enjoying but spending some time for
internship maybe not be full-time
internship maybe part-time internship
working for four hours a day or that
will that will give you a good advantage
so try that I can see a lot of people
are watching this but when is like
strong guys if you enjoy this off
session school I question okay next
question can you learn spring boot
directly having a little bit of noise of
spring yes you can there's nothing
there's no compression to learn spring
but knowing sprint will help you in
learning spring or a boot but know it's
not compulsory you can't you can try it
out okay so
Tushar says why should we know about
github
the thing is github is what you say the
global thing now everyone every project
which you work on goes to a remote
repository Naugatuck is not the only
option
there's this big bucket there is get lab
in fact companies do have their own own
room on repositories
the idea is you should know how to use
the depositories how to use code
repositories example for normal files we
use Google Drive we use Dropbox so if
you in this word if you don't know how
to use Dropbox people will laugh at you
in the same way in the industry if you
are walking somewhere they you should be
strolling your code in the loop and the
remote repository as well
and that's why you should not get up
because if you don't get up you then you
it is easy to learn other other other
repositories as well like we have Kate
lab or bitbucket
so let me eat that is not important but
learning how to use we must look at a
positive is important in fact we also
have auto deployment automation like we
have Jenkins we have Amazon AWS quote
code deploy they all uses the remote
repository so you have to push up go to
remote repository and that will take
care of the of the of the deployment
part so it's important to know get up
I'm not saying you have to be expert in
it okay you don't have to be expert in
the guitar you should be knowing it of
how to use github and how to manage kit
how to manage your repositories ok next
question is incredible line angel says
want to learn Linux I'm into first year
BSC IT that's it that's good being in
first year you are trying to learn Linux
that's a great thing now how to learn
Linux so you just go to youtube and
search for the next tutorials there I'm
sure there's so many videos available on
YouTube in fact there is one channel
from where I learn Linux and I forgot
the name of the channel ok no the guy
has very low voice but amazing the
content is amazing
I forgot the name in case if I if I
recall I will try to post that video or
share that link in my community I forgot
the name he's Indian for sure I forgot
his name yeah but just try it I'll try
to find our series and you liked it
any idea to do lectures on machine
learning notice of now I was thinking
about machine learning but blockchain
came into picture so I'm doubling our
building blocks in first and in the next
year I can think about machine learning
ok so Eddie Thawne says what's the
future of spring it's a mr. best
framework for job as of now so I feel
there's no competition for spring at
least for next three to four years
because Spring has so many so many
libraries within it has so many features
you know I don't think I mean I think
we'll be bidding spring in future so it
has a good future but you never know
maybe Scala will fame some scholar will
get famous and Play Framework will get
more famous then spring you think about
but I don't think spring
I feel spring is a good few spring has a
good future
okay social app says what are the best
certifications about the best
certifications I would say for that we
have only one certificated adjustable
ankle there might be some local
certification but it's on no use so if
you want to get certified go for the
polaco certification that's the best
thing you can do that you know that and
also they have different levels we have
ocj a we have ocjp we have ocj
enterprise level so just try with ocj a
which is associate and then we have a
programmer okay okay so difference
between spring boot and spring MVC
system this is a concept okay it's also
a framework but what happens is when you
work with this framework like spring MVC
there's so many things that you do you
have to add the Java files using maven
repository you have to do the
configuration you do the XML part so it
take you will waste a lot of time right
example if you want if you want to work
on a project and maybe the project will
take one month but the the first day
we'll be spending is only the
configuration and springboard says hey
don't worry about the quantification you
work on the project I will take care of
the conjugation so spring boot will make
your work easy
so in spring boot also we have spring
MVC it's just that the configuration
part it will be done by spring boot so
you won't be working on spring MVC but
with the help of spring boot okay the
how it says from where I can start
springing boot you can watch one of my
video on spraying boot I'm going to
upload a seize on spring and spring
which will be a part of it but it will
take some time but as of now I do have a
one video on splitting wood so you can
run for that search for that is
cosplaying boot and you will get it
which is better playing boot or spring
MVC of course bring boot okay see you
cannot compare spring potential in every
see first of all because it's bring
spring boot is just about configuration
it's not about it's not a different
framework compared to spring so this
spring but it will help you in the in
the project creation configuration
deployment okay what is the best way to
learn data structures in Java watch my
videos okay I don't have all the data
structures as of now but yeah enough
enough to learn the basics of data
structure so watch my videos I think the
others are damaged maybe okay I can see
people are not liking this videos come
on guys if you okay which design
patterns is mostly used a singleton
factory
third I'd build a design pattern those
are quite famous in fact the videos
which I have on youtube so if you can
search for design patterns videos on
from the disco you will get a playlist
right don't tab all these n patterns but
I have this favourite design pattern so
whatever we just have those are
favorites
okay so money says a diverse crowd all
advanced java i would say both learnt
both you cannot you cannot choose one
because if you if you are walking on a
depressed cloud or what you're doing you
do in quantificational what if you want
to get other power of course you have to
learn advanced java so advanced java and
deployed out a little bit so you have to
learn both oh okay
why you're not replying vishal stays but
we need a video question the problem
they see i'm using a phone here and the
questions are going up with rapidly okay
so whatever question i see i'm answering
that question okay next is website
design CSS okay that's an incomplete
question i guess okay so we shall say is
is it possible to start to blockchain in
java
okay now for block change we have
different limitation one of the
implementation is in theorem and in
theorem uses a programming language
called as sorry solidity and that
authority language is similar to Java
because it also follows object-oriented
so yes if you're down to the poor you
can just go forward and I can just fuck
off or soil you do
okay but I lost the question HIDA says
how can I became how can I become master
in Java development practice you know
the more project you make see this knows
there is no mantra for to be a better
than up I just have it's all about
practicing practice for the competition
practice projects the work on new
projects trying to help people that's
what that's how you that's how it will
improve improve your programming skills
tell people you know just so whatever
video you are watching on my channel
just look at the comment section if
there's a question try to answer that
question that's how you improve okay
okay
so Ashwini's says which one is the best
field andrew the iOS i would say both
both has the advantage the example if
you talk about android the number of
users you will be getting is huge you
know we will be getting millions of
millions of subscribers of downloads but
in case of iOS we have the million
people but in terms of money the thing
is when you let's say if you upload an
app on iOS and people are using it you
will get and if you have ads on it you
will get higher CPC compared to android
because we have a lot of people using
iphone outside the country so there's a
thing okay so I would say both are good
okay next question next question once
same username in puss okay okay Kevin
says on bench what to do I'm from both
by now no opening in market compared
with other languages I would separate
yourself
so I guess every company they have this
thing which is cross-department shifting
so if you are working on one department
if you are working on one project
upgrade your skills based on what is
need I mean what other other Department
needs and based on that you can just
jump to this other department you don't
have to shift to company just say change
at your department that should work okay
oh okay
okay so we shall say society needs
JavaScript it's too much costly please
tell me how to learn costly but
difficult okay so yes Santi is derived
from JavaScript I guess but it is
similar to Java as well so if you know
object in programming it is created
okay I tell will die or would actively
die or what
okay maybe okay so I guess geo was just
a feel because thanks to geo every other
company they have reduced their cost now
and if you compare the pricing scheme if
you compare the 8l scheme and geoscheme
they are almost same right so I feel geo
is lagging because at this place where
I'm staying
Etta gives me better Network than geo so
okay mines Aussie is biggest fan of you
so thank you so much Mahesh okay maja
they say Java is not for my MI that's
why Java is not by mine okay drew says
start he do tutorials the thing is true
there are so many things on the way I
want to upload tutorials but there's so
many things on the way and I do not just
jump to Hadoop now which is simplest way
to learn spark ok learn Scala first and
learn Hadoop and then you know you can
learn spark very easily go step by step
I guess park is also easy to learn not a
difficult so first learn Scala and okay
if that's the best way
okay
Karthik says is there a technology than
Java
okay is that sarcasm I know yes there
are so many technologies in the world
which is better than Java and so we have
dotnet we have Python we have blockchain
we have we have IOT we have there's
other things available ok mother says
why ja ok that was a question mark ok so
why Java is not for MI because machine
learning or ml ok machine learning the
thing is it has more to do with machines
it's what to do with the the algorithms
and I guess fightin gives better
features it has better divergence
that's what I'm sort of that's what I
would say I'll get miss 25 everything is
going coach it goes good ok the title of
this of this video is ask anything and
that's why I got the question of ok
that's weird
okay so why Annie okay see you boom says
why and it starts from 0 ok the reason
why and it starts with 0 is because the
number system the if you talk about a
number system it always starts with 0 in
fact decimal system start with 0 the
binary system start with 0 the natural
number which we use as humans that start
with 1 but numbering almost start is 0
right now if you learn about any number
system like this much system binary
system author system they also having 0
so the question should not be why I
started to 0 the question should be why
humans you study number from 1 right
that's that should be question ok I'll
just say it c-sharp tutorials
yes you can expect HR tutorials because
it's not a difficult for me to teach you
see sure I can do that
okay so sarcasm says can be mine in a
depress Emma's on I guess you could you
can try because I know someone who did
this I don't know if it is successful or
not but you can try you can do mining on
cloud as well okay question from David a
da do I need to be expert in mathematics
to become a great programmer I would say
if you are good with a Matz it will help
you as a programmer you know having
knowledge of Matz will always help in
the programming but it's not compulsory
the thing is that different fields
available in nit now we have machine
learning we have AI we have enterprise
developers we have under developers now
if it if you think about any developers
they don't need mad skill but if you
talk about ai ai is all about max just
try to open the book of AI and you will
see how many how much mass you need
there if you are working on some
scientific scientific software of course
you need to know max if you're building
a banking application you should know
accounts as well so depend upon which
field you are working with it should
know that basics but Matz is at least
basic of mass is important don't ignore
max okay so question forms are shaky
hashing is steps to learn java ee first
on Java SE which is the go job part then
lanza flights JSP JDBC hibernate
framework Spring Framework and you're
good to go okay that was palsy can you
upload videos on angularjs no I'm not
going to do that but maybe if if someone
else is helping me with this thing maybe
some I can take help from someone else
who knows angularjs and if they can make
a video I will surely do that so you can
expect angularjs videos on this channel
but not from now already yeah
okay question the question is from Sajid
I'm a QA by profession can you show me
the journey to become a photographer I'm
good with kochava
so if you want to be a first-rate okapi
it's very easy actually I just need to
invest some time and your efforts the
first thing you learn is Ashima CSS
JavaScript because that's a front-end
part and then for the backend if you
want to get into Java so learn job go
Java as in as you mentioned you know
kochava lunch servlets JSP JDBC good to
go you can be you can build enter
application and build one application
using all this thing and then later you
can go for a spring framework as well so
now a question from Kunal I know some
late spring hibernate and Android now
what should I learn you you know enough
right you know solve it you know
spraying you know - it you know Android
you know enough to be a good developer
so whatever you know now build a project
at least two to three projects and do
you do you you don't have to learn
something else top oh good okay so
better way to use angularjs with spring
MVC can't comment on that because I
don't wanna colleges
okay so question from Superboy
programming language I should choose to
get a job quickly I would say Python
Python Android those are the things
which will give you a job now okay
see Java is a de facto thing is that
it's not that you should not be learning
Java you should be learning Java you
cannot escape from Java doesn't matter
what you're doing if you're a desktop
you should know Java if you develop I
should know Java if you're going Android
you should know Java if you are doing
anything in the world
you should be knowing Java so Java has
become necessary in necessity now it's
not it's not what you say a luxury ok so
what is the future of data warehouse
data below this is a basic for all the
data things we should talk about example
we have big data we have I do all these
things they are layered on data
warehouse so this is the basic for all
these things you cannot say it it is
something it is everything you know okay
which is better in web design Nick CSS
or the Photoshop but you're asking to a
long person okay so I'm not in designing
like I don't want to comment on that I
don't want I just don't want to miss
guide you okay so yes say it's what are
the scope in Iowa you can be on another
pot in future will be having IOT in fact
those IOT devices will be having Android
so it has a good future okay next
question future of IO IO T in South Asia
it has a good future IOT because see
India especially India if we talk about
all these countries South Asian
countries we always follow us because in
u.s. we have great companies and they
make something they use for they
published for their people like in US
and we people who go to us for we use
their and we try to interview the same
thing Indian in the Asian countries and
it takes around three to four years so I
I feel and that's for sure asian asian
countries they copy us so what do i
something in US will be coming to asia
and four years now three to four years
so if i OT is getting famous there it
will take next three years to get famous
in India as well on in Asian countries
how to get software job quickly by
knowing new prism no idea need to search
about Judaism now okay
cinema say so what to perceive off the
BAC ID I would say go for masters if you
don't know what to do
see if you are clear with your path if
you know you want to quit you get into P
i if you are going to blockchain go for
that if you're not sure I would say go
for masters complete your MCA or MSC IT
and while doing that bit some projects
using new technologies and that's that's
that should define your future okay okay
so what all you say is while your
channel name is that Isco any specific
reason so when I when I started this
channel basically this is my second
channel if you can search for Java by
there is a job and enjoyed it as my
first channel I wanted to give a proper
name for this channel I was thinking
about some weird names and I thought I'm
Telugu so I should off using some other
language names I thought okay let's use
telephony and I choose telescope because
it means get to know and one more reason
is that is for in India also means
she'll tell us Co okay basically it
means get to know in Telugu okay so next
five minutes we are almost it's been
half an hour okay so next maybe 10 more
minutes will take time o minutes and
then we can wind up okay next question
is so Java is too vast I guess learning
Java might take a decade okay it will
not take lightly can it it will take one
month or so one year mashed max if you
are spending good amount of time so I
would say start with core Java then
launch servlet maybe so coach I will
take one month so it will take two weeks
Jesus we will take one week and likewise
if you learn everything it will take six
months to learn six months to implement
but yes it will take a decade to be a
master
the gate okay how Bitcoin will impact ID
okay I'm I'm not sure about Bitcoin but
the debate on technology behind it which
is blockchain it will affect I team in a
good way and you can soon expecting some
videos on blockchain what are the parts
take so sie werden says what are they
but it can be done on dog chain I was
making a video on that soon
not at this point should I learn dinner
with us of course we should
okay Lassiter says how languages get
created every year but the thing is
creating a language not difficult but
designing a compiler for that is
difficult and why you need more
languages because the existing languages
they have some drawbacks you know and
people want to solve that issue and
that's why we got new languages but it's
not that if you got to be the language
you can do that doing it individually
will it take some we take some time but
in a team you can build any language
acha say surveyed are you from answer
Mumbai
so I'm someone buy a Mumbai okay uh
there's a book Java in 15 days okay okay
don't read those books whenever the book
says Java in 24 hours never never leave
that work the thing is when they say 24
hours is not 24 hours that means one day
it means 24 hours is 24 hours so if you
are spending one hour in a day so 24
days now but even those books are they
short cut it will not give your entire
stuff
okay so mandala say so you're amazing
please come to surah for sure oh there's
one more thing I want to announce about

multiple countries this this year and in
April or nautical

is your job is your VDO enough for job
interviews I would say not enough
because no video will be enough for
introduced okay it's all about how much
efforts you are giving so watch my
videos and do practice then it will be
enough in your block I did have a block
okay best way for learning collections
watch my videos okay should I go for
should I do I'm seeing I'll go for the
job see if you are getting a good job in
good company go for job otherwise MCS
better because if after doing MCA you
may get a good profile see sometime what
you do okay so sometimes the companies
you're working for is not important but
what you're doing so they post you know
that kind of work you're doing and I'm
see it gives you a good profile okay
so next five minutes okay Humana say
it's IDE for Java Eclipse if you if you
want to pay for it you go find a deejay
and I guess if you are a student
IntelliJ is free
I can see it's free so until it is the
best idea available but other other than
that you can go forward you can go for
eclipse
okay NetBeans and Eclipse I would say
eclipse which is always coach okay yes
say is gate versus I es not sure
okay so pressure on says thank you sir
you are awesome okay for your awesome
videos okay thank you so much I want a
Java competition because of your oh
thank you so that's great
III love competitions by the way I do
want it
that's like yay okay so yes say is are
you hiring interns in June I'm hiring
interns in May okay so that's right I'm
having interns in May but reporting
tones so you can work from any place
okay oh okay next question
oh there's one more thing I'm shifting -
Kalyan next month the Kalyan City which
is new to Mumbai and so the official
widget thing there so if you if you stay
nearby in kanji on you can also come to
my office for internship but are you
making a proper video on that okay
motivation says so you like Bill Gates
for me you teach like God oh thank you
so much okay
Japanese provides rent free license yeah
that's quick that's right
jetbrains gives you freelances for
entity chip if you're a student but I
guess you need a college ID for that
maybe can you make a video on
microservices okay let me just think
about that so let's say so I got a job
because of you thank you so much that's
great and that's the motivation you know
I always feel my always get motivated
when I look this type of comments thank
you so much everyone for letting me know
okay did you share coach other videos in
your YouTube blog I don't have a blog
but yes I do have videos on YouTube okay
MCA I'll never see what I'm seeing if I
am going to willing to work for develop
for rest of my life I would say go for
MCA MCA is better is money to eat to
learn all Java collections learn at
least which I have okay krishna says
dextrous is Kalyan great okay yeah Belen
so finally I decided okay so technical
notebook says Salam in mind okay when
I'm in bando now we can have a meet
taking a notebook if you want -
Bangalore oh can i John as an intern yes
you can just so there will be a there
will be a test there will be a police
project submission if you can complete
that project you will get an intention
so there will be a priest waiting no
economics a sperm what me economics
economics yeah economics I don't like it
now anyway general extrapolation be sure
I learned first I would sell on generic
first because it will give you an
advantage but the thing is learning
genrich's with our connection will not
make much sense you know because we
don't use generic much other than
collections so first one connection yeah
that's that's that will good good way
learn basics of prediction luncheon
tricks and compact Malaysian not that
way so learn basics of Corrections
luncheon tricks and then collection back
last two minutes and then we are signing
off and diet okay is Java required to
learn Hadoop yes
knowing Java will be helpful sure
reservation be banned that's a big
question that's a very poetical question
that's a very ambiguous question
reserves you should be banned yes based
on the cost yes but not on the page of
the economic financial level so I feel
that thing well I don't want to comment
too much on that let's see how they go
okay last one minute okay so question
from self are you going to make videos
on later not much idea on later because
I don't work on client applications
let's see let me just have a look on
that and let me see what is that last
one question and we are signing off
what to learn after kochava okay that's
a very big question now first if you
want to go mobile go for Android if you
want to go Enterprise go for spying if
you want to catch it
oh go for a JSP if you want to get it to
Big Data Voice go over Hadoop there's so
many options after kochava unfit say sir
you learn from well I learned from
Google I learned from documentation I
learned from YouTube videos because
whenever new technology comes these are
this official conference or official
video of that from their company that's
from that from that's where that's what
I learned
okay so virtually everyone that's it
from this life session next time we'll
go again live I hope you like these
obsessions and we're going live again
next Sunday buddy if I try to go live in
the Vegas as well I try my best to go
live invictus but you know because I'm
busy with some other stuff but why I
will try to go live again to meet you
