and I was just checking my network
activity here I think that it is not a
good
so don't know how he can how you're able
to hear my voice
I don't know if it is like lagging there
and I'm not sharing my screen yet I'm
doing that now so just click on this I'm
sharing my screen with you are live now
okay so I hope you can see my screen
everyone
oh okay so Fran says today is not a fire
sir okay okay today is not Friday I know
the thing is the project is going going
you know very slow so I thought our
fingers in the piece and I'm taking a
session today as well I was being busy
today as for the class but then I took
out some time to take this session so
all right so I can see the screen is
load here and okay so streaming is not
going the way I want it to get to go
I'll just check if you have some
settings so that I can I can increase my
screen resolution okay ah hold on just
hold on just roll down let me just check
if I have that setting here if I go to a
live control room okay
still says the streaming is not good
streaming is okay it says let's change
to my different route
you
you
okay so I just hope it will go good for
this session let me just start this
session now so I'm sharing this coin I
hope you can see Mize for everyone and
if you can hear me just let me know if
my voice is probably audible or not okay
so so let's answer some questions first
so we got some questions is applaud says
I got scared okay that's fine I guess I
would say hello next time is slowly and
then Jatin says what about it co web
service for TEPCO is I guess it is used
for the messaging services right we are
not using any messages service here so
are we not using okay I mean I don't
have much idea on that I don't even know
how that works
okay my network is not consistent let me
just change that to again a different
router
sorry for the trouble everyone sorry for
the trouble I'm facing so network issue
yes I am
education here and continue changing my
router from 100 other router let's see
how it goes now ok so you can see my
screen right everyone so ok so what we
let me just start recording from my side
so these session will be recorded from
now and ok so before that I want to
change my font size of the HDS what I
will also do is I will simply reduce the
resolution of this friend I hope that
will work and the font size now should
go to
like 14 font size is better than 16 okay
so you can see my school right everyone
so let me start the session now and I
can see 20 people are watching this and
I got any 9 likes so just go like better
so that I will know that you're excited
ah ok so dual likes okay okay it says
i'm not properly audible okay that's
fine you can just watch this video later
as well so I am shutting the recording
now
so let me I can't do anything for that
now I don't have a choice
okay so let me just start a laconic son
click on the Dakota and it says three
two and one so okay so what we do now is
to really focus on the question module
so I want to add question in a database
see I want two things first of all I
want to add a cautionary debase and
second I want you people to help me with
this again I'm not getting a good
response from you people I mean I'm
willing some designs from some people
but I was expecting that I will be
getting the design from lots of people
I'm not getting at so currently I am NOT
that motivated them what the you know I
was initially I was very excited but
then I'm not getting the response I
should be getting because I want designs
right I'm not getting much designs here
only Karthik and darshan
I got designs on them okay so the next
thing which I want to make is this test
module so if you can see on the website
so there's optional tests and you can
give tests with or without clog and
usually will go for test without login
where I don't want user to login to take
your test so I'll click on this and you
can see after after two seconds of this
study with tests we should be getting a
question here so there will be a timer
so this is what I want so let's imagine
if you have 50 questions on this server
I will give you the link of getting all
the questions so I will give you 50
questions or maybe ten questions
initially so I will give you ten
questions what you have to do is you
have to accept those I mean you have to
accept those ten questions and you have
to show your thing in this way so you
have to show which of this I mean you
have to show the question and then you
have to show the options as well so if I
select the second option if I say next
then it should give this second question
which is this one let's say if I go for
method doubling I don't know what this
question answer means I'm going for any
random question and also it rough about
next and then extend I'm giving I'm
giving wrong all wrong on so if I click
on hand test of course I will get zero
marks so you can see we got a mass which
is zero here so this this is what I'm
expecting from you so give me this page
the question page and the result page so
the
thing is I'm expecting from you
something this way a question and
options and if I select whatever options
so at the end of the test so if I click
on end up end of the test you have to
send all this question so you have to
send the question ID you can see the
address bar you have to send the
question ID and the unser you have to
send this to on the server side so on
the server side we have to accept those
values and have to process the values
okay so this is what I'm expecting from
you people but then today I will create
a model where you can add the question
if I don't get a proper response this
time I might not go ahead with life
project because if I'm not getting
response why I will make it live right
so it is not making sense so okay so
come on you have to do it right so let's
do that
okay so what I will do now is so we want
to add a quotient of database so first
of all let me check do we have a table
here so I will open like PG admin so I
forget if you remember in the last
session in the last online I mean live
for project we have created a a database
connection with the Amazon Web service
and that connection is this one which is
AWS dot or I mean this is the or
connection into taking some time to get
connected okay it's working very slow
okay let us close
let me just reopen it then a maximum
time developers spend their time like
this
they simply close the application do we
open the application is taking some time
let me just do that so if I click on the
database now okay so which is taking
some time let me just let's wait for
that
okay he's actually taking lots of time
now this is not how it was it should
work right okay by the time it connects
what we'll do is let's go back to our
spring project and here what we'll do is
we'll okay so what I have done behind
the cns I have period one more
controller okay first of all I will have
to get one controller in the in-text
controller if the things which are
written last time and then we are
calling for position dot HTM so when I
go in under this code let me just run
this code and when I reckon when I call
for quotient or HTML say run as the non
server when I click on finish
okay so if I request for questioner
because I want to add questions right
because in table I don't have any
questions I would say question dot HTM
so that I want to add questions it
should show me a page where I where it
will ask you where it will ask for the
questions I mean the question the
question then you have people ask you
for the I guess it is making a
connection with this server now if you
remember last session okay nothing is
working properly here okay this is
really really weird the thing is I also
need to have a local database because I
will test that in local database right
so this is not getting connected so what
I will do is I will change this setting
so before changing the setting I will
just copy this because I want to read
change this value when I do the
quantification so I will come to this
and I will open my sublime let me space
this setting and it let me save it
somewhere okay full form of AWS a double
stands for Amazon Web Services or it's
not hitting parent total asking for the
password
okay let me say okay and is doing
something now okay by the time I will
use a local machine local network and
it's very slow very slowly pick a local
database let's work with the local
database here so I mean this mask cure
is a local database and then I will use
pose quiz for the server side okay and
in my mask you'll I do have the database
which is question okay what'll I do now
is I will open my SQL work bench so that
oh we can't be connections with the
Amazon Web service that's it we've got
the connection there but then still will
be using will be using the local
database because the network is very
slow today again I am shifting this
office to another place or maybe after
shifting I am checking this on a second
may so maybe after shifting it will give
me a better connectivity let's hope so
we said it connection the IP address now
is okay now you can so you cannot see
this friend academia open mascal
workbench
okay password for this is that's one let
me just say successful the con close
okay let me open this and so if I open
this you can see in my tell us code
database I have I do have a question
table so let me just open you can see we
have a question table and if I say use
the disco and select star from cushion
and if I have five this query of course
you will get a table but again since my
network is very slow it would be some
time okay so we've got a question from
push code and okay what is supposed to
be supposed race is same like MySQL it's
a DBMS okay so once I say is to send a
link before the session I mean I'm
sending the link in the group so once
you have to be a part of the group the
also on Facebook we have a group called
as the disco live project and you have
to be part of that project to get live
updates okay so make sure you are a part
of that okay and my network is dying
okay let me just open this thing I don't
know why I feel I should reconnect but
then things how things might work and
let me just do low connection I would
say mask you'll but so calm dog mask
your dot goody PC dot driver okay and
then I also need it be mask your
connector yesterday we have deleted that
part let's keep both the dependency
let's get mask you'll and force query
system and here I will simply put that
stuff let me just put the mask you'll
thing okay so if you are wondering that
my machine is slow actually the machine
the problem is not with the machine the
problem is with the network and the
white is not working properly every time
I connect with my local server or the
web server it gives it gives me the
trouble
can see my mask ul is not working
properly now nothing is going in our way
today and that's the developer like
right that's what first that's what I'm
doing now but then even my local server
my mask is in fact my machine doesn't
have a mask you'll server it is not
working properly so I'm using the
another machine mask you'll work bench
so that is not working properly so if I
say use the disco I guess not working
properly here but I feel I should create
my own PC data by signal here so okay
let me just use the local database so
you can see in my system I do have my
local database i will use phosphorus and
i do have a table there so I will use
Navin database in my Navi database
I have public tables I do have some
tables here so I will be creating a
table which is called as a cushion table
so let me kind of table here police
question and in this table question I
will be having some columns I will add
the column which is I will in this
column named as a queue idea the type of
qid will be in Peter okay then we have
well I also want into it to be primary
key then we got question okay so let's
say dinner right would this would be
okay okay
using data which is corrected for
question and then the next word would be
I want to add the option one because
every question will have four options
right so it's a option which is text and
then we say opt to and guys I also need
a feedback here I mean if you're
enjoying these type of sessions should I
continue this deserve sessions and
future because the response the type of
response on getting is not that I mean
I'm getting a very load is false
I was expecting something good but then
I'm not getting the response I was
expecting but then okay so let me don't
know that is for I mean no the feedback
what's going wrong what else what you
want to it okay so I got my people hear
something okay and I got this table
where we have all this fields and I will
click on okay so I got my table so I
will be using a local table here local
database and the database name is so
let's not use muscular to only work on
four squares okay so I will say so I'm
not using Maskell I'm using Postgres
again because nothing is working
properly so we have into some trial
errors right okay and this time we'll
make simply mention in shock measuring
all this big tank will simply mention
the database name I will say in fact we
don't have to mention all these things
we can simply say localhost okay we say
to disco original my project name it my
name is my little is name okay and the
user name
is paws gross I guess appliques this
every time I do deploy and test so
password for me is zero
now that sounds good we got all these
beetles here now what I will do is okay
so what I've done is we have taken this
controller which is a cushion controller
and this should work now if I reach to
this server I just do that here so I
will restore the server okay I just want
to change one more thing this should not
be string it should be int so let me
just run this our right leg and run ass
oh we got an error here oh it is set
question ID is everywhere we have to
make it Inc now right click run as run
on server this is a kind of boring
session right compared to the last two
sessions okay so we don't say okay
akshay says or des steps so I have a
playlist extra just search for the
playlist on my channel the newly created
playlists and you will get all the steps
there well it's a question dot HTM at
not HT m it's HTM and it will give you
the page with this question because it
should give you JC page now okay this is
the JC page which you have created so
don't look at the design here learn
don't look at the design so we'll enter
the question idea is one and we'll
mention it question whatever questions
we have whatever option you have it
doesn't matter what is the option
okay and we'll be able to also set B
answer okay answer is No
coming here because the design problem I
guess anyway it doesn't matter
so whatever data you're getting I want
to store this data in data base I can I
want you people to give me the design
okay send me I could design for this and
if I click on submit it should send a
request to this server and you can see
I'm getting some issues here so let's
try to solve this now first of all if
you to make it work to make it work we
have to send a request to the question
controller right so what is happening
now is whenever you send requests for
question dot HTM save anybody requests
for a portion at HTM oh yes karthik CSS
is missing here so actually i got the
CSS but then i was i guess i have not
added CSS in my project okay so nice the
question is not question dot HTM when
the liquids bush here it will call
quotient or JSP and I already have a
quotient or JSP which is this one so in
this question or JSP you can see we have
this is our design and the moment you
click on submit the request goes to the
request goes to another controller with
the request goes as save question and
all the parameters goes here okay so all
the parameters comes here now once
you've got a parameter I am I will be
calling so after adding the question I
will not be calling question or JSP I
will be calling a friend I just want to
check if it is splitting print why so I
will say print questions not Daisy I
want to call this page and this page
will be printing all the questions okay
that sounds good so I got this question
here and this question will be having
all these values now okay instead of
this we could actually used a model
attribute object right so we have seen
that before so we could have used what I
have ticket object
okay just remove all this thing CK see
that's the issue with the request
pattern right we should be using what
attribute here that will make more sense
some of the using model attribute
and we'll mention a question q so in
this cube we got all the values you
don't have to set B values by yourself
one one values okay so we can just
remove this thing okay now I want to add
this value my database right so from
this controller I have to add it later
in our database so I will be using a
dowel right so we have used with our
layer before so let's use that here now
how do we create object of dowel layers
so we can simply create an object of a
feedback tau which we have done in the
index front row like remember so you can
see we just have to use auto Y owed oh
we have to create one more doubt layer
which is for questions now and we
already have that I will say question
Dao I predict this file which is
question Dao and we'll name this as Q
tau okay and then what's that
okay so you can see we got Q da and then
in this Q Dao I will say Q tau dot and I
will simply say add question this is the
method okay refi which make which better
I am using that so in my in this I am
using a method or a saved position okay
I will be using safe portion that method
name so I will say save question and I
will pass the object and I want to pass
the object which is Q so I need to exit
that question here so let say a question
Q that sounds good everything seems good
here
okay so a typical flow once again and in
fact this with this there is code will
be available on the github so once the
session is done because this code will
be available on github okay so I'll be
saying save question but then this is
giving me an error is it any other than
okay you might be saved question button
same question returns our question we do
not utilize the same void so so this
code is done by someone else so I just
want to figure out what is happening
here so we got the same question and you
can see there is no problem yeah this is
- the problem okay because we have a
problem here
hold on okay so there's no letter there
and there should not be enough error
here as well okay it says unhandled
exception so I'm throwing exception here
we should not do that we'll be using try
catch to handle the exception and we'll
say try catch because see whenever you
throw the X whenever you throw the
exception when someone else has gone to
the exception right in fact why I'm
doing all this thing here why even have
to enter the exception first of all I
don't want to use all these things right
we are using hibernate I will not be
doing all this times okay why we are
even doing this we are doing we are
using hi Padre Pio so we will not be
using any data-- basic code here so I
got this question so I am saying save
question I am passing Q so this thing
the down layer will be having the object
of so in this I need optic off work so
let me just go to the down layer of
feedback which we have already done and
you can see if anyone want to work with
the hibernate we have to get object of
either 8 or to Wired session Factory
let's do that let's keep it let's paste
it here so we got beyond the top session
factory and what we'll do now is just 1
with my interns on the server Amazon web
server was the type of the ocean idea is
it spring or integer okay so I guess it
is someone it is spring it is string on
the server as well so what do I do now
is I will say okay I will copy this port
form so we all love copy pasting right
so I will copy this code these two lines
from here is two lines okay and we'll
place it here so I'll be using session
optic and then instead of saving the
object of every we will save the object
of question okay so done but then the
only method without annotation we have
to use here is a transactional so
whenever you work with hibernate we have
to use under the transactional right and
everything seems good here this should
work at least for the database are
having my system right so let me just
run this code let's see what happens if
I save the question but then how do we
verify the question is saved
okay we have to verify that database
right so I was right I will write like
this I will say run as though there's a
non server click on finish okay and if I
say question about HTM it will liquid
for the question now analyze it quite we
call a page first of all taking some
time but it will call a page and we got
an error it says question controller
unsatisfied dependency which is cued ow
oh we are we are left with one more
thing so we're going to say we have to
create a dependent when you when you
want to create object of question now we
have to use add component by before word
to add a component there same goes with
question oh okay we don't need a
component here cleaner component right
because if you remember when we have
created the of feedback Dow at that
point itself the
used a tallit component so it means you
shut the server with the gun as run
server
okay let me just call the old request
let me just call quotient or astrium and
if you can call that you can see you'll
be getting a page now okay so I will say
question one zero one and some question
and some options some options some
options sub-option
will because it's submerged again the
got an error it says a class was you
manually assigned before calling save
okay identifier so we have not mentioned
the identify this is this is all our
hibernate errors so anyway you create a
question class you have to make you have
to use and entity annotations right we
have to mention identity and then you
have to also mention at ID so whenever
you have primary key you have to mention
at ID as well right okay so it is taking
some time for watch okay so let me the
solution server once again okay it is a
bad day I guess is not nothing working
the way we want it to work so getting
lots of videos
okay let me just go here and let's say
enter and I hope it will not give you
any other now it's running it's running
it's running I guess it is connecting
with my server and we got an error okay
is it general okay it says now this time
we are getting edicom feedback why
feedback
I'm not calling oh it is calling add
feedback that's weird that is weird
actually
when I say question it should call add
question right so it should be a
question just hold on I guess it did in
the design we have not changed so it
should be add question
let's restart
yeah okay let me just follow this first
okay now what is the issue the issue
would be with okay this is the ideal
elevation which you've got unwilling
this once again
okay and now this time we got an error
as well okay why we're getting error we
are not calling for okay we're still
using feedback I am calling for question
right what's wrong okay when I say add
question when I click on submit it
should call question only and okay and
then in the question controller I am
calling you got question oh that is safe
core shall not add question but then ok
let's save question my mistake is time
and I just doing life something is very
risky so let's say now and I hope it
work
it is running way slow again we are
getting better so why we're getting
error for three back nothing wrong here
I'm not saving the feedback here
oh this liquid is still passing gas
safely back my bad
it should be safe question Roger stream
let's enter Oh finally you can see this
error something different is not able to
find drink question like so let verify
that with our PG admin let's say ok let
me just open this question table so if I
take this and if I say view source not
real source if I save you all data oh we
have not got the data here that's weird
it says it is it is inserted all the
data but then what's wrong if you got
once again refresh or it is inserting
blanquito that's weird
what's going wrong here we are saying
save then guessing a transactional
god save question oh the things are not
matching a design ok ok ok what we'll do
is there's lots of issues with this
design ok ok we can do it yeah let's do
it here ok as you can see this is not
matching right so you can see if you're
okay whatever we do now is ok ok one
little part let's do one more thing
we'll do this tomorrow itself what about
what I want is I want you people to
complete this because they are not some
issues with the design page I need to
change the design I want to change the
variable names ok what I would suggest
is we'll continue with this tomorrow
and I want you people to complete this
code so you will get the adhere code
from the github so if you can just go to
github and every one every one of you
got the thing right what I want from you
people this is the link very very very
will get the project I want to add
questions in the database and I want to
also fetch the questions from the
database these are two things I want
from you people
ok so submit these two things because I
forgot to change the design so just
check out the code just check out the
project from here this is the Aspen
this is the yesterday's project and
tomorrow will start this from the
scratch and let's see how it goes
tomorrow
so anyway
here let us continue this tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
