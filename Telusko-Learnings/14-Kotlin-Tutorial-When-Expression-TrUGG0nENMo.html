it sometimes for learnings and in this
video we talked about switch hold on do
we have switching cortland now if you
remember in Java normally we go with
this you know we go after after if as we
always talk about switch statement
because if you have multiple you know if
you want to compare multiple values of
you're going to compare one value with
multiple things it's better to go for it
switch right instead of going for
if-else now how do we write switch in
Java so this is what we do right so we
use a switch and then in that we'll be
having multiple cases right so in this
situation what I'm doing is I took a
value which is n equal to three and then
I'm matching with one of multiple cases
so if the first case gauge is a case is
matched it will do something maybe it is
printing something it is doing some
operation it which it might be doing
some weird thing doesn't matter the same
thing is with case two case three and
then if none of this matches it will go
for default now after every case we put
break as well right now why we have to
put break there is because if the first
case is matching then once you got the
first case match it will execute all the
remaining cases we don't want that right
and that's why we use break just to come
out of the switch block so I mean that's
how you use switch right now the problem
here with switch is you know I always
just to wonder a switch keyword makes
sense because this switch again this
concept of switch is coming from C C++
okay this is not you cannot link Java
here for this thing the things which I
hate in switch is this break statement I
mean why do we need a break statement
why dot a case match I mean once you
match the case it should print this
stuff right why you have to put break
maybe they might be having some some
issues with this before in C and C++ but
it doesn't make sense after in 2000 in
2017 right and that's why Cortland says
she don't worry you can use switch in in
Cortland but then there are some changes
the first change is okay let's let me
just go in this way so let me get a
variable here and I will create a Val
now again you can create a Val or Val
the only difference is val is a variable
val is a constant now in java we use
final keyword here we don't have to do
that I will say this is numb and I can
define the type of it I will say
I ain't and I can assign any value I
want I will go for the same example
which we are doing there so I will
create a variable number and I will
assign the value which is 2 now how do
you compare this now we don't use switch
here we use something on this brand now
when is a special keyword in Cortland
which is almost same as switch now it
takes num as a parameter okay you can
pass any parameter any type of parameter
its support string as well that way you
support so string in in switch in Java
right so you can pass any type of value
here it may be it may be true int or it
may be string and then you have to match
with the cases but then coachella is how
do you match a case here what would be
the syntax for this so we don't use a
case keyword we simply assign the value
whatever you are comparing with so let's
see if I want to compare this with one
so that weight 1 makes sense now what
type of operator have to use here in
switch we use : right here we have to
use an arrow now once an adder is done
you can do anything you want whatever
you can what you by mean if you want to
multiply this number with something if
you want to print something just to make
it simple I will do I'll be doing
printing here so I will print our
message and I will print a message as
one so if this matches matches with one
it will print one if this matches with
two I will print two right so I will say
two and sorry for my typing speed its
space slow I know and if it matches with
three I will play I will say println I
will I will print three that he should
be capital just to give them respect and
then I want to check for these three
cases and if nothing matches you know in
switch we have default what about when
in when we use else we don't have a
default keyword when when you work with
when and that will print here will say
give a proper input will say give a
proper input again you can add some
adjectives there at the end but then we
got this one why so we got one you got
two we go three and they got l-spine as
well let's try to execute let's see what
happens now you might you want you might
be wondering various break statement
here and as the magic and when we don't
use break statement in fact we don't
need one in fact you know why I get
annoyed so I don't get
annoyed because of I'm a developer I get
annoyed because I'm a trainer also right
because you have to explain this to some
people when I use switch and when I try
to explain a switch to my you know to my
students or my trainees or my colleagues
the problem is you know I have to
explain this brakeman as well why we
have to put break there and somewhere
they get stuck itself so yeah that's the
issue let's run this code let's see what
happens now so it's running and you can
see the answer we got is 2 and you can
see I don't have any break statement
there and we use we are using else and
that means if I change this value to 6
as well it will print give a proper
input right let's run this and you can
see we got the output as give a proper
input right so that's how it works
that's how you can use switch here okay
easy right and you can pass string as
well you can pass integer now the
problem is I mean not the problem but
then we have a question I mean that
question comes from of my mind is if you
talk about it fells in Quadrant we have
seen that video earlier so when we work
with equals what we use is we can use if
else as expression now when I say
explicitly it simply means that it will
evaluate and you will get something in
return so in this case if you are using
when can we use when as an expression
let's try that so when I say I can use
when as an expression that means it
might return a value so I will say where
STR equal to but then what I'm expecting
here if we talk about this println now
println if you return if it if it
returns something it returns a unit
again unit simply means void in in cod
line so let's not talk about that now
let's let's remove this println for
timing because I don't want to print
something I just want to return
something so when I when I remove this
thing whatever we write after the case
or whatever we are right after the
return after the add all this will
return to the value of STR so the key is
matches with any of this value it will
return that particular value so it means
let me just change this value to okay so
whatever we have done now it was it will
assign the value to that particular
thing so example if I say if I pass two
it will match with this 2 and this 2
will be assigned to STR the same thing
as offense right so let's try to you
know print a STR here so I will do what
I will do is I will say print L n and I
will say STR is and then I will use a
dollar symbol to represent that STR
right this is how you use string
template let's run this code let's see
what happens now okay
can you see that it got the output as
STR is 2 that means using when I mean
you can use when as an expression as
well so that's how you can use when in
Courtland which is same as switch also I
would recommend you to work on this try
different combinations try try to
convert this into a class file then D
compile it to get the Java code and
let's see what what you get so let me
