called odd things and in this video
we'll choose a topic and then we talk
about what why and where they will
implement a technology and today's topic
is Android notice angle
so basically manual is founded by anti
looping with its team and later Google
acquired Android again Android was
founded in 2003 and now the turbines and
Google acquired Android now we have
latest versions of four we have multiple
versions of Android 10 the latest
version of Android is marshmallow it all
started in here - 2008 somewhere so we
had cupcake initially now if we talk
about cupcakes like us which has
multiple features lots of features basic
one and then after that we got updates
won't like darn it then we got Eclair so
I start with this so it was one point
five it is cupcake 1.9 he is Donna Tobin
Percy's first donut and then 1.9 2.0 2.1
was it less and then it goes for F which
is flowing then we have Gmail
gingerbread then we have G H H which is
H is honeycomb then we have Ida's ice
cream sandwich and then we have J which
is jellybean and then we have K Willis
KitKat and L lollipop and the last one
is M which is maja small enough and
maybe if you are watching this with your
next year there'll be something called s
n I don't know what n with me so there
are lots of versions of Android right
again if you miss the dish don't worry
that is that in this description area so
that wall that is Android which is a
mobile OS but Coachella is Y will equal
Android when you have all this always
available when I take when I talk about
all I'm talking about Symbian I'm
talking about
BlackBerry OS I'm talking about Windows
so when you have all this is why we
acquire yet another pulse it's because
if you talk about all this OS maybe
windows maybe BlackBerry OS
all sentient horse they all want closed
platform poles
now when I say closed platform a simply
means windows will be only used by Nokia
at that time then we have BlackBerry OS
only used by blackberry company and
Symbian
again used by Nokia they won't take some
alike they wanted a oils maybe Google
wanted a horse which will be which will
work on all the platforms irrespective
of which company you're working with
maybe if you are maybe a company like
micromax a company like HTC maybe I
combine like Samson or Sony they all
wanted to work with one big OS and then
google talk about why not to use a lack
use and oils which work on all the
platforms so ii kept they kept it open
so that any company can work with that
and that is android for you but then
wash allah is where to implement this
android now well not think about this
world in this world we have seven
billion people and out of that three
billion people are using Internet
just imagine out of that at least two
billion people are using mobile phones
how many mobile phones behind in this
world and eighty three percent of mobile
market is captured by Android so just
imagine the number of users using
Android because the price of if you talk
about iPhone it goes beyond your limit
right but if you talk about Android it
is there for everyone doesn't matter
what your budget you can buy an Android
phone if you are running in the low
budget you can go for a low budget
Android phone if you are going for the
you know if you have lots of money you
can go for the highest Android phone
maybe you can go for Nexus 6p now right
so we have all this mobile phones which
works on Android not just mobile phones
think about IOT now if you don't have an
int int stands for in Internet of Things
which simply means in future maybe not
in future in two to three years all the
devices at your home will be internet
enabled when I say all your devices I'm
talking about your Fletch I'm talking
about your AC I'm talking about your fan
and tube lines all will be connected
with the help of Internet
now what's the advantage all these
devices which are connected with
internet needs a OS right and that OS
will be and why why and when it because
it is free and open source
anyone can let's say if you are a
company you may cases you make french so
you can OS wide again you will not ask
Microsoft
give you that voice you will not ask
that many to give that OS what you can
do is you can just download the Android
source code customize it get devices
from Google and now you can have your
own oils for your fridge that's the
advantage right so you're creating a
Android ecosystem all together so
everything every device at your home we
will be internet enabled with Android OS
now once advantage for developers now as
we as the other person you can make
Android apps which will work on mobile
phones which will work on Android TV
which will work on Android ACS so just
imagine how many devices you have to
walk your own if you want app right
so that's Android for you so we have
talked about one so what Android is a
mobile worse it's an OS why we required
because we wanted some open source like
open source pores and way to implement
everywhere so that's an alert for you
