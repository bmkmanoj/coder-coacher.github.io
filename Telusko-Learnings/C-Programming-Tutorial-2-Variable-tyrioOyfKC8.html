next code and this will add two numbers
now we are going for very basic code
initially so that you know you you get a
what you say a hands-on on C programming
then we'll move towards the advanced
codes so let's start with addition of
two numbers now whenever you want to add
two numbers let's say I want to add two
and three so these are my two numbers
but before adding these two numbers we
need to save this number somewhere so
that once we save this number in your
code so that then we can just fetch the
value from the location and then we can
print it now to save this value we'll
keep it somewhere now it is where to put
so we can simply say I equal to two so
what is I here
it's a container which will have a value
two
same goes for three which will say J
equal to three so DJ is J here is a
container which will have a value which
is three now this container again we are
going for two different statements so we
have to provide a semicolon now this
container I will have a value 2 and this
container J will have a value 3
now this container is also called as
variable now why variable is because in
future you can change the value of I
from 2 to 5 so you can remove the value
2 and you can put a new value which is 5
so I is a container which can be which
can have different values and you can
change the values and that Y this this
container is called as variable ok so it
is variable it's a container in you in
which you can change the values now the
problem is every container or every
container will have a different value
right so some container will have a
value like two now let's say we have one
more container what may not be here well
let's say we have one more container
called as a and in a I am putting a
value which is a let's say a five point
five right now this five point five is
different from two right because in five
point five we have a point value and
into we don't have a point value so that
simply means every number will have a
different type of data
or every container will have a different
type of data and just to define which
type of data we have we need to declare
that variable now it is mean by
declaration whenever you create a
variable you should know the size of the
variable that means how what value you
can have in that variable so for this I
the type of value will be of integer
now when you say integer its it is from
negative range to positive range that of
data screenshot is called as int same
goes for j j is also int right but what
about a here now the value of a is real
real values where you have point values
so this real values in programming is
called as float okay so we can have
float a equal to 5.5 cool so this float
and this are called as this will define
the type of your variable or this will
define the type of your data and this Y
and then that's why we have this float
in they are called as data type
okay so these are data types and C
programming now since they are
predefined data types with it is also
called as primitive data type excuse me
so in variables of in C or variables can
be of different type it can be a float
int we can also use something called a
scale so let's say you want to store a
character which is let's say a Z W so to
store this characters we need to use
something called scan will say care
equal to the name of the variable which
is C and we can specify the variable
which is why as a value which is why but
whenever you have a character type of
value we need to enclose it to a single
character so if you have number of
characters we need to use double quotes
if you have a single character way to
your single goods simple now there's an
error here so there is no error for this
the error is for this arrow it simply
means this is not a part of a
programming it will
give you a syntax error now if you are
using our different IDE you might not be
getting the same error at the compile
are they editing time so I'm using our
advanced advanced IDE which is x squared
X Y I'm getting others at the runtime or
the what you say whether they adding
time so I don't want to I don't want
this line to be a part of my program so
we can exclude it from the code with the
help of two slash so if you write two
slash it will explode this code from the
X Liu this line from the code and this
two slash here is called as comment
which means this is not not a part of
your code simple we don't want to use
float now which we don't want to use
character we are only focusing on ain't
okay now to add these two values what we
can do is we can take one more variable
which is let's say K and this K will
have value which is two but we can have
two plus three all right so this K value
will have a new K will have a value
which is 2 plus 3 which is 5 right but
hold on we have a very we have I and J
right so why we need to use 2 n 3 we can
simply say I plus J so we'll be fetching
value of I will be fetching value of J
and we can assign that value by adding 2
K so I is 2 J is 3 and the addition will
be 5 since we want to print that instead
of printing hello world we'll remove
this and we'll print the value which is
K now will this work let's try let's try
to run this so if I run this code it
says Bill succeed and we got an error
now the problem is now the problem is
whenever you want to print a value of an
integer variable so your printf needs to
know the format of your output now when
you say the format we have to provide in
this format so going to say we are
printing a int value so we are printing
a into value but this is not the way you
have to specify we can simply use % D
which specifies I am trying to print or
Inc value simple
now from this it says build succeed and
you're getting output as five clear so
that's how you add two values and see
programming now let's say I don't want
to print in this format I don't want to
print only five I want to print the
addition of the addition is five for
that what we can simply do is we can say
the addition is and we can say five but
I don't I'm not sure it will give five
every time so I will again use pass and
D and this person D will be replaced by
K okay and if I done this you can see
the output as the addition is five cool
but you will say why to use person D
when you can simply type K here we
cannot work let's try if I print edition
is K and if I run this code the output
will be the addition is K we don't want
to we don't want K we want the value of
K that's why we need to use first and D
which will fetch the value of K simple
now I don't want to print in this format
I want to plant in a format like the
addition of two and three is five so we
can simply say direction of two and
three is five right and if I run this
code
you can see it says the addition of two
and three is five but what's the
guarantee the value of I will be always
two it may be four and now if we run
this it says the addition of two and
three is seven is it the case the value
of I is 4 right so this is a way to
change this to four now why we need to
change this value what if if I type I
and J know it will print edition of I
and J is 5 I don't want I enjoy what the
values of I and J so we can simply use
person D and person D
is person D but this person D is not K
this is I so I'm going to specify I
first this person D is not K this is
Jace I'm going to specify J here and
this person D is K right so it helps you
to print a particular format and that's
why print F stands for rent format okay
so we have a full form for printer which
is print format so the in print format
we always print a particular format
simple so that is your that that's all
about variables primitive data type and
then delve so thanks for watching and do
