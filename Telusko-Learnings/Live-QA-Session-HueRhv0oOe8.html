so it seems I'm life I need to check the
health
I don't know how much i invisible
I'm only half visible
17 people are watching so you can
comment your name at least I would know
so tech solution so 22 people are
watching that's great
okay so we got manish tech nap who is
technic
so we'll try to answer all your
questions guys 20 26 people are watching
my time if you have any questions you
can just come you know you can enter the
chat window I don't know how much I am
visible there
okay so
so technically sewage goten
sort of Gotham from Nepal ok
ok
so do boom
so finally I'm live using I mean at at
my home okay there's a big delay so i
got this question from amazing videos
amazing video was it watch your name by
the way to 29 people are watching just
let me just guess table with this views
and the feel okay so it's a yes it seems
everything is clear and visible okay so
i think i'm audie worldwide so i don't
need a headphones even if I have that's
okay okay so 23 people are watching and
I can start with the QA session ok so
first of all oh why today I mean after a
long time since you know I'm a corporate
trainer so so I i had a batch so i used
to be there by from 8am to 8pm because
it was a different type of training so
that's why that's why i was busy this
for this two months it's not three
months two months I was I guess I first
I've streamed my last video in July
first I guess and then it is September
now so two months okay so okay what else
ok ashido says your videos on Java is
our best Thank You ositos because of
this I get motivated for my all mice I
mean because of yoga because of these
comments because you like my videos that
that's how I get motivated i make more
videos I so thanks for that I hope I am
audible there let me know if I'm not
audible there
okay so I amazing video is raj sharma
okay so okay so question from okay so
himanshu say is glad to see after a long
time yes so let's go them from Nepal
welcome sewage so open to the Gotham so
algorithms are from Nepal that's great
and lately I'm finding that I'm getting
lots of views from Bangladesh Nepal
Pakistan so out of India and so
thankfully people are watching me from
an asian countries not just india that's
great okay so first question from okay
so amazing videos your name is yeah
Sarang welcome I was waiting for you
live so silent Gupta is mine he was my
intern for one month okay Suraj question
from Raj is how to be a good programmer
in fact i have uploaded to my video on
youtube how to be a programmer or how to
be a java programmer so let me reiterate
the same things so to give to be a good
program or what exactly see when you say
we want to be a good program so what
exactly it means to you what do you mean
by a good programmer so i would refer
this thing at this thing first of all
when you say you are a programmer that
means you are solving a real world
problem with the help of virtual world
technologies example let's say you know
when you want to let's say i want to go
somewhere i want to go to so currently
i'm in konjam mark mumbai so let's say I
want to move to the other or some other
location nearby let's say 20 30
kilometers I want to book a cab now so
when I want to book a cab right so I
have to go out I have to search for cab
and maybe there are not many many caps
available so there's a company who
provides cab service but I will call
then I will say okay this is my
locations are I stay in konjam ugh but
it's a very big area right I mean where
exactly I stayed so what exactly happens
is they don't know my location and I'm
not able to give them my location second
I don't know how much time it will take
to send their cause right the gap
service so have to wait for 20 minutes
of 25 minutes or demon it doesn't matter
how much I am waiting for I should know
how much I waiting for white maybe I can
wait for 30 minutes but I should know
that I have to wait for 30 minutes so
this company like uber what they did
they came up with a solution they said
okay what we'll what we'll do is we'll
make an app using which you can book a
cab service and you can specify your
location using GPS and you can actually
see how many uber cars are around you so
what we have what we did is we have
three why we have given a solution which
is real world solution right i mean real
we have given the solution for real were
using virtual technologies so to be a
programmer i feel you should first you
should know how to create those
solutions now again when you want to
create those solutions we require some
programming language right example if we
talk about uber apps for android of
course it is done with the help of java
programming right but if you make the
same app for iOS you have to use swift
programming if you want to use the same
app for Windows we have to do it using C
sharp so first of all you should able to
doesn't matter which technology or
working where the first thing you should
know is how to solve a given problem
that's what make a good programmer
second it is always beneficial if you
know Matt's people who are good with
mass from their childhood they are you
know they can be a good programmer
because program what is programming it's
all about Matt's right so because in
Matt's what we do we solve or give and
drop them in the same way in programming
also we solve a given problem right I'm
just checking if my voice is clear
nobody has commented about the boys so I
think it's perfectly fine
okay that's great ashutosh is a multiple
that's awesome aussie toes okay so to be
a good programmer make sure your you're
good with mats I mean bit of Matt's not
I'm not saying her to be exploited mats
but having the basic knowledge of Matt's
will help you next learn a particle
technology i'm a language maybe java
python c sharp or what helps Swift so do
the master in one language the advantage
is few if you learn one language if you
want to learn other language it is very
easy right so let's say if you're not
java it is very easy to learn other
languages other language like python c
sharp right or maybe a object you see so
if you know one language it is easy to
learn other language especially in India
we normally start with C language then
we learn CC I mean we learn C++ because
we know that if you know see learning
C++ is very easy if you don't c plus
plus we can we can learn java so you
have to go step by step so once you once
you know how to sort of to create the
solutions once you know the basic
programming now what else knowing coding
is not enough I mean knowing how to use
Java is not enough you should be able to
use some design patterns example when it
comes to Java we have to implement a
design pattern colors 00 ad which is
object oriented and analysis and design
right so working with design patterns
working with oops concept so it's not
just about writing code it's also about
following some design patterns right
then walking with frameworks right
example in Java itself we have different
frameworks wide example if you want to
create a web application you can use
starts framework let's say you want to
create an application for dependency
injection we can use spring framework
for database where you can we can use
hibernate so it all goes step-by-step so
if you're still in college make sure you
know at least one or two frameworks
because once you join a company they
will teach you the framework which they
use the advantage is if you know basic
some basic frameworks it will be very
easy for you to work for
at a new framework which is which your
company works on okay and lastly make
software you cannot learn programming by
learning I mean by reading or by
watching my videos you can learn
programming first watch my videos and
then also practice it because the more
you practice the more you learn because
there is a concept called as the more
classes you write your class will
increase right okay so what does I hope
that that's not there's nothing weird
here okay ah ok so this is a question
from son leash I want to make Android
application form for my first project I
have just learned basic java wait to
start please help me so first of all if
you want to make an app Android
application you should be clear with
Java concepts not complete Java but
learning I mean knowing about oops
concept knowing about interfaces because
Android provides lots of in build
interfaces and classes you should be app
we should know what is interface class
how to create object of how to
instantiate interface and all the stuff
so make sure you know basics of java in
fact threads exception handling all
those concepts now once you know the
basic concept of Java learn xml now once
you done with xml then you can start
working with Android I mean you can go
to my channel there is a android series
I don't have much videos on that but
basics are there so you can watch those
videos practice it and once you've got
the basics of Android you see no one no
one expects you to make an application
without I mean after knowing everything
it's not like if you want to make
another application that means you
should know Android start to and it's
not it doesn't work that way first of
all you have to learn the basics of it
then start working on the app because as
soon as you start walking on it you will
get to know lots of concepts right so do
that start working on your app directly
ok
oh ok next question from again technip
can you please make je suis tutorials I
was thinking about JSP from a long time
but unfortunately i'm not getting time
for that so i will try for sure ok hindu
kumar adam from bangalore
so what are the basic parameters to be a
good programmer and what are the key
areas to work on this question is from
dinesh again the basic parameters is you
should know at least one language
perfectly and when I say perfectly it
means if I ask you any question about
that if I ask you about the concept if I
ask you about how to do this we should
be able to do that that's first
parameter second parameter is okay
that's a good question second parameter
you should be able to solve any problem
in fact there are there are websites of
competitive programming website where
you can compete right there is a hacker
rank hacker earth so make sure you go
there and compete with those people that
will improve your programming skills
okay then cuz your question is how old
are you okay so you can guess my age you
can guess my age I'm not that old this
thing here this is the experience I got
this is heredity and say so basically I
am 27 years old so I'm 18 98 1989 born
so yeah 37
what else what else what else what else
okay I guess there were lots of
questions I'm missing some questions
here okay so question from okay this
isn't Bengali I guess what is the best
book for learning SQL for android for
android we we don't use normal SQL we
use SQL light okay I don't know if I
have that book today only I got just
open lots of books from my ball okay I
guess this one I know in this do you
have sqlite let me verify I do have an
Android book to 300 books yes so this is
this is the book I know if it is visible
so if you refer this book this is hello
android it's very simple to learn and in
this we do have sqlite concepts so that
space number 153 we have SQL SQL Lite
concepts so we don't use normal SQL we
use SQLite because sqlite is lightweight
so you can refer that by no way I am
premiering this book okay they are not
paying me for this it's just that I got
these books from somewhere yeah so it
provides you the concept of SQLite SQL
that is no different from SQL it is
almost same but it has some less
features that's it so you can refer this
book hello android if you want Oh what
next
can you please upload spring security
okay even I don't know spring security
of the hike when i upload spring
security but once i learn about spring
security i will do that currently i am
focusing on hadoop okay so i started
learning Hadoop's i mean it's been two
days now i know the basics of head you
now i want to go into into the
programming level of it so soon i will
be uploading videos on hadoop maybe one
month after one month so once i know
things will work on it and then we'll
upload upload videos on that that's
great notice you have learned lots of
things for my videos that's great so
Sarang welcome back what is the
internship starting again internship
after 10 years now okay
in the fall at a concept in Java you can
actually go to my channel there is a
video on array specifically for a day
right in fact not just one video I guess
we have three videos and idle on a day
so go to my channel and search for air
is so long yes I do remember you so
money is what I choose Java or Python
since depend upon you what you want what
you want to choose you can go for java
or you can go for the Python that's your
wish it's just that I prefer Java a lot
because there are lots of platform where
you can I mean if you learn Java there
are lots of options you have right so
all new programmers they prefer Python
because it is it is easy to learn they
hate Java because difficult to learn but
once you learn java everything's I mean
all the other language seems easy for
you so if you ask me which one to choose
I will of course I will go for java
ok so in there how to request or mineral
how to receive an int array in main
method returns from other method so
basically jvm calls main droid we don't
call me only JVM call main and whenever
you pass parameters using JVM it always
goes into string format ok so it always
goes as a string format that means even
if you pass numbers it is going in
string format so you cannot pass int
array to the main method from other
method ok but you can pass those those
parameters as VM arguments but those
will again be treated as a string
arguments so then just says thank you
for all your job videos welcome Dinesh
ok asutosh again for the for the
technical things go to my channel in
fact I have lots of videos on that you
can therefore that
okay so there's a question from Sarang
where do well so we start the
programming from when when you have
learned all the tools and languages see
once you have once you know the tools
once you know the language i would
suggest directly start with something it
doesn't matter what you want to make
certain i guess we had up we had a call
on this okay so forth others who for if
it don't know soldering was my student
in the classroom we went to different
places together I mean within a group so
in fact we had a talk about it about
this thing so Sarang again the same
thing start with something some small
thing and implementing implemented you
will get the confidence so that you can
expand it so i would suggest make your
own application right maybe you're on
your own facebook maybe your own wats
app for Android you can try it try it
further doubt okay Ken player what you
use to program i used laptop to program
okay so i use java i use eclipse to
eclipse as an ide to type my codes so
the pseudocode say is thank you for all
your videos okay so himanshu there's a
question from you I'm himanshu have
completed my android app but stuck
because I'm not able to get a developer
license because Google is not accepting
$25 oh okay so you're not able to pay to
Google first of all when you want to pay
to Google again to to upload your
Android are the four other people if you
don't know this to upload your Android
app I mean if you have created an
Android app if you want to upload that
app on Play Store first of all you need
a developer account on google and for
developer account you have to pay $25
again it's a one-time investment so you
don't have to pay multiple times so you
have to pay $25 which comes out to be
1500 rupees are around
but the thing is when you want to bait
you have to use the great credit card
credit card okay you cannot use net
banking or debit card so it is composite
to use credit card there and if you have
quite weary it doesn't matter which bank
at it car do you have what matters for
it called oh so there's a question from
the oven how to crack product based
company introduced it is very easy
repair right so you have to see I don't
I don't I don't recommend I mean I don't
prefer to prepare for the interviews I
prefer to work on your skills so that
you can answer any question I mean I
personally never cliff never prepare
myself for the interviews let's say if I
want to do I want to give interview for
java of course I should be knowing
everything about Java then only I can go
for it right so I don't believe in this
concept of preparing for the interviews
you have to prepare the whole topic
example if you want to go for a job in
maybe when you come Microsoft we should
I mean I would ask you to learn C sharp
in depth so if they ask any question is
should be able to answer it right next
question
oh how Java helps and good okay there's
a question for mr. Rana how Java helps
in android application development the
thing is Android if you want to make
another application it is done with the
help of Java ok so if you don't know
George is very difficult to work with
Android ashutosh say is I want to
perceive my career in C language ok so
and I'm getting there sorry but demand
for java is more so please help me in
this other thing is there not a lot of
places where we use C programming when
you talk about internet when you talk
about cloud we use Java there but let's
say if you want to make robotic
applications the vortex embedded systems
like a C's fridge of course we have to
go with C programming there so to make
your career in c programming i would
suggest you to go with embedded
programming in c ok
next next next Oh
okay next question how is this club so
again the question from Gotham how is
this scope of JavaScript okay that's
good one scope of JavaScript okay I'm
not a big fan of JavaScript it's just
that there's a time when I mean there is
a time where the only language I mean
the only use of JavaScript was to create
a client-side application example HTML
is used to design of a page CSS is to
use used to make your design more
effective javascript is used to make
your page interactive right example for
validations for changing images on your
webpage so we use javascript there so
initially javascript was only there for
client-side but later you now you can
use Java for everything so there's a day
something else mean stack em e a and
it's m.e a and which is M is MongoDB e
is Express j/s a is angularjs and n is
node.js using means that you can create
the complete website using javascript
you don't need server-side programming
for that so using javascript you can
create servers using node.js you can use
JavaScript for database also which is
MongoDB right so it's a huge go for
JavaScript now so biswajit Oh after a
long time live streaming now it's a
cramp sync time please give some advice
okay so it's time for your campus
introduce that's great I would suggest
you to refresh your skills blonde one
language pathology which is java of
course because maximum time interview an
interview that they ask you questions on
Joe I itself so learn java
okay so uh since I've started streaming
you can if you can do me a favor you can
just share they share this scrim pastime
in the streaming link with your friends
on Facebook so that my lots of people
can watch me currently there are 50
people watching me 48 now so you can
just share this link with your friends
on Facebook so prepare prepare Java
prepared OS concept which is operating
system because they ask you questions
that also in fact data structures heap
memory stack many different algorithms
right
okay there's a question from Cathy if a
person is really good at programming can
he get or this of course right so if you
are good at programming you will get a
decent job the thing is in India
especially if you're if you don't have
good marks I mean people don't prefer to
hire you but there are certain companies
they only check your skill set if you
are good with something they will hire
you so once you join a small company and
I mean the small company means startups
on something that way because they
prefer smart people not marks but skill
set so once once you get into that
company if you work for two years there
once you have the puget experience you
can jump into big companies so yes
there's a good scope if you're a good
programmer
ok
next next next
I lost all the questions I'm getting so
much of questions I am no it's going up
and down now I think I could I should go
for any type of question
but oh
ok
okay just to let you know that in june i
guess i have taken the first batch i'm
in the paid paid course i mean there are
lots of questions why in fact from from
5th September which is monday i'm
starting a new batch or I mean the
online course so it would be in the
evening I guess in from 10-10 p.m. to
1130pm the same timing so if you want
you can join the batch
okay so there's a question from Geeta
can you explain about spain 2-0 in agile
so people for the people who don't know
this agile is so agile is it's a
software development methodology so like
we have waterfall so in that way we have
we also have agile so in a jar will be
normally work in sprint because what
happens is in waterfall we take the
requirements we design the application
we coded with tested we deploy it right
so sometimes some application takes
around maybe one month one year two
years so let's imagine if you are if you
are taking money from your client every
month and you're doing if you're
delivering the software after two years
your client is not certain right i mean
if you get getting the right software
which you are making so what what we do
in agile is we deploy I mean after every
two to four weeks we we give a small
product example if I want to make a big
application will create a small part of
it and we'll give it to decline to
second time will give second part and
give it to decline so each cycle is for
us one sprint so we have sprint one
string to splain three and normally each
sprint goes from two to four weeks so
sprint zero is a place where you can
plan example let's say to get up if you
go to client and you want to discuss
with your client what you want to do I
mean there's a software requirement you
can plan right in in in which sprint you
will be delivering which features so in
sprint one you will be delivering this
part in spring two will be delivering
this plant so all those things in which
sprint will be doing watch stuff will be
done in sprint zero so not every company
follows plane 0 because agile is just a
concept so everyone has their own way of
implementation it right so in spain 0
with those we do those stuff it is vbr
bid we create release plan then we
create what a serious plan is there then
we rethink how many how many sprint we
need for that maybe you can complete the
whole project in five
Prince explained and the size of each
sprint maybe two weeks or four weeks
right so we do all the stuff and explain
zero in agile okay so the question from
what do we can we have videos on sports
I guess I have one video in stores so
you can just go to my channel and search
for stores video wiki a big thing for
all the videos great record the profit
okay so get down what is a proof of
concept in project so basically we
talked about the requirements you know
when you let me just get the definition
of it first so basically whenever you
create to any application for the client
a client will give you this
let me just check
I'm searching for the proper answer I
just don't want to miss guide you
okay I'm not getting up top answer here
but we'll come back to that let me just
have a look on that and they will come
back with that ok so next is
wiki where do you work currently so
basically wiki I'm a consultant a
freelancer Java trainer so I don't work
anywhere so whenever so it says since
I'm a freelancer depend upon the company
i joined different companies so i have
have trained accenture people polaris
the last batch was in JP Morgan so
that's how it goes so I'll be large
there's a question for mobile on what
are different between JVM and DVM so
when you talk about jbm so if you if you
if you write any java code and if you
want to compile it or if you want to run
this you need JVM because jbm will act
as a virtual machine for your java code
but the problem is if we talk about a
mobile a small mobile phone in that
mobile phone if you install JVM it will
die right so what we do we we have a
specialized deep virtual machine which
is DVM which is dalvik virtual machine
which is a lightweight vm which can be
installed and on the small hardware or
mobile hardware so DVM is a virtual
machine for android because since
android works on java so we use the
android flavored of java on dbm so for
mobile applications we use I mean for
Android be used evm for laptops for
windows macintosh linux we use JVM so
amazing videos question java pod or iOS
developer depends so if you have a
macbook if you have an iphone of course
go for iOS because to learn iOS you need
a macbook you need a you need iphone to
test it so if you have the resources of
course you have to go for iOS right
so you're teaching techniques very
excellent a great great sure if all you
have shared my videos with your friends
that's awesome
oh so there's a question from alex from
chennai so from where do did you learn
the basics okay so I learned everything
from youtube so from I went to different
channels on youtube so when I was
learning java five years back so i went
a different channel on youtube i learned
java from there I learned something from
books I learned something from articles
I learned something from working on
project because when you get errors you
learn lots of different things right
that's how I learned java so if you want
to learn java you can do the same stuff
you can watch my videos then after that
you can refer books after that you can
what else what okay let's go to you can
work on project and slowly you will
learn lots of stuff
ok
I guess I have to skip some questions
now
so know when you have something online
live so there will be some asshole I
know disturbing the whole chat and this
time it is us schwadron so you're done
you're locked okay
okay far more minutes again since i'm
getting a Godfrey now I mean I have just
have some time we can have multiple we
can have multiple chat I'm in this live
session if I have skipped some questions
you can just you can ask the same
question in the next next live session
I'm feeling am feeling very sleepy now
okay so the last two questions what is
the difference between public okay by
the time you can just like this video if
you liked it so yeah so what is the
difference between public and default
access modifier so public is let's say
if you if you use up if you use a class
and if you make that classes public that
means you can use that class outside the
package but if you are making up class
which is not public which is default you
cannot access that class outside the
package does the main difference so why
you choose Java ok that's a good
question why i choose java from
childhood in fact from when I was in my
school I used to love maths because
everyone hated maps so all my friends
that you should love history there you
should love signs and they used to hate
maps so I thought okay everyone hate
matt so let's let me just learn max then
later when I when I entered into my
college junior college I was in science
so everyone hated physics right so since
everyone hated physics I learned physics
then and in my bachelors of engineer I
mean The Bachelor of when I was doing
bcit everyone hated programming so I
started learning programming just to you
know I believe in this concept if go
there where people are people are not
there if people there are people who
will be hitting hitting something do
that okay there are lots of these are
lots of lot of scope so we're not doing
my BSC IT people used to hate Java so I
thought okay let's let's start with Java
and that's what I'm doing now everyone
hated teaching so I joined I now i'm a
teacher everyone hated I mean no one
likes to be a teacher right so that's
why that's why I'm teacher I do
something different which people are not
doing that's one reason why I'm doing
why I loved
our second Java is everywhere right
starting from mobile application desktop
application two servos everywhere you
have Java that's why Java and that's it
remaining question we'll see in the in
the next session so by the time do share
my videos and just a funny sensation if
you want to learn Java you can you can
go to my channel and search for the
playlist or I mean the problem with
learning from videos is there's
something as consistency right when you
say consistency it means let's say if
you're watching my videos and you've got
bored so you will switch the if you will
switch to other videos right so so you
need discipline so for that I'm starting
the I'm shutting the online sessions
again it will be paid one the thing is
you can join the online session so you
can attend the sessions there will be
fee the fee for that you can go to my
website and there you can just enjoy
yourself i will send you a mail in which
i will specify the curriculum and the
fees you can pay the fees there and you
can enjoy the course it's starting from
monday that's it so when i will try to
make more videos on java ok abhilash let
me answer your question what is your
aunt's question can a guy from software
testing move to development yes you can
do that so normally there are companies
who are looking for java developer so
let's say you are working for a company
I mean you are doing testing there and
the same company need Java people or
development people so learn programming
make your own demo apps and talk to your
manager talk to people in the other
teams they will surely let you work on
development projects
that's it see you tomorrow or in the
next life session that's it
signing off good night
so remaining questions in the next
session</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
