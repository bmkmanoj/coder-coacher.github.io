different technical earnings and in this
video we'll talk about recursion now if
you have learned any language before
maybe C C++ or Java you must have seen
upon surprise recursion there now if you
don't know the question it's very simple
education simply means if you have a
function called as show and if this
function calls itself enough for what
reason but if this function calls it so
this is the question okay again you can
print some statement here example if I
say print Ln and if I plain some
statement let's say hello and then if I
call this function show from your main
of course this is the question right
because we are calling show and then
show calls itself the moment you run
this code it will go into infinite loop
as you can see it is running okay you
can see we got Stack Overflow first of
all because it is crossing the limit and
if you can see if I if I run this
multiple times
we got hello hello hello so the function
is calling itself this recursion and at
the end we are also getting exception
here but you have at you might be
thinking this is wrong this is a real
concept riod may be a bad concept
because we are getting exception at the
end but then if you use it properly it's
actually a very awesome concept now just
to explain this concept we will go for a
simple example and that example is
factorial in fact if you have for any
book or any online material they all
teach you recursion with the same
concepts maybe Fibonacci series may be
factorial maybe some other concept so
here
what this will be saying how to use how
to do factorial using recursion but
before that let's try to understand the
true power of it so what will we do we
will be doing here is where we doing
factorial with a normal logic which the
way we do and then later we'll try to
see because the question now when I say
I want to find I want to check if a
given number how to find a factorial
first of all so let's say if I say we
have a number which is where num is
equal to five and if you want to find a
factorial F of Phi you should do 5 into
4 into 3 into 2 into 1 or you can do 1
into 2 into 3 into 2 or 4 into 5 right
so either way you will get the same
output so here what I will use a for
loop and then I will say we have a
variable I which will be coming from 1
dot dot num so it will deform this range
from 1 to num and every time you do this
let
take one more variable which which will
hold the result I will say fact equal to
the initial value of fact would be one
of course right because you cannot say
zero because every time you multiply you
will get zero at the end so we have to
say fact equal to fact into I right so
at the end what you will get is 120 if I
print fact here that's how you find
factorials right again I'm assuming that
you know how to use for loop how to you
how to find a factorial number so we are
not here to learn factorial right we are
here to learn about how to you how to
find a factorial using loop first and if
you run this code okay we're waiting for
the input yeah so we can see we got the
output as 120 here so in the output
window we got 120 if you change this
number example if I say 7 you will get
of a number I know what is what is the
factoid of 7 it should be somewhere as
you know so okay so you can see we got
the output as 5 0 4 0 again you can
transmit this is the right answer
so the factorial of 7 is 5 0 4 0 that is
normal for this is normal for loop right
how do you do this using recursion so
what you can do is again there is one
more reason why we are looking at this
concept again if you have seen the
entire series everywhere we are talking
about difference between Java and
Cortland how can you do something in
Cortland and Here I am teaching your
recursion from start because if the next
topic will be talking about tails
recursion which is new to Java which is
new to Kotlin and I just want you to be
sure that you know the question at the
first place right so the converting the
same example is in tail recursion so
this call this video is actually very
important for you ok so how do you how
do you find a factorial using recursion
so what do I do here is I will define a
function and I will name this function
as fact itself now this function will be
taking a parameter and I will say this
function takes a parameter num which
will be of type int and it will return a
int value at the end so once once you
void the calculation it will return int
and so instead of doing all these things
what we'll be doing is we'll be saying
hey I want to find a factorial of num
that's it
so this println will say I want a
factorial of this number num that's it
nothing else now from this fact you have
to do the entire calculation
here now how do you do that so what we
have to do is now everyone knows that
the factorial of zero and the factorial
of 1 is 1 so here what we can do is we
can say if we can say if if my num equal
to equal to zero right
if this is an REO you will simply return
one so we'll set it on one right so we
got the factorial so when so let's say
if you got this value as a zero I know
the value is 7 but then let's say we
have to make sure if the value 0 will
return 1 otherwise if the value is not 0
what we were doing is we will be calling
the function itself now how do we do
that it's very simple just call the fact
itself right and okay so we'll be going
to fact itself and we'll be multiplying
that with num so we send num into fact
and we'll say num minus 1 so what it
will be doing is let's say if you okay I
forgot to write a written statement
there so it done so it's a return or num
into effect na minus 1 now what will
happen when you pass 7 here that 7 goes
here right and then we'll do 7 into 6
factorial right because that's what
that's what we do so when you say 7 we
say we say 7 into 6 factorial what is 6
factorial is 6 into 5 factorial which is
5 factorial is 5 into 4 factorial what
is 4 factorial then this goes on right
at the end you will get 0 which will
return 1 I think your job is done here
just just to make sure I will use the
number which is 5 just to have a smaller
number there and the moment you run this
code I am expecting 120 yeah can you see
that we got 120 this time we are not
going to enough although we are going
for a factor we are going for the
question so what you are doing here is
we are finding a factorial by calling
itself so if I like to comment here what
we are doing here is if I if I send a
value 5 so this line is actually
evaluating 5 into 4 factorial now now
for this fact we'll call it self again
so it will do 4 into 3 factorial and the
list goes on at the end you will get 1
and then everything will sum up to give
you the value
right and the moment on this code you
can see we are getting 120 right
everything everything looks good right
so we are getting 120 but let's say if I
have a bigger value now let's say if I
have a bigger value which is maybe 1,000
and then if we run this code and here we
go
interesting guys we got zero I mean why
we are getting zero here why not we are
getting the exact answer maybe we can go
till only 70 let's try with 70 here
let's see what happens and if you run
this code you can see we are still
getting zero now what is happening here
is when you say factorial of 70 it's
actually a very big number you can't you
can't even count that number on your
fingers so it's actually very it's
actually a very big number so in this
scenario when you have a very big number
like this you cannot not normally work
with inch right so just to understand
this better we will convert this into a
big integer because big integers are
class in Java which supports big a
bigger number right so we'll try to
implement this with bigger big integer
first and then we'll go towards tail
recursion because that will make more
sense than so how to do big big integer
that will see into I mean it will
convert this example into big integer
how to do that we'll see in the next
