use Android studio so once we have done
all the installation we'll try to open
Android studio now so let's open your
under studio so once you open Android
studio it will take some time to load
and you can see it is powered by
IntelliJ which is a product of jetbrains
so this is the this is the window you
will be seeing once you open Android
studio since I have walked on understood
your large so I have all these
applications here if you are doing it
for the first time you will not be
having any recent projects so what you
have to do is you have to create our new
project ok so just click on this new
project here you have to provide a
application name here since this will be
our first code what we'll do is we'll
name this as my first Android or my
first app ok so that's our app name here
are we to also provide a package name so
basically when you provide our domain
name here so let's say whenever you make
a project in Android and if you want to
deploy that app on Play Store so what we
need the S will require a package name a
you call you require a unique package
name for your project so it is basically
a package it's a folder where you'll
have all your files now how to make sure
that you have a unique package
throughout the world so make sure you
have your package name which is livers
of your domain name so if your domain
name is the risk or calm okay which is
my domain name so your package name will
become dr. disco so it's a mirror of
your domain name now once you do that
let's click on the next button and now
what we'll do is here you have to
mention now your so it will ask you for
the app you want to walk on so maybe you
want to make an app for phone or tablet
or you want to make an app for Android
wear which is Android watch or you can
make it for TV Android auto which is a
Ford car and then maybe for glass for
this we'll be making phone right and
there are lots of versions for Android
so we have it's all starts with 1.1 so
1.0 1.1 then we have cupcake donut a
class
so currently we are working with a OS
which is Android marshmallow right which
is latest version so if you make an app
for marshmallow so you can say we are
mentioning here as minimum SDK which
means if you are making an alpha
marshmallow it will only work on
marshmallow it's because marshmallow
provides you many features and if you
are making an app using those features
which is not that in lollipop which is
not dead in KitKat so your app will not
work on the lower levels so you can see
it says a targeting API 23 which is
marshmallow and there are approximately
1.3 percent devices which works on
marshmallow so if you're making an app
for Android using on marshmallow it will
only work on marshmallow which is only
approximately maybe 10 million devices
so what you should be doing is instead
of working on marshmallow select a API
level like jellybean which provides 94
percent or maybe yeah we can we can
select any one in my machine I am using
I have installed the SDK for 4.1 I will
be going for 4.1 here so now my app will
work on 94% of the mobile devices so
that's okay for me then click on next
now it will ask you for different
activities so if you have the multiple
choice here you have you can have a
blank activity you can have empty
activity you can have full screen
activity you can also create an app for
google maps by yourself or maybe a login
activity now since this is this will be
your first application what we will do
is we'll select empty activity so you
can see an empty and then blank activity
there is one difference or there's a
floating button here and a settings
which is not there in empty activity it
is preferable to have your own coding
there so we'll choose an empty activity
here and then we click on next right and
ask you for two names the first one will
be the Java file name because see what
is Android is basically the design of
your Android form or frame will be done
with the help of XML and the working of
your Android will be done by Java files
so this is the name of your first job
file and this is the this is the name of
your activity which is the XML file now
if you uncheck this you will only get
Java file you will not get the layout
which is the design so we'll check this
part and you will also get the XML file
since we want both and we'll click on
finish now once you click on finish it
will ok it will take some time so it's
taking time so if you know about if you
don't know about Gradle so it is gradual
here it's a build tool so whenever you
build up project so you require some
things like libraries structure so there
are two ways you can take this structure
one way is using mavin and second is
good Idol so if you're a Java developer
you might be knowing about mavin so
Griffey is almost same as mavin with
different types of syntax but it's
almost same Android uses Gradle if you
make a web project you might be using a
maven at that time so now when you open
Android studio so let me just close this
two windows so this this is how your
Android studio looks like so the version
I am working with is the version 1.5 I
say I'm using one point five point one
Android studio and now so this is the
project you have which is called as app
here and if I expand this so basically
you have three folders what is manifest
folder then we have Java folder and then
we have re es folder if I open manifest
and you can see we have
androidmanifest.xml now what this file
is so whenever let's say you are
building a project in your project will
be having multiple files right every
file or every screen you have is will be
called as activity so the we have the
first activity here that's how you
create activity again we're going to go
into deeper in this later not now so let
me just close this and let's focus on
this too so this is your are the es
folder in which you have multiple
folders now let's focus only on layout
in layout you can design your webpages
are you so you're not web pages but the
Android screens and in this you have you
will be having different different XML
so for one frame will be
one XML and if I open Activity main so
you can see we got two options here so
you can design your app using GUI or
drag-and-drop feature or you can design
your app using text so if you click on
text you can just change your design
here which will reflect on this screen
and it's very it's damn what you say
response if you would make any changes
in XML it will directly reflect on the
design and yeah so let's say you want to
you want a text field so you can just
take this text field here which text
will yeah so we have a text way which is
plain text and then Jek you can drag
from this this to your page okay so that
simple okay so that's how you drag it
right now what next we have so we have
yeah so this is the properties so if you
for anything you have here you can set
the properties again we'll do that in
the next video how to set all these
things and if you run this app you you
can see the output in two ways either
you can see the output on mobile phone
or you can see the output in the
emulator of course right when you design
a page or when you work on an android
app you want to test it right so either
you will be using mobile phone to test
it or you can test it on emulator now
how to start an emulator so before that
like this is your web page this is your
design okay using this you can design
everything and this is the code page
which is if you go to java then we have
main activity so this is your java code
page if you want to perform any actions
so java will help you here so will not
make any changes anyway we have a hello
world here and if we run this code it
will take some time so okay so you can
see if you if you are connected your
android phone with your machine it will
give you option choose running devices
which you will see our bulk phone here
otherwise you can choose launch emulator
by default if you don't have any
emulator here on any device here what
you can do is you can go you can click
on these three dots I already have two
devices here if
don't have you can click on create
virtual device and you will see lots of
options here we can select Nexus 5 1 X
is 5x and then click on next then you
can choose which OS you want to work
with or with the AIB time in which not
focus on that let's click on lollipop
and then click on next here they will
ask you in which orientation you want to
walk maybe a portrait or landscape you
will select portrait and you can
increase the amount of RAM or CPU want
to assign you can select Ram up since i
have 8gb ram in my machine i can
allocate more ram to it and yeah that's
it that's how that's all the settings
you need don't change anything just keep
it default and click on finish it will
give you that emulator here ok now let
me just close this all close this and we
select the launch emulator i will select
5x which is configured in our machine ok
and then i click on ok it will take some
time for the for loading of emulator you
can by the time there are certain
sections here so we have terminal on the
command prompt or not the command room
but in under studio then we have android
monitor so you can monitor all your
activities which is done in your
emulator on your in your phone
so since is initializing it will take
some time
you can also see this running command so
this is very important when you work
with android we have to work with a haxm
to work with your emulators ok so you
can see it's taking some time so what i
will do just pause the video ok for some
time and then once it is open i will
show you the output
I can see my app is my emerges on and
then my app is loading and we got hello
Boyd here so this is how your emulator
looks like so this is your emulator now
you got a nexus 5x even if we don't have
a physical phone you have a virtual
phone here right so this is your nexus
5x and this is how you have to run the
file now in the next video we'll do some
editing on the code and we'll see the
output in the emulator so yeah that's it
from this video so make sure you
subscribe the channel and thank you so
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
