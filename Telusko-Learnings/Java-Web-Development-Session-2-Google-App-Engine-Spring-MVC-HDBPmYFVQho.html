this later they can table have a
recording now so let me just talk about
what we have done till now we have so I
have just created this feedback page
quiz by George ASP and the design is
permitted by one of our member or one of
the contributor in the group and this is
the page which we which they have
created and the page looks something
like this
now this page the page looks something
like this where you have a page like
form where you can enter all those
details when you click on the submit
button it will call add feedback so as
getting this page and I have fished I
have written all this code in feedback
Daisy page now how do we call a provider
database in the index controller
whenever you request for feedback a list
or HTM you will get feedback or JSP and
this is the awesome thing you know as a
normal user you will see sweetback's dot
HTM at the end but actually what is
going on the back end is dot JSP this is
what we have done and then we have also
added one more thing which is add
feedback here so you can see we have
added add feedback here of the method
this is the method which will actually
take the request if you if you click on
submit by entering the feedback this is
the place where you will variable it
will accept all the all the values so
user you can accept that with the help
of request pattern okay so using this
program you get name you will get emails
so the crisp Aram is used to press the
data from the client machine and then we
are adding Dania database so we can do
that with the help of Galileo so all
your database code can be left can be
returned in this in this class I mean we
are planning to use hibernate but then
let's see how it goes nothing can for
more about - Adrienne so but let's see
we started we'll start with JDBC and
then if you think you know that's the
advantage of using a doubt layer in
futures even if you want to implement
hyper night you don't have to change
lots of code you just have to change
your dowel you okay now this is the
point so we've got a point for Vista has
what if you get multiple requests
because every request will have a
different data right and in total if you
have only one object then how can we use
multiple different data the object of F
now is only one but then
the values for every object of feedback
object and the devices are different
right so this value will be stored
anywhere so okay so let's go ahead and
let's try database code so we'll be out
of a database code inside feedback
router H dot Java so this is your
feedback down here which is this one so
feedback now in at our package okay so
how do you how do you send all this
values how do you spend all this values
inside feedback Dao so there is one way
you can pass all the values like this
you can say comma name comma email comma
you can pass all the variables or the
best way would be to create objects I'm
going to put first of all to get a plus
and we'll leave this planet as entity
classes so we'll get a class here and
the class name would say we say feedback
oh I have forward to change the package
so I want this in a package name which
is package calm dot telesco dot dusk dot
entity so have to make sure that you put
all your classes in entity package okay
so let's move that here
so what do we do here is I will treat so
in this feedback I want those variables
I will say private basically we want to
be we want to make obtain so this is
private string name will say private
strength email will say private strings
regarding is it here is it regarding and
private string you know I'm thinking
sometimes next time I will already make
some codes and we'll see the codes in
the life stage of diversity taking like
lots of time to type everything is a
live session and for this we need get
the dose will so right like those Gators
and settles select all okay so we got
get us a toad and all I also need a
constructor here in case if I want to
pass all the values in a constructor so
I will right click and will say so okay
so constructor with all these fields
click on OK and you bought the
constructor as well okay so we got a
constructor here so gone greater Saito's
record a constructor now what next
so we'll go back here and ok now so we
got the feedback class I want to create
opposite of feedback class here again we
can use okay so we can use the Kincaid
object of feedback so I would say
feedback let's say speed bags but we
just have one issue here again we have
we should be using okay we have to input
the package first so say control space
regard feedback okay so we should be
using antedate component so if I say
added component there is one issue for
every four different people we have
different to be a different feedback
object right but then how can I use it
here okay so what I will do is I will
change the scope of this okay how do you
change how do you change the scope of a
component
okay so we have to use a scope and we'll
mention this cope as roadside now the
advantage of using power-type is it will
create a different object for different
for different requests we don't want
only one object for for feedback right
so every person will have a different
feedback so I will just make a prototype
and here also will be using a trait
oversee simple everyone okay so now what
we'll do here is let's create the object
of feedback and I will say oh we got an
object noise and I want to apply this
values so I will say feedback oh I
should be using constructor here why
because okay let's let's not do it over
here but you will create the object by
ourselves because I want to achieve okay
let's not use that sweet right there so
we create a new object because I want to
pass all this object I want to pass all
these values for myself so the name
comma email comma registration comma and
then we require a code and rating so
it's a code and reading so we got the
feedback object here right and that
feedback object will send in add
feedback so what about it I am getting
from the user will print will send back
here and the same feedback we have to
accept in this so I will say feedback FB
or that's not Facebook by touch feedback
the control space okay now just to
verify if I am getting the proper
feedback make sure the business in
feedback
I was also strange FB but then this will
print the hash foot-wide I don't know I
don't want hash but I want to print I
want to print the data so now I also do
is I was implemented push limiter so
that I will get it eita not the hash
code so right click here and we'll say
to shrinks those two strings and will
select all the values click on ok so we
got a two string method now and
everything should everything should work
now I'm printing that object here let's
restart the server okay so let me just
enter value Co I would say Naveen and I
will use energy as whatever which is
available here and then the this is for
the online code no code available or let
me just also mention the code I will say
one zero four and then and then let's
message that the message the converse
and click on submit okay so again you
will get you will not get the page there
but you can see in the feedback I am
getting all the details right this is
what we wanted so we watch all this data
in the feedbacks ow now this is the time
to state this data in the database again
we can use hibernate here but time it
will not use hibernate or we got one
more suggestion in store instead of
using all this thing we can also use we
just comment which part we can also use
what attribute expert is saying right so
I will use public string and feedback so
there is one more way which is dead in
spring MVC which is called as model
attribute okay what attribute then we
have to use feedback does it work here
so you think it will work directly just
run against motor attribute works with
spring form or asteroid let's try let's
say enter and you got an error
Oh for this we have to provide a default
constructor so we also need a Jaipur
character here
let's seek feedback and use unless user
default constructor come on so we start
is happening there automatically so we
started let us do that once again and I
just work that does work so we can also
use motorized tribute so the advantage
of using model attribute is you don't
have to write all this detail you can
write it in one line so you can simply
use multi attribute whatever whatever
data it is coming from the request it
will be assigned to feedback directly it
is that awesome okay now we can also
mention the name here so that we can
please we can use it later as well so we
can mention feedback so that we can use
it later in the module scope
intersession scope just try which is
working let's say enter it does work
again opened so we got a feedback and
now it's time to store this on database
and to store this in a database whatever
I do is I will use the database code but
then okay so what I want now I want you
people to complete this school and send
me the code using user using JDBC
I mean completed code and save the data
into database that will be assignment ok
and that is that is very easy right you
can watch my video on YouTube how to
save that in a database what I want to
do now is now this is the code is very
simple right you can write it out
database code here and you can store
that data in database now
why I am not completing the code because
I want to do some important thing which
is more which is more important than
completing JDBC code the important thing
is what if you complete this modules
because once we module is complete which
we'll be doing which will be done by
tomorrow of course where do we deploy
this very deposit so as we have planned
that we'll be deploying this on Google
App Engine but then we have not seen how
to how to install Google Apps and how to
work with Google App Engine right so
what I do is this now let us talk about
how to deploy this application on Google
App Engine so we know how to complete
this code and now you also know how to
do this right everyone okay so now let's
see how to create a Google App Engine
account
so we'll create a Google App Engine
account with my bit by a melody which we
are using for this for the amenity which
we are using this is a disco lies
project so I will open my chrome here
alright so I will open my chrome and in
this probe I will say let me use Firefox
because I already have so many accounts
on Chrome
I will go to Google office Google's
website in Google App Engine so just go
to Google and search for Google App
Engine if you want to use Google app
here and ok go to Google App Engine so
you got a partial terms shape how how
Springwood differs from spring MVC
making springboard project is actually
very easy you don't have to go so far
figuration okay so of its I already have
my account here I will just change it to
that it's a live project so many one you
want to go to okay so if you want to
create a Google App Engine account just
go to Google search for Google App
Engine on browser and it will take you
to the Google cloud platform okay and it
will ask you for the login whatever
gmail account you have you can do that
whichever gmail account you have okay so
I'm using that is called lies dodge it
has much email accounts here now once
you log in you can create your project
here you can click on the start language
and you can click on Java it will give
you a Java project but then I want to I
want to link my experts with talk with
this Google App Engine right now how do
we do that so the way you can do that is
first of all we have to okay now Google
App Engine is free for 12 March it can
see Google Apple is free for 12 months
and value for it will give you $300 or
credit so if you are using any of the
service which will which is a paid
service you can use it for $300 okay now
since it is free I will click on to sign
up for free trials okay and it will ask
you some basic questions that ignore
that depend upon which country you live
in
so you can select whatever country you
live in how many dear now so I will
select India and then I would say I
don't want any special offers and I'm
accepting all the terms and conditions
they don't have I don't agree with that
and this is awesome you know there is no
auto charge after 312 and
if you are providing your HR details
they will not charge you even if you
cross into limit so let's click on agree
and continue
okay so it will ask you for some details
it will ask you for the account type you
have to mention individual or business
and then you have to mention the project
name you have to mention the address the
city the postal code because they might
come to your home to give you a gift
right and ok so now they will ask you
for the credit card details you have to
integrate for details here ok and you
can ask for anyone for credit card
details and once it is done you can
click on the start my free trial ok now
once you do that Google App Engine will
give you the platform but then once
you've got the platform once you got the
account how do you link your Eclipse
with this because that is important why
how can you be linked with our STS with
the Google App Engine so for that you
have to go to hell and you have to go to
a Chris mark it place where you have to
mention or connect this marketplace you
have to you have to search for Google
App Engine it take some time to search
ok so you can see record Google App
Engine you have to install this plugin
so you have to install this particular
plugin so click on install button it
will take some time for the installation
okay and you don't have a choice you
have to accept you accept the terms and
conditions click on finish you can
imagine how low my internet is so let me
just make it run in background so that
you can continue the thing oh what is
that oh we have to restart our STS let's
click on yes we don't have a choice we
have to start the SCL okay so when you
restart you can see we have an option
here of creating a project but then you
think I cannot even if we played a
project you have to make sure that you
also deployed it on the server right so
this is the option region using which
you can deploy so even before creating a
project and deploying with
on this server what you have into us you
have to click on manage Google account
and you can see I already have an
account here so you can if you if it is
not there you have to add an account you
have to click on add account you have to
provide your username details here I
will not do that okay so what do you
have an account I will use that
particular account here I will use that
is for training as the account so you
can see how do you have an account ok
once you have an account you have to
create a project you have to say a mavin
based Google App Engine product a
project and ok say is Google SDK is
required but cannot be found that means
you have to also install Google Cloud
SDK now how to do that and that will see
if I will make a video of this how to
install a Google Cloud SDK
maybe maybe today or tomorrow I will
upload this video and you can watch this
video and you will know how to install
Google router in fact how do we have
Google so even in this machine okay I
guess I have not done with the setup
here okay I already have a Google SDK
installed this is check
- okay we do have Google SDK it is
working so Google SDK is accepted so I
will make a video on how to install
Google account how to install Google
Cloud SDK you have to make sure that you
do have Google Cloud SDK near machine I
could ask you for the group ID I will
say contacts at its core and the
artifact ID is just one so it will
create a new project okay and you have
to make sure that you copy all the
qualifications from your budget to this
project what we need here nothing we
just need a package
okay let's select this one Google App
Engine API and click on next and finish
it will give you a basic project which
you have to replace
okay and you have to convert this budget
into spring embassy now how we can do
that we can add this link configuration
we can add a spring dependencies here
and you know how to do that why so we
have that the first version you have to
convert this project and if you make any
changes in this you just have to click
on this click on this link and say
deploy the moment you say deploys the
the project will be deployed on the
Google App Engine now project has come
errors that one is not able exploit what
is not so solving this you can do that
so now we have seen how to create a
Google App Engine project and then we
have also seen the problem here as it is
not able to connect all tomcat
okay now you can see where those others
are gone now what you do is you have to
copy all the things on touch and you
have to paste that in test one and
that's how you can configure this
project with the video project which we
have done till now and once you do this
just have to click on this and say
deploy to App Engine and this will be
deployed so you have to deploy okay this
is the earlier project we'll go for a
new project now first of all you have to
get up your sick days right and then you
can do it again know how to do that once
you complete the project so tomorrow
we'll tomorrow we'll copy all this thing
in this test one will make these changes
and we'll deploy it it's on the App
Google App Engine and using having the
first project deployed so that's it we
have done with the session for where we
have still not compared the code you
have to complete this switchback page by
tomorrow he's taking more time then I
assumed which is taking one-hour session
is not getting enough I guess we have to
dodge we have to go for two or three
hour session from the model I don't know
how many of you watch it if you if you
go for two or three hour session so you
have to make sure that you spend a
derivative code by tomorrow he has
always had to design on the Facebook
group and if you want to be a part of
this group just share the message on
Facebook using a tag hash that is po and
if you do that we'll add you in the
group if you so if you feel that your
request is pending you can do this so if
your request is still pending just send
I mean just share the message on
Facebook
I mean share this video on Facebook and
types of message and use a hashtag for
this hash periscope so that we can
verify so that's it thank you so much
for watching and if you have liked this
video do click on the like button and
