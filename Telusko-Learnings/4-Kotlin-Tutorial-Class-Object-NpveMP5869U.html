in in Kotlin which is hello aliens let's
go for some object-oriented concept now
when you see object or concept the first
thing which comes to our mind is is
class right so we have to get a class
and we have to get an object of it now
just to make it simple what I will do is
I will create a simple class called as
aliens and that agent class will have
two properties will go for age and we go
for name so let's say we say new and
this time we'll go for coordinate file
again again in the next range in some
incoming videos will also talk about
Java class how can we do that time maybe
let's get a class here and I want to
create a class in Kotlin and we'll name
this class as agent itself so we said a
class name is alien I'll click on OK now
as you can see this is a normal class
which we'd normally do in Java right but
this is a Cott linked class now if I
because how we can verify that concern
can you see the extension there it says
alien dot Katie so Katie means
Courtland right now how to create a
variables here so if you remember in
Java we when you want to create a
variable we simply say a variable type
I'm a data type first and then we
mentioned the variable name right in
Cortland you have to mention we're all
Val now in Java we normally use a
concept of value we use the concept of
final right so could you create a
constant we use final right but in
cotton we do not have to do that when
you say bad it means a variable when you
say Val it means it's a constant time
and let's go for a variable I want to
create a variable colors name so let's
go only go for name for time being so
I've got this variable here right now
this variable need or you should value
this I will give a default value which
is blank okay but then we have to also
specify the type right because it's a
type safe language so we'll give a : I
will say this is of type string so when
you want to specify the type of it you
just simply specify a colon and then
specify the type so you can see we got a
variable which is named here now how do
we use this variable inside our code so
record above let's go back to first code
how can you access that variable it's
very easy you simply have to create
object of alien Oh question arise how do
we do that
now again creating a
object goes into two steps right first
you have to get a reference and then you
can create object how do we get a
reference here you say bad and then
we'll say this is the first alien I will
go for alien called as hot or maybe a
maybe okay
maybe okay so what should I name my
alien I will say - - tea - tea - so I've
got my first a division stick - now did
you is a variable if did - is a a lien
here I don't know what what to name
aliens here but then okay you know that
thing now how do we create an object in
Java we use a new keywords right and in
in in cotton we don't have to do that
because in Scala when we use new keyword
it C for experienced people it is very
normal now but then for the freshers
they always imagine you know why do we
use her why do we have to even use that
keyword new so coordinate says don't
have to do that you simply have to
mention alien and then a bracket
you got your object you there is no need
for there is no need for a new keyword
there now once you've got this object
simply say t2 dot if you want to assign
the values implicit name I can assign
the values there I can assign the name
of alien that t2 as hush-hush statistic
to here and then we can also print the
value right so how do I print it it's
very simple we say print Ln and here we
can say a name is and we can give a
colon now if you remember in Java you
cannot see a tick - dot name right
because it will give you the name itself
let's run this code let's see what
happens if you write something like this
and you can see the odd we are waiting
for the output come on
make it fast it only takes time in the
compilation okay if you if you got the
code if you've got the byte code it will
not take much time so as you can see
that getting the output as name is tit -
names adjust that's not what we want
right so we have to like this after the
after the double quotes we normally do
this we do we do in this way right this
is gone catenation
and this this will work as you can see
for on this code I was taking some time
come on make it fast
okay you can see the guard the aquadolls
name is hush so that is we have to use
concatenation so it is so easy to work
with a lien here so as you can see we've
got a class we don't have to mention
anything else it's same like Java class
again we'll see the importance of this
in coming videos what are the advantage
of using a quadrant class other than
Java plus again you can write a Java
code here which will work with cotton
code again we see that in coming videos
so there are lots of things coming on
the way so stay tuned inside we'll be
completing the entire series in a week
let's see how that works so you can see
we are getting the name here but then
the problem is you okay I know I was not
a fan of concatenation before so what if
you can just simply write this in double
quotes itself because I don't want to
use I don't want to use a contradiction
between so what you can do is you can
give a dollar symbol and a curly
brackets so if you can write your
variable inside the curly brackets and a
dollar sign it will take the value of it
okay so you can see it gives a different
color to it that means it can actually
fetch the value now so if you learn this
code because the output has name is
Hertz right so we can also use this one
or we can use concatenation right so
that's how we can write or we can create
a class and that's how we can use it in
fact it has lots of features which we'll
say in the next video
so I hope you're liking all these videos
