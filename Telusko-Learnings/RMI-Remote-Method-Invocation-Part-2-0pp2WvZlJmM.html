of our MI and this will see what are the
steps to implement our mi now see when
you talk about the implementation we
have we require some some agreement
between a client machine and sour
machine and that agreement is like on a
client side just like example when you
have this we have these two machines we
have one machine one and machine two in
some reference we can say this machine
is client and this machine will be
server because the implementation that
is visual object is stored on server
side and the request will be sent from
client machine right so this obj dot
show will be sent from client machine to
us our machine for this we require some
agreement between this two and that is a
client will have something called a stop
and so will have something called a
skeleton so this is your stop so this is
your stop and this part and this part
will be your skeleton okay so we have
this agreement between a client and a
server with the help of stop and
skeleton and to implement to work with
this the first step you have to create a
remote interface the first step is to
create or create the remote interface
next step we have is to provide the
implementation we have to provide the
implementation of that interface we will
say implementation of remote interface
the third step we have to go for we have
to compile this files we have to compile
this file and then we have to create
this is the first step compile and then
you have to create stub and skeleton out
of that implementation so we have to say
stubborn skeleton now the software or
tool we have to use here is our m.i.c
which is your RM I compile it will
create your stub and it will create our
skeleton next step you have to create
the registry
again we'll see why we require the
history here afterwards and then we'll
excuse me and then we'll create or we'll
create a server and we'll start this
over okay so start so I can ignore the
background sound it's my nephew is
making this sound so increasing on and
then we then will create a client and we
start the client of client application
so these are the steps we have to follow
first we have to create a remote
interface then we have to we have to
provide the implementation then we have
to compile then we have to start the
registry we have to start with the
server and then we'll go for the client
machine now question arise why we
require this register here so in this
example we have this implementation here
right so then there are chances that we
have lots of objects here so there are
chances will be having three objects
right then question arise if a client
called show which show it should call
because we are not going for the address
here we will not focus on address will
be focused only on objects and that's
why every object will have a caption or
you can say a global name like this
object will have a a this object will
have C this object will have B now these
are their names right and this name need
to be rich draw in a reg registry so
there will be a table here somewhere
here a table like there will be a table
somewhere here and in this table what
you will have is this will record all
the entries like a object one not to
object one not to here will have a name
a object one not three will be having a
name B so that in future if a stub calls
for the object it will not use the
address it will not use the name or it
will not use the object name it will use
the caption or you can say a global name
so next time a stop want to access this
object one or two it will use this
caption as a and that caption is stored
in this
registry and that's why we have to start
this registry and the tool name here
will be your RA my registry it's a
dispute so we have to first I we have to
create a remote interface then we have
to provide the implementation then we
have to compile the implementation and
it will create Stubbins griten with the
help of our m.i.c tool and then we have
to start with this tree then we have to
start this over and then the client this
is how you have to implement RMI again
the practical example of this that we'll
see in the next part
