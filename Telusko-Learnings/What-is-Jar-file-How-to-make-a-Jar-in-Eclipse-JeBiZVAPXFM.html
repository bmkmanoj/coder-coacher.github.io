Wendy and in this video we'll see what
is jarred and how can you create a jar
file in Eclipse now to understand what
is Jar just just imagine scenario let's
say you're working on a project or maybe
you're working on multiple projects so
maybe in your team you have multiple
projects which you are working on and
some of the project wants some common
features example let's say if you create
a project where you need a video reader
feature which can read a excel file
maybe if you want to find a particular
email or particular string from a
particular file so you like a code for
that right and if you want to use the
same feature in multiple projects you
can take that thing comment right so you
can take that feature in common so that
you don't have to write the same code in
every project you can simply create a
common common file which you can use in
all all the projects now how can you
create this common files now first of
all in Java if you want to achieve a
feature we create classes right so we
have one class for one particular
feature now if you want a set of
features to work together maybe if you
want to create a set of feature which
will be used in multiple projects you
can create a jar now josh is basically a
zip file for java classes normally when
you create files you know when you have
lots of photos with you and let's say if
you have lots of files with you what you
do in normal life is we create zip file
that has said I be but in the same way
we have a concept of a jar so if you
search for a jar file here you can see
we have a jar which is Java archive
which is actually a package file so
example if you want to zip so it is
basically a zip file but then if you
can't observe jar because it it's a Java
archive it has all Java files it's not
just you can have any Java files you can
put your normal files also but
technically what makes sense it should
have all the Java files or Java files
now if how can we create a jar file in
Eclipse
now typically when you want to create a
job while you simply create a project so
you will say Java project and you will
name this project as let's say my lip or
maybe even lip because this is my it
will have my features which I want I can
you can have any picture you want
example let's go with a very simple
concept let's create a calculator
service so I will say next and I will
say finished now if you remember
whenever you start with in any language
maybe C C++ or Java the first thing you
always learn is how I mean the hello
world and then we we see how to add two
numbers now what what if you don't want
to do that do it by yourself if you want
to do it with the help of some libraries
let me let me create that library for
you so in all your projects you can use
the same library so what I will say I
look at a new class here and I'm name is
class as calculator as simple as that
and you have to also make sure that you
use a unique package name every jar file
or the every class should belong to a
unique package okay so this is very
important again you will and I will make
a video on this as well what happens
when you don't have a unique package
name for your jar file okay so time then
let's say we have conduct that is called
dot util so this is my package so I'm
carrying some to do classes and I will
click on finish so that's my calculator
in this calculator I want to provide one
service I know I'm going with a very
basic example that but the coding is not
important important is how can we create
a jar file so here I will say in public
and add which will take two parameters
int i and in j and this one will return
I plus J so what we are simply doing is
we are getting a calculator class in
which you have interval has ADD which
will return I plus J now this folder
which is Navin Lib is actually a library
for me so example if I want to use this
project in or this feature in any of my
project I have to use this but how can
we use this example let me create an
under the project ignore all the
extrapolate here the main project here
is my mean lip and let me create one
more one more project here and I will
say this project as let's attend usko
project so let's say I have my own
website then you score and I want to use
or that is Kobach I will say within
scope web project in this web I want to
create I want to use this calculator so
only I have a main file here so let me
get a jar Negreanu
as my class files I will say this
chromed-out task I love this word task
I also need a main function I think I'd
finish now we got a mean so what I want
is I want to use that calculator here so
if I say calculator and if I say C equal
to new calculator you can see is not
it's not there this class is not
available in my project of course how it
will be available it's in some other
project right how can we use that here
now anyway you want to use some other
project feature so what we can do is we
can make this final Java file and you
can import that Jasmine in this project
so let's do that so let's get a jar file
of this lemon lip so I will right click
here and I will say export
so when you say export there's an option
of Java
so when you say Java you have a jar file
otherwise you can simply search for jars
here you will get it you can see record
jar now we also have a term called as
learnable Java file no this is something
new we have not talked about runnable
jar file yet now imagine you want to
create a standalone software normally
what happens is in dotnet technology we
create exe files
now those exe files are runnable files
when we use shell scripting we create
dot as such file which you can run but
in Java if you want to create a
executable file what you will do you
will be or you have made a project and
you want to make a HC file we cannot do
that in Java I mean we can do that with
third party software but technically we
don't create exe files in Java we create
Java files in fact your exe files your
executable files will be Java files and
that is your learnable Java file but we
don't want to do that we just want to
create a library so we can simply click
on Java file here and then which project
you have to mention so we are using this
Naveen Naveen lip and this have to sonic
this export Java sources files and
resources and then you have to mention
the path where you want to create this
project so I will select desktop and it
will name this I will name this file our
de library has lemon lip itself I can
you can have a different name that's
fine but I will use as lemon like this
my library I will click on save and the
moment I say next and finish you can see
record our job but it is there on
desktop so if you can do it your desktop
you will feel you will see a job on
there how can we import that jar file
here so let's say these two projects are
working on some other
some remote location so this is so - my
friend is working on a telescope web and
he's working somewhere else not on the
same location not on the same computer
now in this case you have to send the
jar file - to that person again you can
email it you can share that with a
pendrive you can upload on that - on
your website and you can share it or you
can also share your jar file using some
remote repository I don't know if you
have heard about this concept of maven
so you can you can upload your java file
on maven and you can give a mem
independency tags and all those stuff
but then yes we can use a central
repository something like Dropbox where
you can put your files on Dropbox and
everyone can access it you can share the
link same way but then here we have on
the same machine so we don't have to
worry about that much we we will simply
right-click on the project and I will
say properties now in the properties you
can see we have a Java build path now in
Java build path you have an option of
libraries now it doesn't matter which
library you want to work with there are
some internal APIs which you can use
example if I click on add library there
are some internal APIs we have j-unit we
have so I was in case if you have some
lab is in built in Eclipse or in Java
otherwise if you have if you have an
external Java is you can simply click on
add external jars and here I will go to
my desktop and I will select naveen lib
here I never click on open now I got I
got my jar file there you can see that
and I will click on OK the moment you do
that in your reference libraries you can
see we got Naveen Naveen lib but still
it's not working there's an error now
normally of anybody use a class it's
important to input the package as well
right so when I say control space now
this time can you see that we got calmed
out telesco dot util dot calculator now
this is actually coming from this this
library which is there is Kondo telesco
util so that's important right so that's
how you you export a library and that's
how you can import it so basically we
share that base with the albergue jar
files so we can use jar files for
creating a or enabling runnable file
executable file or you can use it for
libraries now let me just use this class
and see if it is working or not so I was
a system dot out dot println I was a C
dot add two numbers I will pass those
two
as five and eight or four and eight and
if I love this code and you can see we
got 12 so it is working so that's how
you create a job file and that's how you
export a job file and you can import it
in some other project and you can use it
so you can use it in any project now I
have a question for everyone what you
can do is you can just pause this video
and you can answer and then I ask the
question so what if I want to make some
changes in the Java file can I make the
changes I mean if I go to calculator if
I want to add some new features example
subtraction division multiplication and
if I make those changes will that will
those changes will be reflecting in my
new project automatically or do we have
to do something so what you can do is
you can just pause the video now and
comment in the comment section your
answer and then you can continue with
the video okay I hope you have
uncertainty comment section now just try
to understand if you make any change
since the calculator you can make a
changes there's no there's no rule that
you cannot change the Java files you can
add your like you can add your features
here and after adding your features you
have to make sure that you again export
your project otherwise it will not work
right because you are changing the
source code so whenever you change the
source code in your project it will not
reflect in the jar file by default you
have to make sure that you are making
some changes or you have to are
exporting it so you have to export the
export the project as a jar file now it
will be a new jar file and then you just
have to deface this project provided in
the same location if you are changing
locations then you have to again import
it so yeah that's it that's how you get
a jar file and that's how you import in
the other projects so I hope you enjoyed
this video in the next video we'll talk
about how can we create what happens
when you have multiple jar files and
what happens when you have a same
package name in to our different jar
files so yeah that's it from this video
