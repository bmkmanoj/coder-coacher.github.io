your friends I didn't know about this
channel and what else we can do if and
then one more thing you know if you can
contrib you want to contribute to this
channel you can't do that you can if you
have a project in your mind if you have
a date on the project you want me to do
it like ok I can do that so send me a
project where I will study your project
and I will explain that project light to
everyone so that they will understand
how to build a project how how else we
can so let me know how you can help this
channel or you can help everyone in the
world let's see how that goes
ok so since got everything same skirt
here and let's start with the QA and in
Qi itself again we'll celebrate so I can
see 50 people are watching this and I
caught 21 lights that's great so
if you're not like yet they come the
right button that's how I feel that
you're enjoying these sessions right and
I hope I can see some new faces this
time because every day we get some
number of subscribers so if you are new

you because the entire week I am busy
with something else I want to interact
with my family here so that's what I'm
doing you know doing now okay so great
so let's start with the questions and in
the last in the last video in the last
life session I miss lots of questions
and I got some questions in that video
so I will try I will start with those
questions first let me just do that let
me a search for the video which was here
just one minute
I need to go to that video first and so
yeah I will try to answer those
questions first and I will go for your
videos here okay is that is that right
okay
so questions oh oh where is the question
where's the question do we have any
questions there
okay so Krishna says there's a request
I love okay you love my teaching guys
wait why okay I would love to have more
of this coding shortcuts oh you want to
know some coding shortcuts okay let's
see how that goes okay I can't see any
questions there oh so you want me to
make a video on data structures and
planning for that but let's see because
a lots of things on the way I'm working
on so many things I don't know what
things will become read it first
so yes data structures videos will be
coming okay what else what else what
else
okay will I be making more clear some
Scala maybe maybe maybe Auto input of
logical power how to improve my logical
thinking to solve the more questions so
the
is very simple the more questions you
saw it will improve your logical
thinking because see your brain works in
that way you have to use your brain so
the only way to use your brain the only
way to use your brain is to work hard
right so try work on those skills every
time so the more questions you saw you
will it will be easier for you to solve
the next question in fact in your
childhood you know ways to learn Matt's
in Matt's wish to do the same thing
right the more questions you saw it will
be helpful for you right so that's how
you do it
okay so okay so I can say those up those
are only questions let's go back to the
the light today life session and oh only
28 people watching okay not an issue
sometimes YouTube doesn't inform
everyone for these five sessions so
that's okay okay so everyone is saying

everyone it's it's we we have to
congratulate ourselves right so I will
congratulate to you because you're a
family of so we are in a family of 1

ok so let me start with the questions I
can see someone says love you a blonde
says love you lovely to it right in fact
I love all my subscribers except some
people especially the spammers ok ok
congratulations congratulations love
from Pune love from Mumbai
ok so please upload a video on Jenkins
yeah point noted so that topic is I want
to make a video on Jackie's from a long
time but then our G problem is I need
some examples to work on and I will be
doing that so Jenkins yes I will be
making a video make a video in solid J's
piece I do have a video saw a JSP if you
can go to the playlist supply section
there are sub like JSP videos available
those are not complain though those are
not complete but then let's see how that
goes
maybe more videos on the way maybe okay
so you okay so next next point is good
please put more videos on hyper tonight
and spring okay okay we'll do that I'll
do that okay oh I lost all the questions
where are the questions and this is the
this is the problem with the chat window
you know once I scroll a bit it goes way
up so I have to go back and to check
okay so Ibrahim says what is your
Facebook ID I searched a lot oh you can
search puns I've been ready if you
search when I'm in 20 my name will be my
name will be coming there so na VI and
our a double D why I'm there on Facebook
and you can see my so I have my own
profile there so you can see my photo
and you can add me there okay next next
is okay okay so lenses Lennon why is
asking any chance of teaching Salesforce
no I have don't have any idea about
Salesforce so no those videos are not on
the way okay okay so module module Shawn
say is why congratulating it's because
we have just completed 100,000
subscribers so everyone is
congratulating me and I'm congratulating
my subscribers so that's what is going
on here okay so question from Tyrone
ready scope for web development was this
app development see according to the
according to some people apps are the
future right because everyone will be
using a mobile apps and future but the
thing is mobile screen is still still
small right we want to use of see us as
human we are more comfortable on a big
screen thanks and if I want to use
something on laptops of course I need a
web app right I will not be preferring a
app on my laptop wherever is something
which we love so what I would suggest is
if you are confused between this two I
would request you try both
so try try web app and try making mobile
apps so you see what is your interest
scopes are there in both the places web
ad will be there for a longer time don't
think that it will be gone so still go
with web app it's it's their mobile app
of course those are the features futures
right so you can try both okay it's only
been upon your interest you know III
don't like mobile applications I like
web applications I love building south
side programming but everyone is not
like me right so if you love mobile
application committed okay
and that's answer one of the questions
previously why I why have stopped making
videos for Android because I am NOT
enjoying it is that simple
I made the basic videos right but I
notice changing every day in fact ER
yesterday I went to a solve for India
campaign from Google so they had this
campaign in Mumbai so I bet I went that
because I was free on Saturday and III
seen lots of things there and they're
introducing I mean Google is doing lots
of updates for Android and that's the
problem you know if I skip some if I
skip two months on Android and you'll be
having new things so I cannot cope up
with Android every week or every month
I'm not saying it's bad it's now what do
you think is I cannot cope with it
because I have other things to do as
well so that's the only thing I'm facing
here okay so next okay I think I should
be changing my title because I guess
everyone is saying okay we are
celebrating let's just change the title
to q-a so it's also QA right so this
live Q and E this will make more sense
right okay so I've changed the title
let's see if it is it's change there as
well okay so please make up the wire or
not making videos more videos on socket
programming see I want to make it the
thing is I have started with so many
playlists at the same time I'm not able
to complete everything together so what
I will do is I will try to compete one
by one it will take some time I cannot
give my priority there so what I will do
is whatever I require now I will
complete that first and then let's see
how it goes in future
so that's the sequence but I can't
confirm everything here okay so next
please upload a video in digital
marketing in fact I'm not sure about
dated marketing
I know only about SEO but then not
everything so I cannot make a video on
that as of now maybe in the future okay
okay okay so question from money uh-huh
HP power video and g6 is good enough for
coding and not check that machine yet if
you couldn't pace the configuration I
can just check it I'm not sure about the
exact contribution of g6 so I cannot say
for coding any machine will do okay so
to learn coding you can use any machine
in fact a dual code machine will also do
anyone Pentium 4 will do the only thing
is once you start working on a project
once you start working on server-side
programming once you start working on
Android then you need a good CPU right
at least I five is something required
okay even I three will do seven
generation i7 i five is something
minimum then you need a good amount of
ATP is minimum because the moment you
would load android studio it will eat up
all your audio browser land space plus
browsers you know if you're using Chrome
then God you know in in chrome if you
open 10 tabs 10 into 200 MB it will take
2 GB of your RAM RAM space
so only Chrome will take 2 GB so make
sure that you are using a GB RAM at
least
otherwise any any laptop will do any
company will do all the bad app tops all
the companies are almost same now right
so they all use the same things of
course it's the type of Apple ok how do
it a job ok this is a very common
question you know this is the FAQ so I
think I should start every session with
the same thing how would you get a job
the only thing you can the only way you
can get a job is by improving your
skills again of course of course
everyone will say the same thing right
if you ask this question to anyone they
were saying of your skills why so
important because of course if company
is hiring you they are they want people
who can work on stuff and my observation
is colleges are just making engineers
they're not making
people who can actually work they are
just simply providing the certificate
and that trust me that certificate is of
no use company want people who can
actually solve problems and we are
living in a world of fast moving you
know everything is changing so fast you
have to adapt those changes and learn
new technologies as soon as possible get
familiar with github get familiar with
Jenkins how do you see I learn one of
the length learn any one language
perfectly you can choose Java you can
just Python you can choose c-sharp it's
your choice but be be in be mastering at
each one one language so when you go for
the interviews you have to show showcase
your skills in fact I have seen this
thing as well when you go for the
introduce you know lots of things but
you don't know how to put that into
words
practice that so when you when you are
at home practice a demo into new so ask
your family members to be an interviewer
they will ask you questions and you
answer and record yourself so you use
him a while phone record yourself and
see what is going wrong with your body
language because you feel that you are
saying something perfect but then if you
watch yourself you know what other
mistakes are because we we don't observe
ourselves right and in fact now what I'm
doing now is I don't know if you if you
observe I always look at my screen just
to see how I'm sitting how I'm talking
the smile it makes should make sense
right so this is also important it
doesn't matter I mean what I'm saying is
important but the body language is also
important so when you go for the
introduce make sure that you have a good
boy language the your sentence should
make sense and for that also you should
know skill so improve your skill first
technical skills communication skills
and a boy language those are very
important things that's how we'll get a
job and yes if you are going for a big
company they will ask you for good marks
as well I wouldn't say good marks they
always have a benchmark I depend up on
different countries they have a
benchmark so make sure that you are
about that benchmark I'm not saying you
have to be a you have to top your
college does that cross that benchmark
at least and if you don't have a good
master that is important if you don't
have a good maths that's fine there are
some companies they don't check marks
they only check if you are graduated and
they will check your skill set because
for that come those companies skill set
of skills it is very important
okay okay next back-end technologies
please
back in technologies basically means you
have okay now how can i define back in
technologies okay something like this
you have a front-end technologies and
your back in technologies Trenton is
something which user can see example
when you use a web page the UI what you
see is your front end the back end is
what actually working example you have
you have you have Java programming your
PHP so let's say you go to a fit you you
go to us website and you enter your
username password and even you say click
login now the place where you have
entered your data that is your client
end right but the processing will be
done on this our side on the backend
side right you have a server-side
programming there and you have a
back-end database from where you will
they will fetch data and they will
calculate how they will close as they
turn right so he's back in technology so
back in technologies we have Java
programming language specifically we
have Java we have PHP we have Ruby right
but that there's a big stack nowadays we
have a big stack in that so ok so you
can search one or I don't have a video
on that I guess just search for that ok
next question from awesome
is it secure which framework we should
learn in advanced Java so currently the
best framework in the market is Spring
Framework so if you got a chance do
learn spring a spring framework and in
fact in spring framework itself we have
different modules we have spring code we
have spring MVC we have spring AOP we
have spring ORM so start with at least
spring code once you complete spring
code go for spring MVC and learn string
best and string
warum ok so that's a that's a sequence
of the follow okay
next from okay so next question from so
loads from NIT and I think that's great
so 90 people are also watching ok onward
is from IIT Kanpur oh that's great so so
we got people from NIT and iit as well
watching this or following this channel
that's great
so have I have can I ask yes sure they
tell you can ask the question you have
the entire chat window there what kind
of okay questions from Bhuvan age what
kind of processes we can run on I do
basically we can run data processing
apps on I mean data processing stop on
how do you wait I do with a framework
for big data you see if you have huge
amount of data sorry for that I'm facing
water
let us fine that's fine okay I don't
have a glass of water here hmm thank you
yeah
so what I was saying is the high just
please a framework which works with big
data so if you have huge amount of data
to process that data we need a Hadoop
framework in fact you can also use
Apache spark now so it is so you can run
it you can write an application which
will be helpful it to process that data
your data should make sense right
because only your days people have to
just generate data can generate new data
example you know every day we take so
many photos nowadays and when you go to
wash them you also and if you have a
good mobile phone with a good camera
doesn't matter which phone you have if
you have a good camera you takes 1012
photos right and what you do you upload
all those photos on snapchat Facebook
whatsapp just imagine how much data
you're generating not just photos we are
generating videos example I'm doing live
here just imagine how much GB of data we
are generating just by doing life so how
to make sense out of it so that's what
we do on Hadoop framework
okay in fact I was talking about gone
for India in India so I was I was
sitting in one of the cloud session and
Google so it was Google cloud sessions
right so Google has lots of API is you
can use nowadays one of the API which I
loved is a video API so video
intelligence API got it what it do is in
a particular video so if you go to
youtube in one video we have lots of
objects right so let's say in this video
if you have lots of animations maybe
even s animations so you can see my face
if you have someone here maybe a laptop
I'm displaying if I show a mobile phone
if I show a watch maybe if I show us and
normal glasses so that
we do that software the API will analyze
the entire entire video I will show you
what are the objects are there right
then how can you process those data can
you imagine how many of you how much
video you have on YouTube
if you process all the videos and if you
find all the objects inside those videos
just imagine how much data you have but
I don't think you will process it you
need a big data framework right we just
said you okay thanks for the question
but okay so a she is asking scope of job
je Java EE nowadays co2 specifies this
cook you have to understand two things
there are two things very important one
I mean two type of industries we are
going now one is people who are solving
customers problem and people who are
solving business problems now all the
business problems so let's say if we
talk about a company who is generating
who is creating business solutions they
are already using Java framework and
they are continuing with our framework C
by no means I'm saying Java is the best
language there are other languages which
are better than Java in fact I can say
that C shop is written in Java Python is
better than Java all the languages are
better than Java but the thing is Java
is open source it is used by most of the
software's now even if you say from now
I'll be implementing let's say C shop
where all the applications can you
replace all the existing applications of
course not now since we have lots of
applications which are running if you
are if you want to shut a new
application you want that support to
connect with those applications and
again you the new hi patient will be
also based on Java so Java is there I'm
not saying it is the entire market is
thought by Java but then most of the
applications are still done even Java by
the way Java is the best language so are
you working for Google no I'm not
working for Google no it's my dream to
work for Google one day okay not work
for Google but then with Google maybe
maybe let's see okay so make a video on
Android complete I will try I will try
okay so make a video on core Java I
you have more videos I mean how many
videos you want so Boyd says make more
videos encode Jabba in fact I have 180
videos on codes about how much you want
more do you want to do PhD in that now
okay okay
oh okay question question question okay
question from how they make a video on
JSP servlet how to work on a project
using this JSP and servlets okay that
sounds good I will try that making a
video okay okay same questions are
getting repeated every time what what's
wrong
okay this is when we create web
application using string and we see my
where my deposit version show the
dependencies wide so okay now this is
already taking technique questions first
of all we are working with mavin it may
happen that your mavin is not working
properly so the question is from Rita is
when she creates a spring MVC project
the mavin depositary doesn't show any
dependencies okay it does happen when
you when your memory is not working
properly so there are multiple reasons
why it may happen the first problem is
your mavin dependencies which is there
in the end two folders are corrupted
the second reason would be your the the
plug-in mavin plugin on your Eclipse is
not working properly so that multiple
reasons met it may happen so one of the
solution which I prefer is if you're
using Windows give it your lend to
folder ok digitial so don't delete empty
folder go to him to folder and then it
all the folders inside and to folder dot
up to folder and then create offspring
application and right-click on your man
application and say update laven update
project so it like wait a moment
update project it may work ok otherwise
you can use one of the best website in
the world to achieve that and that is
step off flow right so get the executor
and paste on stackoverflow you will get
the answer for sure whatever project
which we should do at beginning start
with this small assignment so don't
start with the project first starting
the assignments once you become
comfortable in the syntax then start the
project any small project maybe you can
build your own
first create a login for a create a
login application then create a calendar
or calculator that's nothing goes you
know if you can rebuild the existing
applications that's how you but you will
learn fast so but you can try that
okay Michelle says you're doing a great
job so thank you so much Michelle for
supporting ok so if you are if you have
just joined this session we are doing a
live session here if you want to if
you're enjoying this session you can
like button that ok ok ok next question
okay all I'm asking for dinner
structures yes I will do that ok ok next
next next so he roxy is love from Assam
okay let me do from Mumbai Michelle says
I like to listen area no that's great so
that's what I in the last session I was
talking about people are accepting that
they're aliens so let me say that once
again welcome back aliens
great I have a file which the user has
inputted from HTML from oh you can do
that you can read the file so get the
file from HTML once you upload so using
file uploaded you can update upload the
file on the server side get the file and
you can normally use it the way you do
it in on all trying machine something
wrong with that ok so how did question
hi Naveen yeah I wanted to ask you from
a long time why did you give your
channel name as the disco I have
answered this right so I do have a video
on why that is score so why the name is
the disco and I do the same in every
session you know every live session just
to repeat penico is a telugu word which
means get to know the reason why i given
to this case because when i was starting
a new channel i was thinking about how
it giving a good name so instead of
going for english words because it will
be easy for it so it should be unique on
google search right because english
words are very common to find on google
search so I thought going for some other
languages so I thought ok I'm a South
Indian let's me use my mother tongue as
a lack of board and out of that I was I
was thinking about one word which will
define
a landing channel so I went for the
disco so if the disco means get to know
or get to learn subtext go well
basically okay next question okay as I
learnt all the questions here okay
question from Minah advice for machine
learning feel ya machines I think is a
good one now so what you can do is you
can start machine learning so for
machine learning your mats should be
good not great but good graph theory
statistics how all those folio
transformation in mats so learn that
first and you will be good to start with
machine learning so start with machine
learning there is a course of so go to
call center there's a course from ng
Andrew ng and for that latest and you
will love it so once those videos first
and from that you will get the you know
flow okay okay I lost all the questions
where are the questions you posted any
videos okay I do have a video so next
one I do have a video on wrapper class
just go to so what do you tube and
search for that is go back there is Co
Viper class it will show up the video
okay okay I got so many questions and I
lost all the questions here you know the
moment I scroll it goes way down okay
question question question can you make
a detailed video on spring boot with s
API yes the entire place is coming it's
only way on I'll be making videos on
screen boot yes okay so question is make
a video on API testing I'm not
interesting okay so I cannot do that
okay Mahadev
money is money Danny Danny what is MVC
sir I do have a video an MVC just search
for let me see you should hop see
instead of doing this way
we see you can watch the video when I
have some animations you can do that so
start search for such more time listen
do have a video and envisage let me just
check telesco and we see ok so what you
can do is just go to youtube and search
for that um bc i do have a video which
is named as mbc using server than JSP
watch that video will get the idea which
is MVC is okay next question okay that
it says I am from Boston done with my
masters can you please update your
videos examples on github repo some
videos with angularjs ok angularjs
videos will not be coming soon
but yes you want the code examples on
github
I'm trying for that not maybe it may not
be get up but on my own website so I'm
planning to put all the codes which all
of the videos in my website we are
working on it ok next is from ok same
questions getting repeated here ok so
mother says DS videos aren't Java ok
yeah data structures yeah will be coming
so once you not say is without you well
I am from I'm from Mumbai Mumbai
Maharashtra India so I guess Mumbai
which is master which is in India that's
that's where I'm from
okay so won't want to learn so how the
honey says want to learn Python what's
the best way to it start start learning
it start with the hello world the the
best way to learn a programming language
to start with the hello world go with
the hello world then go with addition of
two numbers go for so Python hasn't so
initially all the language to have the
same path and then they do for so it so
start at the inner world okay so okay
Aslam says how can I start cloud
programming so first you should be
knowing programming then learn about
cloud services so go to Amazon go to
Google learn about the cloud services
one of the thing which is getting famous
nowadays is server this programming so
without server I mean you don't have to
manage the server
just have to either code right so I
would suggest you to go for that some of
this programming and you might love it
so go to him AWS or a Google App Engine
Google cloud services Google cloud
platform disappear Google cloud platform
okay you will get the idea so start
walking in so now instead of typing
hello world on your machine type hello
world on the cloud service this off
edition of 30 adding two numbers on your
machine add those two numbers on the
cloud service that's how you do it okay
chinma says calm keepeth Carlos okay and
doing the same thing I guess so when you
say calm keyboard what it means
hmm okay so next question advice for IT
students Oh advice I love to give advice
this see one of the best advice I give
is IT professionals are different right
they are totally different we are aliens
because we live in virtual world so when
you would think about a solution so see
the our job is to solve real-life issues
which water-wise virtual world solutions
and for that you have to think in
different different way right so try to
build solutions if you have an idea in
your mind implement that so there are
lots of people they learn programming so
learning programming is not the ultimate
goal programming is just a tool you
should know how to build an application
how to make it work
oh yeah that's important how to make
application which works right because
there are lots of people they make the
application which doesn't work so yeah
so that's the tip I will give you make
the application which works upload that
on some some cloud repositories see
nowadays it's very easy to deploy your
applications earlier we used to face the
Asif issues but nowadays we have what
act we have AWS we have Google App
Engine we have open shipped so so many
servers are have been able to deploy
your applications in fact all these
applications will give you one year
service for free right aw give you one
year free service Google gives you $300
of the grade-point App Engine so this
one open shipped also gives you a free
service now I'm not sure but then you
can find out
okay question question question okay I
lost all the questions now okay how how
much time okay 30 minutes we are live
great poof
okay where are the questions where are
the questions okay I lost all the
questions which went up just just give
me one minute let me scroll up okay okay
so someone is reaching 100 subscribers
in few months great how it is possible
to reach 100,000 subscribers consistency
persistence that's how you get now so
many subscribers I'm not saying I have a
very big number of subscribers because
some people do get thousands I mean a 1
million subscribers so it's all I've
been up on your content it's all depend
upon which target which market you are
targeting so see if you have seen some
people some some channels which is
something like
Technion Karrueche awesome channel
variety provides it provides you videos
on different different content like
mobile phones reviews then laptop
reviews then talking about geo so so
here's a different target different
audience to target we start getting all
the entire internal audience entire new
generations right the moment you talk
about mobile phones you are talking
about the entire market when you talk
about geo you are talking about the
entire Indian market if you if you are
targeting something like programmers so
I am targeting only programmers and tag
to specific Java grammars so I'm
targeting what you say a small set from
the universal set right and that's all
you I got I got 100,000 subscribers but
if you're targeting every Nishiki shape
people an example it's like you're
talking about if you're targeting on it
much chill running people then you will
get a small subset because not everyone
want to learn machine learning now right
in future I don't know but then so
depend up on your target so if you're
opening up your start
channel again you have a big market to
cover you have a big set to promote so
that's how and also depend up on your
competitions if you have lots of other
channels which is competing for the
audience so that's how you will grow
okay so make more videos specify be
specific who are your target audience
and provide valuable things to them and
ask them to subscribe ask them to share
their sharing your videos with their
friends that's how you the Guru I mean
that's what that's what I do okay okay
and is also there is one more way of
getting more subscribers is paid cells
are paid you week you can pay Google to
promote your videos and that's how you
will boil you will get more subscribers
I've never tried it yet but you can try
it so you can you can you can pay some
amount to a Adwords and they will
promote your channel and that's how you
will earn more oh that's why we'll get
more subscribers the only thing is you
have to spend and it also it's also
possible that the new audience which is
you which you got are not not loyal to
you right so yes so it's all depend upon
how you promote your channel okay next
next next next next question next
question okay any citation for
pentesting no idea okay questions from
chinmaya tensorflow and skies ok
scikit-learn best way to learn okay to
tell to learn tensorflow start using
tensorflow so start learning first one
machine learning basics so go with the
machine so before touching that ends up
flow get the machine learning basics and
then start walking one time's up flow so
so the youtube is not the best way to
learn all those things go to core set up
Kosala has lots of videos on on machine
learning and that's how you will go so i
don't have much experience in that so i
cannot comment more okay so next one
says
okay thanks okay great Atul says can you
make more videos on Oracle first of all
if you have seen the Oracle videos those
videos are not big so I have not made
those videos enough my friend his name
is - chip he made all the Oracle videos
I'm not good with the record here so I
don't think we'll be having more videos
on Oracle soon okay spring AOP videos
okay we'll make that okay so we're
Bochum are say is a simple question okay
not asking in your screen got mad or you
just tell me what should i what the
question means okay so let me just read
the question have simple question and
okay I'm not asking use your screen got
mad or you just tell me what should I do
to improve my math okay okay so okay so
you want to improve your mathematical
skills and finish skills right so if I
want to improve what I would do is I
will go back to my school books you know
the in your school we used to have lots
of physics and maths books so follow
those books and practice those course
that's I will improve your mats do you
don't have to learn anything very very
amazing about mathematics or physics you
don't have to be a real physicist or or
what you say a real scientist in physics
the only thing is you need to know
basics for programming so go to well go
back to your school books and start
learning it that will be helpful okay so
Pawan Kumar says which is the best
website to is good for learning
sorry JSP if you have to know basics of
them my channel that is colonics is good
for advanced you can just go to google
and search for it there whichever comes
on top will be the best channel a best
website okay
okay next question so far more minutes
we are done with 40 minutes here five
more minutes and then we'll end this
session let's see how many questions I
can cover in five minutes oh so that
just says Amazon Web service question
mark Amazon Web service is basically a
web service from Amazon which they will
provide cloud services where you can
host your website they can host your
application you can write an application
there so it provides you all
the other services right monitoring the
applications managing the applications
you don't have to do any other stuff you
just have to use those services those
are not free services okay you have to
pay for that but manageable you know if
you are getting good traffic on your
website so why not pay pay for it okay
okay scope of Big Data a very good scope
okay so I was watching servlets and then
saw you live good work so thank you so
much thank you for that okay by any
chance iw tutorials coming soon yes a SS
videos will be coming not the entire
playlist but then how to use specific
modules of AWS maybe how to use code
star how to use easy to how to use bean
stack how to create a database how to
create a database connection with RDS so
those videos will be coming not the
entire produced okay okay ma this is how
to how to improve communication skills
for interview okay I have talked about
that too in one of the videos so what
you can do is search for so go to my
place and search for five skills for
programming or five skills for
programmers and that I've talked about
the communication but as well can you
say with what that means I don't know
okay okay so two more questions two more
questions and then we'll wrap it up okay
the base videos you are waiting okay
will be coming soon okay finally a
project ideas no I don't want to give
any ideas to you for finding a project
ideas something which you have to come
up with because if I give you an idea
and you might not implement it because
that's my idea right I can give you only
the idea behind the idea there is so
much you know there's a huge amount of
description which or exactly I want so
what I would suggest is look at around
you see think about this we are living
in a world where there are lots of
and all these problems okay we cannot
say all the problem will be solved using
virtual world but then we can solve some
of the issues with the virtual world
right so look around you there are some
problems which exist okay let me give
you an example so in eyestrain Mumbai so
in Mumbai we travel by local train we
trial by BST buses so it was difficult
for us to manage those timing you know
we were not knowing at what time what
time I will be getting a train to to
visit some place what I mean
which bus will go to what location so
there's a pause so one person what he
did he thought about this problem he
created an app called as M indicator so
columns are there around you right so
just toss all those issues and you will
be getting your project right so that's
what that's what I would do if I were in
your please don't ask for past project
ideas just go for that go with the
problem statements and you will be good
to go okay so question last question
from mortal how many years Android will
complete move completely move from Java
to Courtland okay first of all you
cannot say completely move because there
are lots of applications which are built
on Java and they might not go for a
quarter length but people will be
erupting quarreling soon maybe next year
in one year then in the next one years
people will be adopting Cortland over a
Java so if any new projects they might
use coordinate not Java so but then yes
Cortland is Java so when you when you
like a quatrain code it's getting very
into into Java so Java will be there so
that's it I tried to answer most of the
questions as always I cannot all the I
cannot answer all the questions so once
again thank you so much everyone for the
support which you have given to me so
yes what so in one of the so ok there is
one thing some people do message me on
Facebook and they expect me expect a
reply that's good you can expect a reply
but then I am not that okay I know what
I'm saying and not that can you say that
I'm not that on Facebook so I do I do is
it Facebook but then I just check my
notes eight notifications I do whatever
posting I do but then I do
I don't reply to messages you know I get
around
the message okay even if you go for 10
people messaging every day and if I
don't take my master Facebook for 5 days
it is 15 messages how can it's possible
for me to reply everyone I try but then
don't be upset if I don't reply right so
that's why we are I'm going I mean kind
of I mean I'm kind of live on YouTube I
just transfer your questions because I'm
not a person who will hook you can Tiger
solutions I am a person who can who can
talk about a solution I'm not a writing
guy right so please don't upset when I
don't reply on facebook facebook is not
a right platform to get get the answers
so that's it that's what I wanted to say
so thanks thanks for watching again see
you in the next life session which will
be in on next Sunday yeah timing would
be 5:00 5:30 today it was supposed to be
