methods interface so we have seen that
right in fact when you talk about
interface the only difference between
interface and abstract classes in
abstract class we can define methods
right so in abstract class we can define
methods and we can declare methods so we
have both the things right but in
interface we can only declare methods
right we cannot define it so defining is
not possible in interface but that was
the thing only till one point seven the
problem is you know the world is
changing I mean there are lots of thing
which are changing example from normal
software's from normal database
management system we are moving towards
big data right so we have lots of
requirement where you have to process
huge amount of data and when you when
you want to process huge amount of data
you need special functions you need
special features in your language so
examples when you talk about the concept
of big data we use Hadoop we use Park
which is Apache spark and to work with
Apache spark people normally prefer to
use Scala and somewhere Java was feeling
that you know people are moving from
Java to Scala which is time for us to
upgrade so the only way to upgrade is to
add new features right and when you want
to add new features that means we have
to either create some new interfaces or
new classes or we have to modify some
interfaces the problem is we are not
allowed to modify the interfaces again
we will see that once we start with
connection topic we'll see why we should
not modify interfaces so there's a
certain requirement in Java 1.8 we can
define method in interface but this is
not possible before 1.8 okay if I using
1.7 or below this will not work so it
only works in Java 1.8 so you can define
methods now now the real question is
then why we need I mean why we have
interface and then I mean what was the
main difference between that so we don't
have much difference now due to method
definition interface so given a choice
always go for interface now because we
can also declare and define there so
what we'll do now is let's say we let's
say we have an interface here and I'm
the interface as some say interface our
demo into so we have an interface which
is demo and in this interface I want to
declare a method so the only way you can
declare the method is by specifying a
different type which is void and void
and we can mention the method name let's
say ABC that's the method name we have
and that's a declared method right but
let's say I wanna define a method now
can we define our method let's try if I
say public void show and if I try to
define a method by saying I will say in
show and as soon as I try to say this
you can see there's an error here and it
says that you cannot okay abstract
method do not specify a body I mean by
default in interface we can have only
abstract methods right which is not
possible so now what we'll do is we'll
so to define this we have to use a
special keyboard called as default so
using default you can say you can define
a method now you can see there is no
error and unfortunately again we cannot
create object of interface so let's
create a class and it will name this
class as demo impel which implements
your interface which is demo let's
create that method which is ABC we'll
say public void ABC and we'll say system
dot out dot println it is working here
because it is a public method I guess
because of the interface it was not able
to interpret this okay let's let's print
here let's say in ABC now you can see we
have we have a demo method I mean this
show method and then we have ABC method
which is defined I cannot create object
of interface but I can create the
reference of interface right so I can
say demo obj equal to new demo imple and
let's call obj dot ABC so it works and
if you can even call obj dot show so
this default method will also come
inside this class okay
same like inheritance if I learn this
code you can see we got in show I mean
in ABC and in show so that means we can
define methods or interface now because
of the new update in Java 8 so we can
have default methods again we'll see the
real reason for this why we are supposed
to define method interface so once we
start with the topic of collection and
genrich's in that will talk about
default methods some time you remember
that in interface we can define methods
we can say default void show and we are
defining it right so we can define
methods we can define
multiple methods here now in total how
many methods we have we have two methods
right so is it a function interface
let's try so if I make it a functional
interface if I if I write function
interface about that and you can see it
is not giving you any error even if you
have two methods as we have seen the
last video that functional interface
will have only one method right so the
real reason is functional interface will
have only one abstract method in this we
have we do have two methods but both are
different right one is abstract and one
is default so we can have any number of
default methods but you have to make
sure that you have only one one abstract
method here so that's that's the point
so this is also a functional interface
now can we achieve method overriding I
don't want this definition I want to
have my own definition can we do that if
I say public void show let's see if it
is if it is overriding it or not we'll
say in new show and if I run this code
it should print a new show is it working
yes perfectly so that means this method
can be over guided in the class itself
yeah that's about default methods in
interface we can define methods so
that's it thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
