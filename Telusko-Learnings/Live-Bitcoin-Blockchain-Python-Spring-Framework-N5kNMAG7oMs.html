life it's deep sunlight there I can't
say thanks oh I should be opening this
you know I'm gonna window I guess so so
that I can see what's happening there
and I guess boys here hello everyone I
know I'm late I just got busy with
something else and then it took me some
time to do setup because my my phone is
giving me some trouble today so I was
not able to find you the phone so I'm
trying to defy my cook itself so today I
am using a magic camera but it looks
good it looks better than the phone at
least and yeah so that's great or a set
of mine Mike here it's weird okay so
that's great so we have 77 people
watching it's only there so I guess I
guess I got so many messages because I'm
late and okay so so many questions are
there okay so yeah so people are upset
because I'm late okay so we'll start
with the session itself guys okay so let
me maximize this I guess the py angles
not good
okay so let's get started so today we
will be talking about watch your topic
for today is Bitcoin blockchain we'll
talk about Python apaec are not exactly
in detail and we'll talk about spring
framework as well as you can see the
title ok so what's important here is is
in top of the Ottoman yeah ok so what's
important is so this only discuss about
these three things or four things not in
detail but then just to give you an idea
what is my thinking about these
technologies you know from a long time
I'm getting a lot of messages on the
comment section I know I do leave your
comment size if you are thinking I don't
reply to your comments that is that
means like I don't trade it I do read it
it's just that you know to comment on
each and every to reply on each I
recommend is difficult for me
this is my new year resolution okay I
cannot say this illusion but that I will
try to reply to as much as here and
realized people are getting confused
about Bitcoin about your chin in fact in
one of the chat as someone had asked has
asked me about blockchain then pencil
and that's think playing well so let's
get started let's start with the Bitcoin
here again I will pick up your questions
later but just give me 5 10 minutes so
that it acknowledges first ok the first
one is the Bitcoin so what is Bitcoin
and what is getting so famous you know
every day we are getting this thing
which is you know people are talking
about bitcoins in fact when I go for
training but I talk to my colleagues
they all are discussing about bitcoins
in fact the lunch break they spend the
entire lunch break in bitcoins you know
then they let's talk about let's think
ok let's fire a Bitcoin and when I look
at the price of Bitcoin let me show you
the because again just ok ok so you know
in the morning I was just doing some
research on Bitcoin I'm really busy
I'm reading a book one of what are the
best book of it Bitcoin if you don't
know about that book the book name is
mastering bitch point you will get it
from Amazon you will get it from clip
card I guess or the local shows as well
so you can now you can buy that book
which is mastering Bitcoin awesome book
in that book and I went to a page where
implies the big banks so the ties
decolorize Bitcoin is approximately
sixteen thousand dollars for one Bitcoin
so thank what that into a gate can see
if you know in rupees and if it up on be
regulation you want to that but you're
gonna see you can do that also the
website name is big point average
dot-com so the difference different
websites are being able so this is one
of the website I don't know if you can
see this so this is the check if you can
see all right focus it's when difficulty
focus on a Macbook it's possible to say
that yeah so now I guess you can see it
so you can see that the current price of
Bitcoin I
you can see it in reverse order that's
bad it's good yes so you can see that it
is lemon latch 25,000 rupees for one
Bitcoin and that's weird right so if you
are buying a Bitcoin for sort of money
so why this thing so I put a very basic
reason it's in demand by it so every day
when you are talking about Bitcoin so
mana P mu people are buying bitcoins it
is at high demand and with every
transaction it is the rate is going up
it's not someone who is doing it is the
market right so every time you buy it so
depends upon how people are buying it
they find the average of Bitcoin and
that's the current price so it's been
it's insane it's very big right amount
now if you want to buy a Bitcoin so do
you have to spend eleven eleven eleven
lakhs 25 house would be all a $60,000
not exactly even if you have thousand
rupees that's fine
so just to give you a brief a Bitcoin
was created so far the puzzle of Bitcoin
is is Satoshi Nakamoto Nakamoto Moodle
team since this case it's the toshi
Satoshi is this the first name and so
the people in 2009 the paper was
launched by Satoshi and in that people
he talked about Bitcoin it just it was
just a paper and then different people
starting implementing it now Bitcoin is
amazing in a protocol which we use to
transfer money again there is a drawback
with the is in traditional market which
you're working on because we have the
back resolution we have the government
resolution everyone have their own
saying so they are saying you know it's
not that going to actually depend upon
banks and the third parties why because
I read someone between if you if I want
across oh my to my friend why I need
someone in between because they have
their own regulation so that's why we
use this Bitcoin nowadays which is a
virtual currency there is nothing
physical in the Bitcoin world everything
is virtual so whatever you transfer
money it will be done with virtually and
no one I mean
you so it's you and your DC DC well to
tell the two people who are doing
anything here and then the doesn't think
will be done in the in the
so they would meet ourselves in between
and that is where you will do all the
transactions or the the sustain again
I'll be making up in detail video on
this on Bitcoin and trying to pick a
Bitcoin video since and may not be a
very technical video where you will
understand everything about which point
but at least to just to get the idea
because if you have the idea you can
start with that in fact I started
learning Bitcoin a last-resort month not
big coin certainly box change first and
then I said nothing we have Bitcoin and
thanks to one of my subscribers also my
facebook friend Jimmy he you know he
always post about those bitcoins stuck
on Facebook about the Hashcash the
Bitcoin at the blockchain the conference
so I got excited and then I started
learning each point and again just to
repeat the book name it is mastering
Bitcoin okay let me show you if I have
that book so I put in the book name and
I have an e-book cover type employee
book then the physical books how do I
show the image so this is the power you
can see that again
so mastering Bitcoin so if you can buy
this book this is awesome pop by the way
any buffering is there are you facing
any buffering there the guys
I could hopefully
on B how to buy bitcoins so there are
some steps ok videos pausing so just
give me one second I will use another
Wi-Fi because that's a issue with the
this Wi-Fi here ok let's do one thing
let's start this session once again
because I I can feel there's a there's a
problem so let's do that again let me
just close this session and again I will
I'm on the same line so just give me two
minutes for the back
okay so I'm going to be alive I don't
know how this trimming is now I guess it
is better than the last time but you
know in the comments section everyone if
it is the chat window Yogi's proper yeah
so yes is it proper everyone let me know
in the chime in talking okay I'll go it
now that's great so yes I know something
about Bitcoin so you can read that book
which is mastering Bitcoin awesome book
to know about bitcoins and other making
the biggest video on how to pinpoint
works and then how can you buy bitcoins
but the basic idea is virtual currency
and the current weight of Bitcoin is
sixteen thousand dollars or you can say
it is 111 lacked 25,000 rupees now the
thing is a Bitcoin so he uses a so if we
use a bit we use a saw in between and
those people are called as - so em I NP
R - and you can go for Bitcoin mining if
you want to get the other technologies
and it can be a book as a as a developer
as a programmer technologies or you can
build your client application for
Bitcoin so there's a huge go for Bitcoin
now now there are people who are
claiming that because bitcoin was okay
the useful facing some issues with the
voice everyone is it let me know in the
comment section if you're facing some
voice I mean noise how about now okay
how about now I have decided some change
there
is it okay okay so this is the first
time I'm doing this with Maya and
machine my MacBook I used to normally go
with live on the phone but then please I
don't know why what is happening so the
connected connection was not proper with
my phone maybe the Geo Network which is
giving you trouble today so I guess I
hope it is good now
okay I'm using a better mic is just that
I forgot to do one setting there for
from changing my Mac mic to my the
original mic which I'm using here okay I
hope it is better now okay so yeah so
those are - so as I tell apart you can't
build those - okay you can be a miner
there and you can build you can build
blockchain technologies like you can
build a client you can build a mining
application and so yeah so so Bitcoin
uses a concept of blockchain so
everything you have to maintain the
record right so if you are doing a
transaction on Bitcoin so some some
amount to you and if you are using again
if you're facing buffer is it perfect I
don't know what is happening today I I
guess they don't want so Google don't
want me to go live today maybe okay so
yeah so crappy facing some issues with
buffering so it's we can we can handle
for today at least I I can't do anything
now each my Wi-Fi network to my mobile
network so I'm using the ATL Wi-Fi now I
know okay so people are facing issues
what should I do now still facing
perform come on come on let me know is
it okay refer oh there is only one
option
now let me just create a new event okay
I don't have a choice let me get let me
get a new way event five minutes now
okay people are saying you can continue
but then is it buffering a lot okay yeah
so it's continual people are saying
that's fine so let's continue so whoever
is able to go is I mean if you are if
you are just if you're getting
everything properly then that's fine you
can continue with this so yes so that's
the blockchain is basically a ledger
where you will maintain all the
transactions so if you are sending our
money to your friend and if you want
some bet you want that data to be stored
somewhere right so every transaction
becomes one block and so if you have ten
transactions so in the world at this
point if you have ten transactions
you'll be getting ten blocks and all
those blocks will be coming together to
build a chain which is blockchain I can
be used a concept of cryptography here
so their concept of cryptocurrency again
he will get a proper video on that but
that is the idea so blockchain is not
the blocks is not only for Bitcoin
blockchain and as for research there's a
huge there will be a huge demand for
blocks and in future so maybe if you if
you want to get into Bitcoin or blocks
and technologies so start with the
option first understand how blockchain
works and then you can learn Bitcoin so
even if you are changing your technology
to somewhat something else but maybe in
future people are saying that everything
so the government organization the
private sector industry everyone will
store the data in a blockchain
technology so go with that so go with
blockchain now and later you can
continue with Bitcoin okay so how do
people are watching this if you enjoyed
this session I didn't think in the by
clicking the like black button there so
that I will know how this session is
going there because even I need
motivation to come live on Sunday Royds
okay so I can see I can see we have
hundred views and only 15 one likes
what's what's wrong
are people are watching this I know
I know okay then continued canoe so so
the next thing is the next thing is
fightin you know as a as a jaw-dropper I
always promote Java right I always say
Java is that's how I is best right but
then the thing is pi is also good there
there are the languages which are good
in different field
now when I say Java is best I'm talking
about the corporate industry so as a
trainer when I go to different industry
for training I I pick normally people I
mean those industry they are they prefer
java training java in the company so
that's why i they give me a choice of
java but then what about different
technologies no thanks to the machine
learning concept thanks to blockchain
technology thanks to the other other
things python is coming up now if you
don't know python is the fastest growing
language now okay pythons the fastest
growing language so i would say if you
want to get into something now learn
Python and there's a lot of future for
Python for Java as well is a good future
because Java 9 is here so people who are
getting confused about Java is it a good
future
yes Java 9 is zero and Java 9 is awesome
think anywhere it's just that for
different requirements let's say
machines nothing is going to be most
famous nowadays a blockchain is getting
famous so they are preferring they are
preferring a Python in fact you can also
build blocks into the using Java again I
have not done that yet but I'll be doing
that later so yeah
python has a good future and without you
making Python videos maybe because I am
so since if I want to move to blockchain
or machine learning now I need to work
on Python and you know that how I learn
new things
whenever I learn new things I make
videos on that you know so you know to
be unselfish side not to teach you I
tried it this channel to teach myself I
wanted to learn how to teach online how
to so the first or second video which if
you if you see my first and second video
is not for you people it is for myself
you know I wanted to make a video but
later I realize you know my videos are
helping others so that's why I started
this journey of a racecar learning okay
this is not this this is the second
channel the first channel I was going
from I saw this is only
for you that is for nothing is for you
Thanks learning it for my more than one
lakh subscribers so so yes so that's so
maybe I will learn Python now and I'll
make a video so if my video is so if
Python because are there that means I am
learning Python
so whatever videos you will see in
future those are those things I am
learning okay
so that's great next is about Spring
Framework from the last announcement of
my batch of people are asking about it
Spring Framework is a good future of
course it doesn't matter which company
you join now every big company they are
working on java enterprise is an
enterprise language and one of the best
framework for java is i mean one of the
best framework for Java is spring now so
people are asking for spring knowledge
so if you want to gain industry now and
get learn learn Java learns playing
learn hibernate and if you go if you go
for the interviews they will ask you ja
the spring and hibernate questions a lot
so those are the answers I wanted to say
and one more thing about data structures
I promised are you making dentistry
videos and I'm doing that
I've never promised that I will upload 2
to 3 videos per day on data structures I
would have not promised that I will
upload one video per day on data
structures I will try to upload as soon
as possible because I'm working on some
other stuff as well
I will redefine that before that I'm
working on the project I am working on
I'm doing for a corporate training I'm
trying to take I think on as much time
as much as time possible for data
structures in fact there are other
videos as well which is a kind of
example a double is not complete yet so
I'm trying to complete a doubles as well
I'm trying to complete I'm working on
the sahabat videos so there's so many
things which are lined up so yes you
will be getting two complete data
structure series but then it will take
time now once we have talked about it
lets me move let me just move to the
questions so let me just answer your
question see everyone and ok now this
time I will not go from first to last
let me just pick up the questions as I
can see because I can see there are so
many questions already been there okay
let's let's become the first punch of in
Java 9 you reveal your views ok Java 9
is awesome in fact every Java version
which is not which is
now is awesome example Java 7 was a
benchmark then I thought ok everything
is done Java Java 7 has everything but
then Java 8 runs programming and now
Java and 9 came with one of the amazing
feature which is watching your guy
coming can you imagine that you can
create modules now and you have more
control on your code
so yes Java 9 is awesome so people who
are facing issues with Java before those
issues were asked is I mean those are
sour salt now in Java it may take some
time to implement you know Java is still
e still new and companies who are
working on Java especially banks the
coop the the other industries other than
the pure technical companies they take
some time you know to move from to move
from one version to other version so it
will take some time but surely Java 9
will be there in the market soon ok so
next question confuse Java or Python ok
so if you're really confused I would say
go for Python so if you confuse go for
Python but if you are sure that you want
to get into industry when you want to
work on em is if you want to work with
MNCs chance that in they tell you they
will ask each other questions and both
at least I'm not saying you should be
mash up both in languages learn both and
then you can decide which one you want
to master I believe in this thing you
know you should be jack of all and
master of one so when you say Jack of
all it means you should know in Python
you should know in C programming it
should be knowing Java it should bring
Scala
quadlin so now I have the thing it's not
that you know people I don't know why
people think learning one language be
enough one language is never enough at
least to get a job you can learn Java
and that's enough but then you never
know right let's say if you wanna a
project and maybe someday you you've got
a new project and that new but it is on
Python skies at that point it will take
a lot of time right but if you want what
if you have some knowledge you have
basic knowledge it will be helpful right
so I would say when you are a student
try to learn as many languages as
possible not everything about but the
basics and the first problem is if you
learn one language it is easier to learn
other language as well
example if you know if you know C you
can learn C++ easily the only thing is
you have to add dupes concept there if
you know Java
is very easy to learn how you do it so
learn multiple languages and be master
of one so whatever you love let's say I
love Java so I have I'm doing maths
range now I'm trying to learn as much
testing is in Java so or to work with my
scene learning okay that's a good
question now machine learning has
different stuff example do you want to
use the existing machine learning
algorithm or do you want to implement
your own increment I mean if you want to
use the existing one you should be
knowing how you can how your brain works
how our neural network works you need to
know learn all those things and then you
have to implement that in the in the
system if you want to implement then you
should you need to be good with mats
much chill learning is there from a long
time but then we are just very creative
as hype now and I'm not the best person
to answer this question so what I would
suggest is go to youtube and search for
Andreo ng so it's Andrea
ng he's the best guy so I mean he has
some videos and then there's one more
channel called I forgot his name again
okay I'm very bad with names I forgot
his name again
I was told it having a chat window if I
call his name I'm student learning per
person just talking with this avoid its
name no not that guy okay sure I will
check that in some time okay so that's
so you can you can search for that
person's what his name okay let's let
you that data okay next is what okay so
next question is future of Scala in
India enough scholarly takes some time
you know the thing is Scala is used
mostly for big data now you don't know
about this thing we have a point we have
to something unless Apache spark so
initially it was I do which so big data
for beginner people used to work on
Hadoop now people are moving to spas
because path provides you better feature
than Hadoop and spark is built using
Scala so if you are going to pick it an
hour
see Raj his name is Raj so search for
see Raj machine-learning on YouTube soon
as I was right
yes I will okay so yeah so big data
concept so if you want to get into big
data world using spark I would say learn
Scala Scala is you know is awesome the
best thing is Scala is a functional
programming and to work with big data
it's functional programming is the best
one have you can also use Java we can
also use Python but I would say Scala is
the best one Scala is the fastest
language compact Java and okay when I
say faster is also you put up with a
video code so he's better than Python
and Java both but again if you want to
learn speller I would say learn job
first and then learn Scala that's that's
how you will learn Scala faster okay so
next now it says which I have 1000 likes
to give oh that's great Raul that's so
nice of you so yeah you can do that so
just go to my HIV video and click a like
button this but thank you so much Raul
for appreciating my work one God says
you are doing an awesome job to the or
thank you so much brother make video on
deep learning for J please okay I am NOT
about about deep learning here but sure
that I will take that plug in and then I
will I will try to make videos okay my Y
my chat window is so small here it means
here and the question says o as that may
I know the future of blockchain
technology we have talked about it but
then just to just make a quick recap
blockchain is just it's a technology
where you will maintain the data in a
distributed way so it builds up chain of
data so every time you do something you
get a block and you add that block in a
chain which is much better to work to to
you know they will they will be less
corruption because we are using high
school actually helga rhythms which is
more secure and it's distributed so that
it is also transparent you know everyone
can see what is happening there so no
one can fool you example the we are we
as we are having so many corruptions in
gamma now and people don't know where
their money where those monies are
so if you if you are paying like tax you
don't know where your tax is going
example if they say if you are donating
to a NGO you know I I try to donate to
some energy and she is the only problem
is if I donate our money if I donate
something I am not sure if that money is
actually reaching to the people who are
who are intended to receive that money
so using blockchain we actually keep on
track if you are if you are giving money
to an NGO how that money is transferring
from the NGO to the needy people so that
that is can that can be maintained with
blockchain so blockchain is not just
only for Bitcoin you can use blockchain
anywhere so I would say learn to option
or something see if you want to really
get into the new technologies I would
say blockchain is the one doctor is one
machine learning is one yeah you know
people are so there is one more thing
people are getting excited about all
this JavaScript technologies languages I
would say the world is changing now
language is not that important important
this new technologies so develop on
whatever technology you are getting to
learn that language
anyone says do you have thousand videos
that I would like hey okay I do have
thousand videos I don't know maybe I
have more than 900 videos on YouTube I'm
not sure let me just check how many
because I have even have okay we have
857 videos not even thousand my bad
making so if I make one video of my day
it will be approximately it will take
around five I managed to make to get to
that yes right okay so next question can
we learn Scala easily or not easily but
then oh so yeah Scala is not that easy
to learn I would say but if you know
Java learning scholar would be easier so
what you can do is just go to my
playlist and watch color videos I don't
know how easy you feel I I mean when I
was learning Scala it was easy for me
thanks to the Java knowledge which I
have okay
so the puzzle was talking about you know
Java you can see that if you see these
this chat window the live video here and
I'm big in size of see Roger you're
getting same solution of see ROG okay so
there are say large solution so in my
video
okay but I'm getting solution here
maybe he will be installation there so
you can check it again which channel
awesome channel by the way okay so my
eyes my mobile says and my surgery is
also live is it
I am not seen in his life oh that's
great I should say hi to him as well in
the chat window
I should it for me right I am live by
Sergey without you so let me just in for
my such a time life when I am I okay so
okay so okay he's like that's great I
know if you can see the drive into there
let me know that I'm lying also so that
you will know okay
so now next question would be please
tell me about system clause okay I'm not
good with OS anyway okay next one
swapnika says you inspired me so - great
that's that was my main motor you know
so teaching is one thing and inspiring
people's the other thing because I feel
motivating people is one important in
fact is I think that motivating people
are much more important before but now I
feel there's one more important thing is
self motivation so we are external
motivators right and you have to inspire
yourself now so that's great but then
you feel inspired by me so my work is
going good okay so next question would
be II okay it's going so fast oh can you
please please say something about coding
and blockchain technology what should
our developer learn okay
now even I'm getting confused about that
because I'm I just started learning
Bitcoin and blockchain technology it
will take some time being much time to
it and giving it only one and I mean one
and a half an hour to that technology
every day since I'm okay this is the bad
thing about me I try to learn more
technologies at the same time it is a
bad thing of course but you having it
I will surely make a video on how to you
know how to make your blockchain coding
possible the number of views are going
down why why people are going down okay
let's continue okay hey Springs is safe
session in Reddy's spring says that was
what's this I didn't get your question
Jay deep now that says please suggest be
about full stack developer okay what is
first angle of a good question people
use to so we used to have different with
different people you know some someone
will work on so some will be a designer
someone will be a developer in the
backend and someone will be you know a
database person someone will be a
deployer okay so what happens is when we
build an application we have we have to
first design the application you running
something which you see so I said if you
build a website let's say you build a
mobile application a design right and
then you can design that with the
alphabet CML with your CSS with your
JavaScript
but is one one thing so designing is not
for everyone designing this for those
people who are creative but in those
colors because there are other things
color combinations all those things now
if you want to make it dynamic
we need sounds like coding example Java
PHP asp.net than we need whatever else
we have we have zubi so you can use
those technologies to write the backend
programming using which client sees we
have a back-end now we have two these
two things we also have a data base
layer who will make a database and then
after making the inter application you
need to deploy it somewhere right and
that deployment is your so that's will
be deployment and you'll be deployed
somewhere
now who will do that deploy up but
nowadays we want one person who will do
everything that is full stack designing
development database deployment
everything will be done by one person is
pushed I developer and if you choose
Java in between as a Java so you are the
job full sector up or if you choose
dotted your a dotted whose tag data per
the front-end to main same right it is
HTML CSS JavaScript it will not change
again you can use defender J does the
framework like when use angularjs you
can use view GA as you can use react.js
many boutique noise available okay what
about learning angular for I'm not good
with JavaScript framework so I'm
basically a package possible no I love
to work on Java and that's the thing you
know people nowadays they want to learn
the front edge technologies and they are
missing one thing that also because but
at you okay so you have to choose one
either you can be a front-end or you can
be a back-end people do they do both
because of full stack development but I
would say prefer I mean none first of
back end and then London all on front
end and then like in the only thing is
the moment you learn front-end it's very
difficult to go back to the backend part
tedious but then depend upon people
there so I'm not good with angular the
view technology's hell up says please
makes spring boot tutorials only way
after finishing later structures
AWS github I will start with springboard
okay so your videos on coddling are
complete course or not okay so cotton is
a language
and my videos is so in my in my playlist
I have the complete Cole complete videos
oh so when I say quorum call kumquats in
which means all these parts in language
so have come with all the language
fundamentals of Portland but not how do
you implement parkland on Android so I
have not made those videos so if you are
interesting if you're if you're
interested today in how do you use
hotline for anything that's not in my
videos but if you want language because
see if you want to implement parts in
Android first year to learn Portland
right so my video will teach you
quarterly and then you can learn about
how do we implement Cortland on Android
see a lot of people they directly jump
on part in on Android that's not a good
idea you will get stuck in between you
will get stuck somewhere and it is
difficult for you to go come out again
yeah okay so that's great now let's go
for the next question a big fan of your
videos okay thanks so much
I have a doubt Java can expect scope of
Java with 10 more 10 more years now why
you are concerned about 10 years I live
in a world where technology is changing
very fast right I mean think about this
the mobile phone which you which you are
using three years back that four is not
even you getting used now so technology
is changing very fast meaning two years
maybe the the language stuff which you
are using now PHP Ruby Java or nothing
will be there in two years what you can
do technology may change right you just
have to evolve but for sure Java will be
there for a longer time I cannot say ten
years maybe I cannot even say two years
I cannot see what even say five years
but it will be there it will not be
getting replaced by a new language but
yes if the technology changes example
even the CPU world is moving from the
silicon chip to quantum computers and if
you have a quantum computers there will
be lot of change
maybe Java will not be there so don't
think about 10 years if you really want
to focus on something at least focus for
two or three years it is good for two to
three
that's fine because while you're working
on something example let's say if you
are working on Java now and you realize
okay we got a new language let's say
Scala my god
but sniffing it's it will not take much
time to ablate right so do that I guess
we are facing a lot of issues with the
buffering so maybe we can't do this or
some other day buffering is it working
start walking okay it's more video less
buffering or more buffering last video
okay so that's bad so it's only bump so
much.i buffering is happening there okay
so let me just go with two more
questions and then we can stop this
session because there's so many issues
again I will go live again because maybe
I will okay so after this session after
this session you can catch me in my new
channel which is now in 20 so I will go
live on that as well after this after
this video but just search for now in 20
you will need to take you there okay so
one more question from audience a
prominent name in YouTube voltage
Veronica that's thanks so much I never
imagined that's okay so my question is
when you are going to step into big data
a data science machine learning okay so
I'll I'm getting into big data soon okay
I'm getting into big data or machine
learning or blockchain so I have this
three slashes there I'm still yet to
decide we should to go for so it will be
either big data slash machine learning
slash maybe I will do all this thing
together because I have this bad habit
of learning new things you know there's
one thing which with me unless is a good
thing or a bad thing I want to learn
more thing every day you know if I if I
have one day when I'm when I have not
learned anything new I don't feel hurt
somebody I feel demotivated I will get
into this field soon because these
things are troubling if not every day
every day you can imagine I don't mean
this there are some words of machine
learning a bunch of data
no big data they are coming around and
saying hey learn me learn they learn me
and then I'm gonna confuse oh okay not
you now not you now I'm busy with data
structures so that's what that's that's
a bad thing about me so one more
question last question go Java is enough
to start yes good job okay so that's
that's that the answer not the question
for someone
okay witnesses witness says make us
slack channel okay we'll think about it
just like oh sorry it's like we have a
channel that but we have a slack channel
okay I forgot okay so I keep saying it a
bit started yes I have a github videos
just go to my playlist and search for
Geeta I do have a bit of videos there
but movies are coming on guitar as well
so yeah that's it everyone
I enjoy today's session I don't know why
but I enjoyed it
maybe because of the buffering so that's
it everyone
a lot of buffering some see you will be
in the next live chat on the Nvidia
d-link yeah sure so that's it everyone
oh boy se-eun d see you next day maybe
this week itself so we'll do a live
session in the weakest as well somewhere
went but I get some time in the
afternoon I am you can watch me there
probably one okay say it is bar I cannot
say any by that okay yes sir okay
preserve says okay
found oh you have given the wrong link
ma'am it's working for you it's not
working for me as well check the link
once again okay so I will I will just
enter and this video and I will make a
lengthy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
