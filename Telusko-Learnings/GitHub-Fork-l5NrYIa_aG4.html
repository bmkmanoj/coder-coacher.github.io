can you work with two different branches
right so remember in we had two branches
one is master and we had good half now
we can have some more branches if you if
you think that you have multiple
developers and they want to work on
separate branch you can do that but what
if you have someone who is not in your
team but you want to contribute normally
what happens is when you work on open
source project
there are people who want to contribute
in your project now in this what we will
do is if I go back to code and you can
see we have two files right in a master
branch we have read me file and we have
recipes now let me create one more file
here but then I don't know how to do
that stuff and we have someone in the
open-source community who want to
contribute so let's say that person is
me so I will open my repository here so
there's my personal repository now being
ready to 0 and if I want to contribute
how would I do that so what I would do
is are in this project and this are in
this repository I want to create another
file called as pizza dot txt so I want
to define how to make these are our how
I want to make a recipe for Pisa I love
pizza by the way okay so how do I
contribute so what I will do is I will
go that is called training in fact or
there are two ways one you can search
for that you can search for the disc or
training slash the project name which is
in this case let me just search check
the project name it is a task so there
is code training
slash tusks this is one way or you can
get the link from the comic creator so
once you get this link this is the
project I want to contribute here so
what I will do is if I want to
contribute I cannot change this file
right I cannot create a new file here
which we don't have a choice against
that so if you click on this create new
file let's see what happens so if I
click on this create new file you can
see it is giving you the option but see
the message here it says you are
creating a new video getting a file in a
project you don't have a right access to
it unfortunately
not here but then can you see that we
have created a fork of this project
normally what happens is whenever you
try to edit the file it will fork a
project in your repository so this is
how you can do it the another way is
going to click on this fork and will
give you the project I will go back here
and I will enter the file name I will
say the file name is pizza dot txt now I
was like the recipe so I will say recipe
created by recipes from naveen's ready
and I'm a very good cook so what I do if
I want to make a pizza I will say there
are some steps to do it first a step one
go to a Domino's calm and step two
select the is there and order that's it
so this is how I make pizza ok so I
don't make these I advise from some some
pizza parlor ok so once I've done this I
will say created pizza dot txt that's my
message I will say propose this file or
propose the proposed new file now this
is the file which I have created right
so I will click on this propose new file
and it should get a file but then
question arise where it will fit a file
as you can see if I go to my branch I
will see that file there but where the
file is created and the file name is
bigger or txt you have added this number
of lines and I will say create a pull
request so once you click on this create
post request it says ok what is the
message you want to say and you can see
it's a is able to merge the branches can
be automatically merged that's awesome
you know
and I would say create pull requests
now the request is sent to who it has
sent to they just cause training or that
straight the request is sent
automatically we are not doing anything
and the branch is patch one is with the
branch maybe so if I go down it says
there is no conflict and you can click
on comment ok anything left here
everything seems coach you have added 9
lines but those there is no deletion of
the line if I go to code and if I see oh
ok
it is my project let me just go to my
deposit please
okay this is my if I click on
repositories' now this is the deposit to
which I have created call it task 1 if I
click on that there should be a file
called as visa or not here this is my
master branch it is there in patch 1
okay can you see that it is we have
pizza dot 1 so this patch 1 is my the
positive name of this this is my branch
name we have missed the steps on line
between so you can see the guard Pizza
dot txt and the got a pizza recipe here
so this there is me right it is very in
my depository what about periscope
training which is the original
repository if I live flash of course it
is not there in the master again so that
it is not there and we don't even have
patch 1 here because patch 1 is only for
now energy account how would I get those
changes here it's very easy actually you
can simply click on this pull the
question so that sound there from my
account from my personal account down
sending a post request to this
particular account and it pays good
these are txt now as a police code click
or then use code training owner I will
check ok so this guy called 7/2 ID has
sent a new request and in that request
let me just check what are things we
have it says credit pizza but I want to
verify what is that
so if I open that it says the recipe is
from the oven ready and this was recipe
that sounds good again this actually
doesn't sound good because I am NOT
making a pizza here and modeling Pisa
but for this thing it's okay you know
so I will see the recipe and everything
seems good I will click on merge pull
request if everything was good then only
I will say much positive wish if I think
is not that the code which is sent from
the from the person or the contributor
it's not suitable for this project I
will send in some feedback I will say ok
we are the work which you have done is
awesome but then if you can change
method number you can change two methods
they're equally good so that's how you
can send back your response otherwise
everything is good you can say confirm
merge it should happen and nothing ok it
is done I guess it is done go back to
our
and Tennessee - you got pizza dot txt
now this is about txt is not gated by
you it is created by one of the
contributors right and you can select
the contributors no matter g20 that's
great and you got here of you got your
fees are there so this is how someone
else can contribute in your project and
you can see we go also got a
notification here so pork one that means
one of the contributor has walked your
project now what you can do is you can
have your own get up account search for
that is quite does grant expert winning
tasks this one you will find this link
in description area which I will make
sure that you have that link create a
four create a request great new files
and send a pull request to me so if I
think your recipe is good I will accept
the request
otherwise I will I will reject your
oppose the quest so let's see how many
things how many requests I get in in
next two days so that's it that's how
you anyone else can contribute in your
project that's how we can use fork and
so that's it from this video guys I hope
