default methods into in this video we'll
see another aspect of interface so in JA
1.8 they have also provided one more
feature let me remove this one so we
have an interface here and we have a
class which is interface demo so what
I've worn now is in this interface I
don't want any method which is declared
but I want or let's say we have a
declared method there
I want a method definition here so let's
say if I say default void show so I'll
say hi but it's I want to call this show
now the only way to call this show
method is using the object of demo right
and unfortunately we cannot get object
of interface so what we normally do is
we get a class which implements the
interface and then we create the object
of the interface object of the class
those are the long steps right so if you
have a method and you want to call that
method only with the interface you can
also create a static method now an
interface which is something new again
in Java 8 now you can define static
methods okay there's the first time in
Java where you have static methods or
interface and to call those methods we
just have to say interface name it is
demo demo dot show okay we don't have to
create the object of it it's so simple
you can see we got the output as hi so
now in interface we can have static
methods so we don't need object to call
the static methods right okay that's one
but can we have variables in interface
of e we can have abstract methods we can
have default methods we can have static
methods now can I have variables let's
try so if I go back if I go up here if I
say int I there is an error
it says blank field I okay so we have to
it is company for us to initialize the
variable let's say I equal to 8 and it's
walking you can see let's say this is
numb okay so we have int Nam equal to 8
that means we can create a variable and
here if I go to my main or maybe some
other class let's say we have a class
here let's say this is demo infill again
which implements demo and here if I say
ain't can I change the way can I have a
method really let's say public void a
we see the same method which we which
which was there earlier and in this if I
say num equal to nine and we got the ED
of the Elders it says the final field
the demo dot num a hold on that means we
have not written any final final thing
here right so by default if you create a
variable inside the interface it becomes
a constant so whenever you create a
variable inside the interface it becomes
a constant variable because by default
even if you don't write we have a final
keyword there so even if you don't try
its final it is there it is already
final so whenever you create a variable
inside the interface it becomes final
okay so that is that is something every
member we can create the variable but
that variable will be a final variable
second we can have default methods we
can have static methods and we can have
abstract methods so that's about that's
about interfaces or all interfaces we
have talked about so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
