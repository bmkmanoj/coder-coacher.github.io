join and alive method so to understand
that what we'll do here is let's say
after printing this thing after printing
everything I want to print by so we'll
say system dot out dot println here I
want to print by ok so I'm expecting
that this by will be printed after hi
and I mean after printing all this stuff
at the end we wanted by so if I on this
code now something we would happen right
we got by here itself now why we got by
there is because when you say t1 dot
start and t2 dot start so we got two new
threads right so t1 is one thread which
is executing this hi t2 is another
thread which is executing this part what
about the main thread by default we do
have a main thread right so main thing
is doing that thing because this two
things which is hi and hello is printed
by t1 and t2 so main thread says okay I
don't have any job so I will do I will
print the remaining thing which is by so
my job is to print by the right and
that's why when you say t1 dot start it
will print hi it is going for a pause
right by the time t2 starts but before
you want T 2 goes here and executes your
main is printing this what we need to do
is we need to ask main hey main just
wait you know I'm just mainly just wait
wait for this to twist to complete their
task once t1 and t2 done with their job
then only you go for your your execution
how can this do that so we have to say T
1 dot join so join is a method which
will which we use is so John what join
will do is join will join will make your
main thread to wait for t1 and t2 to
join again so as you can see in this
image we have initially only one three
B's main thread and from main thread we
caught two new threads we got t1 and t2
right so t1 and t2 the executing their
job and main thread is continuing there
right so as soon as t1 and t2 done with
their job they will combine with the
main thread and then mentally execute by
so that join will wait for that
particular point which is that you can
see in the circle there so that it will
wait for that particular point
but the thing is it may throw an
exception so we'll handle will use
throws exception here okay
so we'll use we are using closed
exception and now if you learn this code
you can see by you will be getting by at
the end you can see we got at the end so
that's the use of join
so what join will do is join will wait
for t1 to join and t2 for join here now
what we'll do is this is one more method
which we can use is something was alive
so let's say before join if I'm saying
if I want to check if t1 is alive so we
can check if T 1 dot alive or he's alive
and if I have this code you can see
somebody will be getting true because t1
is alive there okay but if you write the
same stuff if you check the same stuff
up to join because once you are t1
joined with the main method and if I run
this code now after joining waiting for
that time and you can see we got false
so is alive some method using which you
can I should detect if you're ready is
in a darling street or not okay so once
your tread job is done
it will be dead so we can check that
with the help of is a live method okay
and so yeah that's about join and that's
about it is alive so that's about this
video in the next video we'll talk about
some new concepts in race</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
