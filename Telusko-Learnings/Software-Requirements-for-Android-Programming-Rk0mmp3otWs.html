download all the software's which is
required to work on Android studio or to
work on Android programming so this is
this is the software required to work
with Android so this is Android studio
it is specifically designed by just
powered by IntelliJ so if you open
Android studio you can see that just it
is created by IntelliJ so even if I go
to about Android it is the Android
version we are working with so it is one
point five point one it is released in
last year December so this this is what
we require to work with Android but
question arises how to install this so
the first thing we require a is JDK so
you just have to go to Google and go to
Google okay so let's search for the
setup which is JDK so for JDK we have to
search for JDK download and then it will
take to a web page which is the first
one this is the Oracle official website
to download JDK so just search for JDK
here you can see we have JDK when you
click on this download button you have
to accept the agreement you don't have
choice and then depend upon which type
of ice you are working with if you are
working with Linux or Mac or maybe
Windows so you can select the particular
version you're working with so let's say
if you have Windows 8 or Windows 7 64
bit you can click on this JDK H again
the latest version of JDK is JDK 1.8 so
if you know about a Linux user you can
download this one dot a dot Z and then
you can install in a particular way so
if you are using Linux you know how to
install software right so there are
certain steps when you install with
Linux but for mac and Windows it is very
easy to download or install so download
setup and install it directly so that's
how that's how you will get JDK
installed now with JDK you also need
something called as SDK which is
software development kit for Android so
just search for Android studio depend
upon which OS you're working with may be
Windows or Mac or Linux so just search
for Android studio it will take to the
official website of Android
or understood you which is
developer.android.com if you put his
website it will ask you to download
Android studio depend upon which again
depend upon your OS version it will
change since I'm using Mac here so
automatic it detects the yard OS and it
says download Android studio for Mac if
you're using Windows or Linux it will
show you that particular version here so
when you click on this button here it
will again it will ask you for the
agreement you have to date this argument
and then click on I accept download the
Android studio so you can see it is
approx 50 MB so depend upon if you are
using yeah so it will be it will it will
be downloaded since I am using a very
slow internet here so it will take some
time
oh so after downloading this you have to
install SDK so inside this only you will
be getting SDK setup so you will be
getting both this office here Android
studio plus SDK okay
so once you installed Android studio and
SDK with that next next next next next
series
you will be getting under studio so even
after installation you have to do some
settings I will do that settings in the
next video so once you install and you
study which this is how it should look
like the Android studio and to work with
emulator you have you require so this is
how your Android emulator looks like so
just have to unlock this again just is
it working not just not working so you
just have to you have to make sure you
have a Android studio and SDK to start
with so so complete this task and then
what's the next video where we start
with the first application in Android
studio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
