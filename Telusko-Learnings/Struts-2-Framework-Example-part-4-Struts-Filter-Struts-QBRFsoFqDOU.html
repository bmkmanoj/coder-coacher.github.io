earlier what we have done is we have
created this action which is hello
starts and then if we have created this
this index dot JSP
so we are using our stores library here
which is starch tag and we are creating
a form which belongs to against Earth so
when we click on submit it will fetch
this username and it will assign that he
this username to this action username
which is username right and then when
you click on this submit it will call
the action which is hello stores but if
you can observe here when you create a
servlet you map your servlet somewhere
and that is web dot XML right but when
you create a action have we done any
mapping no right so whenever you click
on a submit so by default the request
will go to web dot XML so what we need
here is we have to put it up after XML
so by default I don't have a XML file of
an XML file so let's create our XML file
so we'll say right click new you can
find here there is something called a
standard deployment descriptor or you
can choose others and this web and web
you will see there is something called a
standard deployment descriptor
if you send next this will give you the
name which is for XML file and click on
finish so this is your web dot XML file
this this is your web browser will file
you now we have to do some configuration
like when you click on that button we
have to inform your web directs ml that
this request need to handled by
starts not by you because all the
requests by default it will come to web
Dahl XML we just have to forward that
request to starts so in order to achieve
that we need to use something called as
filters so for filter weight we need to
use some tags called as filters again I
will not type those tags I have already
defined those tags here so what I can do
is I will use this this tag and copy and
we'll paste in my clips it means
okay so what you can do is you can just
copy paste this this thing which is
filter and filter mapping now so with
the version of the glass we need to use
here is it starts prepare and execute
filter so this this class is responsible
to forward your request to this third
store XML file so we'll for which type
of request we to use stores so we are
saying star which means for all the
requests we are we need to use studs
okay so using filter you can forward the
request from your XML web dice ml
deployment descriptor to these store
store XML but hold on do we have a star
XML file you know right so we need to
create store store XML also but you have
to make sure that your stars dot XML you
will belong to your source package it
should be in a class path so let's get
XML document and it will name is a
simple document as starts with a next
we'll make it well format document and
we'll say finish
now when you say well-formed document
you will get this thing here aiex ml tag
and a root tag so but what we need here
is we need to use some XML tags or
starch tag so for that what we have to
do is we have to copy this code and we
can paste it in over XML file ok so now
so what we have here we have Apache we
have this start apache DTD and then we
have a package name which is which
exchange does default here ok so what
how it works so when you click on this
submit button this submit button will
will call a web doc sam'l file it says
for all the requests you have to you
have to shift this request to start on
XML and this it will check okay what's
the request request is for hello starts
I will forward this request to a class
called as hello stores but this class
hello stores belongs to a package called
as comm dot now in dot hello starts
right now if you see here they
hello studs it it has a method called as
execute so every time you click on that
button it will go to web door XML so
when you click on this button submit it
will go to web directs ml in this vector
is similar to forward this request to
stir store XML in this store shot XML it
will check for the class name and since
it's the starts it will call the method
which is action or execution so it will
call this method well as execution okay
and in the execution what we are doing
very turning a success right so we're
returning the success that means this is
that success which we are returning
there so if you'll return there may be
failure so we have to write failure you
so in case of success it will call which
page which is indexed or JSP you can
also define a different result so you
can now specify result here which with
name we can say it is may be error in
case of error we will call either dot
GSB we have not created that page here
but we can create a page and we can name
it has ever got JSP so this method
executes may return different event
statement may be a different different
string may be success may be error may
be login so all this will come here so
it will check for the result if the
result is success then this page if the
result is error then this page so this
like our if-else condition ok but this
time we are not going for this result so
let me remove this so the only thing you
have to remember here we have to mention
action and a result type so if you
mention a cell type which is success it
will call anything start JSP clear so
this is what the configuration we have
to complete first now once you done with
the car this configuration will try to
run this code and how to run this code
that we'll see in the next part of a
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
