have talked about why we need abstract
class in this video we talked about
interfaces so there's a lots of
confusion between interfaces and
abstract classes for some people so to
try to understand what the difference is
and how we can use it when to use watch
just to define that first understand
what is interfaces so just to understand
what is interfaces we'll start with an
example whether we start with abstract
class and it will move will move towards
interfaces just to see the importance of
interfaces so let's say we have these
two classes pen and pencil as we have
discussed in the last video where we
have told you to do the assignment on
this right so make sure you complete the
assignment that I mean that assignment
before going for this so we have plus
pen and class pencil and we have a class
for asked it so this kit class has a
method let's do something so in this do
something if I pass the object of pen so
let's say pen P and in this we have a
method for has public void right okay so
we have a method which is right which
writes something let's say I'm a pen so
it writes I'm a pen and then in this
pencil I have the same method which
writes something else so in this we'll
say this I'm pencil simple and if I pass
the object of pen in do something what
pen will do it will simply say right but
that's what we can do it I write that
nothing else to call to call this method
do something we have to get object of
kit right so we are saying kit k equal
to new kit and then I will say kit I
mean k-touch
do something so in order to do something
you have to pass the object of pen right
so let's get object of pen here okay
let's get a pen object will say pen P
equal to new pen and if I pass the
object P here and if I run this code you
can see it is printing I'm a I'm a pen
but if I pass pencil if I played the
odds of pencil not pen I will say a
pencil equal to or PC equal to new
pencil and if I pass the object of PC
here you can see it is giving you other
because we don't have any methods which
says do something and which accepts
pencil so for that we have to get
you object we have to get one more
method right which is do something with
accept pencil and the solution for that
is what we have what we came up with the
solution is we'll get a class and we'll
name this class as writer and this
writer class will have a method which is
public void right because composite you
have that method which does nothing ok
this class does nothing and all these
classes are depend class and prints a
class will expand writer okay both this
class will extend writer the advantages
now you can create a reference of a
super class and we can create the
observe subclass as we have seen the in
last videos and now if you pass PC issue
of accepting pen if you accept our idea
it doesn't matter which writer you are
getting right even pen is a writer
pencils writer it doesn't matter which
writer you are getting you just have to
call P dot right so now if I call if I
pass the object of PC that means I'm
passing a pencil it will call the method
I so it will call the write method of
pencil if I pass P it will call the
write method of pen said I'm passing PC
now which is the object of pencil you
can see record the output as I'm a
pencil because we are passing the object
of pencil so this P will they take the
write method from pencil now if you
observe this class here this is I mean
this method it is doing nothing right
then try to define that method when we
can declare it and when you declare the
method we have to write it abstract and
we can make this class as an abstract
class now everything everything works
fine right we have we're doing abstract
from last two videos and everything will
work fine there is no error here because
we are not creating object of light of
we are creating a reference of right oh
you can see we are getting reference of
right and an object of pencil so there's
nothing wrong there but the problem is
let's say in future you have a pen class
which also want to extend one more class
let's say
pen is a class which want to extends
more class let's say that more classes
let's say ABC now unfortunately if right
is our class and ABC is the class we
have two classes in Java we cannot
achieve multiple inheritance right
because if one class exchange two
classes this is multiple inheritance
right and Java doesn't support multiple
inheritance then how to do that just
achieve that can we make so because the
problem is this the idea is a class and
that's why it's not working right but if
you make writer instead of using
abstract class we can make it as an
interface because if you make something
interface instead of saying extends way
to say implements so we when we work
with class we say extends when we work
with interface we have to say implements
so this clasp and implements all right
on so I can say we are saying to face
veto so clasp and implements writer and
we can do that he rolls and now if we
have any class let's say if you have a
class a I mean if you have class ABC you
can say extends ABC exchange say BC
implements whiteout even do you can do
that the problem here is we don't have
any class plays ABC that's why I say so
but let's say if you have a class ABC
you can do that you can say clasp and
extends ABC we can exchange one class
and we can implement any number of
interfaces we want
so that is interface so what is
interface interface is same like
abstract class the differences in
abstract class we can have abstract
methods we can also have normal methods
example methods which you can define but
in interface we can have all the methods
which are abstract so you cannot define
them as an example if I try to define a
method we saw if I say public void show
you can see we are getting an error it
says you cannot so abstract methods do
not specify a body so in interface you
cannot define any method you can only
declare it so by default all the methods
and interface are public abstract so I
don't have to mention those two keywords
they're public app there's something
which it assumes so if you create any
method in an interface they are by
default public abstract pause remember
whenever you extend the class you say
extends whenever you work with
interfaces we have to say implements
okay and the same thing we can create
the reference of interface but we cannot
create the object of it so we cannot
create object of interface we can only
create reference of it I hope that makes
sense
so this is interface now was the main
difference we can achieve multiple
inheritance I mean we can achieve
multiple entry can implement multiple
interfaces but we cannot do multiple we
cannot extend multiple classes as it
does it false difference second all the
methods interface are by default
big abstracts so that means you cannot
define it that's the main difference
between abstract class interface given a
choice always go for interfaces is
because maybe in future someone wants to
implement your interface so it is always
better to use interfaces if you don't
want to define methods yeah if you want
to define methods you can go for
abstract classes
that's about interfaces if we have seen
the basics of interfaces in the next
video we'll talk about some most of nth
of interface how it can how can we
create object of interface is another
anonymous class and all those stuff
that's it from this video thank you so
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
