ready in the last video we have talked
about how do you provide this login
access right so we can enter user name
and password and you will get
authenticated but then you know of we
are verifying so if I go to my login dot
Java you can see we are verifying using
the static values we have a terrace CO
and L as a username password now this is
not how we write code right we always
make sure that the data is there is
coming from database but question arises
how do we do that here we have not done
any job database code yet right so the
best thing would be you have to create a
database first and let's populate our
database so that we can verify so step
one let's create a database so again you
can use any database which you like you
can go for my skill you can go for post
base you can go for Oracle which is your
favorite I will go for my skill here
because this is my favorite IFI open my
skull workbench this is the GUI version
right and I already have a local
instance created here and if you don't
know how do you have to use this do
watch my video on how to use MySQL
workbench but if you already know that's
let's continue so first of all we have
to create created our database right in
fact we I do have lots of databases here
but let me create one or me let me use
mine I mean database as you can see we
already have an immediate abyss here I
will use that one in that database I do
have some tables but ignore those tables
for time being I will say create ok
we'll say use Naveen first I will say
use Naveen so I'm using this database
and now I want to create a table so I
will say create table and when I
mentioned the table name as let's say
login I mean there should be a logical
name for this login will do for this
example I was a login and in this login
I want some fields right so I will say
the first is username that is you name
off type vodka which will which will be
of length 20 and then we'll be having a
password it will say password and again
this one instead of saying password it
will simply say pass and we'll say this
is Val cat and this is also 20 again
people you can have more than
2020 text so you can change it and that
way you can have a username of 50
writers if you can have a password of
thunder letters if you want to torture
your audience or your cost or you're
blind okay we got this table here let me
execute this query and you can see the
got our tables ready now let's insert
some data here just some demo data so
that you can verify we'll say insert
into login there should be a relation
form for this again you can write your
code you can create a form for a user to
the user of themselves but time and
let's imagine if you already have data
here so I will say insert into login
values I'm inserting some values here I
will say the name is Naveen obvious if
you have a small data n so that's my
username Naveen and my password would be
let's say nine okay this is my password
which is nine eight seven six again that
you can have any password there so let
me just run this query let's see if you
getting inserted and everything is fine
it's got inserted let's have one more
dummy value let's say this is um we can
have any one we can say tasks and the
password for task would be lets say task
we have a username and password both as
does so if I love this query you can see
it is working let's find the correct
what you just to verify if it got is
each other so if I select star from
login and if I says one you can see it
is working we got nubbin nine eight
seven six and we got dusk and touch that
that sounds good right now what's the
next thing the next thing is once you go
to database already once you got a table
let's verify using using Java code now
how do I do that
now first of all when you say you want
to verify you this is not the right way
right this is not the right way of
verifying it normally whenever you want
to connect to a database there are
different layers we go we work with this
is not a big application we can write
the Java pod here itself in fact we can
write the Java code and this in this
method itself you should ensure of this
if condition here we can write the Java
code but then what will make more sense
is if you create a separate class
because whenever you work with database
it's having a separate class we'll
always I mean it
if you also give some advantage and that
separate class will always be in a
different package okay not compulsory
but then it's better to have that in
that way I would say this is logging
down now now is a special keyword which
you should know now simply means no it's
not a keyword but it's a standard we
always use now stands for data access
object so any way you want to interact
with data base it's better to work with
Dao classes and I would say this is
belongs to Dao package again you can
look and use logins repository you can
say log in database you can say anything
you want but now makes more sense and if
I click on finish you got your class
your Dao class now interest Dao class I
will be having a method called as public
and I will say this method will return
boolean so if you want to verify if the
login was successful you will say true
if the login field you can say false I
will say check details or check your
initials we can you can use anything
there we can say check details or we can
say only check okay I think will do
right so against I take videos take
credentials so let's have a check method
which will take two parameters one is
username and the second one is password
right both need to be taken what will be
taken here and once you've got this
values let's return false by default it
will be false right
okay now how do you verify so first of
all to connect with database we have to
write certain steps now if you have if
you know how to work with JDBC you can
continue otherwise what I would
recommend is if you are not learned JDBC
before do watch my video on derivative
first because that then it will make
more sense you will find those videos in
the description area so make sure you do
that you know how to use how to work
with JDBC now first of all when you work
when you want to work with JDBC we work
with different above DBMS right in this
example I am working with mask you maybe
you want to work with Oracle for
different DBMS we have different Java
files which you have to work with and
those Java files are normally called as
connectors now question arise from where
I will get the jar file now you have to
choice you can download this jar file
from the internet
okay so many where I guess I already
have that Java here so if I say a mask
you'll connector you can see I do have
that file this mask for connector I just
have to say show all in finder okay I do
have that somewhere okay if I want to
check the location for this I will say a
ribbon in finder okay if you're using
Windows you can you can actually search
that whatever we do time beam is I will
put that file on a desktop
right so we just want this macro
connector to be used okay this is one
way the another way is you can actually
get the java file using mavin so if you
have if you have family with maven you
can convert this existing project into
mavin okay and then you can add your
java file are not needed in this project
but then you know we can actually try it
out so we can right click here and you
can say configure click on convert to my
own project you will get a mavin project
and you can add that jar file using just
a text again it's your choice time being
I will not converge to mavin let's use
the same project so when you want to use
the same project what you have to do is
you have to paste that Java file in this
Lib folder so push it here and you can
see we got mask o connector now if you
don't have the Java file with you or
what you can do is you can just go to
you can you can use Google to search for
that or you can go to mavin suppository
and in this novel deposit research form
ask your connector ok so if you go here
you can you can select any version I
will prefer the stable version I will go
for PowerPoint 1.41 and you can click on
download jar so this is one way you can
download ok
but using mavin it will be very easy but
ok it's your choice again so this is
where you will get this jar file just
click on download you will get the jar
file just add it in the lick folder now
we have to also add that because for
developer developing also we need that
so we'll go to properties we'll go to
Java build path and here as well I will
add that particular jar file so we'll
click on add jar files I will navigate
to my desktop i will say Maya vector
done okay
now let's write our steps the first step
is you have to create you have to load
the class I will say class dot for
named ignore that error of eclipse so
yeah class dot Ford name and inside this
you have to mention comm dot MySQL
what's happening conduct MySQL JDBC dot
driver okay we got our class oh it might
show an exception so let's everything
let's put everything inside our try
block okay and let's generalize it to
exception so that I don't have to write
write log once again okay so we got
class dot quad name the next step you
have to create a connection object will
say connection con equal to a driver
manager dot gate connection again there
are multiple ways of getting this
connection object we can use data source
we can use here we can use data source
we can use a different tools available
right or we can use the did a connection
pooling concept but time and let's make
it simple I will simply use our URL here
what database I will say string URL and
the URL for my SQL is JDBC : mask ul :
double slash localhost colon 3 3 0 6 as
DBMS changes this link will also change
and the my database name is Naveen right
so we got this thing we got URL here the
next thing is using in we got user name
we got this user name and the username
is root and we'll say strings password
is equal to 0 for my case the posture is
0 okay so we got to see waddles then we
got a username and we got a password
right so we need to three things so we
got you waters we got user name and you
got password I guess I don't know why
they're giving that symbol just ignore
okay just ignore that
ok so we got you others username and
password the next step is you have to
get a statement object this is databases
steps right again if you're not familiar
with this do watch my videos on JDBC
that will make more sense okay let's say
a clear statement odd up
the batch statement will make more sense
here because I am passing the values
right so a prepared statement but then
how will you fire this quadrant now that
is that is important right
what query you will fire now how to
verify we have that username and
password is correct
now that different ways of implementing
it what you can do is you can you can
fetch the entire table and you can
verify each and every record you can run
a loop and you can navigate to the loop
you can find the user in the password is
matching or not but then don't you think
you are fetching the entire table that
doesn't make sense right so what I will
do is I will create a query which will
be bit efficient than normal query will
say select will say select star from a
from login but then where I will say
where you name is equal to question mark
and past is equal to question mark now
will replace those question marks okay
first of all let me just write it as
cool here
will replace those question mark will
say such string lip let's suppose the
first question mark with you name and
let's replace oh I just made a mistake
here the problem is this password and
this person is saying I will make this
as pass okay that will be better and
this would be the password for the
database which is this one so this is my
password this is database password
that's weird I know I will say st dot
set string and we say - and this will be
pass okay what will happen now is when
you fire the query example if I say
username is novena and Paso is any
password so it will try to match if it
will try to match this thing with the
database and of course if I have my
entry there with that username and
password it was returned something
otherwise it returns nothing that's what
we want to do we just have to fire the
query will say result set RS let's input
the package and I would say st dot
execute query now if if I simply check
if R is dot next if there is a record
then return true it's that simple this
is what we want to do okay let me just
do this once again let's say if I enter
a username and password ok the username
which I enter now is Naveen and the
password is nine eight seven six so the
far the query would be select star okay
the query will be come
select star from login where you name is
equal to a Naveen and the password of
the past in this case is equal to nine
eight seven six if this is the data
which I'm entering in this in the while
login and if I don't ask where you can
see we got a recording but let's see if
I make a mistake let's say if I am
entering a wrong password now in this
scenario if I run this query you can see
we got nothing that's what we want to do
if if we got something off to find
equality that means it is a valid user
otherwise is not a valid user is that
simple right now once you once we have
done this code let's go back here and
let's create an object of login tao
again you can create an object anywhere
you can create a reference of somebody
here or just for this example not a good
practice again i'm creating the object
it's inside this I would say login tao
wizard au equal to new login tao let's
input the package as well here itself
let's import the package
okay package is bought it and here i
would say instead of checking that thing
will say dao dot a check with that
username and particular password
whatever username password you've got
and that's it your job is done if it is
verified if it is work otherwise it will
not work let's verify let's run this
code right click run as the non server I
think it should work let's verify it's
running it's running it's running
waiting for the console waiting for the
browser to pop up okay I got my Firefox
browser here hey I don't want to make
your default path default browser okay
so if I say welcome dodgy SC now and you
can see we got the login page let's
verify with the disco and L and this
will not work of course because I don't
have that data there the data which I
have is Naveen and the password is nine
seven okay no that is nine eight seven
six if I click on login you can see it
is working now right if I go back if I
log out and if I give a wrong data
example if I said task and task one if I
give a long password you can see it is
not working is it it's not working I can
see that but if I give a right username
and right password task it's we got the
login right so that's how we can verify
with database so try it out and let me
know if you have a better solution in
the in the comment section so if you
think we have we do have a better
solution than this comment section is
the point for you so that if I feel like
is better I will make I will surely make
a video on that as well
and yeah so we have we are expanding
this project like anything we are okay
so we got the login now with the help of
database maybe in the next video we'll
talk about how to do client-side
validation right so make sure that you
subscribe channel to get the gist of it
and that's it thank you so much for
