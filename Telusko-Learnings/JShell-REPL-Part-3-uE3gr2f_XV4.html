in this video we'll talk about our
different commands so we have always
seen all these commands listed here
let's try to explore some more commands
and some more operations now before
opening this J shell again what I did is
I changed my folder now currently I'm in
Java 9 folder again we'll talk about
that why I have shifted to a different
folder and so it's a simple folder which
is called a Java 9 it's there on desktop
so it is on my machine so what exactly I
have this in this folder is I have these
three files we have alien dot java we
have demo and we have seen this demo
before in the first video right now
let's go back here and let's say CLS and
let's go back to jail so I will say J
shell ok we are into J shell now so
let's try to let's try to do something
else now so what I will do is the first
thing I want to do is I want to create
some variables because if I say if I
save as now using this vast command you
can see all the available variables in
your in your J shell now we have not get
it any variable yet right so what we'll
do is we'll say int I equal to 9 so
that's my first variable we'll say int
num is equal to 3 and we'll say double D
is equal to nine point two and you can
see we got three values we can also
create some other variables of some
classes we will see that later so if I
save as now and you can see we call
these three variables now can I create a
variable of a class and will it be
listed here let's try over perform some
operation like four plus a nine so the
moment you perform an operation you can
see we have a temporary variable here
which is dollar for right so what we can
do is if I say where's again by using up
arrow you can see this is also a
variable which is dollar for here right
so yeah so this makes sense now if I
create a different variable now normally
we have seen scanner so we can get a
scanner variable here I mean scanner
reference or a reference variable but
this time I want to go for J frame now
YJ frame is because not jmj frame now
Jeff name belongs to a different package
right so before we have worked on
scanner we have worked with string class
now all these classes are by default
imported thanks to our default imports
you can see we have all these imports
here but what if you want to use a class
which is not inside this so what we
normally do is we we import the class by
ourselves by saying import and back into
input and the package name or the class
name what we were doing here is let's
use J frame and let's see how can we do
we have any shortcut to do that because
I don't want to import the package by
myself right we are using J shell a
powerful tool so we'll J shell will do
it for you let's try so there's a
shortcut for Windows if you are using
Windows machine again I'm not sure about
different OS shortcuts but specifically
in Windows what we can do is you can say
shift tab so just press shift tab and
resisting this is the buttons and then
say I so let me repeat type shift and
tab and press shift and tab and then
release the buttons and then press I now
it will give you two choices will say do
nothing or input of course I want two
inputs I will say one that's a choice
and you can say it's a is imported Java
X swing jframe and now you can quit
object of jail flames I will say J frame
F equals your new jframe and you got an
object of j flame now and you can see it
works you got object now if i save as
once again if i save as you can see we
got j frame reference as well of course
with the value we the fall value what
but it doesn't matter so yeah so we got
different record different variables so
the point remember you can use shortcuts
to fix the imports but how do you know
what our shortcuts available it's very
simple if you simply say help and if you
type shortcuts shortcuts you can see it
will give you those three shortcuts it
will say tabs for getting the I mean for
completion completion of your code maybe
it will give you some suggestions if you
say Shift + tab + V it will help you in
completing the expression again I will
see I will show you in some time and we
have shift tab I for fixing the imports
so you can see we have a steps here I
guess if you are using different
different OS and if you say help
shortcut it will give you that
a shortcut so it is for Windows so I
fell using Mac just try this and it will
give it will show you the shortcuts okay
now how do what is this V so we know
about I now we can input the input we
can import stuff what is B here now
let's say if I'm using a if I'm if I'm
saying nine now I want to store this
nine in a variable or maybe nine plus
two I want to store this operation or
variable what we can simply do is we can
say shift tab and V now you can see that
the moment you do that it will give you
it will create a variable for you it
will it is saying int because nine plus
two will give you ain't what it is
asking you for it was asking you for a
name right of course it will not give
you a name by default so you will say
key any variable doesn't matter you can
see we got key as 11 so if you want to
create a variable and if you want to
declare a variable you can simply type
shift tab and release the buttons and
press B it will be also applicable for J
flames so if I'm missing a J frame here
and what's that okay let's do that once
again you find say new jframe and if I
say control shift V you can see it is it
has created the it is declaring a
variable now it is asking for the name I
will say my frame and you can say we got
the variable so that's how you can use
those shortcuts okay so we have talked
about we have talked about how to how to
use that shortcuts now what else what
else so now we know we have a we have we
have a command called as vas which will
give you all the variables what about if
I create a method so let's say if I
perform to get a method called as public
what is show
I'm creating a new method now right and
this method will sprint it was simply
have a variable int I equal to nine
that's it
and then if I close this you can see we
got the methyl methacrylate adhere okay
so if I create 10 wait 10 methods how
would I know how many methods I've
created so it's very easy so you can
simply type methods and you can say to
list all the methods which are there so
we can use slash methods for getting the
method names in fact you can also use /m
will it work yeah so it is shortcuts
instead of typing methods you can type
em it will give you all the methods
know what else what about the classes if
I get a plus here let's say class
person I may be class human I love
humans so if I say class human and if I
do if I do not think that if I simply
close this you can see regard the human
class and if I also get an interface
here we can also do that we can say
interface move or maybe interface
moveable and if I declare noting that
I'm keeping it blank just to show you
the effect so if I say so if I want to
know how many classes or interfaces I
have you can simply type types so types
will give you all the list of types we
have human type we have mobile interface
right so if you want to know about
classes interface we can say types so
this will give you all the things so we
got bad vas for variables we got methods
for methods we got types were classes on
interfaces okay this makes sense now
what else we can do here now let's say
if you want to open a predefined file
and that's why I have just shifted to a
different folder right and if I want to
show you the folder in Java 9 folder I
already have a class called as alien if
I open this class alien you can see we
got a class alien which has a string
variable Tech doesn't matter what
variables we have there important is we
got alien class I want to get a same
class in my shell so we can do that
right we can type class alien we can
define it but what if you want to open
up existing file it's very simple you
can simply use a command called as open
so using open first of all it means go
back there yeah so using open we can
what's that let me use this is notepad
on here so using open we can specify
which file you want to open so I will
open alien dot Java
now there one way to do that when you
mention when you mentioned that you are
working with alien now you can get an
object of alien so you can say new alien
alien and you can see it works it you
are getting an object of alien right it
works and even if you say types now you
can see we also got alien so we are not
creating in in class here it's just that
we are opening it so it that class
becomes a part of your gel code alright
it's that simple so you cannot actually
open the existing file what else we can
do now once we okay so only we have done
so many things right and let's say after
doing all these things and now you want
to close your if
you understand on your machine and you
want to work to model now what will
happen is when you send on your machine
when you restart your I mean when you
start your machine again you will not
have the same code right we have created
so many variables we have created so
many types and so many methods how will
you get all these things so you want to
work on the same thing to model what you
will do so before exiting what you can
do is you can save all this command in a
file I will say my code dot txt you can
use txt you can use I need any extension
you want logically if you mentioned jsh
it will make more sense that means the
file is a J shell file right again txt
but also works that's fine and if I do
that you can see it is storing a file
but where if I open my folder you can
see we got my code dot J's such if I
open this with notepad plus plus you can
see we have we have all the commands
here so whatever commands we have
executed or everything is available here
right so now next time so let's say
after some time if you are opening a new
shell so let me just do that if I open a
new shell ok well so I will go to
desktop and I will go to Java 9 ok so if
I come back here and if I open J shell
and if I try to use it you know if I
type if I type types you can see we
don't any type here because this is a
new shell so what you can do is you can
load the existing shell existing
commands you can say my codes or you can
send it to your friends as well you can
type in I mean you can execute all the
commands you can send that file to your
friends and they will all they will open
it and once you open the file now what
you can do is if you when you so types
you can see we caught all the types so
yes it is also possible you can use this
thing I mean both the cells are same now
because they all have the same history
right so yeah so that's how you can work
with this do we have some other thing ok
so we have talked about open and save
let me just write it down on a notepad
not here where's my knot it's here yeah
so we have we have save and we have open
so you can save a file you can open a
file that's awesome do we have something
extra so what we can also do is let's
say
if I have a statement so let me just go
back here here okay
and I want to perform an operation let's
say if I want to type eight plus two so
if I if I type eight plus two of course
you will get ten right of it with on a
variable 14 now what if I want to
execute this same command again it's
very easy as we can simply press up
arrow and you can enter you will get the
same operation otherwise what you can do
is you can give us flash and you can
mention foot in and if I say enter you
can see we got the same value of 10 so
what we are doing is we are saying /b so
many ways a slash that means you are
talking to Jay shell right you're not
adding a Java code you are talking to
Jay shell so all you're commanding to
Jay shell that's what it's called as
commands
so when you say 14 here it means videos
- at least you can see in the least
we have 14 which is 8 plus 2 so it will
execute the same statement so we can do
that so example if I say 7 plus 2 now so
we got 16 when I say 16 it will execute
the same thing all what we can do is you
can give a slash and you can give us
exclamation mark even exclamation will
do the same thing it will execute the
last statement so 7 plus 2 you can
execute that so if you want to execute a
particular statement you can go with the
number if you want to execute the
statement you can go with exclamation so
we also have exclamation so slash
exclamation that's awesome
okay one more now if I say bad okay so
you can see we have so many variables
here I don't want this 15 variable
I don't want 15 so what you can also do
is you can mention slash drop and you
can mention 15 okay you can see this you
can drop the variables and now if I say
bad you will not find 15 there you can
also you can also get you can also
remove this num let's try that I will
say drop num and you can see num is gone
now so if I save as you can see we don't
have num there so we also have a drop
command which will drop the variables
you cannot just drop variables you can
drop the classes you can drop the
methods so you can play with it so yeah
that's how that's about Jay shell I have
tried I try to cover most of the things
in J shell once I
I come across new things I will surely
make a video on that so I hope you
enjoyed the entire series on gel and if
you liked it click on the like button

friends on Facebook or whatsapp that's
it thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
