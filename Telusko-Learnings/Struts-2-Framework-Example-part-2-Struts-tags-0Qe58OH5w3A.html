index dot JSP page and what I want is I
want to add some extra tracks tags here
and those tags will be provided by Storz
framework so in order to use those tags
we need to add some extra libraries so
before that let me remove all these
comments
okay so let's add those libraries now
you can see I have I guess on my desktop
I have those libraries so you can see
here I have storage to Lib using which
in this if you open this you can see
there are some libraries now from where
you can get this libraries you can go to
just just go to google and search for
search tulip it will give you all those
libraries in fact it will give you many
ladders may be around 225 libraries from
that this 8 libraries are important in
fact you can skip this one which is free
marker free marker is one of the V
weaving technology of you technology
since in this example I will be using
JSP so we don't require a free marker
but still well since it is there I will
use it so have this 8 libraries here so
what we can do is from your project I
guess we can even copy paste
let's try so copy and you can just
simply go here no paste option
unfortunately what we can do is we can
click on add library it's right click
and click on add ja ok by default I'm
getting the selection you can select all
and click on open if I click open it
will show all this libraries here now
once you've got all these libraries
let's use those search tag now I hope
your family with GSP direct to tags so
in order to use any external tags we
need to use JSP directive tag here so in
order to use JSP directive tags we have
to use a date if we type at the rate it
will give you three options either
include page or tag lip so in order to
fetch ex
two attacks we have to use tag lib so
tag Lee actual tag has a attribute
called as prefix
so the prefix I want to use here for my
application will be let's say s and then
you are I so you are I is its Uniform
Resource identifier which specify the
location from where you have to face
these tags since we have added those
diabetes we have to simply say starch
tags okay now so this s prefix defines
that any any time in future if I write
here any new tag I have to provide a
prefix as s just to define that it's a
starch tag simple in our application I
don't require this head let's go with
body and I don't require this now how to
verify that your libraries are imported
if you get an error here on this line it
simply means there is there is some
problem with your libraries again you
have to also check for the version of
library here because if you use a wrong
version your application will not work
so in order to remove that dependency in
your libraries you can either use mavin
mavin provides you these dependencies
they will remove all the dependency it
will add jar file by themselves okay so
if I'm not if you're not family of it
mavin it's ok you can just remember all
this was your name and provided you are
using that means ate all supported in
fact I guess when it means 7 or so it
will work ok now in this body tag what I
will do is I will use a form tag now
form tag is not a normal HTML because
normal HTML form tag goes in this way I
don't want to use a form tag of HTML I
want to use form tag of stores so I can
simply say s :
why else is because my prefix here is s
so I can simply say s : and a form tag
because starts itself as a form tag and
you can provide an action now there is a
big difference between an action
normal HTML and action attribute of
studs normal HTML when you talk about
normal a web application what normal
Java Java application in that if you
provide a name in this action it assumes
that it will be a servlet it will be a
class file but off servlet right but in
case of starts it's not a normal table
it will be a action now what exactly -
is that we'll see later let's say my
action name is hello starts so it is an
action name now what is exactly action
that we'll see later
so instead of creating a servlet will
create an action here some action name
is hello sir hello starts now if I skip
the method so in normal HTML if I skip a
method here it will be get right get
method but install it's by default is
post now what I need here is a text
field so I will again use touched ax we
say text field not take stadium I need a
text field then I will give a name of
this text field I will say it is user
name that's it
once I don't be the textview let me use
a button for button we have to use s :
submit again all the tag we are using is
of stores and we'll use a value as
submit simple so I caught a form here so
once I click on this button it will call
this hello starts now okay
so if I click on this submit it will
take that it will fetch that data and it
will send that to action but what next I
want to show a greeting right so for
that greeting what I will do is one more
I will take a property tag here now this
property tag has the power to fetch a
variable from the action again we'll
talk talk about it later what exactly
this property means for time being I
will say the values message and what if
your message is absent will say guest
okay we will discuss this part later
okay so focus only on this part so once
I click on this submit
it will fetch this username it will give
that username - hello starts now what
exactly this hello starts its how to
create those who to create that action
that we'll see in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
