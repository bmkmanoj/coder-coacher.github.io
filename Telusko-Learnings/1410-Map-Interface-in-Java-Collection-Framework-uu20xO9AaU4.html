interface now when you talk about leased
or set so those are the collection of
elements right we have values they're so
particular if we talk about add a list
where you put all your values and how to
differentiate between different values
is with the help of the index numbers so
let's say if you put a value like Naveen
at the first location you will use index
number zero let's say you have the value
as John the second value you will refer
this with the help of index number one
if you have a let's say Medusa that is
second name of the third name for that
matter the index number will be two so
to differentiate between different
values we use index numbers but the
problem is we humans we are not that
comfortable with numbers right so for
every value I need some specific key
right which I can represent example
let's say Naveen would be let's I will
use a key as my name right so my name is
a key and I mean is a value of my
favorite actor I will say John so the
key would be actor and the value would
be John right so we need a key value
padding here and to achieve that to
achieve key value pairing we use map so
how do we use map we say map then we
let's say we have a we have let's say
let's call the object name as well as
map and then we send you the problem is
this map is an interface right so if I
import this again belongs to Java dot
util and if I go to map its interface
now it takes two generic values one is K
and B now K represents key here and V
represents value so it's actually a key
value pair so now so map is a interface
now how can you create object of map
here so we can use hash map and we need
to import the package for as hash map as
well and we got the package ready
however now how do you put values here
not the thing is map thing takes two
things one is the key and second would
be the value now to put those values we
have to say now instead of using ad we
use am has put because in at least in
said we used to use admin
but here we have to use put method now
this point method will take two
parameters what is the key I will say my
name that's the key and we can have a
value here we'd say Naveen and we'll say
map a butch will say actor my favorite
actor I will say I will say John and
we'll say my favorite CEO I will say
c-e-o and that's medicine
okay so we got these three values here
we got Naveen because John and record
Messer so everything here as a key right
so you have join is actor and Medusa is
CEO but that's how you create that's how
you create a map now the problem is when
you talk about a radius we talked about
sect we always use generic types right
because we want to make our connection
API type safe now how do you make this
type safe so again we have to use
certain type safety here right so we can
use genrich's here so I will say K comma
V because this K comma V represents this
is key and value but if you specify the
type of it so time in both our string
right so both this our strength so we
can specify that with the help of string
so it's a string string and if you just
trying to use the diamond back in tight
suit and you got your map there so once
we once we created the list once we get
to the map and we can put this values
here now what will happen if I try to
print the map I will say print in map
and if I have this code okay so we got a
map in this format we got actor John we
got my name naveen and regard CEO Marisa
and you can see it is not in a proper
sequence the sequence should be my name
actor and CEO right but the sequence is
not getting mapped okay you you you know
you're you're right in your brain
somewhere you have say that maybe
somewhere it is implementing set because
it said as well or has it is in acid as
well we we don't get things in
sequence right so you can see the name
itself the name is hashmap right so in
hash set hash map they both uses a
concept of hash code and they don't they
don't give you the actual sequence which
in which you are adding the values so
that doesn't matter so we can we can
print all the values like this but it's
I want to print the values in one by one
sequence how can I do that
now the problem is if I use a enhanced
for loop to print the mass to print all
this stuff the problem is how would I
know how would I know this sequence
because in list and said we can use
index numbers like how we can use index
number here so what we normally do here
is let's let's try to fetch one value
let's fetch naveen here now how do you
fetch naveen is we'll say system dot out
dot println I will say map dot get so in
this get method you have to specify the
key no index number here you have to
specify the key the key is my name ok
and if I Don this code you can see we
caught Naveen if I change this key from
my name to actor and we'll say run we
got John right so that's how you that's
how you specify that stuff let's say if
I say by mistake if I if I type 1 here
we don't have that stuff in my map so it
will give you a null so for any key
which is not available it will give you
a null so there is no exception of that
kind that something like addenda sort of
bound exception we don't have those
exceptions here it will simply give you
a null so in this get method you have to
specify the key so once you specify the
key you will get the value right so that
means if I keep changing the keys I will
get the values right so I can put this
thing in a for loop and every time I
will change the key right but hold on
from where I will get the key now the
awesome thing is in map we have a method
called S key set nowadays it's e key set
is so key set will give you set of keys
so it will give you my name it will give
you actor it will give you CEO and we
can store that value in a set right so
we can say set of strengths we'll say
this is keys equal to map dot keys
now once we got keyset let me input the
package once we got the key set we can
say string key : keys right that's how
you can use an ounce for loop here and
we can print the key here with some
space and we'll print will print the
we'll print the value as well and if you
run this code you can see we got
everything in a proper sequence we got
actor we got my name and when we got CEO
with John Naveen and Melissa right so
that's how we can use map interface we
can put the values and you can fetch the
values now since we all say that this
thing is a set right does that mean we
cannot repeat it let's say if I say put
and again if I say actor and if I change
this value to let's say a share what
happens if I say Akshay now will it not
take the value or let's let's see the
behavior if I have this code so again we
are getting what the three values not
four it was supposed to be four bit we
got three now why we got three because
it uses set right so all these keys is a
set of values so it will not repeat so
what is happening is when you assign the
value of shy to actor for the second
time it will replace the original value
so it will replace this John by Akshay
okay that's how your map works so this
our values I mean we can't repeat values
here so I can it's I can say Naveen so I
can have two Naveen but we cannot have
two actors right so it will replace the
value so actor is also Naveen and my
name is also Naveen right so we can
repeat this values but we cannot repeat
these keys that's because this is set of
keys this is set of keys and this is
least our values in button list we can
repeat the values okay now this is this
is one way of implementing math the
second way of implementing map is with
the help of hash table now hash table is
also up okay hash table T is small so
hash table is also a class which
implements map so if I go to hash table
even hash table implements map is that
it's here so unstable implements map
now the awesome thing about hashmap is
that you can be the difference between
hash map and hash table is where is that
where is that okay
one is synchronized the other way other
one is not okay it is not written here
is it it should be somewhere okay yeah
so hash table so hash table is
synchronized and hash map is not
synchronized okay so when you know that
you have we don't want to achieve thread
safety of course it should go for hash
map but if you if you want read safety
go with hash table okay so that is one
thing in fact hash everyone uses hash
map right anyone uses hash table so
given a choice you will always use hash
map okay so instead of hash table will
be using hash map but remember we do
have hash table stuff so that's it from
this video we have talked about map</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
