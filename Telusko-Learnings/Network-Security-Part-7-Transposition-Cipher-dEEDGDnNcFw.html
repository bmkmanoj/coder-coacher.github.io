something called ash transposition
techniques now in transportation we'll
talk about two techniques today it's
what is rail fence and second one is
it's simple columnar okay so what is
elphinston simple columnar now one of
the most difficult transposition
technique is real friends but it's
simple it's way easy
I think I want this if I convert my knee
my name is now being Frankie
okay guys I'm not permitting my name is
just an example okay so it's it's not
being ready right so if I convert this
number 20 into a ciphertext so this is
my plane tential to convert this into a
ciphertext what I can do is first take
its take n here and a town so write it
in tabular way so a and a V I and remove
the space continuum switch RT t t y okay
run with this he knows he wanted but no
need then what next now the column lead
row wise so you have to get it eigen of
things and then lead row wise now how to
lead row wise it's n V and then e D so
where did this love for with a stolen
it's a ire1
simple right this is your plain text
plain text and this is your cipher text
so this is called as rail fence okay
next we talk about something all the
simple columnar what it means let me go
with the big sentence called as this is
network security session so we have this
big sentence so what
let's count the characters 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
25 26 27 28 so in a proximity will go
with energy 30 characters right
so it's 28 bit we'll talk about 30 so
let's suppose but if you're going with
simple columnar the first thing is you
have to create a table again how many
lows how many columns is given up on the
key so if your key is fine you will go
with five five columns if your key is
then you can go with ten columns choice
is yours so what I will go I will go
with eight columns so let me go with
eight ones so called a 100k column will
you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 extra lets
you move last - I'm going with 8 columns
and multiple rows again how many of
those given up on the sentence right so
then you name this program is 1 2 3 2 5
6 7 8 so I have 8 columns now what you
do is skip the first row so it will look
good that's it
not nothing more you have to just skip
the first row and start numbering with
this I can do so hits this1 e p wo RK
s-e-c you are i t by SP s i will be need
one more do SES s i o n so what can have
done we have put all this sentence in
this box right in a column format or
table format so this is how you have to
represent C before now now how to find
the cipher text it's not very easy so
what I do is go with numbers so we
simply start with 1 so 1 2 3 4 5 and
this goes on so what I do go with column
leading so go with column leading what
it does so when you read the column it
will be TT us then H WRI then I oh I oh
then
s r TN and then I KY and it goes on
alright so this is how you have to
convert your plain text into cypher text
using simple columnar right again they
cook the sequence of 0 column depend up
on you you can go with this sequence
also you can go to sequence like five
four three seven eight to the one you
can have any combination so you can go
with this combination you can go with
any combination right so this is how you
can represent a simple columnar example
you to go with this combination it will
be PI KY s r TN io io and continue right
so this is how you have to convert using
simple columnar but the problem is
simple kana is so simple that anyone can
hack right if you know the key the key
is here it's your size of your table
right if number of columns so if your
key is small it's very easy to crack if
your key is big there might be some
chances we are not able to crack right
but it's possible to make it more
difficult to connect what you can do is
you can go with simple columnar with
multiple round so it's multiple comments
now it is multiple round you should have
going with one column we can go with
multiple being each other buying a one
table we can go for multiple table what
it means once you convert your plain
text into ciphertext now use this same
ciphertext as your plain text and create
one more ciphertext once you get this -
X again how to get your ciphertext now
input these values in this table do the
same procedure you will get the new
cipher using that cipher again a treat
it as plain text and create one more
cipher so this is how you can cut you
can use multiple rounds it's not
foolproof
we are making it difficult to crack
right so this is your second taking a
simple columnar the winning techniques
we'll see later and for that
