different ISIL earnings and as per a new
report of as fighting minds now if you
don't know about as fighting mind you
might have heard about am CAC which is a
MCAT so as fighting mind has released
this new report based on that tool of
examination that 95% of the engineers
are unfit to be as or to get a job as a
software engineer now that sounds harsh
right because only 5% people are
eligible in fact I'm reading this news
from last two years okay so in fact
initially they should say 80% of the
people are unemployable then they got a
ratio of 85% of people are unemployable
then they got 93% engineers are not
employable and now it is 95 percent I
mean can you imagine that the degree of
unemployability is getting up and up so
now I don't know maybe in future they
will say 100 percent engineers aren't
unemployable I mean that's an
exaggeration right but the important
thing is there are lots of Engineers
they are unemployable what is the reason
behind this because see to antwon to
solve the issue we have to first
understand the problem behind that right
in fact are lots of things which people
are saying first the colleges right we
don't have a good education system
that's why we are not getting good
people to work in industry second some
people are saying there is a huge there
is a huge supply and less demand so
whenever you have a huge supply and less
demand of course there will be that
unequality issue right so the thing is
what if I say there's lots of vacancies
in the company company says I mean this
corporate company says they say that
they have lots of vacancies and they
don't have a good people and then we say
on the other hand that we have lots of
people they are but they are not getting
job the problem is employees want a job
with a good package right and company
want people who know something people
who actually can work on the project the
thing is I mean you can blame to
colleges you can blame your your
education system you can blame yourself
the main problem I feel is the attitude
of learning what we do so you see when
you talk about doctors when you talk
lawyers they know what they want to do
so let's say if you are doing MBBS
degree you know you will be a doctor in
future your main job will be to to treat
patients
the problem with engineers you know what
we what we think first of all whenever
whenever a women you know we have a new
kid or new child in our house we say you
know that guy will be the engineer in
the future the problem is you say you
have to be a engineer or you want to be
a engineer but how you go to you you
complete your tool stander and then you
search for the engineering colleges
right and normally we always talk about
IITs or we talk about NID or big
colleges but there are different tiers
of course right we have third tier
colleges as well now these are some
small colleges now what they do they
only run up business right so what they
do they they take people okay they don't
train those peoples fees is very high of
course but then they don't teach they
don't motivate you know I feel as a as a
teacher as a trainer my job is to
motivate people because if you can't
motivate your students they will not
learn right so in - in fact or if you
talk about the big colleges they also
motivate people they motivate students
in fact the students in the becauses
they are self motivated but again for
the tier 3 colleges you have to motivate
students that's up that's how they learn
right and so first of all you have to
motivate them you we need to have good
colleges plus we need to have good
professors right so yeah I was talking
about the column with engineers right so
we have this attitude problem what we
think once you once you've got a degree
you will get a job and that's that
doesn't that's not how it works right
degree will not give you a job what will
give you a job is your skill set so you
have to make sure when you are doing a
degree you have to increase your skill
set so that you can match with the
company now how do you how do you
increase your skill set again you can
say we don't have proper education
system we don't have proper teachers to
teach again I understand that we don't
have good teachers available in India
especially or they are multiple use
reasons for that the first of all the
payment issue the universities are
paying very less to teachers the second
problem is if you are a good at if
you're good at software development of
course you will not be a teacher right
you will go to company and you will join
a big company you will get a good
package you will get a
diagur's of a developer but then if you
don't know thanks of course you'll be a
teacher that's how that's how this
system is working now so again you can
blame that system that we don't have
good teachers but then no one is
stopping you right we are living in a
world of Internet where you can learn
everything by yourself there is one more
thing you know it's not just we are
getting when when I say engineers it's
not just about IT or sales if we talk
about mechanical engineer if you talk
about electronic elect a CCC engineers
in fact those people because we have lot
we don't have much vacancies in the in
that field so even they are planning to
switch to software industry so when you
say 95% it also includes those people
okay so of course right when you are
some different domain like mechanical
engineer or a tsa engineer of course you
know more about your domain than
software domain so you have to learn
coding skills in Thai as per report of
aspiring minds it's only 1.4 percent
students were able to write the code
which actually works okay just imagine
only one or two person people can
actually tap code which actually works
and others they can write a code but not
the code which actually works so they
have to go to Google and they have to
download they have to search for the
codes right so if you want an engineer
if you want to get a good good job in a
good company you have to increase your
skill set and no one is stopping you
okay doesn't matter from which domain
you are maybe chrome science IT
mechanical engineer or maybe et Cie it
doesn't matter from where you are you
have to increase your skill set you see
not just coding part it's oral
development part overall software
element things overall about databases
OS and how all those things works
because when you go for the introduced
of course they will check all these
skills not just your programming skills
right you have to learn about all these
things and then question is when you
will learn it most of the engineers they
think ok let's complete engineering
first and then we'll think about the
future that's now how it works in fact
in the first and second year of engine
of your engineering or maybe some other
degree you have to decide what you want
to be example when I was in my last year
second last year of my of my degree I
was sure what I want to do I want to do
I wanted to go for a Java domain I
wanted to be a what you say a trainer
not exactly a trainer like this I wanted
to
what is a motivational trainer but then
I got into this field so yeah you have
to be very specific what you want to do
in your last year or second last year of
engineering or don't wait for completing
your degree right because you know if
you know what you want to do you can
improve your if you can improve yourself
in the in those two years right or one
or two here so you have to increase your
skill set again we are not living in a
world where you only have books now we
have online videos we have udemy we have
Udacity we have what other domains we
have we have plural sites so we have so
many websites where you can learn from
again you they will charge you of course
right no one will give you everything
for free but then if you're investing so
much amount in your colleges why not
invest some amount in this online
courses as well if I'm not if I'm not
wrong if you go to lynda.com which is
one amazing website to learn things they
will charge only $30 per month which is
which comes out to be two thousand
rupees per month which is way less than
your college fees right so think about
this you have to increase your skill set
and there is an open platform and the
advantage of this websites like Linda or
three treehouse you have to pay monthly
subscription of some amount and the
advantage would be you can access any
course and I mean if you're a member you
can access any course you can learn Java
you can learn Android you can learn iOS
you can learn about database you can
learn about pl/sql everything for for
that subscription fees right and there
are also some free videos available on
youtube right so in fact it is called
earnings all the videos are free
available on youtube so you can learn
from that as well in fact there is one
more issue with the with the people now
they want to be a software developer but
they also know about programming
languages did they know about Java they
know about databases but they have not
made any software by themselves in fact
maximum engineers I was talking to one
guy yesterday so he has that is
engineering and he was saying up I was
talking about the project so last year
or almost 80% is 90% engineers they
don't make project by themselves they
buy projects so they outsource the
project so they have some some we have
some people who do business of making
software's I mean I hate that that of a
business anyway but then what they do
they makes office and that's sale to
students and that's how the spoiling
students life I mean if you're an
engineer
and if you if you want to submit a
project what you will do you have two
choice you can build the project by
yourself or you can buy the project and
if you can when you can buy the project
while you will buy yourself again it
will they will only charge you two
thousand find it apiece per project I
guess it is ten thousand rupees but then
you if you have four people you can you
can you know you can share and you can
buy the project but just imagine if
you're doing that you're spoiling your
career because if you are not making a
software by yourself you will not get
that confidence or making yourself and
when you go for the introduced they will
ask you about your software and what you
will say hey I bought a software I mean
that doesn't have it that doesn't that's
not how it works right you have to be
you have to make sure that you build a
project by yourself and that's why in
fact the last week I started this life
coding now so I'm teaching students how
to build a project from start to end so
that it will give you confidence may not
be you're not building a project by
yourself but then you're actually saying
how a project is build even if you pop
in my code I mean the things which I am
doing I'm I'm typing the code live and
then that project will be available on
github you can pull the project and you
can learn you can you can make you can
make some changes and you can have it
your own project that right so build a
project that will give you confidence
and I'm sure if you follow this these
steps there will be a new report from
aspiring minds by saying thirty person
people are unemployable seventy percent
are employed well I cannot say that zero
person is unemployable now because it
will take lots of time but if you can do
this I don't want you to be see getting
a job doesn't make you employable employ
or employable person right there are
lots of people they dye aggregates and
industry but they don't know how to work
in fact I have seen people they don't
even know Java and they work as a
developer I mean that's awesome thing
right so don't be a person who is
unemployable and still you're getting a
job be a get a job as a deserving
candidate okay so what that you have to
work on your skillset and let's let's
hope that aspiring mind will change
there these are next year or next to
next year so that's it
improve user daily and that is what I
think is there to improve to help you in
your career so thank you so much for
