talked about how to use class and how to
get an object let's try to understand
what this ver and Val means so when you
say Val it means you are creating a
variable now if you remember in Java we
use a keyword colors final right so
instead of using final in in Kotlin we
can actually use Val so when you say Val
it means you cannot change the value of
it so instead of changing this fear
let's go for the variables first now if
you remember inside our agent class we
do have a variable right now what is if
I make it as a Val now what happens you
know once you assign the value to a
while so which are which we are doing
here as you can see I have assigned the
value for Val as double quotes and if I
am trying to change the value here it
says Val cannot be reassigned that means
once you assign the value for val you
cannot change it so that means if i
remove this from here it is asking you
for default values so you should use the
val keyword when you want to create a
constant so when you want when you know
that you are creating a constant then
they should go for val example when we
create a path when we use a PI value
when you have a constant rate we're
using which you want to change something
so always go for constant always go for
Val so it doesn't make any sense to
create a Val variable something like
this so in case of variables of a class
you can use Val which is create you're
creating a variable but what about this
object can you make this one as well
let's try so as you can see if I if I
make this valve there is nothing there's
nothing wrong with that everything will
work with fine everything will work fine
but what if after some time if I create
this object once again which means if I
say again if I say t2 and equal to and
if I maybe if I want to create an object
once again so when i say alien and if i
give a round bracket now this is a new
object right and the moment I do that it
is giving me an error the reason it is
Val
so for Val when you are once you assign
the value you cannot change it
so if I go back to
there will not be any issue yeah it's
just that if I if I try to print the
value once again after getting a new
object just to prove my point that it is
creating a new object whatever you do is
I will just print this once again after
the object creation now this time we
don't have a value for name right let's
run this code let's see what happens so
if I run this code once again it is
running it is - it will take some time
as you can see we got the output and the
output this time is name is blank
because this is a new object a new
object will have a default value or the
default value here is blank
I mean it's empty right so that's how
you can use Val and that and in Cartland</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
