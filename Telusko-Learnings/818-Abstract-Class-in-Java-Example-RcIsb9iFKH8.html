ready from police for learnings and in
this video we talk about abstract class
so the concept we are discussing now is
abstract class and abstract method okay
so let's start is exam let's start it
video with an example so what we'll do
is we'll okay just roll down okay so
what we have here so let's take an
example of phone so it is here 2012 just
imagine this is year 2012 and in this
year there was a person called as Ramesh
okay not Ramesh
maybe Mahesh so there's a person class
Mahesh and he want to build his own
phone a new type of phone because he is
doing b.tech now or be engineering and
he want to build something new I mean in
your in your last year of your project
or basically if you are working or if
you're if you're a college student or if
you are working somewhere maybe you want
to build something else and then you
want to build a new phone this new phone
should have some new features example
initially it was you know we used to
have a phone now we have a smartphone
which has multiple features but Mahesh
is not happy with those features what
Mahesh wants he wants his phone to do
something else some more features so
what he want from his phone is his phone
should be able to call and of course we
know right every phone has the switcher
of calling so what he did he created a
class or create a method called as
public void call that's how we create
because the behavior of your object is
defined by the methods right so this
method will define okay or how to call
so when I create object of Mahesh phone
that phone should be able to call right
so what we'll do we'll say here we have
provided some implementation we say this
is calling okay so we have done some we
have written some statements which will
call but let's say we are just making it
abstract so let's say we are not writing
the exact code now in order to create
object of Mahesh okay can simply say
Mahesh phone right and then obj equal to
new Mahesh phone and we'll simply call
OB J dot or not obj dot call
because my Ashwin has this features of
calling I fed on this code now it should
work if I done this as Java applications
so there is no problem it says calling
but let's say Mahesh is not happy with
this one feature he wants some more
features what he want he wanted Sloane
to even dance not just imagine first
let's start with move so phone should
automatically move one thing is Mahesh
is thinking about thinking about this
concept but is not able to define it
okay so Mahesh fails to define move my
headphones one more feature which is the
phone should be able to dance and one
more feature a phone should able to a
cook okay so let's say we have these
three methods so four should be able to
cook dance and move Mahesh knows how to
define calling but Mahesh don't know
that how to define how to provide the
implementation for move how to how a
phone will dance our phone will cook but
he wants those features so he cannot
define it because he don't know how to
do it so he is declaring it and whenever
you declare the methods this makeup
methods become abstract since you don't
know the implementation or you don't
want to provide the implementation you
make the methods abstract okay so we can
simply make it abstract here so we have
public abstract void move public
abstract void dance and public abstract
void cook quite simple right so you can
have a method which is declared not
defined so this is declaration and this
is definition as we have seen in the
theory now the problem is when it was so
this this method here this methods are
called as abstract method so these are
abstract methods now since you have
abstract methods here so the class which
has abstract method the class should be
abstract class and you can see there is
no error now here because you can have
abstract methods inside abstract class
but the problem is you cannot
instantiate cannot instantiate
the object cannot instantiate the
abstract class which simply means you
cannot create object of abstract class
is that simple okay so this will not
work so in order to achieve this in
order to create the object and to call
the methods what we to do is
so what Mahesh will do now Mahesh is an
in hope so since it is last year of
Mahesh is his he tried to define all
this method but he failed so what he did
he he created a research paper or
article he written an article in which
he has mentioned that the future phone
should have this four features one of
them I have defined now it's up to you
the future generation to define all
these methods so next year in the same
College there was a person and his name
was a blemish so it is ramesh phone now
himesh want to build the same phone with
the same feature so Ramesh wanted some
other features but he was not getting
what features we need so he went to his
library and in that library he found
there there's already a article return
on a phone by Mahesh and my head says
every phone should have these four
features one of them is one of them is
defined by me it's up to you to define
this so what Ramesh did Rama says okay I
will extend Mahesh phone that means
Mahesh has many features why to create
my own feature when I can use my edge
features so he has extended my eyes
Mahesh phone but the thing is whenever
you extend when your class extends the
abstract class you have to define all
these methods it is compulsory to define
all these methods now to define it so
what my Ramesh there Thomas tried to
define a method which is move so Mahesh
was successful in defining this method
move see by default whenever you extend
you have these three methods here what
we are doing we are overriding this move
that means this move will not come in
this class since we are overriding it
right and will say it is
moving okay and now so this class ramesh
phone has how many methods any guess if
you say two methods then the answer is
no ramesh phone has four methods it has
called method because we are extending
by H phone it has move which is defined
here and it also have this two like two
extra methods which is abstract methods
any class which has abstract methods
will be called as abstract since the
Amish failed to define this two classes
this two methods we cannot create object
of Ramesh phone because this is again
abstract so example if I even if I try
now if I let us keep it Mahesh because
the concept is of Mahesh right if I if I
write it - Ramesh here still we are
getting error because Ramesh is an
abstract class so cannot instantiate the
type Ramesh phone so this was your 2012
this is year 2013 and now we have year
2014 in which you have one more person
and the name is Suresh now Suresh want
to do the same thing he wanted to build
a phone he went to library he saw the
article from Ramesh this time remai says
okay I have have taken the concept of
Mahesh in which you should have four
methods I try to define one that means
two methods are defined now what is fall
second is move now it's up to you to
define this two methods
so what Suresh did he extended the mesh
phone
that's the mesh phone and here he
defined both these methods public void
dance and we'll say s out okay this is
that's weird
so that's s out and we'll say this is
dancing and he also defined one more
method which is public void which is
cook and we'll say this is this out
cooking and now you can see there is no
error
so what SUEZ did he tried to implement
all
methods now the advantage is you cannot
create object of rummage phone because
it is abstract right but you can create
object of suresh phone because suresh
phone here is called as so this will be
called as concrete class and this Mahesh
phone and ramesh phone they are abstract
class in fact this one row Mahesh the
mesh phones are abstract class and
suresh phone here is a concrete class
okay now using this Mahesh phone we can
call all the methods so that Don's and
then obj dot what's remaining it's move
right so you can see now if we run this
code will be getting all these features
amazing right so that's the advantage of
using abstract classes sounds good
so this is one of the use of abstract
class you can one can declare the
example let's let's say you have a
project manager so project manager says
okay I will I will give you the overall
structure of the project I will not give
you the definition but I will give you
which methods I need it is your
responsibility to exchange my class and
implement all the methods so that's the
use of abstract class okay now we'll see
abstract class with another example in
the same video so what I will do now let
me remove all the stuff we do not
require this now now let us take an
example of a phone class so let us say
we have the first class as iPhone and in
this iPhone class we have a method which
is public void show config okay which
prints the configuration of iPhone which
is iPhone has 2gb RAM I'm talking about
iPhone 6's and it has i/o as 9.3 version
right and then we have one more class
which is class
Samsung s4 because I have these two
phones with me so I have public void
show conflict and this will print
what so in this also have 2gb RAM and I
have lollipop what so that's lollipop
okay now so let's say I have one more
method here which is public void show
but public static void show now what
this show will do is it will call okay
which takes a parameter it takes a
parameter let's say of iPhone will say
obj so what's the main intention here as
soon as I call show by creating object
of iPhone so let's say if I say iPhone
obj equal to new iPhone okay and if I
pass obj so what will happen we are okay
we are getting in arrows darts iPhone
okay so what we are doing now we are we
are creating object of iPhone we are
passing this object obj and then this is
taken by iPhone so this is your passing
this value here and then we can call obj
dot show configure ID and if I run this
code we can see the configuration of
iPhone so 2 GB and iOS 9 but let's say I
also want to print the configuration of
Samsung so what I need I need one more
method which is public static void show
so the first method is taking the
parameter of iPhone the second method
will take the parameter of samsung which
is samsung s4 will say obj and here we
are saying obj dot show conflict now if
I create object offs s4 also let us say
this is samsung s4 obj equal to not OB
gel itself which a1 equal to new Samsung
and if I pass obj one now so it will it
will it will call this one right this
Samsung obj the second the second show
methyl on this code you can see we have
2 GB and lollipop the problem is why why
we need this 2 methods
both the method name is Shou and both
are taking the same border taking the
object of a phone right of course iPhone
is a phone and Samsung is a phone then
why to create to these two methods what
if we can just create one method but the
problem is if you get only one method
what should be the parameter it should
be iPhone or s4 that's the confusion
right so to solve this problem what we
can do is we can use something less
abstraction here which means create
abstract class and we'll in this class
as phone in which you will be having one
method which is public abstract avoid
show conflict okay so we need to just
declare it and both these classes iPhone
and Samsung will extend this class which
is phone because Avengers their phone
right since we even if you say iPhone
off Samsung both are phones
and here instead of creating the instead
of taking the parameter as iPhone just
take the parameters phone so we don't
require these two methods so even if you
pass object of iPhone this phone will
accept it because you can pass the
object of subclass and the reference of
superclass so that's the awesome net
awesomeness of abstraction we can pass
obj we can pass obj one depend upon what
you pass it will display those thing
since we are passing obj one it says
lollipop if you pass just obj it will
show I phone sounds good so one more
thing so that's that's the example of
abstract class but there is one more
thing it is not compulsory to have the
abstract method in abstract class okay
so we can have any method we can also
define this method here we can say
public void show we can define methods
here also there is no issue we can have
abstract methods we can have normal
methods in abstract class sounds good so
that's it that's the concept of abstract
class and abstract methods so that's it
from this video if you have any
questions do comment and
yeah thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
