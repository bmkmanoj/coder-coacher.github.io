you for the workplace you want you want
to work with again you can create a new
you can clear a new workspace odd you
can work with the same workspace which
will be which we were using for eclipse
ultimately springiest years or s3 as
itself is Eclipse right now you can
verify that when you go to sto tiny
silicon have or HDL you will get an
option you will get that this works on
Eclipse platform specifically Eclipse
neon 3 so the version which I am working
on maybe if you are using a new version
it will be having a registration of neon
or maybe Eclipse ok so if you remember
this will be project which we have
worked earlier right now since I have
this project in Eclipse I have worked on
this project in the existing workspace I
got this project here now what I will do
is I will create a new project so to
create a new project now this time we
are going for spring project ok there's
an option of spring boot in spring it's
a new thing again you can go with normal
spring MVC or you can go with spring
boot now just to make this thing easy
for you I'm going for spring boots
because spring boot says you don't have
to do much of the configuration in fact
if you're going for spring MVC there are
lots of competitions which you have to
take care Springwood says hey don't
worry you can judge I can start with the
project and the way you can do that is
by saying new so I click on your project
Explorer and say new and create oh ok so
I'm not getting to the option here so I
was right like I would say oh can you
see that I'm not getting the option of
spring project here so if I if I see I
don't have a spring budget option we are
using HDS right so we have to make sure
that you are using a spring perspective
so if I click on here you can see we
have a spring perspective you have to
click on that and say ok now you are in
spring perspective now if you right
click and if you say new and if you
click on spring startup logic now you
can see we are getting option of spring
startup project now this is basically
your spring boot project so if I click
on spring starter project
um okay it will give you the service
you'll again we talked about this in a
some in some time here I would mention
live less I will mention my project name
as spring boot left because this is not
just a rest a project this is a
springboard flash project and we'll
mention the group group ID with say
Condor telescope and we'll mention zero
condor telescope okay everything is set
let's click on next now here we have to
select where because we are working with
websites to the select web and nothing
else just click on next and then click
on finish the moment you do that you can
see we got a project now this is a
spring boots logic and you can also see
s there s simply means a spring project
and at the end you have boot this is a
string boot project if I expand this and
if I go to my form Dalek mph Alex let's
see what exactly this file is if I go to
form the recommend five you can see we
have we have spring boot dependency here
and then we have spring boot start up
start up web so this is the web project
basically this is the thing boot web
project you can also implement MVC here
where we are going for spring list let's
close this and I think else if I expand
this mean if I expand Java
counterexample if I open this thing boot
rich app you can see we have a main
method here and you can if you run this
code it this will this will work now one
of the awesome thing about spring boot
project is when you collect web and if
you expand your memory dependencies of
course you will be getting to some web
libraries there but with those web
libraries as you can see we have spring
in we have spring MVC here with this we
have one important thing which is this
one can you see that we have an optional
tom can't embedded now what exactly it
means let's say if you build a project
on your machine and you your machine in
your in your machine you have eclipse
you have Tomcat installed everything is
set up let's say if you're going to your
friend's house or if you have a
different machine now if you run this
project on on the other machine what you
do is you have to install it uncle as
well you have to download Tomcat you
have to configure Tomcat but spring
would say hey don't worry
why you have why we need a external
Tomcat but I can give you
embedded target that simply means you
don't need a external server what I will
do is I will stop the external server
you can delete it delete this if you
want other simply stop this now what I
want is I want to create a ok I want to
create a URL using which I can access
some data now we have a choice of
creating a web page here from which you
can access data but that's not a good
thing right we are building a restful
web service where you don't have to
mention a page we can request the data
using postman so whatever you do is I
will first of all on this code and of
course this will not work this will work
maybe let's try so it's a run as son as
oh now how do you run this do we have to
run this on server no this is offspring
boot project right so anyway you want to
run a spring boot project you have to
select bring boot app just click on this
now that's your spring boot app which is
running and you can see in the console
here it is running
let me just minimize all this Express
stuff which we never use anywhere and we
got an error it says if the port is
already busy oh that's bad
is it the issue yeah that's the issue
because I wanted to have my Eclipse
running and running straight here let me
close my Eclipse and let me just make
sure that this is this which stops oh
maybe I will delete this tomcat server
from here to be unsafe sighs anyway so I
was I think again I will say is run as
run a spring boot app which should work
now and you can see Oh again we got an
error what's wrong who is using the port
number 80 80 that's bad really bad ok so
what I will do is this will not be an
issue in your machine ok what do I do
here is I will change my port number in
case if you are facing the same issue
you can change your port number you can
just go to applications or property file
and you can say it's our dot quote again
my intention here is not to teach you
what is what is the Springwood and how
to configure this stuff or you can learn
that in a different cause of string
projects right but if you want to change
your port number that's very easy to
screw to efficient properties and you
can change your port number to eight
zero eight one now let's run this this
should work now otherwise I will call
this project Alice there is one as
one as spring boot apps it's running Oh
finally it is started I don't know what
which service is using maybe the eclipse
is not software properly closed maybe
this one is not too up on the close so
but this is working you can see we are
using a port number which is 80 81 okay
now what I will do is I will go to my
postman I will say hey I want to request
for 80 81 and it will say enter you got
nothing of course we will not get in you
will get nothing like but what I want is
I want to fetch all the aliens so let's
say I get request I will say I want to
fetch all the ages if I send or send it
if I click on the send request it should
return the data ok now how do I do that
it's very easy we just have to create a
class and that class is responsible to
return the data the way we have done in
rest or spring of these Jersey right I
will mention this is my alien controller
not technically this should not be a
controller this should be a resource
that makes more sense like this is a
resource I click on enter now how do you
mention that this is a spring project I
mean how do you mention that this is a
spring a controller order I souls now to
do that we have we just have to use and
annotation which is called as rest
controller so anyway you want to
implement virtual API you just have to
annotate it with rest controller the way
we have done in in Jersey we have used
ad path we have to use at rest
controller here and this we just have to
mention a method so we say method name
is public or this return a list of
aliens again we can buy database code
but that will duel after some time we
say list of alien and that was it
obviously this is get alien and this
will return a list now to return at
least we have to get at least first
right so other critter list of aliens
here I was the least or alien and I will
name this as alien sequel to new alien
but the problem is we don't have a Aiden
class here that means first you have to
create disease in class oh now I am bit
lately I will ensure creating the class
I was just simply
copy business again you can call it as
code real right the same alien class
lets me paste it here now problem solved
is it 2000 salt yeah brother solve it we
do not have an issue with aliens now and
I will simply return the aliens but
unfortunately this agency is empty so I
will say alien I will say alien a 1
equals your new alien and I will insert
some data for this I will say a 1 dot
set ID will mention the idea is 1 0 1 I
would say a 1 dot set name I will set
the name as marine and I will say a 1
dot set points I will set the points as
70 okay that's my point
let me just use one word object I would
say copy this and create one one one
object for me this will be a - a - a - a
- and this will 1 0 - I will name this
as Priya let's say point is Eddie once I
got these two objects two alien objects
let me add that in a in that least I
will say aliens dot add let's add a 1 I
would say aliens dot and let's add a two
okay so we have added this to object
everything should work now now okay so
before before running this code let's
let I have this question for you will
this work I think about it and let's see
the answer now so let's restart the
application now there is one thing you
have to or you have to remember when you
work with filling boot don't start your
project once again if you don't this
project once again it might give you an
issue because spring boy project has
embedded target so it will not restart
when you're on this project you have to
click on restart to restart the project
or they start the tomcat server let's go
back to our postman and say hey postman
send oh it's still not working
of course it will not work because we
forgot one of the annotation here which
will map it right it remove the past
annotation then here we have to use
request mapping because we are mapping
both requests right so we have to say it
was mapping and I will say request
mapping with slash aliens or we don't
even need slanter so is the alien so
whenever you get a request for alien
this is what you have to run let's just
start the application and let's go back
to over tomcat or sorry postman and
let's say is one it worked
can you see that we got different data
we got you r101 the first aliens because
the second alien as well it's so simple
right so instead of using Josie we can
also use springboard now the thing which
you have observed here we have added no
dependency nothing right
in fact we got the data in a dozen
format and does not something what Jason
we don't have to actually add any
dependency everything is there but who
is doing that in in your J in your
Jersey we have Jersey converters white
which is moxie here if you expand this
Navin dependencies you can see we have
something called a Jackson now Jackson
is pre-built in in spring rest project
or spring WebLogic so this Jackson is
just judging Jackson is responsible to
convert your Leafs of objects into
Jace's right so it's an exciting tool to
work with I get into indie-pop second
tutorial we talk about how do you use
post request put request and any
requests so I hope you are enjoying it
