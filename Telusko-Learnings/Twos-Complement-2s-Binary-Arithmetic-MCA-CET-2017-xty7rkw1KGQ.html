already from Toys for landings in this
video we'll talk about two's complement
now why do we need to is complement is
because in your number system we have
negative values and we have positive
values right and they can find the
binary format of positive numbers
examples it's an example if you have a
number 5 how to find a binary format of
this we know that right we have seen in
the first video we can divide this
number by 2 and you will get the binary
format
so with that way assuming that you have
a big family if you have 4 bits so
you'll say 0 1 0 1 that's how we'll
represent 5 right so if you have a
number 3 how can represent 3 it is 0 0 1
1 that's how you can say 3 right but
then if you have a negative number
example if you have minus Li how can I
represent minus 3 here now there are
lots of system which which says you
cannot we can just convert the 0 0 1 1
and we can change this to 1 which
represents a sign bit right so when you
have a positive number you can make this
a 0 if we choose a negative number you
can make it 1 and if this will become 0
1 I mean 1 0 1 1 right
is it minus 3 not exactly it's because
when you say 3 minus 3 or 3 minus plus 3
you will get 0 right
in this case if you have so if this is
your positive 3 if this is plus 3 which
is 0 0 1 1 and this is minus 3 this is 1
0 1 1 if you add this two values you
will get 0 that's perfect you got 1 then
you got this is 1 carry here so we got 1
and then we got one is it 0 not exactly
right so this is not right so this is
not minus 3 now how do you find minus 3
then to find minus 3 here we have to go
for two's complement so if you want to
convert a number minus 3 into binary
format you have to find two's complement
now how do we do that
so to find those complements what we
can't do is
okay so to find two's-complement
let's take a number three okay if you
want to find -3 first of all you have to
convert this number into once a banished
format which is 0 0 1 1 now this is
still a bunny format of 3 then you have
to convert this number into one
compliment so you have to find the ones
complement of this number now how do you
find one compliment just reverse this
number so if we have 0 right 1 0 is 1 1
is 0 and 1 is 0 so you have to inverse
system but not reverse ok inverse so 0
becomes 1 0 becomes 1 1 becomes 0 and 1
becomes 0 if you have a number like this
if you have one I mean 1 0 1 1 so this
inverse of this will become 0 1 0 0 ok
so we are not reversing the mob we are
inversing it so 1 becomes 0 0 becomes 1
now once you've got the ones compliment
you just have to add it with 1
so once compliment plus 1 will give you
two's complement so when you say you
have ones complement plus 1 will give
you 1 0 1 1 and trust me this is minus 3
let me just verify this so this is plus
3 this plus 3 then we say plus 1 1 0 1
let's add this to value we got 0 because
1 plus 1 is 0 then we got 1 carry here
then this is 1 plus 1 is 0 then we got 1
carry here 1 plus 1 is 0 we got one
carry here we call 0 and then we got one
extra here so ignore this extra because
we are working with 4-bit system and we
got 4 zeros which is 0 right that means
this number is minus 3 so how do you
convert a how do you convert a negative
number into a binary format by finding
the two's complement of it's positive
number so in order to find minus 3 you
have to first find please binary format
then apply two's complement and you will
get minus 3 so that means if you want to
do 5 minus 3 what you can do is you can
say 5 plus minus 3 and what is what is
5-year it is 0 1 0 1 what is my has to
be here we got mastery right
one one zero one let's add this two
values so one plus one is zero then we
got one here we got zero then we got one
carry that is zero and then one carry it
just ignore this one because we are
working with 4-bit system what you get
is 2 right 0 1 I mean 0 0 1 0 is 2 right
so 5 minus 3 is 2 so we what we are
doing here is we are up we are we are
getting we are getting a subtraction
operation with the help of additional
operation right so one circuit two
operations so that's the importance of
two's complement but then it so if
you're giving if you are going for any
entrance exam so they might ask you not
to complement let's say if they ask you
for false compliment what is what is
force compliment so in balanced system
we have two is compliment in decimal
system we have tens complement in and we
have octal system we have h complement
in quarter system so a system which has
a base full they will ask you for force
compliment any guests perfect it is
three is compliment plus one but then
question arises how do you find this
compliment so in one's complement what
we did is we did the inverse part right
but that's not the actual concept the
actual concept is if you want to find
the ones complement of 0 0 1 1 what you
have to do is let's say we have 0 0 1 1
how do you find ones complement of this
just supplied this number by all ones
when you say ones complement subtract
all the numbers which which is your
number here by 4 ones what you get is 0
0 1 1 can you see that so we have
actually not inversing it we are
subtracting everything by 1 so if you
want to find ones complement subtract
your number by all ones now guess it for
threes complement if you want to go for
threes compliment let's see if you have
a number 1 3 1 if this or 0 1 3 1 if
this is your number you have to subtract
this number by 3 3 3 3 and then what you
get is 2 0 2 3 so this is the please
complement of this number which is 0 1 3
1
how do you find force compliment is
simple just say plus one so how do you
find force compliment it is threes
compliment plus one okay so we'll get
plea to 0-3 right now how do you find
sevens compliment so it is sevens
compliment right so anyway whenever you
have a number system like binary system
THAAD system octal system decimal system
digital system which is based 12 we have
hexadecimal system for all this system
you have to do so for for two's
complement it is once complement plus
one for quad system it is threes
complement plus one for octal system
sevens complement plus one right but if
you if somebody asks you sevens
complement it is sevens complement it is
not six complement there's one okay so
for eight complement it is sevens
complement plus one okay
four so forth sevens complement is
simply sevens complement so that's how
you have to answer in your entrance exam
so that's about two's complement if we
have some more questions about this let
me know in the comment section so that I
can make one more video on that and if
