different bicycle earthlings and in this
video let's continue with the last thing
which we have done which is hql so the
last video when we find a query which is
from student we got the interact-able
right and then we save that into a list
and everything was working then what we
did is we applied a where clause where
you are getting a unique result it was
working but the moment you specify the
columns you know we have specified roll
number name and marks that's where the
problem started right because when you
use select query that means or whenever
you specify the select part it means
that you are not fetching the entire row
you are fetching a specific columns it
will not return you student object now
so what it will return is it will return
you the object now while object why not
string integer it's because roll number
is integer name is string and master
integer so if you want to have any type
of data we always go for object white
and we are not getting one object we are
getting three objects they roll number
name and marks right so for that we have
to create an adding so we'll say object
array on the right hand side as well we
have to say object adding right we have
a type class of the object adding and
now since we got an array we cannot use
normal student print right we have to
use a loop here we'll say a loop which
is of type object I can use enhanced for
loop here we can say object Oh equal to
student okay and let's print all the
values let's say I want to print oh and
if you have this code you can see we got
seven named seven and and 49 right so
that's already caught here we have one
more ways of instead of using a loop
what we can do is we can say system dot
println we can say o of 0 then we can
use a colon here just to separate those
things we can say o of 1 oh not oh it is
student right so we'll say student of 0
student of 1 and then plus student of 2
that's that's our three records right so
now it will you will get one go which is
seven name seven and forty nine so you
can see that there was a there was lot
of space between this
we wanted a space here right so will you
a curler okay that's perfect now let's
run this and you can see we got a data
as we want it but let's say um so that's
how you can fetch the if you use a
select thing but let's see if I don't
use a we're close now let me remove a
where plus from here now what will
happen is the moment if I remove the
where Clause it will not give you one
lick or it will give you the egg tight
table right now you cannot show that in
one record you need to use a list of
students I will say list here because
again we are going for the entire table
let's import the package for that which
is Java dot util and let's type cast it
with list of objects right so that the
object adding is for one row and least
is for the list of rows right again now
there's some change here we will name it
as students because we are not getting
one student and now we can use ion house
for loop here we can say object array :
students object array student :
students now what will happen is from
the student students list it will fetch
one one student and you can print all
the values and that's what we are doing
here right and not sure on this code you
can see we got and error oh now we
cannot use the eunuch results right
because we are getting the entire list
so we have to use a list that's perfect
let's go on this and you got the entire
table so that's how we can use a select
query with with by using the object
array can we do something more here oh
let's let's try let's say I want to
fetch okay I want to fetch only those
values which I get then be greater than
whose mass is greater than 60 so I think
again we can do that we can say where
roll number is greater than 60 now
sometime what happened or not
roll number but marks marks is more than
60 now what happens is let's say if you
have two tables and both the stable have
the same low or same column example
let's say we have student and we have
a certification person any-anything and
the both the table has the same column
it there will be a confusion right
because we can use joins here we can
have two tables so we have to be very
specific which table mass and talking
about so that means we have to use
allies with student so I can say student
s and you can say s dot marks even we
can do this and if you run this code you
can see because the output all the all
these students are having more than 60
marks right so that's how you can apply
the where Clause can we do something
more here yes we can let's say I want to
fetch only one result I want to find
this sum of marks we can do that we can
say some of marks now in this scenario
we are not fetching one record or we are
not fetching the we are not fetching
these columns we are just switching one
list so I will remove this I will say it
is just a list because we are not
getting an array of objects will simply
see a list and now we cannot Swiss say
object Adam say simply say object and
will just print student marks now okay
in fact this column name is wrong will
say marks and will print
marks will it work and you can see we
got the addition but hold on why do we
need at least because we need we know
that we will getting only one thing
right so we can simply say unique result
and we can show that in the type object
right and we can remove this with list
from object and then we can say this is
total marks and you can plane the total
marks right so when you know that you
are getting only one data you do not
have to use a list here we can change I
guess we can also do one more thing
instead of saying object can be say in
teacher because we know it will be
getting we will be getting in teacher
right let's try okay it works and you
can see we got the output as a we got an
error it says it was written your long
but that's the problem it will some
returns you long okay
so you cannot typecast with integer you
have to say long on this side as well
you have to use long and all let's run
this
and it works right so that's how we can
use all those things the important point
to remember is whatever you can watch
whatever you can do in SQL the same
thing is possible in HQ well okay we
have one efficient way okay so can we do
one more thing let's let's try what
we'll do now is let's say I don't know
this value so this value will be coming
afterwards so let's say I have a
variable here which is ain't Marx and
let us say the Marx is 60 I cannot say
Marx but let's say be so int B is 60 and
in here I want to specify that variable
K how do you specify variable if it's
very simple we can say plus B right if
we don't know the value you can add it
at the end unless you want this it works
but hold on I'm not a big fan of
concatenation right because
concatenation always gives you trouble
so if you remember in JDBC we have done
with the batch statement can be used
pepper statement here okay we can try so
to use flip a statement here we can
simply say : B and then our job is done
we don't have to we don't have to use
that the pass statement stuff we can
simply specify : it will work but hold
on before before running the query we
have to change the value so we'll say Q
dot set parameter for the first position
I will say the value is B or not the
first position but for B listen if this
works and okay it is it 0 it starts with
0 I guess ok there is one more issue
parameters are based at 1 okay that's
weird
so what you can do is you can simply use
B here and now it will also be will be
replaced by B ok so this B which is : B
will be replaced by this B so anyone you
want to specify the value later you can
actually use : which will act as a
positional parameters which we enjoy BC
we have done with prepass we provide the
same stuff easier so this is how cool
hql is ok so in the in the next video
we'll talk about some more stuff about
hql so if you liked my video please
