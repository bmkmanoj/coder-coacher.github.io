ready from physical learnings and in
this video we'll talk about collection
and generics so collection and genrich's
is very new to Java not paying you
exactly but when jar was introduced the
first version was 1.0 right and 1.0
collection was not there collection was
introduced in 1.2 version and later in
1.5 we got one generics concept okay so
now since you are working with Java 8 we
have all the features which is
collection and genrich's now why we need
a collection it's because collection
provides you a dynamic type of arrays as
we have seen in the theory so it is a
dynamic array where you can add your
elements and you can expand the size of
array you can reduce the size of added
so that's the advantage of using
collection 0 why we require Genrich that
we'll see once we start with the session
now let's say I want to add some values
so we can add values inside a day right
so we can have a similar type of
elements inside array but why sips why
similar types you can also have an array
of objects right example let if I have
an array of integer so if I say int
values which in which is an array I will
say new end I can specify size of 4 so
that means in this array with which is
values we will only have int values
right we can also have a list of objects
right so we can say object we can say
values 1 it's an add a new object so
it's not compulsory to have this similar
type of elements right we can now we can
have an array of objects here so let's
say we have four objects in this four
objects I can specify the integer value
so I can say values of zero this is
let's say my name naveen okay I can say
values 1 of 1 we can say value 7 right
so we can have integer we can have
string we can even have an object of a
student class right so we can have
anything inside this object array so
this array here it's the integer values
and this added here these are objects
in this object we can have any type
right so these are similar type of
elements which is object type and an
object we can have anything right but
the problem with this two addresses they
are fixed that means we can have maximum
four elements so we can start with zero
we can go to one two and three maximum
we can have four elements what if you
want to increase the size of the array
that's not possible
can we decrease the size of array that's
not possible right and that's why we go
with something of this connection so
what is collection collection is a
interface in Java okay so let me input
the package for this I can say control
space I which will give me the
suggestion which is collection Java util
and if I say enter so you can see we got
a collection here let us ignore this
'part so in order to create object of
collection we can say collection again
say values so let me comment all this
part so that I can reuse the name which
is values which is my favorite name so
have a values here but the problem is
this collection is an interface right so
this is an interface but what we need we
need a we need to we need to create
object of this collection right so we
cannot create our own class which will
implement this so what we can do is
there are certain classes which is
available in collision framework so you
can see collection is a framework so we
have we used three terms with collection
reuse collection as a framework we use
collection as a quote as a class
collections with your class and
collection as an interface so this
collection is the interface here okay
so this is the collection which is a
root interface for all the collision
classes and interfaces so we have
certain classes which implements the
collection interface here so way to
search for that class here now how to
search that class so what we can do is
we can just go to google okay and we'll
search for the collection
API okay we can see what are the classes
available so when you say collection in
Java there is the best place to learn
the Java concept which is Oracle website
so you can go to the order official
Oracle website right we can you will
find everything there no need to go to
other websites to learn anything you can
just directly go to this website and you
can learn anything you want right so you
can see the collection framework here
you can see the implementation
you can search for all the images like
example we have this so we have a
collection interface which is
implemented by or which extended by this
all interfaces if you can find the class
implemented by any of this interfaces we
will get our thing right so what we'll
do we'll go to Google Images so that
will get that go to Google Images which
is you know and let's search for
collection API in Java not now it's Java
and you can see here we have a diagram
it which explains everything
the or this is awesome hand diagram so
now we have a collection interface here
and the collection interface extended by
this all interfaces we have said we have
least and we have Q and inside least we
have at least vector and we have link
list right so we can use any of this we
can use the edges vector or list we can
also use hash set we can use priority
queue but this for this example we'll go
for other dish we'll say new add a list
here and we can provide the black kids
so in this analyse let me input the
package so once we got the object of
analyst here which is so we are creating
our interface reference which is values
and then object of ArrayList let's add
some values now how to add values here
so we can simply say now we cannot use
that square bracket here we have to
since values and objects so we can say
values dot add so that is a method of
using bits you can add value so let's
say we are adding three so we can add
integer values I will say values dot add
and this will add a let's say let me
insert my name there so I will say
Naveen and let me insert a float value
also will say value start add why I am
getting every time at all and this time
as I will insert five point eight okay
that's the double value right so if I
mention five point eight F that will be
float value so we can add elements in of
any type so this is a collection of
objects right so when I say what is
collection so we can say collection is
the collection of objects right and now
how to fetch values so in this values
collection we have added three back
three elements now
to blend all those values now it is very
easy to paint these values we can simply
say there are three ways you can fetch
values the first way in fact we have two
ways to fetch values from the collection
the first way is using iterator so we
can use me write it here so we have two
ways one is using iterator and the
second way is by using enhanced for-loop
okay we cannot use that with help of
normal for loop we can use enhanced for
loop okay so we have two things we have
a traitor and then we have enhanced for
loop now how to use iterator here to
fetch the values from the collection we
need to use a traitor okay against the
interface in Java so we can say iterated
I equals u now to get the object of
iterator since it's an interface we can
call the collection so we can say values
because this values will have a method
which is iterator
so this iterative method returns the
object of iterator so if you can click
on the situate or method of the
collection class or the interface you
can see we have it returns the object of
iterator so we got the object here now
once we got the object we can fetch the
values using next or method now how to
do that we'll say us out and we'll say I
dot next so this is the method using
which you can fetch the value okay so I
dot next we'll give you the next value
and if I run this code you can see we
got three but if I want to print
naveen also so I will say copy-paste
and I want to print five point eight so
I have to write this statement three
times so we got those three values right
so we need to use a traitor to fetch the
value from the collection what the thing
is a mission of adding this statement or
three times can be use a for loop so can
we say for loop which starts with I
equal to 0 I less than equal to 2 that
with that thing we can do right
otherwise let's say if I don't know the
number of values we have so we can use a
normal for loop or the while while loop
in which you have a method called as I
and we'll say I dot so this is a method
called as hasnext so this has next will
give you it will check if if do you have
the next
in the collection okay so this has next
we'll check for the next element if you
have the element it will print it
otherwise it will stop okay and we just
try to write it once if I on this code
you can see we got these three values
right so that's how you use iterator
with the collection but the problem is
iterator is very alright so the way it's
a very old technique can be using
advanced technique here can we use
enhanced for-loop so I want to use this
enhanced for loop here now how to do
that we can use a for loop here and how
to use enhanced further we can search
for a video on a nonce for loop in my
playlist so in announce further we just
mention the type of element so we'll say
we have I and I is coming from value so
we are fetching the values of I from the
values but what is the type of I here so
the type of I is object because in
values you you don't have any specific
type so we'll take object okay so the
type of values is object so this object
I will take one value from the values
and we'll print R here and if I run this
code we got the same output right so we
can add some more values we can say
value start add let's add a value which
is a 77 right if I on this code now you
can see we got four outputs so even if
we do not know the number of elements
tax okay we can use enhanced for loop to
fetch all the elements now the next
problem is I want to be very specific my
collection should be of type integers it
should not support string and float it
should only support integers for that
after the collection we can mention
something in this angular bracket so we
can mention that in this collection you
should only have integers which not
support end or you should not support a
float and strength so I don't want to go
with the object type I want to go with
the integer type and we have to mention
this on both the side okay and this
concept of mentioning what type of data
you have in your collection is collagen
rigs so that's the generics here so this
collection if you click on
like collection it was introduced in 1.2
okay and you can see there is something
written here so this a represent the
type of element you are working with so
let's say if you have all integer values
so we can have all we can write integer
here so let's say if you are working
with float so you will be having float
here we can also have the collection of
students so you have to mention student
here now what is student you can create
a class a custom class in which you can
have student student parameters
properties and methods so you can
mention student here so you can see we
are getting edit in these two lines is
because it will not support it now you
can only have you can have only have
integers here so again I will say value
start add and here will 88 so now we
have three elements here we have three
77 and 88 so we have three values both
online integers and if on this code we
are still getting the same output right
but hold on in the fourth loafie writing
object why we need object there when we
know that the elements are integer so we
can use integer or we can even use int
and that's the awesomeness about the
wrapper classes this is boxing unboxing
even if you have all the integer values
we can fetch using int and if I got this
code we got the output right so we can
write integer we can write int there so
that's how you work with the enhanced
for-loop
with the collection api sounds good
so this is collection and genrich's we
can have any type of elements here so we
can use iterator to fetch the values we
can use for loop now there is a small
problem let's say I want to add the
element in between so I want to add the
element after three so let's say if I
have a element which is values dot add I
want to add the element let's say nine
in between after three and before 77 so
if I add nine and if I then this code
you can see the nine will be coming up
to 88 but I want to print nine after
three how to do that can be specify the
index number can be say it will be a in
this way it should be at index one
because three zero so I can say index
one and nine and the answer is
no because there is an error it says you
don't have any add method which takes
two parameters because if you go to
collection interface you do not have any
method which is the name is add and you
get takes two parameters so you can see
we just have one add method which takes
only one parameter and that's the issue
right so how to do that that we'll see
in the next video where we will talk
about list interface because list is the
interface which extends collection it
has some extra features and you guessed
it right it will be having a feature
where you can have you can add the
elements with the particular index
number sounds good so we'll see that in
the next video in the in this video we
are the mini well with one more thing we
can also remove the element so let's say
if I want to remove 77 we can do that or
we can simply say values dot or let me
remove this L so we can say values dot
remove and we can mention 77 there and
if I than this code we get only 3 and 88
simple so that's how we can use
collection genrich's with an answer for
loop an iterator
so thanks so much for watching and do
subscribe for further videos and in the
next we will talk about list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
