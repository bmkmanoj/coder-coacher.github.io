in this part 1 we have talked about a
least command we have talked about edit
and set feedback in fact we have also
seen different way you can I mean you
can create a variable you can create a
method and you can call the methods now
in this video we'll try to explore more
on those I mean on in terms of commands
and in terms of statements so what we'll
do now is let's create something on a
string
now let's say if I want to define a
string variable now what normally we do
is we say STR and then we complete the
statement right but what if you want a
shortcut now if you remember if you use
any IDE like eclipse or IntelliJ or
NetBeans we get Auto completion right is
it possible to get it get that here now
it is possible so if you type STL if you
say tab you can see it gives you the
suggestions what you can go for if you
can go for a string you can go for
string builder you can go for string
reader you can go for string it right
now so there are lots of classes
available for this I want I want a
string here so we say string and I will
say s now this is not exactly a code
completion this is a suggestion you can
say so if I say string as equal to and
if you assign a value let's say naveen
and if i say enter you can say we got a
variable naveen and we got a string as
well so you can see we got created
variable as equal to string right so
what you get is these suggestions but
what if you what if you want a
documentation something like this if I
say string and if I say tab you can see
we got other options with string but you
find say again a tab here you can see we
caught the entire documentation for
string so if you want to know about a
plus what you can do is just type the
name of a class or whatever keyword or
something you will get the the
documentation for that now string
belongs to Lang package right so you can
see we have the entire definition
available here right so so remember this
if you say single tab it will give you
suggestions if you give double tab it
will give you a documentation and this
is this is awesome right so if you're
learning Java for the first time it will
be very helpful when you when you do
something like this ok that makes sense
so we can we can use string entry we can
print the variable as well
in fact if I say you can see we caught
the variable we got s and it has a body
which is Naveen okay now push our dice
can we can we redefine the variable
example if I already declared the
variable if I say string s now with a
different value so I'm not just changing
the value I'm changing the I'm creating
a new variable can we do that let's say
if I use a variable name here as Ana so
what do you think will it work and the
answer is if you if you see that you can
see it says modified variable s strength
so you can see it is modifying the D
variable right let's do the same thing
with int variable is it possible so
let's say int I equal to 9
and if I say int I equal to 3 and you
can see it is modified so it will not
give you any other error that you have
already used this variable right so and
we have created so many variables right
what if you want to see all the
variables which we have used till now
so don't worry if you have a command for
that as well so we got where is it where
is it so it is V a RS you can simply use
a tab there to complete it and if I say
enter you can see we got the entire list
here so this is the this is the these
are the variables which we have created
till now so you can see we got age
record s we got this J here so if we
have created all these variables for our
use right
in fact oh can we see methods and you
are right we can also use methods as a
thing in fact you can simply type M ETH
n against a tab it will autocomplete for
you
and if I say enter you can see we got
two methods we could show and display
this is what we equated till now oh so
we can create variables we can create
methods we have not created the class
yet is it possible to create your own
class I will give you two seconds to
think about it so think about it can we
get a class oh and the answer is yes
let's try this so if I say class and I
will in this class as a runner so we
have a class runner here or maybe if I
have a class alien because you all are
aliens right so if I create a create a
class called as alien if I open the
brackets and you can see it works it is
giving you an option to do some things I
would say public void alien work we work
I don't know so if I say enter and if I
define something here
system dot out dot println and if I say
what working I mean you can type
anything you want and I love the
statement abort no okay I lost this
treatment so it's okay so instead of
typing into I equal to 1 I would say
into I equal to 9 doesn't matter we just
want to define some class right and we
are doing that here and you can see we
got our class we've got a class called
as alien okay now that's possible we can
get a class as well
no can I can I call this class I mean
can I create the object of this class
let's try so if i say alien a equal to a
new alien and it does work and you see
that it does work so we got alien a
equal to new alien so it works so you
can you can conduct class you can create
an object and you can practice java like
this right
i don't know about the different uses
for jhl but then as a trainer it will be
very helpful for me so when I go for the
twinning next time I will surely use a
gel for my training I mean I'll try I
will try to do that I need to still
explore how efficiently I can teach Java
in gel because we need some other
experience as well right
some ways some flow let's see how it
works so yeah so we can create we can
get a class we can create an object of
that what if I try to create an object
of a class which doesn't even exist
example let's say for I create a object
of a class which is maybe maybe human so
let's I don't have a class human
available but still if I do that if I
say human obj equal to new human and if
I try to do that if I say enter oh it is
giving you an error you cannot do that
okay can i define a reference because of
course right we don't have the object
yet and we don't have a class yet but if
i say human obj oh you can create a
variable but you cannot get the object
because we could quite a constructor
right but you can see we can create a
variable the only thing it says is you
can't get a variable but however it
cannot be the French until class human
is declared so same thing right it is
future forward reference so you can
create you can create a reference but
then you need a class to make it work so
yes you can get a class now and you too
it will work for sure so you can use
this obj object Oh
that sounds good okay now we also have
one more command called as a history
let's see let's see what happens when
you type history here and if I say enter
it gives you all they come all the
things which you have typed till now you
can see regard all the commands or the
statements so it will give the entire
history and that is awesome okay now
there's one more thing do we
is it compensate to write the entire
stuff can I simply say /h no because / H
is ambiguous it says either history or
help so what we can do is we can say H I
so we don't have to actually complete we
can actually type H I yeah it will
detect that it is history right the same
thing is possible with list so if you
simply type / L it will give you a list
the same thing is happening with exit so
if I simply say X I know X naught X e no
even is ambiguous I will say e X exit so
yes if you do if you want to use
shortcuts you can do that right and most
of the time you have to type something
and you will learn on the way right the
way I did now I was no I was I thought
it will be X but then it is e x but
that's fine so yeah so you can use shell
like this you can type all the commands
which you want okay now what else we can
do
let me think now can I can i connect
create object of scanner class because
see when you use scanner class in normal
Java we need to input the package right
because see if we talk about system
class string class those belongs to the
Lang package and we all know that Lang
package is something which by default
gets imported what about what about you
to package because scanner class belongs
to you till let's try that so if I say
scanner SC okay I will not okay I will
say a new scanner and if I say scanner a
ok system dot and that's how you create
object of scanner right and if I say
enter how it worked you see that there
is no error
it says Java dot util dot scanner that
means the util package is by default
imported and that's awesome right so you
can work with any class by default all
the classes are imported okay so let me
try one more what if you go for Java dot
SQL package because if you talk about
this statement class so what we'll do is
we'll say statement or maybe some other
some other some other thing
maybe nada my remote so if I say remote
are because remote is a package right so
we'll say but then okay let's let's go
for statement let's go faced with SQL
package so we say statement s and if I
say enter oh it's a statement opt so it
is it is getting a new variable and is
asking me to get a class quest statement
but no statement is that it's an
interface which is pretty pretty
building my in my in Java dollar school
right it's not working that means all
the packages are not default imported
you have to import some package by
yourself but how would you know what are
the packages which are they already
imported so what we'll do is we'll say
imports now this will show what are the
packages which are by default imported
you can see we got IO packet imported
math is important net neo package util
package so all these packages are
imported right by default you don't have
to import them but if you want to work
with SQL then of course you have to say
import and Java dot SQL dot start now
you are importing the Java package okay
so now if I say statement so you can see
that it is saying that updated replace
variable s now so if I say s you can see
it is null but it what it works now they
know that s belongs to statement right
so that's how you can work with that's
how you can input the packages you can
know the already imports right so if I
just want to lease down the commands
here so we have import we have set so if
we have least released all the list all
the things we have we have done we also
have history right in stable actually
give you the history okay but list will
give you the in died e IDs for that I
did will help you to edit something with
the with the idea of course we have
import we have history what else we have
okay what else we have seen we have help
right so you can explore all these
commands by yourself and try it out so
this is available for you so try it out
and what else so that's it from this
video we have talked about different
stuff let's see in the next video I will
try to make something extra with
