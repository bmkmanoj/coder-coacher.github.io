next video is about real friends now
you know what you still friends so let's
take a brief idea on real friends so
let's imagine your plain text is like
Naveen ready so you have blending
sun-diamond ready so what I do is to
convert it into a cypher text let's make
just to make it simple let's take a
capital things we have all these capital
letters so this is my plain text now in
20 I have to convert this plain text
into ciphertext and the idea of our
elephants is you just have to arrange
this thing into two two rows one will be
n then we have to go for the next row we
have to go for a then in again here you
have to go for V then here you have to
go for AI and then you have to go for
and again you have to enjoy everything
in diagonal format and then you when you
read this I get V I will be having
continue already here but when you read
it it will be n VN then all dy then it
will be a I our d5 so what it means you
have to you have to write it in car in
this diagonal format and you have to
read it in row wise this is how it works
why so - um implement this what we'll do
is we'll take we'll treat this letters
and go with their index numbers so this
index number is zero and this index
number is nine right so what we can do
we can take all even numbers together
and then we can go for all odd letters
together so how to do that
for that will it will require a string
called as plain text so we'll say PT
then we require a cipher text and okay
so let's let's see let's let's make my
plaintext as I can how to take input
from user that you know for my previous
tutorials so time being will take
directly take this string as now in 20
okay and then what we'll do is we'll
just run a loop this loop will start
with I equal to zero it will go till the
PT length so PT dot length and then I
plus plus
now business I will check I missed a
semicolon here okay now we just have to
check that index number it is it are
even or odd
so we'll directly say if I mod 2 is
equal to equal to zero that means it's
an even number right
so for that we'll take we'll take two
extra variables and we'll name this
variables as string even part we can say
string even and we'll say odd again the
default value for this will be blank
just for the installation
okay now we'll say it's even equal to
it's even plus now we have to us where
to take this we have to fetch this and
right now how to face this and it's very
simple you just have to say PT dot cat
and it will will get I write simple and
then an else part will say odd equal to
odd mm plus PT dot care at I so all this
even characters will go to even and all
this all characters will go to add odd
and then that's it when you points this
loop is completed you got all the
diagonal format while printing you just
have to print even and then you have to
print odd it's as simple as that right
this is your L frames
let me run this code okay see this it's
it's n is the output yeah it's n then
it's B then it's again and then it goes
for e then it goes for D and then it's
go back to a then I then R then D then
by so this is how your Delfin works i
simple again for this motif some
modifications are there first you have
to take input from user
so this input should be from user then
you have to end this loop that's it then
you can print in ciphertext is and you
can print the data so this is our
elephant elephant works for further

thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
