talk we'll do some more operations like
what if if wanna print something like
hello
so I want to display hello in my frame
so in last code water done is we have
just create or created a frame so to see
those flame right click on your
projected here or coding area and then
say done so you can see I got this
window right so this is your frame but
the thing is I need to I want to print
hello you so what we can do we can just
say this may close this so what we can
do next is yeah we can take a label so
we have a component called as label in
swing also in AWT so we are talking now
we are talking about a WT so we'll focus
on interpreting we have we have a
component class label ok so again to
import package we have to say control
shift I I can't select label now if you
can't focus we have we have used two
components one is frame and second is
label and both these components belongs
to the same package well as a the blue
team and this AWT stands for its
abstract window to get ok so this is a
WT right and a template is replaced by
swing in future so what we have if we
have enough for we'll start with eight
ability then we see what is swing
applications okay so now or to display
something we have label L and again we
have to give the memory right so we'll
say new label okay and we'll give a name
so we say hello okay so once we have
done this we have a frame so we can see
a frame right and now we have a label
now what it means is like when you
create a poster so you can create like
you can you can tear up some papers you
can create some collage and you can
stick that collage to your to your
poster right in the same
way you have a frame you have a label
now you have to add this label to your
frame and for that you have to use a
method called s ad and then say L now
this L which is your label will get
added to your frame okay let's see how
it works so when you run this now you
can see there is something else hello
okay but but what if let's respond this
what if if I have two labels let's
suppose I have one more label as l1o
spelling mistake so it's label and still
I to declare I need to give me Marie so
it's a l1 equal to new label and this
time I print hi okay since I have to
show both right so I could say add L and
add l1 so when I do this now I have two
labels which are added to your frame now
if I done this I can see we have only hi
there is no hello you
questioner that's why it's because your
frame your frame by default goes with
something called as card layout now it
is card layout it's like playing uh
playing cards so if you have a card like
a spade or a card like King if you have
another card like when so if you keep
cueing about your King you cannot say
king right you can only see Quinn in the
same way that this label is over your
label hello
so what we are doing is we are
overriding this hello what I need to say
I don't want to use card layout now that
that's the default layout the offspring
of your frame follows is card layout
which means one one or component will
come about another component so your
high is about hello what I want they
should be together they should be they
should they should occupy half of space
of your frame so I have to change the
layout so for that what we do is we have
to say set
layout so this is your method using
which
inside the layout and it will ask you
for the object of some layout so we'll
say we will follow floor layout if what
is ProLiant we'll see in a minute but we
have something else lo layout okay and
then we have to pass object off F again
since we are using predefined classes
you have to import the package
so we'll say control shift I and some
wherever you can see we have a package
for floor layout which is a WT okay now
now you file on this you can see we can
see both both the components which is
hello and hi not just flown layout it's
like first if you say hi if you say
hello it will take this middle middle
space of your screen if you say hello
and hi both will try to accommodate at
the same center of this skin and that's
why you can see both are in the middle
right so we have hello and hi which is
your floor layout so floor layout is
like a flow of new components gets added
they will try to occupy this space they
have in middle okay so this is how your
floor layout works like this floor
layout we have many layouts that we'll
see in future but currently what you
have is you have a floor layout you have
to create object of floor layout then
you have to pass that layout in in here
and then you can add your labels but it
was it what's tricky is the this F
object you are using only for once right
so what we can do if you are using any
object once instead of defining the name
you can directly say yeah you can create
an anonymous object of those class so
what you can do it's not passing F you
will likely pass new floor layout so
don't have to write this right so this
is how you can improve your code you can
do settle layout you have to pass new
floor layout they have created two
labels and we have added two labels how
can you fight on this now you can see
the output it's somewhere it's you have
hello and hi okay so this is this is
from this is your label and that's what
this video for more videos do subscribe
