parametrized constructor so you can say
we have int I so in order to call that
int I made to pass something so if you
pass 5 it will call this ABC with a
parameter so if I run this now even if I
call if even if I passing that 5 we are
not actually using it but the only
reason I'm using that Phi is to call
this parametrized constructor because if
you remove that Phi you can see we are
getting an error it says it says we
don't have any constructor with with a
default parameter but hold on in the
earlier example or in the any in any
example we have never used constructor
right we have not never defined this
constructor because when you define a
parametrized constructor that means you
should also define a default constructor
since you are not adding default
constructor we can get to pass this 5 so
if I run this and the output is in ABC
Const but can I have two constructors
with the same name obviously you can we
can write a public ABC and this
constructor is not with not accepting
any parameter so what we'll do is we'll
say in ABC Const para and somewhere here
we'll say in ABC Const alright so we are
writing here in ABC cost para and here
in ABC Const if I pass this 5 obviously
it will call this one but what if I
don't pass any value so this time it
will call in Const in ABC Const so this
thing which which have we have two
constructors with the same name but
different parameters this concept is
called as constructor so this is
constructor overloading so this is the
so this is constructor and when you have
two constructors with the same name and
different parameter which is called as
constructor overloading even we can
define any number of constructors here
so we can say in ABC and this will
accept int I comma let's say double D so
we can have a constructor with two
parameters we can have a concert of
three parameters
and we'll say you're in a b c const a in
double so since we have two things we
should say in double and since we have
two parameters need to pass those two
parameters we'll say 6 comma 5.5 right
so if i run this code now it will call
at the parameter it will call the
constructor with two parameters right so
that's why it is int double clear so
this is what we have a concept of
constructor overloading so in the next
video we will talk about more about this
constructor parameters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
