insert data into laced how to insert
data at the start of the list and then
how to insert at specific index so if
you can see we have a value which is
1845 12 and 25 and then we are also
adding 555 at the start so if run this
code we should be having five elements
right but then I made a mistake cipher
on this code you can see I made one
mistake I am getting this 55 two times
so what went wrong if you can see the
code here we are saying when you have
any when you insert at this start in the
if the index value is zero then you need
to execute this code that means we know
we should not be executing the other
code as well right I mean this thing is
need to be skipped and we are not doing
that and that's why you can see we are
inserting 55 two times so this code here
should go into the else part which we
mention in the last video I will just
put else block here and after putting
that else block I will just go back to
my way now and if I run this code now
you can see we got 55 only one so yes
that was one mistake in the last video
so I just made some connection here so
this should be an LC oh it's working now
you can see we got 55 so just to draw
here whatever we have done till now so
let's start with the first one so what
we are doing is with this line of code
will create your first box here and let
me just write a box which is 18 and
let's give an address which is 5 0 1
that's my first address let's let's have
one more so way when you say 45 we got a
second box so when you add this list we
will get 45 here the value is 45 now
let's say this is 5 0 2 so of course
this 18 here will have an address of 5 0
2 so it will link to this box and then
when we are saying add 12 so we got one
more box here just 12 and let's say this
has some address which let's say 5 0 3
so 45 here will have 5 0 3 now so we got
this link here we got one more which is
25 but 25 will go at start so we got a
new box here which is 25 initially we
were having a head which was referring
to 18 it is ID start of location but now
that head is not referring here the head
is referring to this new box
25 because we are saying start at the
start so this will have its own address
like for 95 this is the address can go
anywhere it's not just when you when you
say it will address start it will have
this value it can have any value
you maybe 595 maybe 695 or 795 it
doesn't matter now here it will have
five zero one so this will refer to the
next element so the sequence is twenty
five eighteen forty five and twelve and
of course twelve will have null and then
we have saying insert at zero location
so we are adding one more element which
is which is fifty five so we got fifty
five which is going at and let's say 50
fires its own address we'll say this is
seven zero to fifty five will have four
ninety five because they had value and
then this will therefore here now header
will not be referring to the twenty five
head will refer to this new location so
that's how you insert value in between
or at the end so we have seen all those
stuff the next thing which is remaining
now is delayed right so how do I perform
delete operation so let's say I want to
delete this eighteen here so I want to
delete this eighteen with index number
zero one two so I want to delete this
index value two now how to do that so
when you want to delete this index value
to so what we normally do is we just so
the only thing we have to do is just
change this address that said the only
thing that it changes change this
address so here instead of having five
zero one we can we need to change this
to 5 zero to our job will be done right
so when you say this is 5 0 2 it will
refer to the next node and will not be
using this not anymore
so this is gone ok now how do we execute
that so let's go back to our linked list
and let's add one more method which is
din it
so before show here I would set in it
public void alert and this will take our
index values I would say index int index
now technically the name should be
delete at right so it should be did it
act because we are specifying the index
value okay now we have a special
scenario here what if you want to delete
the first index so if you want to delete
this one which is the first index here
now in that case you just need to change
one thing you need to change your head
location with this one that's the only
thing you do right and how do we achieve
that
so we say if my index value is equal to
zero in that case I will change my head
location so the head location will
change to the next node and what is next
node it is reffered with the head node
dot next so I would say head dot nice so
head will become head dot next and
that's it this is what you do when you
are delete the first element is
that simple but what if it's not a first
element so we'll go for L spot again and
here did we had to traverse remember we
whenever you want to traverse you have
to do something if you had a driver's
remember this we were using a for loop
or the while loop I will go for further
because we are using index value right
so remember this this code here the same
thing from here to here everything
everything will remain same we have to
traverse to that location so let's go
there I would say copy and we can just
usually use the code here so we are
traversing right so from so from the
head node we are traversing to that
location now once you reach to that
location so now when you pass a value to
here so the index value 1 is 2 so this
loop will run only once right because
the index 1 is 2 so 2 minus 1 is 1 and
we are going till I less than 1 which is
0 itself so this loop will iterate only
once that means the current end value
which is representing after the loop
would be this n so this one will be your
n so n is 1 now I want this value which
is 2 power 5 0 2 because so that if I
know this 5 0 2 you can assign that
value in this box and the way you do
that is by using this node in some
temporary variable so I will say that it
is + 1 so when I say N 1 now I'm
representing this object and when I say
n I'm representing this object or this
node so I would say first of all I want
to assign N 1 is equal to n dot next
that's how you girl you will get this
reference so if you want to if you want
to use this object here you have to so
if you want to make it n 1 you have to
say n dot next because n dot next is N 1
right oh but we don't have anyone
anymore
so we'll say and node n I mean node N 1
is equal to null so that we can refer
that so we have to declare that object
first now once I got N and N 1 the only
thing we have which you have to do now
is the n object so when I say n dot next
so the n dot next need to be replaced by
+ 1 dot next and it's very simple now
you can simply say n dot next is equal
to n1 dot next ok and then once you got
the value you can simply say system dot
out dot println and you can print the
value if you want
so just one just to mine 25 everything
is working properly you can delete the
element which you want to delete so I
would say I want to delete n1 because
that's what we are doing we want to
delete anyone right so we'll say n1 and
let's print the value of N 1 which is n1
dot data so we'll know it at least which
one is getting deleted now how to verify
this let's go back to our door now and
let's do it a value after some time so
it's at least delayed I want to delete
the element at index number 2 which is
18 in this case let's run this code and
you can see after running we don't have
18 anymore in the list
yeah this is getting printed in the
delete method itself if I don't print
something here even it will not print 18
there so yes with the we can delete the
value just by using delete method so we
have did it at it will you it will be
used to date the value at they end up to
a particular index so that is awesome
this is how you delete the element the
only thing we did here is we just
changed the reference right so this n so
this element address is changed by the
new one which is 5 0 5 0 2 not 5 0 1
this case and that said this is how you
break the links okay there is one
problem this object is still there it is
related from the list but it's still
there if you want to nullify it you can
do that you can simply say + 1 equal to
null so that it will be eligible for
garbage collection right so if I run
this code now you can see we have
removed 18 and it is not that in the
memory as well it is a super for garbage
collection so that's how you can delete
this data now I will upload this D or I
will upload this code on github so you
can find the github link in the
description area that that's where you
will find the entire code I hope you
