create a constructor and that to a
primary constructors right and the way
you can do that is by specifying a
parameter here I mean you can specify a
bracket and you can specify the
parameter so whatever you pass in the
constructor while creating an object you
that value goes here but then if you
remember in Java we have a concept where
if you call a constructor we can
actually perform some operations the way
what the thing the thing which we are
doing here is just assigning the value
right how about if you want to perform
some operation maybe if you want to
plain something where do we write it
let's say if I create a constructor
human and then in that I want to plain
hey I'm the human is created or human is
born how do we do that so we have to
write some block right and the way you
can do that is by creating a init block
so we can write any doc oh okay so we
can create an init block and you can
print you can you can perform whatever
operation you want here and you can see
you can say a human is oh what's that
human is here right and we can also
assign this so whatever we are doing
here we can also assign that value
inside the console inside they need
block that's fine okay yeah I forgot to
I forgot to mention that outside so it
should be the variable need to be
created outside right so we'll say keep
it here and initially we'll keep the
blank and later we can change the value
right so here I can say name equal to n
right even this works so this is how you
can train some blocks now let's see how
to create a we have not run this code
right let's run this and if you run this
code you can see we will be getting the
output as human is here because that's
the init block and you can you can
imagine as a constructor so when you
when it calls the constructor it will
call the init block and then after the
idea of calling thing that's why you're
spending coordinate is awesome and you
are so printing the name right that's
great but how do we create a secondary
constructor for time in like remove that
we don't need that anymore
let's assign n here now why do we need a
second constructor maybe I have a 1 mode
I have one more variable here which is H
and H is of type int and the initial
value of H is 0 but of course so I know
I don't want to have an H 0 here how do
I assign a value to this both the
variables
want to go for primary constructor so
you can also create a secondary
constructor you can say a constructor
you can use a keyword values constructor
and you can pass the number of
parameters you want to pass maybe you
want to pass two parameters in this case
so I will say I want to pass H colon int
comma and you can specify okay what else
we have we have name colon string right
so you can see we got this constructor
and then we can open any close we got a
secondary constructor but we are getting
an error
now it says primary constructor call
expected now this is a zoo this is the
rule in in Cortland now what it says is
whenever you could whenever you call a
constructor by passing some values
example if I pass or 20 comma Naveen and
that's not my age here but let's say we
have 20 and Naveen here and if you pass
these values so this 20 will be assigned
to this age and Navin will be assigned
to this string which is name the problem
is Kotlin says whenever you create an
object you have to make sure that you
also call a primary constructor I mean
even if you are calling any concept of
you of your choice
maybe in this class we have 10
constructors with different parameters
you can call whatever you want but you
have to make sure that you also call a
primary constructor that's very that
compulsory now how do we do that
okay now you can do that with directly
or indirectly from by using constructor
chaining but then just to keep it simple
what I will do is I will give a colon
here so after the concert I give a colon
and the way you can call a primary
constructor or maybe any concept or in
this class is using this again the same
thing is there in Java as well right we
call they can do constructor changing
with the help of this keyword okay so in
fact I do have these videos on my in my
Java playlist if you if you have any
questions just go there and watch the
video in fact in the entire series
wherever you find any problem just you
can watch my Java videos and click it
will it I mean for sure it will clear
your concepts ok so we can use a disc
this keyword and then you can drag it
you can pass whatever you want to pass
example know what would not whatever you
have to pass only this string because
parameter comes at exit only strings
they will pass name right so you can see
whatever we are getting from the from
this from this constructor you are
passing that constructor here and then
you are assigning that constructor
in here right you are saying that value
in here and then in this constructor you
can assign the value as a so we can say
H equal to H now that will be a
confusion right so in in Java if you
remember we used to use this dot H let's
see that works here and you can see
there is no error it should work right
and we'll print name colon we always
also print H now so we'll print age and
let's see if it is working or not let's
run this code and it says okay come okay
that we got naveen and colon 20 so now
why we have used at this keyword here
because we have h here which is a local
variable and this is a instance variable
right so we can refer to the instance
one with the L pop this keyboard all
right and that's what I said you know if
you know Java concepts working on
Cartland is actually very easy right so
you think this here just was my just
guess because it works in Java so it
should work in cotton as well right so
yeah that is that awesome so you can
create multiple constructors do some
experiment with this great five to six
constructors call with different values
inside you can also do constructor
chaining there and that's it that's that
I hope you it helped in your constructor
concepts I am saying else in fact we can
also use constructors in inheritance
again how to use that that we'll see in
the next video so in the next video
we'll talk about how to do inheritance
and how to call how to do constructor
calling that so yeah that's it I hope
you are enjoying this session so do like
and do share this video with your
friends that's it thank you so much for
