we have fine even an odd number but the
value work is our own value right but
every time we cannot change the value we
want to ask a user to enter the value
that means this value of n should
confirm user now for that what you do
first you have to ask user so we'll say
we'll print something we'll say enter a
number so by by adding the statement
printf we say enter a number and then we
have to use something called a scanf so
print F is used for the printing
statement and scanf will ask the user to
enter a number the scanf is also a
function in which I will say the input
inserted by the user should go to n but
hold on n is a variable name scanf will
ask you for the address that obvious
right when you say you have a variable
and this is a container it will be
stored in your memory that means that
memory will have some kind of address
now how to specify the address we have
to use something called as ampersand
sign now this ampersand sign defines the
ampersand sign defines the address right
and to specify which type of data it
will contain and then we have to use
something else person D now this
percentage finds the number you will be
getting is an integer value and it
stored it should stored in the address
location it should store in the variable
and and the address of n is ampersand
and okay now now if I run this code if
we got the out we will get the output
from user will say input from user will
say enter number if I say 8 now 8 is a
even number right but I want to I want
to take this input a new line so after
this entire number there should be a new
line now how to go to new line after
printf you can simply say slash and now
slash and means new line so it's a
special symbol /n is a new line then we
have one more call as a slash t will be
used for tab then we have slash V which
is used for vertical tab
okay we'll focus on slash and time beam
and yeah now let's let's run this so
it's asking for a number we'll say
number is 67 and it's an odd number
right so this is how you have to take
input from user but what if you want to
take two inputs so let's say we have one
more variable just for our example it's
if you have one more variable X so what
we can do is we can say it is ampersand
person T 2 times and the first person is
ampersand and the second person T is
ampersand N and X right and then for
just notifications will say in total
numbers right this is how you have to
achieve - we can take two inputs on the
same time or you can use two scanner
simper so this is I have to achieve user
input in C programming just remove this
extra code even I don't want this X here
so just enough and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
