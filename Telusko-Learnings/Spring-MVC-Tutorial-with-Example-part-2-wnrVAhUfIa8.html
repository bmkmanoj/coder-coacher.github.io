MBC and spring embassy so in normal
embassy what we have is we have a model
we have view and we have a controller so
whenever you send a request to a web
server the request will be processed by
your controller now controller will ask
data from the database or from some
other resources in the format of a model
and the data will be displayed on a page
which will be called as view so you send
requests to our controller you generate
data in a model format you send that
data to the view so that you can show
all the data now if we talk about spring
and if you talk about normal MVC so you
have a model you have a controller so
you always imagine you have one
controller but if we talk about very big
applications you know huge applications
in that you might you might need
multiple controllers to work with
multiple views so for different
different tasks will be having different
different controllers now when you send
a request who is responsible to to
accept your request
I mean how will they know what you want
so let's say you want up you want to do
you want to add two numbers so there
will be a specific controller to add two
numbers let's say you want to log into a
system there will be a different
controller to log into your system if
let's say you want to log out again
there will be a different controller to
do that task for you so we'll be having
different different controllers so you
cannot send a request to multiple
control the same time so far all those
controllers you will be having a main
controller which will be also called as
front controller so you have to send a
request to a front controller now front
controller will decide okay depend upon
your request it will check your request
and it will send to the request with a
particular controller now to achieve
that we have to first define who is your
controller here and to define this
whenever you click on a submit button
here the request will go to web dot XML
file right so you have to mention your
thing here you have to mention where you
want to send your request so if dying
you cannot I can send your request to a
particular controller you have to use a
front controller now it is front
controller so in spring embassy that
front controller is called a dispatcher
servlet
now this dispatcher sublet is a sublet
of course so we have to send your
request to this sublet and to do that we
need to we need to type way to type the
redirect data here which is sublet tags
now instead of wasting my time in typing
that I already created a cheat code here
or cheat sheet you can say I will be
uploading this cheap sit on my website
and you can directly but it is website
go to the my website and you can copy
this I will provide a link in
description area so let me just copy
this thing so this is my changes so I
have to mention a spring dispatcher
sublet here which is a G dot spring
framework dot web dot sublet dispatcher
solve it so whenever you send any
request so when I say I have to send any
request so whenever I send any request
here which is slash for all the requests
I need to call dispatcher sublet now
dis- how we will take care for the
further processing okay so I'm going to
mention this thing so we have to mention
a sublet tag and a sublet mapping which
simply means for all the requests you
have to call dispatcher sublet now just
a point one thing but we have a sublet
name which is telescope again was the
importance of this name we'll see later
but time and just remember we have
something called a disco as a servant
named perfect now if we talk about this
class which is despite a sublet is it a
part of Tomcat and the answer is no this
is not a part of Tomcat so in order to
use this class we need to add some
libraries so from where you will get the
Slavens you have to go to spring website
so you have to say spring dot IO in that
spring dot iOS this is the official
website for spring then you have to go
to project section then you have to go
for Spring Framework you will be getting
all your libraries here so which is your
spring MVC right which is we are going
for spring MVC so we have to we cannot
download those lobbies here the only way
to get spring our basis we have to use
babban okay so what I will do too
to add those libraries in your project
you have to use this file which is P om
dot XML which is form file in this you
will be having lots of things we don't
we are not concerned about all this
thing we are only concerned about it
dependencies so whenever you need
something in your project you have to
add some type of dependencies in your
project so let's say you want a J unit
library so you have to add this
dependency with the version name let's
say you want to add mask you'll connect
up for database connectivity so you have
to add one more dependency so if you're
typing all the dependency are going to
have a cheat sheet in which I have
entered all I have already entered some
dependency so I will just copy this
dependencies again I will let you know
what are the dependencies are so let me
copy this and paste so the dependencies
we need here the first one is J unit
mean in order to test your application
in this I will not test anything so I we
do not require this but let's keep it
there second you require your spring MVC
libraries so this is your spring MVC
library next we need maybe in future if
you want to connect your application
with database so we require this
dependency now may you may need to work
with J STL which is Java JSP standard
tag libraries we have to use this
library here okay so again you will get
all this thing in the cheat sheet now
once you say save it will download all
the libraries from Internet okay or the
MAV and repository since I have already
done this project earlier so have a
local repository for that so that that's
why it was damn fast download all those
avenues if you are doing for this for
the first time it will take some time
for you to download so you can see your
progress in this section the like
section cool let me just show you that
how it works so if I say 4.11 I hope we
have some type of version there so you
can see this type of progress will be
there ok let's go back to three point
eight point one if I'm not wrong yeah so
once we have entered this so whenever
you click on a button whenever you click
on the submit button it will call
or it will go it will go to web device
ml file which says for all the requests
you have to call dispatch established
and then you will get dispersed object
from this file we don't want pom file
now dispatch a servlet needs to send
that request to some class right so we
need to create that class here so we'll
go for two main we'll say new simple
Java class I will say simple class with
class here so we have a class will click
on next and we to provide a name of the
provide first package will say to us or
so recom dot disco okay and this I will
provide a particular name so name of my
controller will be let's say add
controller okay and slick on finish now
this controller this is possible to add
two numbers okay now I will create a
method here which is public a void add
which will add two numbers okay and so
time we will not take any values just
print the output so I will simply say
sis out oh I know so it is this out
there's something wrong with my Eclipse
yeah since this out I will say I am here
okay so that at least if I run this
application it should print I am here
right so if I run this if I click on
submit button and if I request let's run
this white talk all this thing let's run
we start the server
okay so we have a form let me just zoom
in this time okay so let me enter two
values 7na doesn't matter it will not
add those values but if I click on
submit oh we got an error letter says
file not found so you can see again lots
of people hate errors but you know these
are the good things to learn new new
things so always go to the root cause
and search for the error so it says next
an exception which is Java dot IO dot
file not found exception okay so we are
graphing with some file and the file is
this one that is Co - sublet dot XML now
is this file this file is basically
whenever you run this application
whenever your request goes to web dot
XML it will go to dispatch a servlet but
dispatches servlet is a configurable
class so you despite a sublet should
know whenever you call for add you need
to call this method now how to teach
despair a servlet how to do that so we
need to create a new file which is a
configuration file for dispatcher
servlet and the type of file will be XML
will get XML file here and then we need
to mention a file name but what should
be the file name so it says the file
name should be tedisco - servlet dot xml
will enter this name again we'll see why
to enter that name so it is they just go
- servlet dot xml okay so we got a file
here but why this file name that is Co -
sublet so if your file name your
configuration file name should be
something - it should be something -
servlet dot xml so this thing is
confirmed this should be fixed you need
to change this now this thing is depend
upon your sublet names I hope you
remember I have talked about how I told
you about this you have to remember this
part let's go so since this is telescope
so this should be the disco so that
should be a file name ok now once you've
got this file name we have to configure
this servlet we need to add some bin
thing again
mission of typing all those things I
have a cheat sheet here let me just copy
this part and paste now it will specify
what to do so whenever I call whenever I
call for add my spring embassy need to
search for a package which is comm dot
was of a package named comm dot
telescope ok so it need to search for
this package is comm dot telescope I am
also saying that it should work with
annotation configuration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
