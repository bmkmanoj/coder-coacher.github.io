addition of two numbers so this was the
output we got which is result is 13
right so let me close all extra tags
here okay so this is what we were
getting right let me run this again so
that I will show you the output okay is
taking some time let's so let me pass
two values here which is seven and eight
and you are getting the output as
fifteen right now there is one may one
more way of writing this code so instead
of specifying the request dot kill
attribute we can actually use something
called as e l so e l stands for the
expression language so how to use C L so
we have to use our dollar symbol and
curly brackets we have to mention the
name of your label which is result so if
you are if you see this we have result
and then here also you have to mention
result okay now let's run this let's see
what happens if I run this code so let
me enter two values nine and eight if I
say submit it says result is in dollar
result we want the output not this part
right the problem is there are multiple
times where e L is not supported so
first way is maybe your your Tomcat your
where your web server is not supporting
e l or you are using a sublet version
which is below 2.4 I am using 3.0 so you
might you might be using a servlet
version below 2.4 odd maybe your JC page
has actually ignored all the expression
expression language so how to enable
that so in the page section we can use
something called as is e L ignored so by
default is false but in my mache it is
true now so what I will I will do it is
again false I don't want to ignore e l
so you just
have to add this line if in case if you
are getting error and let's go back to
the code let's run this and you got the
end of it you got the output witches
result is 17 cool so that's how you you
have to use e l here now what we'll do
next is we'll be creating an application
or login form in spring MVC okay so I
hope you got the basic idea about spring
MVC so whenever you try to we can do one
more thing here what we can do is
whenever you talk about web applications
so we'll be having multiple layers so
this is your controller layer so when
you are adding two values we should not
add values inside your controller so all
the logical processing should be done in
something called a service method so how
to use service so we have to or service
class so we have to create a new class
here we'll name this class as ADD
service and make sure it belongs to a
different package will say package name
is comm dot telesco dot service okay and
in this service will be having a method
which is called as public int add which
will take two parameters and it will
return one parameter we'll say return I
plus J okay and in this controller what
we can do is instead of creating object
we can we have to get object of add
service here so you have to say add
service we'll name this as a s equal to
new add service and then we'll be using
a s so we need to import the package so
we'll say control space so there are two
ways of inputting the package go to the
class and then say control space that's
one way or second ways you can type
control shift
o if you're a Mac user you can type
command shift oh okay and we'll fetch
that value will say int K equal to a as
dot add it we have to pass two values
and then it will add your values and you
will get the output now you will say to
add two numbers we have why we have to
create
nooks new class altogether see annual in
your dear life project will be not
building additional addition code our
calculator you will be doing something
very big right maybe you're creating a
login form maybe you have to fetch the
current stock market price so you can
ask your service class to do that for
you ok
so this if you are fetching stock stock
market price this will not be only one
line this will there may be 50 to 40 to
50 lines cool so that's how we need to
use service so in the next example will
be talk will be creating a new MVC
application but we need to we will also
deploy that application on OpenShift
server so what we'll do is we'll first
create a cloud-based application not
cloud-based but a mobile application
with you which you can deploy on
openshift
server so make sure you watch the next
video and yeah that's it from this video
we'll see in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
