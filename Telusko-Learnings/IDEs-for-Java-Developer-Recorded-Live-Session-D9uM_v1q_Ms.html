am I so just give me a high if you are
if you can hear me okay so in this video
we are going to talk about different
IDEs are available for journals and
we'll talk about one of the best ide for
you so you know we talked about idea is
we have lots of ideas available right so
we have NetBeans and like every causes
they normally use the beans we have
Eclipse IDE then we have a IntelliJ then
we have jdeveloper we have lots of ideas
available right in fact not the point is
they prefer to use to use notepad to
type the data right so when you say you
want to use an IDE why exactly we need
ID and what exactly I da means so I de
stands for it may just remove this and I
de ann's for it is integrated so that's
integrated development environment ide
stands for integrated doors open
environment and so it simply means that
whenever you want to make an application
so whenever you want to make an
application we have to use such we have
to use some ideas you can either use
netbeans we can either use net eclipse
or we can either use in today Jade and i
know that i have already have this video
i have this video on different ids
available but i wanted to explore mode
on this one which is IntelliJ because
when you say which is the best idea of
enable we have eight beans we have
Eclipse we have a DJ but still your
college prefers to use notepad I mean
why do we use notepad because see when
you write a Java for on notepad we have
to create we have to use also we have to
use notepad we have to combine it with
the help of CMD if you are using Windows
machine then we have to use some
commands like Java command to run the
application we have to use Java Sea for
compile the application right so when
you write a Java
on notepad we have to compile that using
cmd using Java Sea commander that you
can run this with your Java command and
yes if you are big nose or then yes note
that makes sense because when you use AI
de you will get some suggestions you
will get you will get those suggestions
we are we don't want that right we don't
want suggestions actually check your
errors you can you can work with you can
solve the adults when you compile it
right that's that's that's one of the
best way to use to learn to learn a java
on notepad but let's say if you have
learned if you have learned java what
next to make an application of course
you have to use certain ideas right
because we don't want to focus more on
so I don't want to focus more on compile
time error i want to focus more on the
concepts so when you say you want to
focus on concepts so of course we have
to use not concept but we have to focus
more on the development part the logic
parties are focusing on syntax that's
where you have to use it you have to use
IDEs ok so one one of the best one is
NetBeans of course everyone knows that
it this is best right but we have
certain other ideas as well which we can
use let me just show you those those
lengths or these websites where you can
find this idea is first so I'm sharing
my aunt Aston with you now so that you
can see what's what's going on behind
the scene okay so okay I hope you can
see my opera browser here so one of the
best I mean one of the ideas which you
can normally use is NetBeans so again
you can go to NetBeans and you can go to
the website the official website of
NetBeans and yet so this is netbeans ide
the current version of 19 is 8.2 but I
don't normally prefer NetBeans in fact
or if you can see all my videos all my
new videos are no NetBeans right but now
I prefer now I don't use that means we
are using so I'm using eclipse ok now y
equals is because if i go to eclipse dot
if i go to eclipse
website okay so i use Eclipse now
because one of I love this a kile of
eclipse in fact why everyone prefers to
his eclipse is because they are
different IDs I've been able on eclipse
example we have jboss jboss developer
studio which i use in my machine you can
see if I opened a bottle of us to do i
normally use that now so why we need a
washer / studio net say if I'm if I want
to make a website and and I have jboss
as my server and I need some features of
jboss so it is always better to use
gparted up a studio because it will give
you those features now jboss developer
studio is based on eclipse it's not
something within you it is something
which is based on a clip so if you use
eclipse it is very easy to use the
portal of a studio in fact we can also
use stl so what is sts so when you want
to make a spring application so if you
are thinking about making string
application then we can use sts and so
so when you use sts here so we can I is
that ok just taking lots of time to open
I don't know my machine is getting
raised lot nowadays so even if you open
a click on its pling you can see
somewhere it is written here at clubs
right so even spring st I mean spring
tool suite which is a software to make
websites or web application or soft lips
of application we using spring framework
is based on eclipse so if you know it
clips you can learn all this thing very
easily ok so that's how your eclipse
looks like if you if I want to show you
the that's that's the project ok so I
was making some hibernate videos you can
see I am making there just to update you
i'm also making high mind videos if you
want to learn hypernet you can see that
so this is your eclipse this is how I
cliffs looks like oh yeah so if i go to
about eclipse you can see I'm using
eclipse mass mass pipe i mean i'm using
4.5 11 you can use this but then which
is the best ide available is it this
thing else so the best ide available is
not this one but this one which is a TD
j AI de this is best is because it likes
you lots of features in fact lots and
lots of features but the only problem
with IntelliJ is why i am not using
IntelliJ when it is best if I go to
IntelliJ it is made by jetbrains okay
and in fact this is very famous if you
are using if you are using this one
which is Android studio and wash studio
is based on intelligence so if you ever
opening and wants to do you can see it's
based on internet chain okay so it is
one of the best one but the problem is
you can see the type of I'm the ball
shall we are using i'm using here is
community edition which means that i can
make only those i mean i can i cannot
make every type of software so i have to
use so i'm using community edition one
of the enterprise asian let me just go
to the website of IntelliJ just to just
to show you what I'm talking about if I
put you into DJ IntelliJ is that DJ ide
and ok so if I go to the website okay
come back right soon okay so it is
giving me the download option this is
the intelligent official website now
they have to wash your one is community
version and second is ultimate version
so when you want to make a verification
you need to use ultimate version right
so you can see if you want to go for
ultimate version they are giving you the
file trial version here so you have to
pay for the ultimate version now how
much you can how much they will charge
you they have their they have some okay
i don't know the so you can see we have
a buy option there okay so if you
ultimate you have to pay around five
hundred dollars per year and that is
about one machine okay if you want to go
for multiple machines then you have to
have to pay more so that's one of the
reason why i am not using IntelliJ but
there are companies they use in to DJ
because they can they can pay for this
so yes you can also use IntelliJ if you
watch oh yeah so that's that's why i am
using it that's why I have IntelliJ I
have a community version not the
ultimate version and that's why I use
eclipse because eclipse is free ok so
that's it if you want to explore more or
IntelliJ you can just good go and
download into the j now what's the
purpose of this video is just to show
you different IDs available I mean there
are lots of numbers of ID is which one
to go for if you are in college go for
in that means if you wha if you want to
get into company Coppola clips and if
you are working for a company where they
are ready to tear a to pay you are they
ready to buy this inscription for you of
course you have to use it TJ if you know
one ID age is very easy to learn the
other IDE so that's it from this this
video I saw you making some life I can
go live anytime ok so I am planning for
this you know I will not mention any
life session in future I will go live
impromptu in the unique site in the
evening time itself so if I the moment I
get some free time i will take a topic
and i will go live ok so that's it from
this video if you if you want to be if
you want to be notified about this live
sessions I guess you can just click on
the notification button on the
registration is a notification button
somewhere here where you can mention
that whenever I go live you should get
updated on it you can also like my
telesco logic page on my channel or this
holding page on Facebook and to
subscribe dushay my videos if you think
my videos are valuable so that's it
that's it from this video see you in the
next light session thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
