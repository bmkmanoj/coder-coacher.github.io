ready from Paris colonics and in this
video we'll talk about constructor so
whenever you talk about Java so Java
specifically follows object-oriented
right so now in Java 8 we have
functional programming so if we talk
about this concept of object-oriented we
have certain certain words like we have
object we have class and we also have a
trombonist constructor so where the use
constructor so let's say when you have
when you have a plus let's say this is
no class here which is class a and in
this class we have certain variables so
let's say we variable we have is int I
and then we have one more variable let's
say not int but this family variable is
float okay we have float let's say F now
if you have two videos in this class
right and let me just end this class
here so if I ask you what's the size of
I and the answer is four right so also
for you so in takes four bytes if I ask
you about float again float takes four
bytes so eight total we have eight bytes
right now let's say I want to gate
object of a here so when I want to
create object of a so let's say this is
our main function PS v m now why exactly
we require PS vm so let's say let me
take my duster okay so why we have this
PS VM so let's say if you want to create
the object of a we require a main method
why because the execution of your code
starts from main so what we need so in
order to call a main method so main
method takes a parameter right so maybe
because if you want to pass some initial
parameters you will pass those
parameters use which is string Arg use
and since the type of parameters can be
anything it can be int it can be float
it can be string so that's why we take
string because string accept all the
values then we are not sure that how
many values our user will send one or
two so you are taking an array now this
mean will return nothing so we have to
write void because it will return
nothing but a chance that this main
method can be static method now
why should be static is because to call
any method in Java we require object
right and you can create object once
your execution starts main is the
starting point of the execution so you
cannot you cannot call main without
object and you cannot get object without
main so that's a deadlock there to solve
the deadlock they are just saying that
this is a static method that means in
order to call main you don't require an
object you just require a class name and
we'll make it public so that is public
static void mean okay so we are going
for all this and so we have prosthetic
void mean if I open this and close this
now how to pay it object of a so when
you want to get object of a we can
simply say a and then we say obj right
so that's how you create object in C or
C++ but in Java in order to create
object we have to provide one more step
so this is your reference creation so
this is reference in order to create
object we have to specify a keyword
which is new so we use new to create the
object of a class in fact it provides
this space because if you talk about
object so it will take some space inside
a heap memory so there will be a heap
memory so in order if you know how to
create object of inside heap memory we
require activities new keyword so new
keyword will consume this space right so
just explaining example just imagine you
want to travel you want to travel and
again we have seen this and one of the
video which is object instantiation
whenever you want to travel in train you
buy that pillow right which is which
will not have in air so you have to
inject other or you have to blow some
air so you have to blow the air with the
above new keyword that will provide the
memory but how much memory you have to
also specify the amount of memory right
so let's say if you want to create a
variable 8 so you look you PI's 4 bytes
float 4 bytes but what about the object
how much space is required for an object
so this answer will be given by the
constructor so every class even if you
don't pension even if you don't mention
there will be a constructor in in every
class so constructor is like a member
method which means every method will
have brackets so we have a bracket here
okay this thing is a constructor yes
this is a constructor okay so a bracket
so this bracket here this is a method ok
so black it means method and so
constructor is a member method which has
the same name as class name so you can
see class name is a that's why
constructor name is also a ok so that
for the first rule or the first thing
about constructor constructor is a
member method that means we require
round brackets second constructor will
have the same name as class name so
that's why we have a next constructor
will never return anything that's why we
have to write public so no need to
mention any written type here no void no
int and that's your constructor okay so
every time you want to create an object
you have to use constructor even if you
don't define the constructor it will be
there inside your class and that's why
these constructors are called as
default constructor because you are even
if you don't create the constructor it
will be that that's why just call it
default okay so now here okay just me
just do some line so here you have to
mention the constructors so that every
time you want to create the object it
will communicate with your JVM that I
want to create the object how much space
I require that will be given by the
constructor so the use of constructor it
will be used to allocate the memory to
the object okay so let me repeat or this
constructor it's a member method okay
write it somewhere but right okay
so we'll use this space so constructor
is a member method second it has the
same name so same name as class name the
third thing is it will
never return anything and the fourth
thing is it will be used to allocate
memory it will be used to allocate
memory okay now you can also use the
constructor to initialize your value so
let's say the value of I by default will
be let's say zero and it will be zero
point zero it has a default values for
int and float but let's say I want to
provide the default values for the
variables not zero but let's say five so
I can say in the constructor I equal to
five and let's say for if I want to
specify five point five so the value of
is five the value for F is five point
five right so we can provide the initial
values of the variables in constructor
so that's the one that's one of the
advantage of constructor
now question arise to assign this values
we have to call construct right so we
have to call the constructor and the
amazing thing is you cannot call the
constructor for the same instance
because every time you create an object
it will call the constructor right so as
soon as you create the object it will
call this block you don't have to call
the constructor it will be called
automatically sounds good so that's how
you can use constructor but we can also
have different types of constructor so
we can have here so we have we can have
one more constructor in the class so we
can say public a but this constructor
will have a different parameters so we
can specify int I and we can specify a
lick will say this is int K so we can
specify I equal to K here right so we
can have two constructors in the same
class provided they have different
parameters okay and this concept of
having multiple constructors with
different parameters the same class is
called as constructor overloading
against a part of polymorphism right so
once you know about constructor once you
know about method overloading so just
combine it it is constructor overloading
guess is good now in order to call this
block so if I send it let's say if I
printing something here if I printing
something that says system dot out dot
println it is hi
and Here I am printing system to ordered
println hello so if I run this code now
it will print hi it's because we are we
are calling a default constructor but in
order to call the second constructor
which is have to pass a value let's say
if I pass six
so in this a bracket if I pass six it
will call the second constructor okay so
let me just check my videos walking is
it recording okay so so we have a
constructor here in which you have I
equal to five so if I run this code now
it will print hello quite simple right
now what next mm something more we can
do here okay that's it that's your
constructor so we can call the constrain
this way and nothing much now let's say
can we have mocha suta we can also have
one more constructor here which takes
two parameters one is a and it can say
int K comma float J right so now in this
case you have to pass two parameters so
in this you have to pass 6 comma let's
say 5.6 so when you pass this two
parameters you have to also provide F
here when you pass those two parameters
it will call this constructor okay so
that's how your constructor overloading
works so to understand it with
practically we have the next video we
have talked about the constructor in the
practical way so if we can run those
codes there so so that's it that's it
from the constructor so once you
remember constructor is a member method
it has the same name as the class name
and it will never return anything and it
is used to allocate memory it is also
used to initialize your variables and
that's it so that's it from this video
