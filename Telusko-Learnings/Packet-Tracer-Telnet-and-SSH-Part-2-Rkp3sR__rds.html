we'll talk about something called as SS
h which is secure shell now as you know
last video was of telling it didn't tell
that we can access your remote machine
from your local machine so for this you
have to configure a router so that it
will work with telnet protocol now tell
that stands for terminal network yeah so
then that telnet gives you features of
remote login but the problem is when you
talk when you talk about remote login
now you have to you have to send some
password to this router so it will
verify and this the password which you
sent to this router it goes in a plain
text that means it's not secure to make
it secure you have to use something
called as SSH now to enable SSH so you
have to go to the goatee router and then
again we have to configure first you
have to say enable I have always set the
password for this router 1 2 3 4 5 ok so
then once you get it to routers router
country or this enable mode you have to
say config T and from this you have to
work with some commands now the first is
you have to set the IP domain that is at
the IP domain name we can set any name
like we can say the wins so IP domain
name is Naveen then you have now when we
talk about this SSH it uses some
cryptography method so we have to set
some cryptography put it oh we have to
set some key and we have to generate
that key so we have a command call it
generate and we have to specify the
algorithm type so one of the algorithm
which supports this SSH is RSA so you
can use RSA algorithm such as this then
yeah for this we need to set the
hostname it's compulsion so we can set
the hostname and we'll say what hostname
is SS such demo
now we can go for the clip to clip the
part yeah now it's asking for the how
many bits you have to enable for this
module now it which by default is five I
went to you can say did multiple so what
you can do is you can set once there to
four for the Alice algorithm and then
you have to we have to specify which
type of remote login we can use so we
can say IPS as such we are going for
assistance this time and the version of
SSH we are using is version 2 then after
this you have to set remote login so we
have to type line vty as we have done in
telnet its line vty 0 and then here you
have to say we have to use a transport
layer and we'll be giving some input
from transport in the format of ssh and
say ok so once you complete this once
you complete this you have to say exit
and that's it you have already
configured your SSH and then let me
close this router and from this machine
if you know work with SSH now instead of
saying telnet last time we have used
with yeah last time we have said telnet
this time I will say it's SSH and since
we are saying login so login and you
know with username is admin and then you
have to specify your address it's one
eighty two dot one sixty eight dot one
dot one and now password is one two
three four five six now you can see you
can access your doubt and this is secure
mode when you say part you have sending
some password it will go in ciphertext
because we are using algorithm called as
our SC so telnet the white shoe remote
login SS is per watch your remote login
the difference is telnet is not secure
SSH is secure
so I hope you understand this thank you
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
