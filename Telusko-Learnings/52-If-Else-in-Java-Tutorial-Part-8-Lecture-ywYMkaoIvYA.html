secure video tutorials
now in this we'll see the implementation
of each else condition now for this will
create a new file new Java file so we
have to right click on your project and
say deal and this will be fine you will
find something of the Java class in Java
class will name it as a limit as demo if
finish okay okay so now we have this new
file demo of this code all this comment
okay and now here what we can do is we
need to write some code right and when
we write some code we'll rewrite some
statement which will be executed those
statements should belongs to a function
called as main function so we have to
say public static void main the shortcut
we can use this PS VM and tab so we are
getting DPS VM thing now in this what we
need to do is we we will we will check
for a given number if it is a even
number or the odd number right so to
check a given number is even or odd what
we to do is we have to we have to check
it with the help of when we divide a
number by two if it gives us a remainder
one it is an odd number it would give
you a remainder zero it's a one number
right so to implement that part what
we'll do is it will take a number a
variable number one in which I will save
a value file okay now what next
we have to check right so to check
something we have to use if statement is
also called as control statement so in
this we have to pass now what we have to
check number that it is when we divide
to divide this number by two we should
get a remainder some demon - right so to
get the remainder we have to say mod so
there is a simple color is mod this is
your percentage sign is your mod symbol
when you say do mod - if you are getting
a value zero if you are Amida is zero
you can say you can say the number is
even so you have to enclose all this
part in this curly braces then else part
now if your number if this condition is
true it will execute this part if this
end condition is false it will go to
else
so in else if your number is not even it
should be odd right simple now when I
run this code shift f6 when I run this
code
I was doing some time
yeah the answer is odd now if I change
this number to eight which is it number
to 8 and now if I done this the answer
is even right now now will this is your
if and else now what if you have
multiple conditions like if I'm a check
or given number like let's let's go for
three numbers this time we'll go for
clean numbers let us suppose a B and C
okay and is initial value is for base
value is 3 and C value is 8 now we want
to print the biggest number we have to
print the greatest number so what we can
do is we have to check again now we have
to check now how will you check to check
the greater number and this what we to
do is we have to check first a let will
check if a is greater than not so we
have to say a greater than B if a is
greater than B and it should be greater
than C right it should be a greater than
B and it should be greater than C so
when you say we have this and condition
we have to use ampersand ampersand
ampersand ampersand defines and
conditions okay and then we can see a is
greater than C so if a is greater than B
and F get isn't C we can say a okay then
we'll say else if now we are again
checking that base greater than so we
have to say else if so in this B is
greater than C see if a is greater than
B and a is greater than C then your a is
greater if you're a if this condition
gives you false result if your result is
false it means a is not get a right so
we have to check these greater than C we
don't need we don't need to check we
don't need to check this part B is
greater than a because we know that a is
smaller now so we have to check B is
greater than C
so here output will be B now if a is not
greater B is not greater output will be
C is greater right so we have to say is
out C so this is how you can implement
if as condition okay
and here what's more important is this
ampersand ampersand which is which
signifies it is an operation so we have
C right to C is greater now if I make it
this as 13 base 13 so output will be B
right because b is greater than oh now
how this and operation works is for this
we take a note okay now how this and
works is let's suppose you have a value
if we have operator a and B if if a is
true and B is true you will get the
output as to when and operation so we
have to use and operation if your a is
true and B is false the output will be
false if your B is a is false and B is
true again it will give you f false if
both are false you will get false it
means in and operation if one is true if
both are true you will get the result as
true now you can also think you can also
talk about our operation so we have
logical operation or in which you have a
B and for all operation you have to use
two pipes okay if both are true you get
to true if one is true second is false
you will get true if both are if a is
false B is true you will get true if
both are false you will get false right
so in this if all are if any one of them
is true you will get true now in this
you can remember in this way imagine
true as something
earth as nothing so when you have
something plus something you will get
something right you will get something
something plus nothing you will get
something nothing plus something you
would again get something and nothing
plus nothing you will get nothing so
this is how you can implement here
something nothing logic here you can
implement a logic of pure water in pure
water so tea is pure water F is in pure
water so you have pure water when you
mix it with pure water you will get P or
bottom if you mix pure water with impure
water you will get impure water in pure
water with pure water you will get
impure water and impure water in pure
water will mix it you will get impure
water so this is how you can implement
this logic so in this we are using and
operation it means both should be true
so that will execute a okay so this is
how you can you can implement if-else
condition now one more thing to be noted
here if if your if block if your block
has only one statement one executable
statement then Curly basis is not
compulsory so you what we can do is we
can remove this Godley basis it still
will it will still work okay so in case
if you have only one statement there is
no need of quadriyyah basis so now if i
done this what would you still be right
it's working so I hope it will you
understand something and now do the
square for these for the videos thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
