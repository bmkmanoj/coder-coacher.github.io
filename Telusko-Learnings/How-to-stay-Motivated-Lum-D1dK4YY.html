question is not how to get motivated the
mouth the main question is how to stay
motivated it's because to get motivate
it's damn easy but to stay motivated is
damn difficult you know when I go for
different sessions or training sessions
I have it have this habit of motivating
people because I believe education is
10% teaching and 90% motivation because
if you cannot motivate people they would
not learn now you know we talk about
motivation to get motivated you have to
set a target now what a target you have
to set so let's say I want to get sling
that's my next motivation all I want to
learn may be different topic like big
data I want to be a big data
professional so that's my that's how
that's what my target is and when I see
my target every morning I get motivated
Oaktown to achieve this so that's how
you can motivate yourself all you can
attend different sessions you know you
can just go to you can you go to YouTube
you can search for different videos on
motivation and then watch those videos
and you will get motivated but the
problem is when I motivate my students
that motivation doesn't last long maybe
one day maybe four hours maybe two days
I feel their memory is like Osram so
once they can go for a nap of six hours
it gets a no volatile so if everything
vanishes so you cannot depend up on
motivation motivation is like taking a
bath you have to take it daily right so
every day you have to get motivated but
I will not I will not be at your home to
motivate you every day right I mean you
can watch my videos on YouTube every day
you can watch the same video everyday we
are you'll be getting motivated I am
getting lots of views but the problem is
that's not how you do it right you have
to be self-motivated now question is how
to get self-motivated so to achieve that
self motivation you have to get an habit
now how to get in habit let's say let's
say you want to achieve something you
want to be a best programmer so you have
to do that programming every day that we
so programming should be in your should
be a habit now if you do something for
21 days consistently it becomes a habit
a lie I don't believe in that it's
because most of us are learning or
studying from last 20 by the ears and we
still don't have that habit of studying
so it's not about what you do for 21
days it's about how you feel doing the
doing that thing for 21 days example
when I like making videos is my habit so
when I matter when I make a video I feel
good you know it something inside me
feels very good so that's what motivates
me so to motivate yourself get in a
habit get a target okay and be
self-motivated that's very important so
from today you have to motivate yourself
and now get get the work done don't
think about work work it make it work do
something so once again be motivated get
in habit and this has motivated okay now
this is this is how I motivate you now
you have to motivate me so how I get
motivated
I need likes I need subscriptions and so
do like my video and do subscribe thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
