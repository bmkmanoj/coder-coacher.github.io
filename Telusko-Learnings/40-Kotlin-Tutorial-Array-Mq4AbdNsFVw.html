defenders kaletnik's and so we have done
so many things right until now we have
not seen about something called as Eddie
now if you remember if you have worked
on any language maybe C C++ Java you
must have seen the concept of added
right now at exactly this array means no
when you have a collection of elements
so if you have a number of variables and
if you want to work them together
instead of creating five to four I mean
four to five variables separately we can
create one array so instead of saying
five variables we can create an array of
five elements but then how can we do
that in in Cortland so it's very simple
actually so let's say if you have a
variable and if you say those variables
nums
now instead of having one value in nums
let's say if I have if I want to have
four values in norms and those four
values are maybe 10 12 14 16 so I want
these values to do that if you want to
assign values it's very simple actually
in content we have a function called as
in debug function called as ain't a day
off so you can simply say int add it off
and in this bracket you can mention the
values so the values you want is 10 12
14 and 16 so if you want to assign
static values this is so simple just use
int add it off and you can assign you
can specify the value there and you have
all your values in these nubs okay now
how do we print it so let's try to print
num zero so if I try to print num sign
you fire on this code let's try which is
printing all the values and okay it's
worth taking some time and as you can
see in Java as well we get the same
output right so we are getting the hash
code and then this is an array of hash
code of an array if what if you want the
individual values so it's very simple
actually what you can do is you can use
a for loop to print all the values so it
is a for loop and we say I and we'll say
I in nums and let's print individual
values let's print I and now if it on
this code and of course when you have a
for loop where you have only one
statement you don't actually need that
curly brackets and if I love this code
you can see we got the values which is
10 12 14 and 16 now how do we get added
it's very simple simply use int array
of and then you can specify the values
now can we change the values of fit
example if I assign the value and
strength 12 49 16 let's see let's say I
want to change the value of 14 how do we
do that
now in if you remember when you talked
about array you always refer with index
numbers right so today for the first
tournament we use index number zero so
the index number starts with 0 so this
is 0 this is 1 and then the second one
okay is that so this is 2 and this is 3
right so we have this index numbers I
want to change this 12 to 10 so let me
just change this value from 12 to 13 to
do that what I will do is I will say
Nam's now in added we always use the
square bracket so if you want to change
a value if you want to specify the index
number which is specify a 1 for 12
right so 0 is 10 so the index number 0
has a value of 10 index number 1 is the
value 12 so we say num of 1 is equal to
12 right so in or 13 so we have two main
you have to make the number as 13 and
let's save and let's run let's see what
happens now after learning the closing
the code you can see we got 10 and 13 so
of course we can we can do that the same
thing is possible in other language as
well we can use this in C C++ and Java
now Cortland says
see if even in Java arrays are objects
right and when you say arrays are
objects it should have some methods
using which you can set the values and
get the values because walking with the
square bracket is not comfortable for
everyone there are some people they
believe when you want to fetch when you
want to assign the values we should be
using a method like maybe something like
set or get is it possible here let's see
if I want to print this if I want to
change this value but not using this
syntax so we can do that will say nums
of ergonomics dot we can use a set
method again so that we do have a set
method which which takes your index
number first so we'll specify 1 comma 13
so I want to replace that value with 13
so instead of using the square bracket
we can also use a method set and h1 is
now and okay it's taking some time ok so
as you can see we got the value of 13 so
we can either use a we can either use a
square bracket or we can use a
method which is said okay now how do we
how do you French the element let's say
if I don't want to print all the
elements I want to print a specific
value
I want to fetch this 16 of course the 16
is at location 3 right index number 3 so
I will send nums dot again we can use a
square bracket here we can say a nums
of 3 so it will fetch the it will face
the value at index number 3 and let's
print or not system dot out dot println
will use println ok let's do that and
again we don't need semicolon here let's
run this code and as you can see we got
the output as 16 so we got the output as
16 okay so this is one way the another
way is you guessed it right we can also
use a mirror gate using which you can
specify the index number which is here
which is three and let's run this code
okay just taking some time okay as you
can see we got the value which is
studying here sorry sixteen here so at
the next number three we have value
sixteen now let's say if I don't know
the last value so do we have anything
called as size zero so if I say num
start size glad we got size ok so num
start or do we have some other method
using fit you can using which okay so do
we have so it gives you the last value
I don't normally to work so instead of
saying get let's say num start last will
it give me last value
let's try I don't know I've never tried
this before let's run this code and okay
can you see that we got the evaluate in
16 so yes so it provides you lots of
methods to work with so yeah so it gives
you lots of other methods like set get
last it also give you size for the size
of the array right
okay now thing is if you want so this is
the add a which has the static values
wide with God we know the values were 10
12 14 16 so it was working but what if
you want to create an array where you
don't know the size or you don't know
the values you know besides the values
the sides will be 4 but you don't leave
values now how do we create an array
where you don't know the values in that
scenario what we will do what we will
use is well you will not use int array
off because int array of imagine that
you will pass the parameters
at the same time instead of that will
use a special class in cordoning called
as int array and in this ain't added in
this bracket of dimension 4 so when you
say 4 it means you have an array of 4
values so let's let's remove this read
this code and let me just uncommit my
for loop right and what's that I just
need to uncomment it and let let's not
let's remove this part ok now let's set
the value so we'll set the value at 0
location so again you can do that here
we say nums dot set let's set the index
number 0 as 10 if you don't know the
value spree hand we can do that so we
can create a dynamic array or we can we
not say dynamic array but the values are
coming later right so we'll say 2 comma
14 and then we can do with the we can do
with this third value instead of that we
could have copied this before so that we
could have saved some time but let's try
so if I say 3 and if I assign the value
16 here ok let's run this once again and
I'm getting able to being the same
output yeah so we got 10 13 14 and 16
right so we can create an array or if
you don't know the value spree hand so
if you know the value spree hand we can
use int array off otherwise we can use
int array what works okay this is what
ain't right what if you want to use
float what if you want to use double so
don't worry in that case you already
have those classes can you see that if
you if I say control space not here okay
that's weird what's happening okay so if
I say a double addict and so that we
also have double array we have float
array we have gather a so we have all
this added types so fall fall in bridge
data type like primitive we have all
those arrays what about string what if
you want to create an area of string
okay in that scenario what you do is we
have to say arrays that is not just for
string we can use it for other type as
well so we'll say a day off so we can
see we have a option of array of nulls
because if you do not know the values of
course are you cannot specify that right
specify a days off null and in this FG
specify the class name so if you want to
get an array of string begins a string
if you want to get a day off student you
can say student provided you have a
student class of course and we don't
have a class as of now but let's try
with string so we say a days off null
and we can provide a string there in
this package of to specify the size
let's say few says five this array will
have five elements again you can you can
try it up I try try it out by yourself
assign the values here but you have to
make sure that you are assigning a
string value and then you can print it
out it works right so that's how you
work with string that's how you can work
created an object of student or maybe I
need any other class for that matter now
the thing is if you can see in the mail
itself we are using this array how do we
use this array and how can we what are
the other syntax available so in tax in
fact there is one more syntax available
for array we cannot discuss that now
because we have not seen a higher-order
functions now so once we talked about
that once we talked about lambda
expression we'll come back to add a once
again and we'll see obviously how this
works so that's it I hope you enjoyed
this session and do share this video
with your friends and do like and thank
you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
