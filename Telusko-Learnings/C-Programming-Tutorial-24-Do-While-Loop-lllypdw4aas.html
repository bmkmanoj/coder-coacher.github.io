now in the if we talked about this while
loop what if your value of I the initial
value of I is 6 will this loop will this
loop executes let's run if you run this
it's not printing any value which simply
means it will go to this condition and
if to check 6 is less than equal to 5
and the answer is false it will not
execute the while loop okay that's why
it is not printing anything but let's
say you want even if your condition is
false you want to print a you want to
execute a block for once so that is
possible when you use do-while loop so
what is syntax for do-while loop in
do-while loop
you check the condition after the block
okay and at the start of the block you
use of a keyword College do so we'll cut
this part and we'll paste it here so
here goes your condition so let me just
give some tabs okay and this is your
condition here so now you have to
mention do then you have to you have to
type your block and at the end you will
be specifying the condition and then you
will be give a semicolon here
now why semicolon at the end is because
when you talk about by loop so after so
if you talk about normal file normal why
look in that you mentioned curly
brackets white curly brackets open and
closed which defines that next is the
block but in this you are defining the
block before while loop so you have to
mention something here to end this
statement so that's why we are using
semicolon
okay so you have to make sure anyway you
use do do I hope you give a semicolon at
the end this is not while this is do I
now and in the case of while loop if you
execute this condition with the initial
value which is 6 it will not print any
high but since we are using do-while
loop it will it will first execute the
block then it will check for the
condition just to prove I am point if I
run this code you can say we are getting
high once okay
is because it will print hi ones and
then since we are not satisfying the
condition it will come out of the loop
and it will only print once right but
let's say if I make it one what happens
now is it will it print six times and
let's try it's printing five times so it
doesn't matter if you just do while loop
or while oh it will execute in the same
number of statements but it will execute
it once even if your condition is false
at the starting level okay so that's how
your do while loop works so the next
video will talk about for loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
