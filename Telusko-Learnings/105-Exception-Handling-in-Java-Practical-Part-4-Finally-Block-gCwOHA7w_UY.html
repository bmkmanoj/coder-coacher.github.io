statement here after my calculation if I
print the value and printing the value
it's yeah let me just take this K from
here and when you put it here as K so
this will this K will print the value
will say output pairs : and then we'll
print with the value of K right and now
and before this I should print enter the
number enter into the number so to make
to make our code more efficient right we
since we're taking input from user well
run this and enter the number we'll say
number is 4 and the output is 2 right
and at last I want to print by so after
this if I say us out I want to print by
it's like that side you got the output
now get lost that's the only way we can
say by eye now if I run this entire
number so far and you can see last in -
we have this by but what if if I run
this code and unfortunately if I give
our input a 0 and the output will be
cannot divide by 0 and I which is either
exception and 0 alright that means once
you got the error here it will throw an
error it will directly go to this catch
statement it will execute this statement
here and it will do the exit what I want
to print it I want to print is by right
it will not go back so why do i this by
I want to print by anyhow it doesn't
matter if I get the output or if I get
the error I want to print by so what you
will say just copy this line here and
print it here also so that in both the
cases doesn't matter if output comes or
error comes it will print by all right
something in this way if I say 0 now you
can see we have fine but don't you think
we are going for the intent redundant
lines and in software world the
redundant code means it's a criminal act
basically so what we can do is instead
of writing it here instead of adding it
here
in Java or we have something called as
finally blog notice this final block
means doesn't matter if the your code
gives an error or not if your try
executed successfully again it will call
finally block if your if your thrice
throws the error it will call the catch
and at large it will call finally so in
both the scenario in both the case it
will call final block if I run this code
let's give the property input as - you
can see we have why because this is from
finally block now and let me just print
here
finally finally right okay so that again
will go with input as - you can see
finally black or finally by and if I
give a wrong input if I say zero again
it's finally by right so in both the
cases it's it will give me the output
now when it is useful let's say you are
trying to use some resource like in this
scenario we are using a resource which
is VR and unfortunately this is a
resource we should close so what we can
do is in finally we can say BR dot close
so you should always close the resources
you are using again it will it will
again throw an exception so we can write
try catch and as the that's the problem
with the Java you have to handle lots of
exceptions and it's not wrong it's
because it might throw another because
maybe that resource isn't used and you
are trying to close it right so we
should close all your resources in
finally block and ok and next we'll talk
about those and throw in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
