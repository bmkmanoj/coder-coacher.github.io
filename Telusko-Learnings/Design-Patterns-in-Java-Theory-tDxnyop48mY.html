ready from the Haskalah things and today
we will discuss something about design
patterns now you know when you you can
build your own softwares right of course
anyone can build a software and to
develop a software what we should know
is programming language right and one of
the best language to learn so that you
can build a software is job of course
right now let's say you want to be a
software developer so what you will do
you will spend one week and then you
will learn Java and the next week you
will start making software's awesome
right but when you build a software you
have to face lots of problems
now this problems there are some
problems out of this which are very
common problem which are future which it
which are faced by lots of software
developers so what if if we have a
common problem
can we just solve it and then anyone
having the same problem can use that can
use that solution of course right we can
do that now whether that's in turn a
domain problem example when you are
working on a banking application so
that's a different domain when you're
working with maybe a social networking
app that's a different domain but if you
talk about the conceptual which is
object-oriented conceptual problems we
can solve that with the help of some
common solution and now also throughout
the industry we have some professionals
they provided something on us best
practices and we call those best
practices as design pattern so it all
started in 1994 around also there was a
book by four people and in which they
have mentioned the principles of design
pattern or principles of object-oriented
design patterns so the main motto was
just to so whenever you have a
object-oriented software the first
principle was you should always prefer
composition over inheritance and the
second principle was whenever you cool
code for interface not for the
implementation and depend about these
two lines they created the whole set of
design patterns and this four people
were commonly known as Gang of Four
garlic goons right so we have gang of
four people so they have this four
people and now so they have defined some
design patterns so and we have just
classified those design patterns of
these sections so we have this truck or
the
creational design pattern we have
structure and then we have
behavioural so if you are not a design
pattern right so now if you want to
build a software using best practices
follow this design pattern but there are
two questions now the first question is
should we know all these and patterns
and the answer is yes you should know
all the design patterns the second
question should we implement all this
design pattern of course right so let's
say you are building a next software now
you will be using all design pattern
right hold on that's not the case you
should not use all design pattern one
software it should depend upon your
requirement look at your requirement if
your requirement says we want to create
an object how do you get an object then
we have to follow creation design
pattern right let's say I want to either
solve in which you want to compose
objects so let's say you have an object
inside that you want to include one more
object or you if you have an object here
which provides some features you have
object here which provides some features
and this object wants to use this object
then we have to work with structural
design patterns the third one is let's
say you have two objects we don't want
to compose them but we want to make some
communication between those two objects
at this point you have to use behavioral
design pattern right should all depend
upon your requirement don't rush off
don't rush to use design patterns think
about your logic or think about the
applauded them think about your software
problem try to solve those problem with
about best practices which is design
pattern here and you can use any of this
so approximately we have 13:23 design
patterns we have some more but this is
basic design patterns you have here okay
so let's start the first one we have
created a design pattern so in which you
have six five design patterns one of the
my favorite is factory pattern so when
you if you are working with Spring
Framework if you are working with
hibernate you you know about what is
factory right then we have singleton you
can create only one instance of a class
amazing right though no one use it now
so we have all the design pattern here
for the creational because here your
concern is about creating the object how
to create an object maybe using factory
may be using singleton so it's all about
creation of the object the next one is
structural now what it means so if you
have again two objects and you want to
compose this object inside your object
then you can
was structural so if your Android
developer if you have worked on swing
you might be knowing about adapter
design pattern right we after with this
we have lots of design patterns one of
my favorite is facade I know in the in
Hindi we have this Cahawba
of sorry facade gate Jolliet sorry
facade each area has its facade design
pattern here if you don't know in this
that's ok that's what a weird bug out
joke ok so we have a structure design
pattern which you have six we have seven
design patterns here the next one is
behavior in which you have I don't know
how to call this I guess this is 11
design patterns so in which we'll talk
about observer design pattern we'll talk
about these are design patterns of use
we try to cover all the design patterns
I will try to cover everything but basic
ones will be there okay just just to
make you understand how to use design
patterns so this is design patterns and
if you want to know the actual
implementation of it that we'll see in
the whole series we'll talk about one by
one design patterns okay so make sure
you subscribe the channel so that you
will watch all the exact pattern and
thank you so much for watching and if
you have any doubts any concern about
design patterns make sure you come into
that I will try to answer that questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
