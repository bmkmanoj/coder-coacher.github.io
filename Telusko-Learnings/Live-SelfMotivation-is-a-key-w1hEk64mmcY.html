five seconds I'm live but I can I cannot
see any people or no like snow viewers
what song am I on the right channel let
me verify okay so I can see one like but
there's no messages is it the right
channel I'm going live yes the right
channel okay great
so I can see myself there and let me
just play the video if we just do it
just should check if everything gets
proper okay so okay so last time it was
it was a different phone this time I'm
using a different phone I hope the
quality is much better than the last
time okay so oh we got sha-1 after a
long time hey hi sharpened
it's a long time I've seen you great so
welcome to that is for learning shebang
after long time
okay so we got everyone saying hi Akuma
Rohit what Masai that's great we got so
many messages there on the top and it's
going up it's going up now okay suddenly
we're getting were lots of messages but
that's great and I can see 1 0 2 people
are watching and ok 1 1 2 now and then
28 likes that's great so what we are
going to discuss place so today's topic
is be different again it is live
sessions of course I will answer your
questions but then also it's about self
motivation I mean people do believe in
motivation right in fact motivation is
very important thing and but today we
will focus more on self motivation again
I don't know if I have made a video on
this before but I really wanted to talk
about this today you know in your life
there are certain certain situations
where you feel demotivated because of
certain reasons maybe maybe in your
company in the environment which you are
working within your company maybe in
your at home maybe in your friends so
there are certain issues which you
always face and then that's where you
might not work the way you are working
you might be you know you might not be
that directive as you want to be and
maybe one of the main reason you are not
oh it isn't because of you're lazy
you're you are delaying your work
for next day so the lots of lots of
reasons why you are not doing the work
which you should be doing so at this
point what people do is they go to
Google they go to youtube and they
search for different motivation videos
right now the thing is motivation is
temporary right what happens is when you
watch those videos you will get
motivated for sure but then those
motivations are temporary motivations
they do it within you in your mind for
some time what I believe is self
motivation if you feel that you are not
motivated for the work you have to
motivate yourself don't watch those
videos online and then you get motivated
you have to motivate yourself now how do
you motivate yourself see whenever you
do things you always do things to
achieve something all to enjoy the to
enjoy the learning or to enjoy that
phase example if I am making a video and
making video for two reasons first I
want to know the I mean I know the end
visa how it look how it will look like
how will people appreciate my videos or
how it will be helpful for people but
also I enjoy the process of making a
video right so we have to first make a
great content then edit the content then
upload a content in fact before that we
have to also create a content least what
we are going to create right so you have
to motivate yourself you have to
understand two things do you really
enjoy the process of doing things which
you are doing odd and the second thing
is the ultimate resource what you will
be getting after that that's how you
motivate yourself in fact there are lots
of people lots of things people do
suggest or you can use your boards you
can use the it's at the what you say
what you say the sticky notes and you
can write your goals there and that's
how you will achieve something so always
believe in self motivation do motivate
yourself every day the way you take bath
the way you eat every day you have to
motivate yourself every day that's how
life works right and that's why we say
you know you should write your goals on
a paper that's how things will be going
ahead so great so remember that time
always motivate yourself believe in self
motivation not in external motivations
okay that's quite so we got so with that
let's start with the questions I can see
we got once you're two people watching
this and we have 50 likes that's great
so
if you enjoy these obsessions looking
like button I will get motivated now
let's start with the questions and
answers so okay so because we caught hi
hello everyone there
okay so optimal says I'm your fan oh
thank you so much optimal okay so
everything video is good better than
better than last time I feel that's a
bit much not a good quality I know but I
my best to improve the quality day by
day so okay so what else what else okay
how to get consistency by being at the
bike being consistent you have to always
remember whatever you have achieved
previously they're not that important
but then they are useful so what you
will do is whatever your achievements
are right those achievements on so great
three sections of your life the past the
present and the future
what we what you want to achieve in
future like that win one section what
you are doing now that internal second
next name in the middle section and what
you did in in the first section now
anyone you feel that you aren't liking
consistency just watch your previous
work it will motivate you and then you
will know that okay this is my bunch
benchmark I have done all these things
till now I don't have to lose my track
then you know be on that track and also
make sure that in future if you want to
achieve something there should be a
graph light it's going up graph so in in
in your past if you have achieved level
this and currently if you are here then
you have to make sure that at least you
come here and then in future if you want
to reach here you should it should make
a exponential path there right so that's
how you be you that's how you are to be
consistent maybe I'm not a right person
to talk about this because I'm not
considering with my videos I should be
uploading lots of videos but then I'm
not doing that but yeah that's that's
what you can do to keep yourself keep
yourself up okay way to learn machine
learning so again I mentioned this in
the previous sessions as well so you can
you can go to google and search for
Suraj all Andrew ng so Andrew ng so they
talk about machine learning AI so good
stuff oh python cause the same answer
not not on my list as of now okay okay
so Krishna says are you are software to
the power some
things like that oh I am something like
that I don't know what that means but
then I guess I am a software developer
plus a corporate trainer plus are
youtubers I'm doing lots of things
together so yeah ok so he says you are
my motivation that's great Sookie thank
you so much for that ok so what else
what else okay so how says I'm going for
machine learning that's good again the
same thing go to youtube and search for
search for and um Angie Angie and in
fact in Udacity
I guess they also have a entire course
on machine learning from Andrew ng it
will be useful for sure ok so you are my
Savior oh that's great so today I'm
meeting our nice comments great that's
great this is what this is my motivation
ok so push for us says tell me about AWS
so AWS is basically Amazon Web Services
and they provide lots of services it is
basically a cloud platform to achieve
let's say if you want if you have any
other application and you want to deploy
the application not on your server but
down on some cloud servers so you can
use Amazon Web service in that case so
make a project and upload that project
on AWS now AWS has a feature of of
deploying the application they have a
database tool we can you can make a
database there they also provide storage
services using s3 so Amazon is like a
complete bundle so it provides Amazon
Web Services a complete bundle it
provides all the services from
deployment to database from and they
also proved now there we have a new
service in Amazon called and edibles
called as gold star using code star you
can actually actually achieve pipeline
the deployment pipeline so what it does
is you can make a project on your
application ok I don't know about how
much you are confident about deployment
and projects if I if I give you a gist
of it what happens is whenever you make
a project what happens is in that
project select Java project first of all
you have to make a jar file on a wire
file and you deploy that Valve file on
the web server by yourself and in AWS as
well using
ec2 which is elastic cloud computing on
top of that we have elastic beam stack
okay I know you if you
getting all those words that's fine I
just go to Amazon Web service create
account and explore all those services
it's a very big poke a very big cause
but then we have ec2 we have elastic
beam stack being stuck spending now and
then we have code star so what happens
is if you are using ec2 or bean stack
you have to upload you have to upload
your jar file or the vial file on that
platform by yourself that means every
time you make a change you have to make
a file and upload otherwise what you can
do is you can use co-star now using code
star at whatever changes you make on
your Eclipse you can deploy that on
Amazon Web Services using Eclipse tool
right click and push right it will be
deployed automatically so it's an
amazing tool to work with so I would
suggest you to go to Amazon create
account and I do have a video on Amazon
Web Services so if you can search for
Java web development by telesco I have
some set of videos I'm working on I was
I was working on a live project and I
guess the third video talks about how to
deploy your application on the NWS so do
check in to check out check it out
okay so great Oh what next
I hope that answer your questions so
love your video so thank you so much
that's great
ok give up my name is Aria no that's
great audience but nice name give away
ok how can I learn Python does your
channel provide Python tutorials no no
ok
so Dikshit says what's your mic ok this
I'm using a lapel mic so this is a rod
lapel mic I'm using this from last one
year is it not one year so I bought it
in Jan this is the second mic the first
my got damaged I'm using this one last
two years now yeah but then this is the
second one I bought it at George and so
yeah so it's a good mic too for VB logs
for recording videos okay so so shook
Omar says which technology are future
technologies a good question in fact I
was thinking about making making a video
then what you should learn in future
what are the technologies which will be
booming in future now one of the
breakthrough which is I mean every
company's going to going now is
blockchain
if you have heard about Bitcoin in fact
I was like not knowing about the auction
before and that's why I love my life
session so in one of the live sessions
someone asked me about blockchain and to
be honest I was not knowing about it
shame on me but then I was not knowing
about blockchain and then I researched
about that with this blockchain and I
did lots of research and I can see in
future everyone will be going for
blockchain in fact every company ok
which company basically mostly banking
companies finance companies in fact
normal companies as well to make sure
that data is secure data is managed
properly they will be using blockchain
not not just for bitcoins it will be
used for lots of other stuff so if you
really want to enhance your career a
blockchain is one of the thing second is
machine learning machine learning is
booming in fact nowadays we have CPUs
mobile CPUs which have AI inbuilt so
they provide your feature that in case
if you in future if you're making an AI
software they are giving you support not
the cheap phones I'm talking about the
high-end phones so AI machine learning
are the future so blockchain machine
learning AI what else cloud services so
these are the futures those days are
gone when you make one you can use to
make normal websites and used to find
clients so those those things are going
going away now so try to move yourself
to cloud platform blockchain and all
those things okay so would even
introduce kaletnik good evening Shree
okay so everyone say hi okay so okay
next person from Rohit why to learn
spring stores frameworks you know I have
any frameworks in Java now see we talk
about job of Technology Java is then
famous for what are the features it
provides you right but the thing is when
you are making a project in your project
does does so many things which every one
example think about this if you are
making a project there are certain
problems in every project right there is
a business problem and there's a
technology technical problem no
technical stuff arms and talking about
jar files and talking about the way you
store data in a database the way you
will you will pass data from one layer
to second layer now you can do
everything by yourself using some design
patterns or or you can actually use
something called as frameworks so using
frameworks
gives you some inbuilt features right so
which everyone needs so let's say we
have thousands of programs and let's say
we have thousands of programmers and if
everyone needs the same module why to
write those code by yourself you can you
can you know actually use clouds you can
actually use frameworks features so they
will provide you those features and if
you are building a project using cloud
services it will be much easier not
cloud services I'm talking about claim
work so now I'm mixing these two things
I don't know in my mind everything is
running as cloud services the thing is
there's lots of lightning happening
outside the same as last time I know
what's happening on Sunday last on that
loss and last Sunday as well there's
lots of lots of lightning and even this
Sunday we have lots of lightning so yeah
so I was talking about framework so if
you are using frameworks equal to be
easier for you to make a project it will
be easier for you to manage the project
so skirts is something which which
normally people are not going now but
spring and hibernate years they are
booming so if you want to make big
projects then you starts as a spring and
hibernate in fact just to get the gist
of it what you can do is I do have a
videos on I do so I was in fact I should
share the link and there are lots of
people I guess they don't know about
those things let me search for that
videos and I will share the link in the
chat window do watch those videos and
the okay so I said search Java but that
is called Java web development and I
caught the playlist that's great let me
share this playlist with you in the chat
window do follow this playlist and you
will get the idea about how to make a
project in Java how to deploy a project
how to I mean all those things there are
lots of things you can learn from that
so what do they chat go to the chat
window click on the link watch it later
not now watch it later bookmark it and
watch it later okay I can see we got 150
pal people are watching this that's
great and we got 95 likes we connect it
is that right okay okay so we got Joel
says come to why's that
you're Tooting is fire can you hear that
can you hear that lightning sound okay
that's weird
okay I don't know what went wrong
something went wrong horrible okay so I
guess the lightning problem because of
lightning maybe there was a network
failure tender okay so yeah so how about
now can you can you can you watch me I
can see when the ten people are watching
this okay
so very bad I know so let's get back and
yeah so that was I was talking about
yourself motivation a exchange
motivation that's why I don't know what
were the last thing you hide from me
okay
next next next wait to start machine
learning you have talked about that and
then hi telescope please apply whatsapp
video status says reply what replied
what should I apply okay so imaginary
intact in this says so will you speak in
Hindi a lion only okay I mean I can
speak and leave it normal I do talk in
Hindi so when I'm with my friends with
my family I do talk Hindi but the
problem is when we go live on YouTube
and we talk when I make a video on
YouTube it's a global platform and not
everyone knows Hindi right so especially
in India itself we have states we don't
speak Hindi so that's the issue right so
I cannot only talk about a talk in
English in Hindi but if for you I can
say okay so what should I say Indy okay
so if they give me a sentence I was fate
as they bat Indy but I can I can speak
Hindi I do talking in the I love I live
in the language by the way okay so a
scope of C++ so so this question is from
such any scope is very good for C++ if
you want to get into embedded
programming if you want to build your
own OS if you want to build anything
which deals with Hardware C++ is the
topmost language right because to work
with hardware we don't use Java we don't
use eShop we use C++ or C C language so
yes it is very helpful so if you know go
for that okay next question because I'm
not able to use my even mind mobile
network is not working properly my home
network gone and even if I use mobile
network I don't know what is what's
going wrong there
but then I'm not able to see your
questions here so I will try to pick up
the questions from here on the mobile
phone or some questions are from here so
Giri Raj says regards from Ohio at my
network Oh No okay so I will pick up the
questions I lost all my questions there
this is the horrible life sessions which
is we going to sign colors in my laptop
and let's focus only on this questions
here okay how to achieve mastery in in
Java so - first of all you have to make
sure that your basic syntax are good so
you should know all these in tactical
things in Java then design patterns I
would say so data structures design
pattern then learn about build a project
basically so then whatever you learn
always try to build a project that's how
you will learn something new so try so
your master okay so it's Java obsolete
no no no never Java is not obsolete
I know Kotlin Python they are booming
nowadays but then you have to understand
the corporate network the industry is
working on Java so Java is not going
anywhere it's there for a long time at
least for next five to six years and
it's a big time right if you are
thinking only five to six years you knew
you never know in five to six years what
will happen maybe computers will not be
more maybe people will be working on
quantum computers instead of using
silicon chips and the moment you move to
quantum computers they only have to use
newly you have to use a new language I
don't know why it will support Python
PHP c-sharp or other languages I don't
know which one it is a port so five to
six is a good time so Java I will be
there for a long time and again I work
to go back to my chat I need to take the
questions okay so currently learning
advanced Java I got a job okay I got a
job as a testing should I go for it or
should I try okay I would suggest if you
are getting Java job that's great
otherwise I would say whatever job you
get ticket and while you're doing that
job enhance your skills and look for the
other jobs I would say getting our jobs
of is very important nowadays because
even if you are sitting at home you will
you feel depressed you will get the
motivated that you don't have a job so I
would say take any job which you are
getting see if you are if you can wait
for one month and if you think that you
will be getting good jobs soon
great otherwise get the job and start
working okay
so Jimmy says congrats on getting
married okay so yeah I love getting
married soon not I'm not married yet but
then I might be getting married soon
okay so I'm a big no for C language I'm
unable to understand - please give
advice sir I do have a C videos why
don't you watch my videos from start to
end
I have 42 videos on C programming do
watch it okay so I have applied for the
internship I feel comfortable with java
web technologies which technologies
should I focus more on if you're
comfortable Java language then why not
so if you if you know Java Tech joffrey
works then go for it why you're waiting
for otherwise if you really want to
stretch ship to other languages I would
say go to Python it's booming nowadays
okay so ROM says you are really create
or thank you so much strong what else
what else what else
okay I have two point nine years
experience in an android should I
prepare for introduced of course should
prepare for the interviews I didn't get
your question okay
okay what's the sequence of learning so
first have to learn servlet then JSP
then JDBC then hibernate then spring and
then spring would that sequence
okay difference between NetBeans and
Eclipse basically NetBeans Eclipse
IntelliJ are three top most used IDE
nowadays if we talk about the best IDE
available I would say IntelliJ the only
problem with IntelliJ is the community
version is free the ultimate version you
have to buy it
and it's not that cheap so and if you
compare Eclipse and NetBeans Eclipse is
better ok I can see my it says very bad
connection I don't know how how how good
I am about you able to see you there
but it says bad connections that's
pretty bad I guess we cannot go ahead
with these sessions more because I'm
getting lots of network issues here
thanks to the climate ok so please call
my name sir moku yeah hi Marco yeah I
was talking about eclipse on ABS right
eclipse is good compared to NetBeans
NetBeans is good if you are learning
something but if you are making a
project Eclipse provides you lots of
extra features like if you can you can
have your own plugins you can download
plugins from the internet there lots of
plugins available for eclipse ok which
framework is very good for 2018 in Java
Spring Framework spring boot especially
ok so that's it guys it's been a long
time on talking and so we'll see next so
I know I am NOT able to answer all the
questions so what you can do is the
moment the the moment you call you close
this session so once the session gets
over once the video gets off line in the
comment section ask your questions so
that in the next session on next Sunday
I will answer those questions first I
know the velocity lots of issues so yeah
that's it guys
oh okay
seems good so that's it guys see you in
the neck on next Sunday I know I'm not
able to answer all the questions but I
don't have a choice now network is going
bad and ok what else what else any
important questions that I can answer
that soon if in short time ok Android
all just ripped I would say JavaScript
if you re ready focus upon two hours ago
for JavaScript okay that's it
so Java JavaScript has much good future
compared to Android yeah ok bye bye
everyone
mmm finishing this session</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
