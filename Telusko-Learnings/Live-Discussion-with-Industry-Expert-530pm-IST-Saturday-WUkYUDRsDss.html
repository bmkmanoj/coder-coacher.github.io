there are 19 people watching this in
fact debating for this video and 17
likes on the video in fact that means
everyone is excited that's awesome
including and yeah including gob shake
that's good and I can see some messages
in the chat window
ok so I can see 19 people are waiting
still fighting I guess it is not getting
any fresh properly come on Google you
have to work on this okay finally
against it is awkwardly doing okay 34
people are watching this great that's
great
Oh awesome let's pick up and out Oh
watching this year's going up it's a
great a v6 so I got everyone ah okay so
here we have a B shake from the data
warehouse industry and he has lots of
experience here in fact the okay so he
went before going for the introduction
let me just talk about why we're doing
this okay what's the idea behind this
thing okay so let me just go in this way
so what happened you know I was talking
about lots of thing you know that okay I
think should remove this going in my
wall in my corner
yes okay so my legend with that as well
okay
it leaves only one side that elevator
okay so I was thinking about this one a
long time you know that that industry
experience is different I mean industry
knowledge is different from the college
knowledge and then and I was having this
chat with avi shake in fact we had a
chat and I'm just across suggesting that
this is something they should be doing
in the industry this something we should
be living in the college life and not
being very specific see the thing is
he's working in the industry and from a
long time and he's different a different
way of thinking towards education
towards knowledge right and that that's
very important to share those things
also so here we have a be shake is
I mean is excited to share his knowledge
it's not exactly a lecture kind of thing
where you will say hey this is how you
have to behave this is how you do that's
not the case here the idea here is true
we want to share what we think about
education what we think about how you
should learn for the industry how you
should prepare yourself for the industry
because there are lots of treasures they
are not getting job because of different
reasons we will try to tackle some of
the reasons here and we'll try to
understand what you can do in your life
right I think what you can do in to
improve yourself so finally let me
introduce a Abhishek here and enough of
talk on my side it's all about Abhishek
now and let me just show Abby shake yeah
here we go after shake it's all you now
hey guys a very big hi from me
my name is Abhishek and I came in
contact with Naveen couple of week back
I mean it was it was really a very
fruitful discussion which we had and I'm
into the data warehouse industry not
industry with a data warehouse stream
for last eight years and we were having
discussion on
can I get my experience into picture in
in terms of guiding and how things a bit
different what how it looks in the real
industry standards and how it feels how
how things work in pains and you know
it's pretty different than what's being
taught in college and and then we
decided to go live today so here we are
and I would be open to any type of
questions and I mean to help as much as
people we can in terms of exposing the
the myth that that that has been there
behind the books beings really
restricted and too few things and so so
it's all up to you maybe so I am open
for the questions
oh okay that's good so I guess
everything okay so okay before starting
against people are facing some issues
here that video is not clear
okay so guys this is a live session and
in live sessions we do get these issues
uh okay I'm coming best to stream as
best quality as possible again facto a
vicious objec is using best vodka and
best what is their best broadband yeah
best drugs answer since there is issue
with the network maybe something's Tommy
should with the compression technique or
maybe technique here
and a little juice do move some more
setting let's see how it goes I do have
some settings here just to make sure
that everything goes - just give me a
sec here I have it one setting and ok
that's not telling which one optimize
for less buffering that would be good
don't you can see not you - for less
leave a powerfully I can do this I think
I let's see how it goes I've just
changed something here okay so let's
let's start I'll be Sheikh and here we
go so this is your first question like
it is not a cone they are colorful to
here okay this is more of this question
what do you think about thing so I
thought about this questions you know
just to fire you up so that you know I
feel you know people work in industry
they are like a well write full of water
it's just that there is we need someone
who can just pull those water right so
I'm trying to do that Abhishek you have
come to the to the correct well great so
I guess I'm trying to say my face okay
yeah so the first question to you are we
shake is you know we always hear this
thing with the Sun say something was
data and then we have a concept of big
data again there lots of pressures they
know this thing right big data is the
next thing and then sometimes we talk
about information technology which is I
everything it turns with it deals with
the data right so what do you think well
I mean what's the difference between a
data and big data or you can also touch
upon the data warehouse concept how it
is linked and I want to know your views
on that data wasn't shota sure so so
basically everything which we which we
have around us right
so the grocery market and you have
bought some groceries you have got some
data along with you in terms of recipe
if you're going to go to if you're going
to a petrol pump and you know refilling
your petrol and those you are providing
data to the petrol pump in terms of how
many litres went in if you're making an
transaction you are providing data to
banks so basically it's all data
everywhere now now the thing was the big
data came into existence quite well
before it's not a term which is now
anymore new to anyone but the thing is
that with the growing technology with
the growing with the evolution in the
technology now the earlier the data
which which people were really
interested in was like okay transaction
details what getting get us the customer
details and you know all this very basic
kind of data which wasn't there but then
the real when when you know for example
if I take a concept of black box which
is there in the aircraft's if you see
that that is actually being recording
each and every flight each and every
second yeah and then you look about look
look at Facebook I mean we are posting
things over there like anything and now
the best example is the YouTube live
streaming which we are having right now
but the data so so the thing is the big
data comes into picture where and the
demand for the when even the definition
of the data changed so when we said used
to have the data it was all in terms of
you know those fancy tables where you
can actually in rows columns but then
they said no we want to stop just movies
we want
to store videos we want to store any
kind of unstructured kind of data so
then the concept of unstructured kind of
data came into picture and then
companies were like ok we we want to
store even the unstructured data and
then the concept of big data came ok if
you are going to do that then let's do
it using big data and then all the
analytics and all those things now there
are so many platforms and where you can
actually analyze the the data which is
being coming in in terms of beta
petabytes for a day now imagine the data
centers and all how much data is being
stored so so that's so that's basically
the history and the difference between
the data and and the big data is a big
device looks like a very fancy term but
it is nothing it's just like collecting
any kind of data it could be images you
know videos live streaming black box
audio recordings it's just not the name
of a customer we used to have an
employee table a customer table is not
about that it's it's it's about any kind
of data and we do need those for
analytics so coming on to the day
warehouse concepts which you which you
are saying so so I've seen so I'm from
an electronics background the college
but then when I stepped into the
industry I actually came to know about
the data warehouse saying why is it so
important the data warehousing and and
you know the when when we read books in
colleges it is it has been like
restricted in terms of definitions that
as soon as you say ok I and you can
HOSA are you sure you have a fat I guess
there's a lot of them in this yeah
slowly changing in sass all those high
stable industry then know that the the
real data warehousing is just it uses
all these definitions but but if this in
a very simple language it is that we
want to access data for analytics for
analysis as possible we don't want to
delay we don't want to be lazy you just
want to be smart enough to get the data
analyzed and presented as soon as
possible well so then they came up with
data warehousing concept that okay we
have and if you use to a stars came out
if you store it like this then you get
the data you you can retrieve the data
as soon as possible out of the disk
behind the data warehouse and not just
reason why we have dimension that's
reason why we have facts so that we can
join and we can get the data as soon as
possible it's just designing the storing
of data in the most efficient way is
what data warehousing is all about okay
that's great a me shake and I guess
something between the network was going
off and there's a lag mm-hmm okay so
just to summarize what I heard from you
I guess I'm seeing on some messages
there that the sound is not clear
I just lagging okay so okay just to
adjust to let everyone know that it's
not just about network Vishal okay when
you say there's something is lagging
it's not just about to go get lots of
parameters which comes into picture yeah
I thought so I think we think in between
no I think and it's a live streaming
going on so yeah it would appear as a
bit lag here but when you try to see the
video finally on the YouTube then it
would have defined yeah so that's the
thing yeah because
according and we are going okay
streamers oh yeah okay great uh yeah so
what I heard from you is in the entire
thing is we have a thing all this data
and everyone I mean the software
industry is working on data right I mean
think about any software stimuli
illustrate exactly so everything is
based on data in fact I feel you know we
should change our name from software
engineer to data engineer because what
we do in the entire career is we work
with data even if you are the network
engineer while you're building networks
for data right so I feel it is very
important and as you mentioned yeah big
data is not a new thing is there from a
long time now and we are generating huge
amount of data right the data kind of
what is the unstructured data mostly and
it comes it does warehouse it is most
structured way of data right it's more
structured way of data but the thing
which which I was mentioning was that
when we go into the definitions and
terms which are in there which has been
like okay we have we have dimensions so
there are only like we have the changing
dimensions slowly changing dimensions
junk dimensions so these are all
definitions which are been there but
nobody actually explains why why we
needed what what we meant by gender from
HPV we only we know okay there is a
concept called this but we don't know
how it's being used and the example
which has been given over there is just
from I employ table and a customer table
and then it's it's it's not going to
work right it's not going to work in the
industry so so so that needs to be
reformed but said so the definition is
drift definitely important but we should
also know why what is slowly changing
what is changing in a dimension I know I
mean the example which I read in my
college time was like that if you're if
the person changes his address then
that's a changing dimension correct but
but on a broader term why do why do we
even need a dimension why do we even
need fact and why and all these things
so so I think I think what what data
warehousing
suggest and say is ad use me to get the
data as soon as possible okay database
stole the dumpster okay
and with that thing you know wait when
you see it customer table and employ
table be a big fan of that okay even
take an example somewhere I'll just talk
I don't know why it stuck to my mind
employed depart yeah estimate that's it
yeah
is there you know yeah it is that all
the books with that I have a question
for you why I mean what is the
importance of SQL in the industry sees
beyond Jordan apples right and B are
very part of it
I want your obsession at the moment you
know when I work on a project and
someone says hey we should also know SQL
so what you think how much important SQL
is in the industry so before I touch on
to SQL I would say that the ultimate
goal of data warehousing is to improve
your business intelligence and pidgins
is such a key concept for the industry
to find out how we're gonna perform even
in next five years probably to forecasts
that now sequel the you I would say it's
a best tool which was being used to play
around with data and sequel is something
which is which is really so important
for retrieving the data out of the key
informations I mean through sequel we
are generating reports through sequel
that's that's the that's the main
language which I would say we had to you
know there was there is a concept of
like vectors arrays matrices
two-dimensional arrays but then when
sequel concept came in terms of having
those two dimension areas in actually in
rows and columns entire
was so easy that you can actually play
around with the data you can actually
retrieve that data build such important
reports which would be so useful for the
company and you know and all those
things so the other thing is that sequel
is really important because it also
gives you so many options so you can be
a data scientist if you know it I mean
you need to have know the programming
language apart from that as well but but
just imagine that you can be a data
scientist you can be a database
developer you can be an application
engineer you can be someone who is who
is just you know even if someone who is
doing some on the SSAS or the or the
analysis services side you could you can
be an analyst you can be anything I mean
it gives you a different perspective
sequel gives you a lot of options I mean
I know that now
we have God with a concept of big data
you know I can I can actually give you
an example so C so when Hadoop came into
picture yeah then then they also have
introduced hive which was for sequel
demos F from HDFS so it was it was as so
important you could feel that they had
to release hi solution do you want to
access the data the HDFS data which is
there on the big data which has the
effects did from doob then for the
sequel developers they had to introduce
hive as well so it is it is very very
important and therefore if you go into
any industry state a bassist wherever
there is their base there is there is
sequel and is the most a I would say
okay that's great a business that's
great a v-shape so that simply means
that it doesn't matter who you are right
in the industry maybe a tech tech person
maybe I'll join up for baby I get up at
least waiter okay I want to show my face
at least at once so yeah so it doesn't
matter who you are
database I mean SQL no your skill is
very important right so it doesn't
matter which feel you are working on so
knowing SQL will always help you when a
future is SQL it is present also yeah
it's been passed as well the only thing
is now so after being into like eight
years and to read a warehouse am you
know I'm I'm learning Java so it's like
it's like if you combine sequel with the
programming it's it's it's so powerful
that you could do wonders oh great
huh so with that I have a next question
for you you know I do remember when I
was when I was working for some
companies and then when I was taking
trainings as well and when I was taking
some lateral batches one of the comments
um some peas some of the people they
were from bi which is business
intelligence and then they wanted to go
for development and then we also got
some vacancies you know in fact I was
offered a job for bi and I was knowing
nothing about that you know I was like
okay I want to get your app I don't want
to go into business
that's weird white but then later I
realized some images so this lots of
embodies of BI so I want to know from
you or in fact my participants here they
will be excited for this so what do you
think what is what exactly bi is
according to you of course serve yeah so
so bi is it stands for business
intelligence and these two words are
self explanatory
so basically business intelligence is
such an important expect for any
business or for any any any industry
that you cover your company's
performance you cover your company's
forecast you cover I mean it's basically
an intelligence kind of a thing where
you go I mean your analysts or your data
scientists and all these people they
actually they go and then they they
analyze and to business intelligence
week
to know that how the industry is really
performing I mean it say for example
I'll just taken a Z down so then goodbye
the traffic of data and you are getting
the data
it's like enormous amount of data every
every every earth so since your students
you are getting so much so huge amount
of data then in terms of you know you
need a business intelligence Department
if you have that the that business
intelligence Department would actually
take care of the thing that how your
website is performing is it is that
really hit is it a real hit in the
market or not and that we do and that's
that's that's the way it's being done
that is like you need to make reports
every every day you need to you need
even so for example if you did some
change if you you release some change
into your website one day 31 and I'm
there a day 32 your traffic is just just
drop down so so then you need to know
what what exactly caused that yeah from
the data so if it really went down on
how you performing or even say you want
to know that how you're how many
visitors you would have or say your
website how many how much how much
whatever metrics you can build up over
like like orders or you know if you are
if you are a training if you have a
training website then how many
enrollments you are expecting in like
next five years for that you can do that
based on the current data which you are
getting and that's how the data
warehousing is really gives you the
complete picture of the way you can
retrieve that data and then put your
algorithms and then build some forecast
data for next five years for your say
training website or something like that
so that's why business intelligence
that's that's the area where business
intelligence comes into
picture where where it gives a fare by
using the intelligence term it means
that you can play around with the data
and then bring some useful reports and
metrics which are very key to business
for businesses to identify how they're
going to perform how they are performing
and how they performed in the past okay
great
okay so thank you have a shake that's
good
and yes it okay for everyone this is my
nephew okay he was it wasn't there say
smile okay yeah so it's time for the
next question okay let me just leave
this guy enjoy play yeah
Tomica posture okay so here we go for
the next question
and okay so once we have talked about
SQL and b.i which also heard about
before the next thing is let's get by
technical now okay and that technical
thing is oh okay I was I was kidding
the thing is see if we talk about
students I mean if you talk about the
knowledge look at is this list agnostic
let's talk about knowledge what do you
think was the difference between a
college knowledge and industry knowledge
what is recommended oh I mean what do
you recommend for students to learn so
when from dream college sure so the
difference is imagine you're traveling
in a bus and I'm in a flight and I just
cross you between me and you is the
distance between the the the things
which are they are being taught in
college and what appear in the strings
so so it's like it's it's a huge
difference what I've seen the the thing
is the the colleges they teach pretty
well I would say but the problem is that
they the industry exposure we only get
when we get yeah and then it's really
essential for for students then my
piÃ±on and their college life now we
have got like projects which has been
given by colleges where they say okay
this is your summer intern project you
go to the company which you choose and
then you get that thing and submit it to
us now I'm pretty sure that most like
80% of people they just do it for just
just for the sake of submitting the
project but I don't see so the thing is
and the reason is because the syllabus
which we have in the books yeah that is
not in the same I would say it's the the
the technology is growing exponentially
but the but the syllabus in the books
are not so so that and they and the
other thing is that if you are if you
are going through so for example if you
are going through a subject if you are
going through key terms now there is no
place where someone would actually come
to you and say hey can you can you come
up or turn up to the company once and
then we would show you how how these
terms which you are actually studying
that how they are implemented in the
real world so so I would say the book
the knowledge which has been there in
the colleges that is that is key
knowledge that is still essential it's
good but you know it's just for getting
some marks so I would find the education
system to be more successful only if say
for example if I have been taught Java
until and unless I build something in
Java personally something like a very
useful kind of a thing well then it's
then it's beneficial otherwise it's just
about you know going through books and
just writing that in the exam and
getting marks and then coming into
industry and say oh okay hang on this is
a production environment this is a lab
environment and you know this is this is
how this this is how things work in the
backend of websites this is how things
work and the backend of the cellular
providers now just imagine I mean we
come to
and then we say okay we are still
learning but we go with the learning
attitude but then learning attitude is
really essential
you should always stay foolish and stay
hungry as what Steve Jobs say but the
other thing is you should be
contributing something into into into
anything which you are learning
otherwise it's a waste then if you have
to learn everything once you join a
company then then what the four years
which you just studied I think you
should take the max out of that you
should you should do something useful
and and and build something I mean I
don't I the reason why there are so many
startups which are coming now because
people they don't rely on companies
really to show their talent they are
doing it they're building something even
college dropouts they are doing it they
are building websites they are learning
things because thanks to Google and all
the open source tutorials and and you
know the free learning which is
happening which which is really
accessible for people yeah I know
especially telesco learning so this is
so the reason why people are you could
you could imagine the reason why people
are so much you know connected to you is
just because I think there is something
missing in the college it isn't it
I mean colleges should each that how
things work in real world and to
understand that concept there are books
which should be you know a helping hand
in understanding that and should not be
the only hand which they are they are
right now in college so that's the
biggest difference which I have seen in
colleges and the industry okay so in
fact something from my side as well I
know what I feel this should be a
seminar or a project every week or once
a month for they for the student
students for me just from the industry
people
Angus a specially in India we have this
problem you know we always think that we
should be providing them
with industry exposure in fact I have
seen many colleges now they take this
people to I be right which is industrial
visit and what it what you do is they
take them to Manali Shimla I don't know
I don't understand what they are doing
with this taking to picnic so I guess in
fact I have talked to some of the
colleges and they said it is very
difficult to connect with companies and
they they don't allow you yeah that's
true yeah let's do it I mean so the
thing is that that is very true and they
are very right at their end because
companies they work in a classified mode
day and it's it's it's against company's
policies to share anything and also but
the thing is we should not really you
know go to a company to see what they
are exactly doing because because no
company would ever do that you know
expose the way they were kick butt but
the thing which I was mentioning was
that should look for the people who are
experienced still working and they've
come so if we can't go to the industry
due to the restrictions or the policies
and all those things then they so we
should look for people which should we
should come to the College as then guide
students in terms of for example if they
have a subject and third year or second
year stay data if they have a subject
called data warehousing so they should
be some guy who should be you should be
using it who should be using data
warehousing for say so many years and
and I'm sure if you if colleges start
approaching people and you know I know
it's it's not it would be a bit tough
but it's all about money as well but if
if it's been it's been an initiative
from the college to reach people who
have experience then I don't think so
there would be any problem when those
people come to college and provide that
experience to to students and you know
these days these days setting up
anything just for an education of just
for a tutor
purpose it is it is so damn easy that
you have your virtual box you have
VMware's where you can build up virtual
machines to set up anything and then you
have got so many open source software's
which are available which you can
install and you can do anything so if
for example if you want to do sequel you
have got so many things through which
you can even have servers you can build
that on your machine you can do it it's
just that someone needs to tell you that
if you do that and you know let's let's
build something let's build build a
project let let's do to it and only all
the challenges which will face in that
project that kind of you know learning
and you know solving challenges should
be there in the companies oh sorry in
the colleges okay that's that's a great
tip in fact I think the same thing you
know company industry people should go
to colleges to get the experience yes
they should
ok great and ok so I have some one
question from one of the person here in
the chat and I want to know how you
comfortable with this question what is
the role of informatica in data
warehousing so yes sure so so I've been
I started my career as an informatica
developer so yeah so the thing is
informatica is is an ETL tool and the
good thing about informatica is that
they have evolved as the technologies as
the demand as the data revolution which
has happened in the last years few years
informatica has evolved as well so it's
it's basically an ETL tool which helps
you to do extract transform and load
it's basically in I I always like to
speak in layman terms not in these
typical business designed terms so it's
basically nothing but taking the data
out and then you know cleansing it and
then loading it in you know in a star
schema or in
in a very well-designed database format
where people can actually grab the data
and quickly get the results what they
want to so so and then in formatting as
a tool is it was really helpful for for
for the companies for which I work for
I'm from the currently if it's like for
past few years I will be that much
linked to informatica now but but it is
it is a great hero what I would say ok
now thanks for the answer I will shake
Maurice I hope so this question was from
Sofia she did not not wrong the in
question is you know in India especially
we are getting lots of massacres and
especially I can say media or Facebook
everyone we can see you know that Rizal
there's a huge layoffs so do you find
the same thing in London or any other
place so watch what you think so
so I never believe in these layoffs and
all those things you know because the
thing is just just just think that you
don't know anything more yeah you you
are like a PK right on the way I just
landed on us and can you just don't know
about anything now just from that
mindset just think companies they need
people who are who are like who are
great who can think in a very smart way
who who are intelligent enough to
provide the maximum profit to their
companies and if there is um you know if
there is a layoff and then someone who
is immensely talented has been layered
laid off from the company could be hired
by any other company for sure forget the
thing that knowledge as fast is the
ticking going on a revolution that is
are also being increased right so say
for example the only thing what we do is
that if say we got an offer from a
startup right we just say ok I
know what that company even is I don't
know
maybe I should join that or not but and
then we go with the big companies as
well so but but you know I have met
people who are there in big companies
but but they are not very happy with
what they are doing is just that they
want to be secured and then I have also
I also know people who have been
associated to startups and it's like
they're not being the starter but the
kind of exposure of work which they are
having that is credit so so I so laying
off from a company is actually not a
laying off from your I mean your talent
is there
B so I would say I ever believe in even
if I know that ok there is a net Reacher
way as the other employees and that so
nothing can stop you if say every
company laid off everyone chocolates you
should have a confidence that you out of
your talent you think your own - yeah
embattled
laying off all okay there's a lack of a
shake reason I mean is it still there
you can hear me right Abhishek yeah you
can okay this'll act is a life is that
we is a video life I can hear your voice
property yeah okay so that I think we
put a shit saying it it should be fine
now I think so yeah okay so thanks for
all the answers I just have one more
thing for you
sure as a industry person working there
from a long time and working on
different domains in fact we know is
also important right yeah what are the
messages you want to give to students
because these are very big family now
for learnings and everyone has a lots of
hope so what you give them as a
suggestion or a tip which they will
include in that in the curriculum or in
their life which will be aloof of them
when they join a company
sorry Naveen I think you'll have to
repeat your question because ok there's
a lag right yeah yeah there is a lag
sorry ok question is ok so what I mean
what tip you want to give to these
students because we have a huge family
here of approximately 65,000 subscribers
now and you have having lots of hope now
so any tip which you want to give to
them which will be helpful for them as
you are working in the industry for a
long time so I need to show your side
sure so so basically the first step is
have confidence in what you're knowing
because pay you can do is that now you
have Google so I mean you have sunny
sources through which you can gain
knowledge just don't stick to the
bookish knowledge find what's the real
purpose of these definitions which are
there in the books are why do we need it
I mean I'm damn sure that there would be
so many blogs which have been written on
each and every definition or each and
every bold letter in a book on the
Google so try to create a try to build
your knowledge six very strong right and
thence the second tip is and then and
the second tip is that don't study just
to score high marks study I mean you
would find it really helpful if you are
in college right now that is if you have
passed out the college then then it's a
different thing but if you asked in in
the college then to just just try to
find the real power of being a in a
college it is score score high marks
excusing just not score high marks but
but try to build something out
the knowledge that you are gaining that
you know you if you build something I am
damn sure you're going to score high in
your subjects so so don't worry about
that you have to just go her high marks
just think that you you need you are
learning something for some benefit
which you have to contribute in the
society one or the other day so you
learn today and then you contribute
tomorrow so go with that attitude and
then I'm damn sure if you are
contributing to the society and in terms
of making a app or making a tool making
anything then you you know the concepts
and all then then only you will be able
to make right so so you know the concept
you build something and then when it
comes to writing in the exams it would
be just like you know it would be that
you are the expert you you know
everything you just go and you just
write it over there but but it would
then for you in terms of how you think
in terms of how you deal with the
challenges because it's a challenge
right now I could feel and if you are
able to do this then you can face any
challenge in your life the people who
have passed out the college and who are
looking for a job my tip would be that I
have confidence on yourself have
confidence on your talent if if you
think you are not good enough and if you
just looking for a job so that just
someone can just hire you just like that
then then your knowledge as much as
possible try to again work on something
come out view you have time right now
it's a balance you go into an industry
then you then you you know then you go
you have to take the domain noise as
well and then you have to relate it with
what you are doing but right now you
have this is this is the right period if
don't think if somebody is not hiring
you that you are not probably us I mean
every one of us is so powerful that if
we get to know us our talent our limits
it is just like you will become
unstoppable and then you can just you
can just build anything you can probably
build a company you don't need anyone
too high and then you would be hiring
people who knows so there have been many
stances which I have seen so those so
get inspired from that and then people
who are who have just industries and
then who has just just been placed the
thing is that yes domain knowledge is
really important and domain knowledge is
something through which you contribute
to the company apart from the technical
knowledge which you have so once you get
the domain knowledge and then the way
you you come up with ideas you used
suggest plans you suggest okay I know in
the health industry this is how it's
been done but why not we do it like this
this would be really helpful
this is and then not page I'm sugar you
connect close to the people if you have
only technical knowledge you are only
connected to people who have technical
knowledge you know but once you have
domain knowledge you can you know so be
connected to people who are analysts you
know who are working on that domain
people who are setting up the
requirements you can easily connect with
them and then it would be really really
good for your career path okay so thank
you so much I wish I can fact I'm I'm
looking for more sessions like this
because I can see there are lots of
questions here on the chat with you to
check out and well very difficult for me
to track everything so I'm sure I mean I
hope you are all so excited for this for
fun yeah I'm one more session in future
drinking is what different domain for
different different things today we have
focus on your data party debate house
will try to have some more sessions like
this right yeah sure I mean I'm I'm
always there I mean I before we say
anything more I would just say that
through you it's it's it's a privilege
to talk to you right now because I could
see because what I want to do for people
is like you know people don't have time
to really share the knowledge people
don't have time to really you know spend
spend some time with people and you know
make them understand how things go
people are not willing to contribute
that much but but I caught that
motivation by I mean it the way you
explain things it was so clear that I
thought that it's it's
really good to connect to connect with
you and it's it's we will definitely
have more sessions for sure due to that
and I think it it it if if people would
people think that this this is really
useful for them to know about what's
going on and how how they can or they
they should do again nobody can define
how one should study how one should work
how one should do all this thing but it
may be that full for those who who are
just who think that okay if we come to
know how things work then probably it
would give a kick to our learning
process and then we would be back on
track oh that's great then so thank you
so much happy shake for you I might be
taken when out of youth sorry for that
and thanks for being a part of this live
session because lots of knowledge I'm
sure it was helpful for lots of people

that for my offline sessions like Jeff

thank you so much happy shake we'll be
doing this more in future when some good
different content sure hope to see you

again and thanks to all the viewers and
and I hope that I have answered most of
the things which would be like I have
pinged on the bubbles which were
wondering in the in the mind in terms of

to some extent and we would be coming up
