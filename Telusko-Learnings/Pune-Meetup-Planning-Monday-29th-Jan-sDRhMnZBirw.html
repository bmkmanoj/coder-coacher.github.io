back I'm live that means I'm I just need
to verify on youtube as well so let's do
that quickly and how do I know if I'm
like yes
it seems our live and I can see who
people are watching this that's great
and we God God of says hey okay hi god
of so it says I'm like I hope I'm perk
up when you are people there because I'm
using a normal night today I'm not using
you so yes it's good it sounds good okay
great then so let's get started so uh so
this is just a small live session I want
to talk about my visit to Pune so this
Monday I'm going to Pune for a for a
visit okay it will be more like a
meet-up so let's see who all are there
in Pune I just have want to have a live
chat not like this but maybe a physical
life chair where I can talk to you in
person so let's see how many people will
be there now the thing the only thing is
I'm not that familiar with Pune I went
for some training but then not have not
you know been to put in a lot so I will
need your help there just to you know
just to get the place the place is not
decided yet I'm just trying to you know
get the proper place in Pune so I got
some solutions from on Facebook from
some of the people some people are
saying margarita I forgot the name is it
mother
Miguel cata then hinjewadi then we have
one one ba place one aid
something like that so I should not
should not confirm yet because on Sunday
I'm going to Sunday I'm going to Amazon
I could remember that I'll be going
I mean I'm coming back to Mumbai I'm
coming back to Pune on on Monday that's
the thing because I have a friend's
marriage in America on Sundays I'm going
there and then I'll be America I'm going
to Pune for a meter so that's my
planning is so that's why on Monday okay
so I cannot I wanted to make it on
weekend like Saturday or Sunday or the
problem is tomorrow Saturday I'm I'm
going to college for a seminar then
after that I have some other project
work to complete and then Sunday I'm
going for a friend's marriage so of
course
possible for two days but then yes
Monday maybe evening time so that Monday
evening time would be a good thing right
so that's what I'm thinking about
because here afternoon time will be
difficult so okay sure so yes some bulam
is a meet-up so they'll be having a
meet-up there so it will be of course a
meet of a mighty work people will be
coming so again I'll be doing alby's so
in the community tab so I hope you are
familiar with the committee tab on this
on this on this channel so go to coming
committee community tab and there will I
be posting or different locations in
Pune and the timing so you can take it
you know which one you want so if you
want Pune let me know putting if you I
mean if you want Margaret I let me know
she watch another let me know so I will
give multiple options and you have to
choose okay so yes a multiple meetups
are on the way meetups in Bihar meet up
and okay behind will be difficult maybe
Delhi because I do for training right so
so based on that I know have you okay so
yeah so meetup input in Delhi will be
there Bangalore Chennai Chennai 98 but
in Bangalore Delhi and put it that's
what I'm lying now
Chennai maybe we'll try so know Patna
because I don't take training in Patna
so so let's see if I have some you know
because I want to complete multiple
tasks on the same day if at if I'm
coming there so let's see Jaipur are
gonna same problem we don't have
trainings there so if I get a training
in Jaipur of course I would love to okay
so I can I will do that and then one of
the question which which sounded bit odd
here okay so question from Gaurav and
says I found Enterprise Development
boarding and not that what actually
thought okay the thing is if you if you
find into Enterprise Development bowling
that means you have not seen the real
enterprise project
yeah I mean walking on the client-side
example working on another Android
application working on iOS application
yes it makes much much more interesting
because you can see a UI right but it's
also been upon you if you want to be
very logical if you want to build the
enterprise project where you have so
many comments to work with I mean trust
me the moment I start working for
enterprise project I feel very happy
because maybe I am working on some tools
which are interesting so maybe you have
not seen the interesting stuff yet I try
to try to work on AWS or try to connect
with different or servers there try to
load balance try to I know that some of
the magic available into enterprise
world so you can do in load balancing
there you can create micro services
those are the interesting things you can
look at that but yes it's a long
learning curve you know people who love
Android I would say Android has a big
learning curve but then by learning
Android Abed you can make it you can
make an application right and day by day
you will learn but in enterprise market
you need to learn a good amount of
things to actually work on enterprise
project so maybe that's what you find it
boring not sure so yeah so I won't just
wanted to update here about Pony meetup
so it will be done on Monday 29 Jan is
not fixed here and location is not fixed
I'm still trying to figure it out what
should be location and watch the timing
I feel evening time will be better you
know the five six pm seven or six pm
would be a good option right because
everyone can meet there but the place
I'm still I was trying to figure out a
good garden somewhere so that's about
this live session I just wanted to talk
about those things so let me know so
just go to community tab I will be
posting a question in some time and then
give your text so let's see how thing
goes I hope you are excited for Pony
Meetup
I know how many I excited here but I'm
excited for conejito because see last
time I did a Mumbai meetup it was on
Monday I know Monday is not a good thing
too good time I mean Monday is not a
good day to take a meat ax because
everyone is busy and the same thing
happened in Mumbai some people showed up
and then it was a party time you know in
meetup which happened in washi it was
awesome
again not that many people showed up and
because of it was Monday it was
afternoon time ever was one everyone was
busy and then I announced only one day
plaid so that's my bad but then some
people showed up and then we have a
great chat so I got some good tips from
them some good suggestions about the
channel and some feedback and they had
some questions which I tried to answer
it was our interest session I enjoyed
let's see how well beat dad in Panay
okay so let's take up some questions
when is the hind about me talking about
as the mother of course I would be
visiting husband as well it's my
hometown so I should be right ok so
please come to Bangalore sure they'd be
I'm lying to they with us I'm trying to
come to manga as well okay saya the test
says how do you be an entrepreneur
that's a very interesting question you
know how to be an entrepreneur will
surely make a video on that I have this
point you know there's a difference
between being off three nights and then
being an entrepreneur because freelance
there are so many people they feel that
freelancing is same as entrepreneurship
that's not the case
freelancing is when you work individual
value where you have everything yours
yeah
entrepreneurship it's more towards
working in a environment where you are
giving some solution to the people and
they can come back to you too I mean
they you solve their problem and you
have a team with you because it's not
just about one percent it's by just
running a business there are so many
things you have taken up when you when
you are entrepreneur so we talked about
it in detail later
I'm not saying one person cannot be
entrepreneur but then it's a different
story or they will do it one day oh okay
so so mum sings happy decide any place
not not yet not yet well do the act on
on maybe or by tomorrow so he finds that
finalize the place or tomorrow time
timing as well you kind of says I just
learned and practicing for becoming web
developer in my free time learning Java
EE Java EE is awesome you love it oh hey
can you go meet up in Bangla
shortly I'm going to do that oh we're in
Pune that's what I'm still trying to get
out when I because I'll be visiting I'll
be visiting Pune on Monday so so entire
day I'm available in Pune but let's see
in fact my family will be with me in
Pune so we'll be so in the afternoon
time will be will be
look we'll be saying Pune will be curing
different places and then in the evening
time we'll have a meet-up so that you
know everyone will be out of the office
so that they can meet me can I come to
meet you yes that's why I Ganesh that's
what we are doing right so of course you
can come to meet me
it is is it all point of people to came
we're but Abby Sheikh
sucker says mother pata okay okay are
you guys okay - ah okay I've no visited
ke liye yet well it's surely I will do
that when Jaipur we have talked about it
she watching no good okay she was
another in Pune okay we'll see that so
options are hinjewadi she watch it now
go and roll but come let's see okay so I
will pick these three places there but
now okay we have talked about it what
about Dehradun the other thing is if I
come to that other one I'll be coming
only for the some of the other other
work not for training so I need to take
out some extra time the thing is
nowadays I don't know what's happening
I'm damn busy with other stuff I'm
trying to be free as well as possible
I'm trying take out time for myself for
the channel it's not happening and you
can see that I'm trying to upload as
many because as possible maybe to
minimum two videos per day my target was
minimum three videos per day but then
I'm trying to I try my best droplet at
least two videos and it takes time you
know editing videos does take time
uploading it setting the thumbnail
there's other things around one video
and so it takes time so I'm trying to do
things as fast as possible
so maybe somewhere around June or May
all the available to visit all different
cities other than trainings Oh
okay so in pune hinjewadi will be the
most convenient location okay that's a
good option let's let's see oh okay what
is the thoughts about gladden okay what
is a good UI framework i have heard
about wedding a lot from different
people i've never tried it by myself but
the company which i which I visited for
training they use waiting for you I died
on a bench so I think it's a good
framework because big companies are not
talking about small companies when I've
come for training at big companies they
use by date so of course it should be a
good option I've never tried it but so
here watching agar is it's a central
place is it oh okay that would be a good
option
yeah let's see okay so it lasts three
minutes because I have some other work
to do I have a session now at 9:30 so I
have to be prepared for that as well all
the data channels say starch was the
spring of course spring we are living in
2018 and spring is one of the best dream
work I've been able and it's fitting as
well I would say go for spring boat it's
awesome
I'm not saying start is bad okay starts
is also good but then starts works well
when you are making verifications what
if you have if you want to have some
other services then we can have one
option we can merge start and spring
together it showed that you can use
spring and taifeng whether it's a shop
using stored option best option okay
okay so something says what should be
one take strategy to learn Java very
well
I would subtract is not just Java all
the languages doesn't matter which you
whatever you learn whatever technology
you learn it's practice the more you
practice the more you will remember so
there's a code which I normally prefer
which is the more classes the more
classes you write your class will
increase so your class will increase so
if you want to be a good programmer if
you want to be a good other part
practice more it's all about practicing
that's one thing second if you follow my
old videos as well on kochava just watch
the entire series and to practice I'm
sure it will it will give you a good
knowledge on Java
so I don't say my courses are best they
are but then saying my questions are
best will be what you say I don't want
to think it's the good thing about my
chance that good you can't ride out
there that says can I go for Python for
ethical hacking or network security I
think I don't work I mean I'm not even
security much so no idea okay so say is
it a good is Java spring framework is a
good use for machine learning
I don't think so spring is not used for
machine learning but then we have some
libraries in Java which works with
machine learning but spring no we don't
use paint to do that according to what I
know about Spring Framework okay how to
crack Judy I'm good with I'm not going
to collision skills are good communion
skills then improve it you don't have a
choice you know if you want to crack
introduced using in Gd you have to
improve your connections communication
skills I'm not okay there's one more
this is one more thing which I'm saying
from a long time communication is not
about English some people say if you are
good with your English that means you're
a good person I mean do some people do
it church you know I don't know it's
it's how it happens only in some
countries like where if you are good in
English that means you are intelligent
that's not the case you cannot judge
someone intelligence just by looking at
the English I would say so communication
comes so there how do you think the
communication what you say how you say
it and the way you put your words yeah
that's important so practice I would say
looking at the mirror in fact I do have
a video on how to or what are the five
skills I have talked about when some
communication thing there you can watch
that video sublime or Adam all BS code I
don't use Adam I don't use BS code
because I work on on server-side and
force our side I do use some IDs like
eclipse IntelliJ NetBeans so those are
my IDs I don't I'm not a designer to use
these tools I'm not saying any do any
designers use this tool but then I'm
much more comfortable with the Eclipse
but I do use sublime if I want to see a
code like HTML page that works for me
I'm not a good designers to actually
experiment with the stools I don't even
why script so okay so Omar Ronnie's a
llama say is distributed computing yes I
want to make a video in dis really
competing because three to four years
back I have taught the entire subject to
one college you know so I know quite a
bit in distributed computing has been
for years I've I lost some of the
concept but I do have a book I just I
will revise it and I will make up for
you on that but not soon it will take
some time okay
last last one rate then I'll be living
because I have some other work as well
by the way happy puppy day or everyone
oh okay when is the either bath meter
okay so I mentioned about that soon I
have not placed a date yet but soon can
I use Java batida of course you can can
I go for Parkland after Java of course
you can all these questions are actually
answers the more the more classes you
write the more your class will increase
in the program okay okay we are talking
about my quota
thanks thanks so that's it everyone
signing off see you next time so again
the one more thing Sunday I'm not sure
you probably I will be able to go life
because Sunday I'll be nominal good I
don't know about the network because the
hotel I'm staying
I don't know if they provide three Wi-Fi
service or then I don't know how stable
it would be and I'm coming my phone as
well if mobile networks is health I mean
it will be content well then of course I
will be going live otherwise we'll see
you in next week so that's it everyone
thank you so much for watching

you are visiting tomorrow you're talking
about tomorrow tomorrow I'm going to SPI
T which is set up a deal for a seminar
