ready and in this video we talk about
cue now we have talked about link list
we have talked about stack and now it's
time for Q now Q is almost same as stack
the difference would be in stack we use
a concept of leave for which is last in
first out and in QV is a concept of FIFO
which is first in first out which means
whichever element arrived first will be
the first one to go out so it is first
in first out now in real world whenever
you want to take a movie ticket you join
a queue right so whoever arrived first
will get the first ticket in a queue
what we do is we have let's say we can
implement this with a with a different
concept we will be implementing this
with an array so you can do that with
the help of array or you can do that
with the help of linked lists in this
example we'll look at how do we
implement that with the help of array in
fact in array itself we can go with the
flat array or we can go with the
circular array but we'll see the
difference now let's have the area of
size 4 where you can have 4 elements in
this array you'll be having to end the
end from where you will insert the value
and the end from where you will take out
the value so this is your insert so this
is where you will insert the element and
this is where you will take out the
element and that's why whichever element
reaches first in the queue will be the
first one to go out now let's say if I
insert a value 5 so the 5 will be coming
from here it will go in this area so the
5 will be saved here the moment you
insert a new value let's say 2 it will
go here and let's say find 7 it will go
here and let's say find so 3 it will go
here so this is how you add the elements
now if you want to delete the element so
this is the first element which which go
out so 5 is the first element which go
out and then all this element which is 2
7 and 3 they will shift on left hand
side so 2 will come here 7 will go on
the place of 2 and 3 will go on the
place of 7 and then you can add one more
element at the end that's what we are
expecting from Q so in Q basically we
have two and one is from where you would
insert the value and from where you can
take out the value so you can call this
this area or this thing called as front
and this is the real end way from value
inserting the value now in Q we can
perform some operations
you can insert the values and you can
remove the values the way we did with
stack we in stack views a concept of pop
or push so push would be inserting
values in the same way in queue we use a
different term so that term is an Q so
NQ is like inserting or in stack you can
say push if you want to remove the
element we use a word called as DQ so we
have a concept of NQ so you can
represent insertion with the help of NQ
and you can remove the element with the
help of DQ now of course and Q will take
an element from you so you have to pass
a data and then in DQ don't pass the
value but it will turn your value so
let's say if you say DQ and your front
is 5 so it will give you 5 but let's say
after after that also you are saying DQ
it will give you 2 now with these 2
methods we can implement some more
methods as well example we can implement
a method of size which will give you the
size of the queue we can implement is
empty if to check if it is empty these
are two methods we can also implement in
this we can also implement peek the way
we did in stack you can get the value
which is going to be removed it will not
remove the value but it will it will
show you which is the value which which
is going to remove now how do we
implement this so first step would be we
need to create a array so we have to
create an array of I will go for adder
of size 5 I love this number 5 so I will
go for the ID of size 5 and then I will
try to add the element
now how many variables we need here so
basically my talk about this
implementation maybe we need a front
variable which will have the index
number of the front because every time
so initially when you don't have the
value in this in the queue so example if
I create another queue here and if I say
the queue is of size 5 so even a size of
5 so anyway you don't have any element
of course the front and rear both will
be not be referring here but then the
moment you add a value front and rear
both will refer to this value so this is
your front and this is your real but the
moment you add more values let's say if
you have entered 5 and then to the rear
will be pointing at this point in fact
the diva really we have took shift to
this point when you insert 2 so that you
can add 3 so here will shift here so
every time you add a value you will say
RIA plus + +
every time we delete the value you have
to say front plus plus so when you say
delete you have to say front plus plus
and whenever you insert you will say
rear plus will see the implementation
and then you will understand what I'm
talking about so I will go back here in
the queue and so you can see I have two
classes one we have is one a class
another we have is a queue class I will
go to queue and let's try to implement
those methods the first method we have
to implement is NQ o before that we need
to create some certain variables the
first thing would be I want to create a
queue itself so I would say queue and
the size of this queue would be let's
say 5 initially or this is not what you
do it so you say new ain't and you
specific the size 5 you can make a
dynamic your choice but initially I will
go with the static one or fixed one so
there are two it will be easier for you
to understand and then we need three
variables we'll say size one of the
variable then I need a variable which is
front which will refer to the front
element and then I will need a real
element which will only a variable which
should refer to the DL element once you
got these four variables and of course
the value for this size would be zero
front will be zero array will be zero
and then I will create the method so the
method name is public void and queue
this is my method which will take a int
data and then I will try to insert a
value here now how do we add the data
into NQ so for that I will go back to my
at this point and let me just make this
an empty empty queue okay so you can see
that we got a empty queue here so the
name of this Q is Q itself and now I
want to insert a value so let's say if I
am inserting a value which is 5 so in
this queue at the index value 0 I want
to insert 5 now if you want to insert
the value we use a variable which is
real and by default real has the value
which is 0 in fact front will be also
referring to the first element as at
this point so we'll say front is also 0
index number 0 index number 1 index
number 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
now front and rear both will refer to
the same element here at the end now the
moment you add 5 so at the real point
you have to insert 5 now how do we
achieve that
so in the code itself you will say Q of
real is equal to whatever data you are
passing so they did I am passing is D
itself now once you have added the value
you need to do one thing
after adding the value 5 you just need
to shift your ear to the next location
which is here and how do you do that how
do we shift our ear it's very easy you
simply say RIA + + so you will say Rio
is equal to Rio plus 1 or you can say
plus + that's fine and then once you
have added the value or incremented
devalue now I also want to increase the
size of it right so now this size is
size plus plus because we are not
interacting in right size equal to size
plus 1 just to maintain the same
sequence so if you have really quality a
plus 1 and size equal to size plus 1 so
every time you add the value the size
for the increment it's that simple time
in each work with an q and then later
we'll work with DQ I want to see the
element as well so let me say I want to
create a show method which will print
the elements so we also need one more
method here which is show so I would say
show method as well and show is
responsible to print all the elements
and in this show if I want to print
elements it will print all the elements
in the quraan DQ but how do we do that
so what I will do is I will say for loop
I will start with 0 initially and then I
would say ok till what point we have to
go after you have to go till size right
and then plus plus because the size of
the array may be so you have inserted 3
values so the size would be 3 so you
have to go till I less than 3 and every
time you go there you just need to print
the elements and the way you can print
the element is by saying the value Q of
I and then you will also print a space
after that and here I want to print the
elements I would say system dot out dot
println I would say elements elements :
so that you know you it will give you a
good format of printing I don't want a
printer in there that's it it will work
now so we got and cubic God so now how
do we verify so let's go to Rana and in
this run now let me create object of Q I
will say Q q is equal to nu Q I got the
object which is Q and in this Q I will
add the element I would say and Q I want
to include the first element which is
let's say 5 as we have done here now
after inserting 5 I will just seem
please say Q dot so I want to see how
many elements are there and if you don't
this code you can see we got five we got
only one element that's perfect let me
just add one more element here and that
would be two in this case I would say
two here and when you say - if I'll on
this code you can see regard five and
two so every time you insert the value
it will it will get added in the q But
question arise how will you remove the
element and what happens when you go
beyond the size let's say if I inserted
seven values what will happen and of
course if you insert seven values or six
values it will give you a very famous
error or the exception which is array
index out of bounds exception now how do
we handle that that we'll see in the
next video so I hope you enjoyed the
video let me know in the comment section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
