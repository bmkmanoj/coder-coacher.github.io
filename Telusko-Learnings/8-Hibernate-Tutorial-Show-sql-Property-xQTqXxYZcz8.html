we have seen as we have created the
knack we have created this application
where when you run this code it will be
so it will be storing this object in the
database right now in the hibernate dot
CFG for xml file we have mentioned
update right so that's why whenever you
run this application all this new data
so if I let's say if I change this to 3
and if I say hush and let's say for
color hush is let's say blue or blue or
later on right let's see on now in this
color if I if I don't this code you can
see in our database will be getting hush
as well if I don this code and you can
see we got hush but you can see we are
not creating database again and again so
it is using the existing table is
because we are using update but what
will happen if I say create and if I
change this value from 1 0 3 2 1 0 4 and
with the same name harsh NC on and if I
run this code if I go back to my
database you can see if I run this code
you can see we got a new table so it has
deleted the old table anticipating a new
table and that is what it does when you
say create it will create a table every
time you learn this code now what is
happening behind the scene I mean when
you say when you on this code see we are
able to store data into database right
so that means your mask you'll only work
with SQL so somewhere your hibernate is
converting your code into SQL at how for
that what we can do is we can use one
more property here and we can name this
properties as show underscore SQL and we
can say true
because by default you cannot see the
SQL query if you do if you do this if
you say show a show SQL true it will
make sure that you will get your query
in the console window let's try it out
once again if I have this code since we
are using create it will drop the old
table and you can see we got the entire
SQL query here it says drop table if any
or if exists
alien create a table with all this fails
and it is saying not null and then we
also specifying the primary key at the
end driver key
a ID and then we are as inserting the
values right so that means even if you
are not writing SQL queries hibernate is
creating an SQL query for you awesome
right so if I go back here and so that
is we have create and then we have true
so these are two two properties we can
use in fact let's say if I if I say
update here it will not create new table
now if I say update if I change this to
let's say 1 0 1 with name naveen and if
I say color is green
now in this scenario if I on this code
you can see we are getting the SQL query
but only of insert no create and no no
drop right if I go to my database now so
it's always better to use update you can
see it is not getting a new table every
time you run this and we don't want that
right we don't want every time you run
this application it should it it should
create your database again so that's
that's how you use these two properties
ok in the next video we are going to
talk about different annotations which
we can use so that is what this video
