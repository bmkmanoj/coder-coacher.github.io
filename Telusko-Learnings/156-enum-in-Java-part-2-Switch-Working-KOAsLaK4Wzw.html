from the list alerting and in this video
we'll talk about the working of enum in
the last video we have seen what is enum
how to use enum in this video we'll see
the working of it so before going for
the working let's try to understand
where we can use this innum how we can
compare this so what we can do is we can
use enum in switch so basically till one
till one point for switch user support
only one or two where datatype ways to
submit is your support integer I mean
not even integer int by a short but
later in 1.5 we got - we got something
called as Auto boxing and boxing because
of which we can actually use this enum
in in switch okay so how we can use that
we can say switch and we can pass the
inner object but before that we need to
create the object of in apply it so let
me remove this stuff and let's say this
is mobile so in fact we can create the
oddity as this also we can say mobile m
equal to mobile dot apple now this M
represents Apple here okay and we can
pass M here
now if that M matches with any case I
mean that taste would be of course it
would be Apple so if that matches with
apple we can print a statement here we
can say system dot out dot println okay
so we can say system dot in how apple is
best so if your body's apple it is best
right so we can we can also say break
after that and we can have some more
switch statement we can have more cases
we can have Samson right and we can say
this is we can print some message here
we can say first copy of apple right and
then we can have a break here and there
is no comments for let's just see here
and even even this will work if I have
this code you can see record
best and if you change this to Samson of
course you'll be getting the first copy
of Apple right so we can use you can use
enum in switch statement so this will M
represents either Apple or Samsung or s
you see how about if you have our
different case here we'll say we have a
case where the case is my company let's
say the bean company is will that work
I don't think so if I'll if I do that
you can say here itself we are getting
an error it doesn't matter if I'm
writing then or not you can see by
getting errors so in the switch blog you
have to make sure that if you are
passing M it should match with the
constants available inside this switch
there is something you have to remember
okay that's about switch what else we
can work what what else what exactly
happens behind the scene so once we have
done that let's see what happens behind
the scenes because enum was introduced
in 1.5 right so if that was if this is
introduced in 1.5 so did they change the
internal working of the programming but
exactly so as a programmer you type this
but at the compiler level what your
company does is compiler creates a class
Paris mobile so the moment you say in a
mobile the compiler will create a class
for you in the backend and all this
Apple Samsung is to say they're actually
a final object they are static final
objects of mobile itself so mobile Apple
equal to new mobile so this is what is
happening behind the scenes so if I come
in this section for time being so this
is what is happening behind the scene
and that's how you create multiple
constant here so we got Apple will be
getting so this would be Samsung and
this would be HTC so this is this is
what is happening behind the scene so
every class on every enum in Java gets
converted into a class with with all
this stuff here okay so this is a
- the same as this one so let me come in
this one and let me go back with this
and that's why whenever you use enum so
whenever you use am like mobile we
always use I mean when you want to use
Apple we always use mobile right because
Apple is a static constant so when you
don't use static we actually use the
class name here which is mobile so
that's why we say mobile that Apple
mobile dot Samsung and mobile goes to C
so that means enum gets converted into a
class right does that mean C in class we
can define methods right we can create
methods is it possible to create method
inside enum and the answer is yes the
way we can create class the way we can
create class okay not class the way we
can create that's that's real so the way
we can create variables and methods
inside a class I think we should I
should pause my Dropbox for time way I
mean lot of notifications here ignore
that part so we have so the way we can
create variables and methods inside a
class the same way we can create
variables and methods inside enum so we
can say int X right inside this class
the same thing can be done here so we
can say int price because every for
every phone will have a price right so
we'll say it price and we can also have
methods here we can say public inch
get price and we can say return the
price so every phone will have a price
now we can do that we can have variables
and methods inside a enum and that is
what making a num different from the
enum in C and C++ so in C and C++ it we
were not having anything called as I
mean we cannot create variables and
methods inside inside inside enum
gimmick we cannot create methods and
variables there so can we can be
accessed these methods
let's try so if I want to access those
methods first of all what we have to do
is we have to say mobile let me just
print that value so we say mobile
dot Apple dot get prize so if you want
to use this method we have to use object
right and this decide your objects here
and if you are this code the quad zero
because we have not set the price but
now I want to set this price so I want
to set the price for Apple I want to set
this price for Samsung I want to set the
price for s you see how to do that that
we'll see in the next video so thank you
so much make sure you like the video and
