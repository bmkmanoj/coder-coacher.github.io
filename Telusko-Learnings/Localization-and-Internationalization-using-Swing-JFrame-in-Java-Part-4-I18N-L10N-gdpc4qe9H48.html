a little application to add two numbers
we'll make it simple and then we'll try
to use the other concept of localization
internationalization in fact so to
create a swing application just write
like look at a new package write like
and click on new package and we'll say
this time it is a GUI I'm using a one
convention it should be small G refactor
rename it should be small G okay and
then we'll create on you Jeffrey so this
is how you're to create a java
application or the swing application
click on I will type add and since we
are working with jframe you will be
getting option of drag and drop so you
can even go for drag-and-drop or you can
write this whole swing application by
yourself
so we'll take two text field here so
that we can take two input from the user
so it's like two text field will give a
proper name say this is DX g1 and the
very text okay text here
and then same goes for here and will
change its will change its name when
said his pxt
- okay now me I need a button here and
this button will say the text will do
whatever you say ad and then I will say
change me happened it should be BTN and
yeah let's see what is a demeans in some
different language will say ad in Hindi
it is Jordan oh and we will use this
thing using the language you can use any
language any time language I wish with
that okay and then if I change my
language if I click on Hindi so let's
take a button here here I will mention
Hindi which means if I click on this
button the the text of this ad should
change in fact I'll take one note one
more button to demonstrate this time it
should be closed so once I click on
close this system should go system
should get exited so let me just write a
code for closed variable name it is VTN
closed okay in fact low click on close
you it should close the application so
far I think the application we have try
to quote phone system but exit and we'll
pass these chips as 0 so that specifies
a normal exit let's have it and then I
can also code for ad now so let me just
code for this addition code over here so
we'll say ain't I equal to taken to from
txt integer dot parseint and we'll fetch
data from txt 1 so T X T 1 dot txt
same goes for J or J variable to the
services J and the input will be found
DHT - and then we can use something
called ask a variable say it is I plus J
and you want to show this output I need
I need a label here this level will
display resolved the name of this label
will go for change variable name and we
take as lvl 1 so here again specify lvl
1 guard set text you can pass key since
cite textual except our string we have
to spoil the string since a K is integer
so when you say integer plus string it
will give you a string that's a big
we've done with the addition that's
let's strike this chord oh yeah
forgetting this for you went i-5 and to
add and say 7 if I click on close it is
closing but what if I click the meaning
files here what if I go here and if I on
this chord and click on Hindi nothing
happened right is because I'm not
written any code for this now once you
click on Hindi so this text should
change this Act should change that means
I had to create a resource budget for
this awesome
and to create that that means providing
some features we conduct design and go
to the navigation bar here from and once
you go to the design mode and check for
this property window in properties
window you can find something for us
automatic internationalisation if you
just if you just concentrate here and
this GUI package is just only one file
just our focus then if I click on this
automatic internationalisation you can
you will get one more file they call has
mental dot properties right and if you
open that Mandela property you have you
can see we have all those text that
means the data you are able to see on
this ji why they are coming from this
bundle file
if I change here if I say I'd now if I
say save it's not changed that will
define the Lord save you can see it is
add nom nom okay so that means that it
is fetched from this this is what the
fight now what do you find if I click on
this hindi the language I should be
getting is chef add number it should be
number its Sankhya Jodi is thank you
Judy so what we'll do is we'll create a
new bundle file now how to get a new
bundle file for that also just click on
this form but is this design locale and
just expand this ellipse - ellipse you
can just mention I'm going for country a
language code as H I this is H I and
then you specify the country code which
is India its I am you can see the code
is a child is called I hand and click on
okay I can see you get a bundle failure
abide if I just blank right so what we
can simply do is just click on this
bundle and say bundle properties click
on right click here when the properties
and open you will get a form and this
you can just change the font here you
can say that if it's not for and now the
text should be it is this test copy and
paste the point is not supporting
moisture it should have this close it
should be close it should be bundles a
copy this and we'll paste it here
and that's it I just want to change
these two things if you go to this H I
thought and you can see we have this two
keys now now what we need to do is we
just have to make the changes so click
on this Hindi so once I click on him the
we need to create two classes again two
objects will say no kal-el equal to new
locale you have to mention two things
first is the language name and the
language you will be using here is Hindi
and then you have to mention the country
name which is India I M then we have to
get object of this bundle as we did in
the first video we'll say the source
bundle will say are equal to resource
bundle Dodd get bundle by accepting two
parameters first is file name file name
is again it is under GUI underscore
bundle and then you have to specify the
locale which is L so now what we to
change is way to change that text of
this atom this is button one button add
and button clues so what we'll do is
we'll say button add dot set text the
text should be coming from the source so
the get string now you have to mention
the key name not is the key name just go
to this bundle file and fetch this key
watch this key which is I had got button
add Bhupesh it here and for button close
god said text this time also it will
fetch from get string and way to specify
the close key and for close key it is
this so we copy this code and paste it
here and that's it I want to make this
changes your your code will work now
cipher on this file so I get we can add
two numbers 5 and 3 add numbers or
answer is 8 if I click on
the you can see the font has changed it
is bunda which is closed and Sankhya
this is your ad okay if I click on bunda
now it will close it so this is how you
have to achieve internationalization and
localization in Java so thank you so
