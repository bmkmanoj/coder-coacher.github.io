about Scala interpreter right where we
have where we just have to write a line
and that mean when you say control-enter
it will give you the output instantly we
don't have to write the full bunch of
code to get the output now let's try to
understand how to work with worksheet
now as you can see we got a worksheet
here where we can't object demo now why
we have to do this is because you know
in a way it comes with Java we have to
write a class demo and then we have to
mention the publisher avoid main and the
reason why we do why we use static main
is because we don't need object to call
main because we don't we cannot get
object of main without calling main so
that's why I make we make it static
right now scholar says we don't need all
the stuff which you simply say demo
I mean create object obj object demo
it's a real instance which we can
directly use it okay again we'll talk
about this later once we talk about the
classes object concept but here whatever
you type here
you will get instant answer here itself
I mean you don't have to go to console
to see the output example let's say if I
say welcome to scholar walk should let
us say this is hello world and as soon
as I save it you can see the output
instantly dead itself you don't have to
go to console and see the output
it is that awesome okay now what else
let's say I want to create a variable
now so the way we can create a variable
is by saying that okay value is used to
create a variable and we can specify the
variable name as num and we have to
provide the data type using : and the
type which is int and let's say 8 now if
you're thinking about Java where we use
ain't float so normally what happens is
in Java we have int we have float we
have double now all these types I mean
in total we have 8 right we have eight
types we have short end we have long we
have boolean so if you talk about all
this this are Paul - so this stuff are
called as primitive data types and
that's why Java is not purely
object-oriented right because in Java
which still white ink
load which are coming from C programming
so Java is somewhere you know because of
data types I mean because of primitive
types Java is not fully object-oriented
and we still have upper classes to cover
it cover the top right so wrapper
classes like I'd like covers to this so
instead of using ain't in wrapper class
we write integer it should I float type
we write float class it should have CAD
we write character class but in Scala
everything is AB class in fact this end
is also a class so in Scala we don't
have primitive variables so this ain't
is a class itself and this num is an
object okay if you think that this is a
primitive no it's a class and this eight
is also an object in skull again we'll
see that how that is the object and if
you if you can see that we are getting
instant reply here and now we can print
we can say print the value of num let's
see is it tight working ID well it works
again you can see we got the output as
eight so when you print the value of num
we got the output as eight now what else
we can do here let's perform some
operation will create one more variable
let's say time in let's say this is num1
and this is we are printing num1 here
let's say we are kidding one more
variable which is num2 : int equal to 7
and we can perform the operation as num1
plus num2 again we have seen this in the
last video right but should i want to do
this now i want to do this is because
even if I remove this semicolon it works
ok there is no harm you can see fall on
this code now you are getting the output
that means in scala
we don't need semicolons as soon as your
line ends as soon as you can see there
is no line I mean there's no statement I
mean there's no characters or words
ahead it will end the statement in
itself again you can do it-- you can
write semicolon or you that is not
composite right because you don't have
to give lots of pressure to your little
finger right to type that semicolon so
we just we can simply say num1 plus num2
and you got the output to simply says
save it will give you the output here
itself now what else we can do in fact
I think Scala has copied this concept
from Swift I'm not sure okay I'm just
guessing it because if you learn apple
programming Swift programming are yeah
except it will give you output instantly
I guess it is called as workbook in in
Swift I'm not sure I forgot the point
but anyway so we can add those two
values what else we can do here we can
define a string we can define all the
stuff but let's say can I change the
value of off no what if I assigned let's
say if I say num 1 if I say num 1 equal
to 23 will it work
yes you can't change the value right ok
you can see we are getting we are able
to change the value here but what
happens is in in Scala Scala believes
that there should not be any booty
mutation now what is notation means
changing the variable value or changing
the value of our type I mean changing
the value is called as mutation and we
should not do mutation is because Scala
believes in concurrency as we have seen
in the okay so have you have seen in the
interest of Scala Scala believes in ways
that that is that yeah so Scala believes
in concurrency right where it is
so Scala believes in concurrency and how
to achieve concurrency when you have
multiple threads working on this same
variable what happens is if one thread
is changing the value the other thread
value will change right and we don't do
we don't want to do that if there are
multiple threads working on the same
variable we should not change the value
of a variable there should not be any
mutation because see change is good
right change is good because the only
thing which is constant is change and
sharing is good because sharing is
caring so when there are multiple
threads it - they can't share the same
variable but changing and sharing that
is the real problem so you should not
create a variable which is changing and
sharing at the same time right so Java
Scala believes in concurrency so - how
to achieve a constant value I don't want
I don't want on anyone to change the
value of now one
now how do we do that in Java so we in
Java what we do is we simply say I want
to create a final variable so when you
make a variable final it means you
cannot change the value of it in Scala
Scala goes ahead and say okay the only
way to do that is by using Val so when
you use a Val to create a variable it
becomes a constant and you can see once
you specify Val you cannot change the
value so if I go to the error now it
says reassigning to war Val it is not
allowed so if you say bad that means you
can't change the value if you say Val
you cannot change the value so if you
say valid periods of constant and in
future if you want to create any
variable always make it well again you
cannot change the value but that's not
the intention of Scala right Scala
believes all the data should be constant
because we want to achieve concurrency
okay but time being since we are in the
nothing stage we'll go for bad so if you
say well it gives you the instant output
done and you can see we got the output
as 80 now what else okay so can I
perform some operations now if you say
if you are performing this operation
you might be thinking let me create a
new variable for that let me say bad
result is equal to num 1 plus num2 now
by any mean let me just simplify it I
mean by any mean if you are thinking
that we are able to okay let me remove
this stuff that means let me just make
it very easy initially let's let's do
that so if you are thinking that we are
doing 8 plus 7 that means this 8 is a
value and this 7 is a operator and
that's not the case in Scala
everything is object in Scala
everything is object and everything is a
method so this plus here is not a
operator okay can you see that there's a
pop-up there if you can see death is the
way you define a method or a function so
def is the way we define a function and
the function name is plus it is except
our variable which is int I mean it's
like it is accepting or int variable and
it returns a int variable now if you're
familiar with C++ programming where we
have operator overloading this is what
we are doing here this plus here is not
a operator it's a function
let me repeat plus is a function I know
you you are a bit of a shock now it's
because we don't have operator
overloading in Java and if you are
comfortable with Java that means you
know that in Java we don't use operator
overloading but in Scala we do because
Scala is also a functional programming
so this plus looks like an operator but
that's a method or a function how it
works
so imagine eight is an object and we are
using a dot operator there and the
function name is plus and the addition
of which is the addition operator and
this seven we are passing as a parameter
and you can see we are still getting the
output so we can see regard the output
as fifteen that means this eight is an
object this dot is the operator this
plus is the function and this seven is
the parameter which you're passing in
the function and we are getting the
value which is 15 and that is something
awesome about Scala it is this this is
both a object-oriented and a functional
programming okay
I hope you got some some something about
it in the next video we'll try to create
classes and how to do that that we'll
see in the next video thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
