Verde and in this video we'll see an
example covering servlet JSP mavin and
JDBC in one video we are carrying
covering all these things so this video
will be helpful for those people who
want to revise all these topics so maybe
you have learned this topics from
somewhere and now you want to make a
quick recap so this video will be
helpful for you because we will be
covering most of them I mean the
internet topic of that as well and then
if you want to just see how sublet JSP
Maronite it even looks like you know you
you see you talked a lot lots of people
and they say ok you sure you should
launch a servlet and JSP but you're not
sure what exactly we see in that you
know some people not know Co Java and
they just want to see how the JSP looks
like so this video will be helpful in
that way now again this video is not for
those people who want to learn serve it
and JSP indeed because will not be
covering all those things in detail here
but then if you just want to get a gist
and then if you want to if you just want
to do a quick recap this video it will
be helpful for you so let's get started
now first of all to make it work we
require two software
the first one is eclipse again you can
go with any IDE bit here which you like
maybe you can go for NetBeans or eclipse
or IntelliJ which you like in fact in my
machine I already have a clip so I will
continue with that and then the second
software I need is at our DBMS so in
this example I'm using MySQL or you can
opt for Oracle pause quiz whichever you
like
so I'm in this in this video I will be
using Eclipse and masculine yeah so so
in my Eclipse you have to open eclipse
you have to select a workspace and then
let's create a project so I will say new
and now you have two choice you can go
for a dynamic web project or you can go
for mavin project now what's the
advantage of going for mavin so in
dynamic what you do is you create a
project and then you assign a tomcat
server I get to do that you have to
assign a tomcat server and then what you
do is you when you when you want to use
some external job for example for MySQL
for JDBC we need a jar file right and
you have to go to Google I'm near to
what internet you have to download the
Java file and you add in your project
now when you work with lots of
dependencies it creates some issues
example if you work with advanced
framework like spraying
hi bud net or maybe starts framework
there's so many dependencies you have to
work with so you're downloading all
those dependency by yourself I'm talking
about Java files okay what you can do is
you can you know you can ask Mammon or
the build tool to give it to you so
mavin will say okay programmer you want
you want Mahaska character I will give
it to you if you want Spring Framework
dependencies I will give it to you so
your Marron will give you all those
dependencies again you have to
quantitate somewhere you have to infirm
haven't hey what what are what are
things I need
so I will give it you give you those
things but what its debit maven and like
it if you have all the Java files
available available with maven ok so
here are we starting a madman project
and how to do that just pick one of
those and you will simply say ok sting
sometime I would say mavin so search for
my main project and you can see we
caught mavin here click on next and
we'll say next here will mention the
project type so I'm going for a web app
project again you can select quick start
if you want to go for a standalone
software here we are building a web
application so I select web app click on
next and here we'll enter bloop ID so
Cooper is basically your company IDs so
let's say if you have thousand projects
on on some web services or some Play
Store you have to make sure that every
app is different and you can
differentiate between those with the
help of group IDs and the package name
so our group IDs come to the disco
that's how I represent my bro party I
can satified edit the project name I
will say servlet JSP demo again this is
servlet JSP JDBC and I mean demo but
like this name it I serve it
JSP demo and with click on finish so we
got about mavin project now this budget
is coming from the internet you can see
just taking some time to configure now I
will if I go back to my project or not
this one this is the spring project so
this is the project which we have
created now which is servlet JSP demo
again is taking some time to make the to
build your project and you can see we
got our project here we got resource
folder we got JRE because now in
dependencies with memory dependencies so
this is the or with that very moment
dependencies so if I if I open Java
resources you can see in this we have my
own dependencies and we only have one
dependency what I want is I want a
ask your dependency as well because if
you want to work with MySQL again in
this application we'll be working with a
database right so we require a mask
you'll connect to connect with this
database in fact I also have a database
ready with ready with us so I have
installed a MySQL rehand so you can
install MySQL or post with your choice
so I have mask you with Maskull
workbench so it's saying is some time to
open so by the time it opens what I will
do is I will download the dependency now
question is how will you get the mask or
dependency it's very simple you just
need to inform mavin hey you want mask
well dependency and how do we interact
with mavin you do that with the help of
P or M file so in this p om which is
project object model you have to inform
what type of what type of dependency you
want so we just need to add a dependency
which mask the dependency here so we
already have J unit now we don't have to
type by yourself okay if you're thinking
you need to by heart all the
dependencies not needed you can simply
go to a website and so the website is
ambient repository okay so here with
search for Emily and repository and you
can take you to a venom posit 3 where
you just need to search for which
dependency you need so here we need a
mask you'll connectors so if you can
search for my so connector it will give
you a connector here so if I click on
search and it will give you a connector
and which one is select you can select
any version I will select six point zero
point six to stop it this and go back to
your mask you'll but you go back to your
Eclipse and paste it here the moment you
paste it you can see it will download
the math so go enter for you I know our
job is done so using math and you can
download any dependency if you want if
you want mask you'll you get it there if
you want a spring free Spring Framework
dependencies or Java I'm talking about
you can get that using maven
so maven has lots of advantage like it's
a build tool you can build the
application it will package the thing
for you but I mean we only need a jar
file yeah so we got a jar file there now
the next thing is the next thing is I
want to get a page right so using which
I can't send data so if I go back to my
master workbench you can see I will just
connect with my with my workbench and
the password is star star star star
which is root in this case
for Mama she's at least and okay so I
don't have a database called as maybe if
I explore now when you can see we have a
database my mean in which I'm a table
has alien so I already have all this
data ready with us so that you know when
you work on a project it will not make
it will not waste much of time so I have
a master database which is Naveen and
the data the table name is aliens
we just need to fetch data from this
example if I user says hey I want data
about user IDs nine so it will print
nine media and hardware if someone says
hey I want user ID - so it will print to
Archana
big data if I want five up lanai and up
to now and Oracle so this is what I want
to do so for this we need a page right
so that I use I can enter the value so
if you can see we already have a index
dot JSP page now why do we need JSP one
of this GML because when you say you
want to make a web page you always go
for HTML right but in this case when you
say you want to create a page and that
should be a dynamic page because see
what happens with HTML is you can make
only static content with HTML Oh again
if you have if you are using javascript
and that if you are sending a sink
request if you can achieve dynamic
content there but imagine if you want to
make a dynamic page without using
javascript all the stuff if you want to
write java code inside insert HTML is it
possible can you run java code inside
HTML what exactly right so that's why we
require JSP so whenever you want to
create a dynamic content you have to
choice you can go for a servlet or JSP
now when you want to process something
server is better and if you want to get
a view JSP is better so sublet are used
to process the request so whatever our
clients have a request so it will handle
that again you might be thinking why
servlet then we can use to our normal
Java right servlets is Java okay servlet
our servlet is a Java file the only
thing is in sublet it has a special
feature where you can accept a user
request from from the internet right
it's normal Java cool if you render if I
if I make the code it will it will make
sense but then we have servlet which
like sent a request and we will process
some information and then we will show
the data on JSP now again we have one
more thing which which is called as MVC
which stands for
model-view-controller now and this c is
used let's say if I use a sent request
request will go to controller now
controller will generate data again if
you want to know about it if you're new
to NBC please watch the ABC video first
I do have a spring I mean I do have a
video on MBC do watched first and then
so if you know about just to make a
revised vision we have a controller
which will accept a request we have a
model where you will hold the data and
we have a view where you will show the
data yeah so we can implement controller
with the help of servlets we can
implement model with the help of a
normal Java class and we can implement
view with your pop GSD so this is our
JSP here and it you can see if you are
getting some error here the other is
because we don't have Tomcat linked here
so we have to make sure that I do have
Tomcat and fortunately I do have a
tomcat here against that the news 25
which is working so if I say Tomcat
start so target is there and it is in
running state I guess yes it is in
running state you just need to connect
your project with Tomcat because your
project is not going to be Tomcat yet so
I will right click here and I will say
properties and this option of target one
time you simply have to check this thing
which will make sure that your Tomcat is
linked and click on OK now this will
link your Tomcat and we got a tomcat
there so you can see no there's no
problem with JSP file now in this file I
look at a form tag and I will say form
action equal to and I'll mention I want
to fetch the user data so I want to
specifically I want to fetch the alien
data because the table name is alien
right so I would say get alien so that's
my user request so actually is get alien
and here I will specify what I want to
fetch so I want to fetch the data based
on the a ID so if I mention a ID I want
the complete data of the user ok and
then I also need to make sure that I
have I have a button here to click it so
I will say input type equal to submit
yes I will say submit here ok now when I
click on the submit it should call it
should fetch the data right now push
arise when you click on this submit they
need to be a controller will accept a
request right and that's well we have
solved it so let's get a simple servlet
here
and there's one more issue I don't have
a Java folder you can see that in SRC we
need we need Java folder as well so we
have to make sure that you have Java
here okay not here let's let's go to
main and say I want to get a new folder
I will say a new folder and that folder
name is Java folder which should be the
inside main okay now in this jar folder
I want to create some resources so I
will right click on a project I will say
what's that and I want to solve that
right so I would simply say I want a
class how maybe I'll simply see it clear
sublet so right click I will say new
servlet and this subject will have a
name also a package name first I will
say contact I disco and the comdata
disco the odd web and this class name
here will be alien but I will say get
alien controller here so I'm specifying
a controller name as get alien
controller I will click on next now the
you are mapping so for which request I
want to call this controller so the
request type is get alien so whenever I
use a request for get alien I want to
call this controller so this is the
linking this is how you're lying so you
have a controller which is a servlet and
you have a request so the questions get
alien right and the controller is the
name of the controller is get alien
controller you can see the spelling
difference there right so anyway our
user request for gate alien you can see
the HTML we are specifying gate Adrian
you have to request gate alien
controller click on OK and click on
finish this will create a socket for you
and miss the mapping you will be saying
the mapping will be done inside web I
adapt so where I live we have web a dot
XML file this is where you have done the
mapping so the mapping is done with the
help of solid tag and solid mapping tag
so the southern mapping is specified for
which request you want to call which
controller game so that the controller
name is here the class name Kandra that
is called our web app get alien
controller simple right so that's how it
works that's how the just the mapping
now if I go back to controller here we
have a plus we don't need all this extra
thing we just need a do get method so
basically when you have whenever you
have a get request so basically we have
two type of request
we have five but then in Soviet we used
to we have get requests and we have post
requests
now get is something very so if you want
to press data from server you use get
request if you want to submit it on the
server you use post request so get to
fetch and post to submit data here we
have to face data right and that's why
we using get request okay now once you
specify get request what to do so based
on the Eid first of all are you sending
a ID right so if you can see in the
index page I use I sending a ID how can
you fetch the a ID in this servlet
thanksfully we have a request object so
using request object you can surely
press data so I would say request dot
getparameter so the quiz is an object of
httpservletrequest so we just need a
method one has get parameter in which
you specify hey I want a table it is
coming from a ID so request dot
getparameter a ID it will give you the
data but then we have to store it
somewhere right so okay we'll just do it
some extra rows here I would say I want
to store that in a a ID variable so I
would say int a ID equal to request dot
getparameter now unfortunately get
parameter will give you integer also it
will give your string I want integer so
I will simply say integer dot parseint
and here I will just try to remove this
yeah so you can see I have I have I have
passed it right so you have kept on
waiting your request data into an
integer format now once you've got your
integer
I want the object of alien right again
you can fetch one one data you can fetch
a ID you can fetch name and you can
fetch tech so you can see the column
names we have a ID name and tech so
these are the three columns in your
database
now you can fetch these three values but
we are walking with Java right and Java
is purely object oriented that means
even if you want to face this data this
should be passed in the object format
how do we get the object so to create
the object first you need a plus so in
this I will create a class and this
class name will be called as alien and
this Aryan is a model so whenever you
have a class which which
whose object will ever send some data
that's a model object yeah so I would
say I have a lien here and this alien
will have three things it will have
private and a ID it will have private
trying a name and it will have private
string text so we have these three
things and for these three variables I
want getters and setters so I will
simply right-click here I would say soz
generate Gaeta setters and I will select
all the variables here and I will click
on OK now once I got this guess let also
use to signal so that if you want to
print this object it should bring some
data right so I would say souls to
string because what will happen is if
you try to print a reference reference a
couple of a class it will print the hash
school I don't want that I want the data
so over like two strings so whenever
possible in fact I would suggest for
every class override to string that's
how we do it
okay so now once we got to string here
let's go back to controller and now we
can create object of a ID so I would say
alien so first object of alien so I will
say alien a1 equal to new alien let's
get the object of alien no we should not
make any quantity of alien right because
you want to face this data from database
okay that's that's a thing right how do
you face together together for database
now remember this whenever you want to
walk with database you need to write
data with steps DB steps right now JDBC
has seven steps in it now if you think
about those seven steps the first step
is you have to import the package you
have to then second step is you have to
load it driver you have to create a
connection object you have to create a
strip in the object you have to process
results and then you have to close the
connection there's all these steps right
now where to write all these steps
should you write all these steps in our
insert controller which is servlet
that's not a good idea in sublet it
should also subject should only fetch
the request or it will accept a request
it should do some first thing but not
JDBC processing and then it should
return the data to the view so who will
do the DBC processing but who will have
the all the content all the all the code
and that's where we have a special layer
we just called as Dowell's again it's
not compensate to go for down layer but
that's a good practice right if you want
to be a good developer if you want to
create a software which will be
less bugs go follow some standards and
that's where you have a towel layer so
let's get a class and I would call this
class as alien Dao which belongs to a
package come toward the disco
dot web dot Dao so we are putting that
in a dau class or dau package alien Dao
so example if you have five tables so
you'll be having five classes which
representatives table and you'll be
having five down now classes right so
that's not so empty class will have its
own every table will have its own Dao
class and in each now class we'll be
having those four operations for
operations here create a Priya data or
create alien read alien update area and
delete alien right so put options
normally normally that's what we do so
in this and this alien tau I will be
having a method which will it'll be the
alien object and I will say this is get
alien so this gate alien will accept a a
ID and it will give me the alien object
that's simple
so let me just pee ride an object I will
say alien alien and then I would say
this alien or we have to input the
package for this because it belongs
different package than that and it will
say a dot set a ID so time is I always
specify static IDs okay static values so
that let's see if it is working or not I
would say name is Naveen
then a dot sect tag as my favor
technologist Java all this travel and
then I will return the alien object of
course this data should be coming from
database but then let's go step by step
now once record this class let's go back
to controller now the alien data will be
coming from the DAO layered right and
that's how that's where you require the
object so we'll say alien Dao and I will
say Dao object equal to nu equal to new
alien Dao yeah and let's import the
package for that so you can import the
package in Eclipse by saying ctrl shift
o so ctrl shift o is used to you know to
import the package for required packages
and using this down now you can specify
hey Dow get me the alien if I pass the
value which is a ID so if a user say is
a ID one it will pass one
but that is matter because even if you
have even if yours passing one you are
passing static values yeah so we are
doing some I know some thing here severe
stuff anyway
so once we got this alien object I want
to display but where to display that and
to display this data way to create a JSP
because JSP is a place where you can
actually show the data right again you
can print it up from here as well
but creating a HTML page in servlet is a
bad thing okay it's not a bad thing but
then it will be damn difficult to design
a page think about it let's say if you
want to make a awesome website when you
have lots of graphics so each so even if
you create a small page with lots of
graphics it needs around 70 80 lines of
HTML tags what do you think will you
write all the HTML tags in this in this
servlet by saying out dot print that's
not a good idea so that's why we quite a
separate page which many will have
design and then you can put data so
let's do that so in this in this web for
in this project or in this project I
will say write like I want to get a JC
page which will show my aliens I will
say hey jasp show the alien so I would
say show alien dot JSP I will click on
finish so because a JC page here which
will have some layout example I will
change the color I will say BG you can
design your stuff I'm very bad with HTML
so you can say I'm simply saying busy
color equal to C and that's it that's
what I know about HTML and here I will
print the data about alien now how do
you print it or first of all how do we
call a JSP from a solid that's the first
question right so I will go back to
servlet now how do you call a JSP there
are two ways of calling it one is
dispatcher which is Vickers dispatcher
the second way is using send redirect
which one to use here now we can use
anything but then it is always
recommended that if you if you want your
client to know that you are getting
redirected didn't go for it right
otherwise if you're using dispatcher
client it will not even know what is
happening behind the scenes and that's
what we want right we don't want to
confuse our clients by changing the page
URL every time so because the client is
sending requests to get alien not sure
alien right because if I use with I
write the URL will be shown here
okay so what we do here is I would say I
will usually dispatcher so I said it by
dispatcher and I would say Rd equal to
the quit dispatcher is in the face and
the way you can get the object of it by
saying request dot get requestdispatcher
and in this you have to specify so in
this bracket you have to specify the
name of your JSP so they want the JSP is
show alien door JSP yeah and you simply
have to forward the request you will say
our DDOT forward and he will pass you
forward these two objects which is the
question response because you want to
send so when I use a sender request
right user send a request to the index
page right from index page use any
request to the controller that's one
request the same request object will go
to JSP so user should not know that we
are sending to request right so that
your question will go to Jay spend
that's why we have to forward otherwise
if you don't want to forward it to your
choice you can go for another way as
well okay which is dispatch which is
really lightweight time and let's go for
dispatcher and now it will forward the
request to JSP it works okay well let's
verify in JSP I will print in show agent
just to see if the flow is working yeah
so we are we will be running index dot
JSP index dot JSP we'll call a
controller which is your servlet and so
it will call JSP let's verify right
click run as run on sawa it will I guess
it will run on my Firefox maybe let me
just remove this MVC from here because
trust not required click on finish
browsers are walking slow today yeah so
we can see to asking for the a ID I
would say once in a one hour click on
submit and you can see it is printing a
JC page remember the page color which is
C on color and then see the request
request is still get alien even if you
are calling up page which is get which
is show alien the user you are that is
getting it because we're using
dispatcher so a client don't even know
which page is getting called that's the
beauty yeah but if you're using rewrite
then you have it will bind it will show
the page name okay so I will stick with
dispatcher Savage
but how do we pass this object with a
lien here so I want to pass this alien a
one object to JSP and the way you can do
that is by using the request object
because in forward you are sending
request object right so what if you can
simply add your data in the request
object it's something like you know
let's say if from us if your friend is
coming to your place let's say so if I'm
staying in India now so let's say one of
my friend is coming from u.s. to India
and if I want to order something from us
he can carry it right so he's not coming
to India just to give me the just to
give that thing to me but he's coming to
India for his own work but then I'm
asking him to take that thing for me
that's the same thing we can do here the
forward is sending the request object
right so we can put that data in to
request object and send it so I would
say request dot set attribute and I will
have a name so I would say I'm sending
the aid in data
I'm sending alien and the object is a
one so R equals dot standard view we are
sending alien which is a a one here and
in JSP you just need to fetch it
now you can write Java code here right
so to write Java code inside JSP we
simply use this this angular beckoned
percentage this is called as replayed
yeah so in JSP we have this we have
declaration tag we have scripted tag we
have different tags available but if you
want a java put inside this we can
simply use cryptic tag and I would say
I'm fetching the object of alien which
is a 1 here but how do you fetch it so
you simply say request dot get attribute
and you specify hey I want to fetch area
now if you remember in servlet in
subject we have set we have set the
attribute in JSP we are getting the
attribute with the name alien same thing
right and here we'll print the a1 object
oh not this way we'll say out dot
println I will say a1 okay I guess we
have to import the package
now this alien pack it is a class which
belongs to package model so you simply
say control space and that's the package
you can see import package comes
something like this this is how you
import packages in JSP not like normal
normal Java code
right import space and package name you
have to say input equal to because page
is an tag for you now and this becomes a
attribute okay we are getting some error
here because we have to type trusted
because again attribute will give you
object of object I want object of alien
so we just have type class indeed it
should work now right it should it
should print a data at least some data
right so let's restart the server and
let me just go back to my page here
refresh and I will enter the ETA which
is 1 0 1 I will say submit can see that
we've got our data we call it alien AI D
is equal to 1 0 1 name naveen and take
java but hold on this is that this is
study data i just not having read from
database so how do we connect with
database here so if you want to write we
database you just need to use Dowlais
alright because this is where you are
faking your faking this data you just
you don't need to create a dummy data
you want to fetch it from database so
let's remove this or maybe you can just
have it there that's fine what I want is
I want to a database code here now to
work with database we need to follow
certain steps right the first time you
have to input the package so I will go
here I will say import Java dot SQL dot
star that's how we import the package
and then the next step is you have to
get the connection object now I would
say I would simply create a connection
object outside the methyl or let's let's
do that inside just just for time being
I would say try catch because it might
generate error so I will say try catch
and then here we'll write although
statement so we'll say first the first
step is we have to say class dot for
name and here we have to mention comm
dot mask yacht JDBC driver yeah so this
is how you load your driver
so for mascot we have this string for
what I can't we have a different string
from post-mission different string so we
have to just go to google and search for
the driver name for different different
drivers different different tip DBMS
that's the first step we have we caught
your closet for name next is you have to
get a connection object so I will say
connection go on equal to now cache is
the interface and the way you can get
object of it will by saying driver
manager dot get connection
and here we have to pass three
parameters so in this case I might pass
three parameters the first one is the
URL the second one is the username and
that is password so password is root and
the username is also dude from SQL for
my machine and the URL is JDBC colon
mask ul colon double slash localhost
colon 3 3 0 6 / database name is Naveen
I know it's a big string right but then
this is called as URL which is which is
used to connect to data database so JDBC
colon masculine double slash localhost
colon 3 3 0 6 class Naveen now once we
have done with the connection object we
need to create statement object because
let's say if you want to call someone
you you create the condition first you
dial the number you connect and then you
think what to say and then you say right
so that thinking is statement right so
this kind of statement object I will say
statement s T equal to corn dot 3h
statement now you are saying you are you
are you will be saying something and how
to say so you will say st dot execute
query and you will fire the query here
then what's the quality for us it is
select star from alien that's the query
here but then this query is not complete
because we have to specify the ID as
well right because I don't want all data
I want only one so it's say where a ID
is equal to plus I'll mention a ID
symbol and then this execute query will
return you the object of a or not this
will not return object of alien right it
will return the object of result set
because statement object returns the
object of result set so I would say
result set RS equal to so isn't such an
interface so the moment you fire a query
it will not give you normal data right
it will give you a table structure and
that will be stored inside result set
and now flow is all set you can say so
we so we have to traverse between
different rows right so if you get five
rows how do you specify which row to
pick up and that's how you that's why we
use artist dot next so allah's' dot next
is basically to shift your pointer
between different rules and we are not
even sure if you have
next drawer and that's why we'll say if
so that we can avoid the exceptions if
you have an extra because next will also
give you a written it will return
boolean value if you have a rule if you
have a row then what we'll do is we'll
fetch one with value and how do you
fetch so we have so we will fetch any we
will assign to the alien object well say
a dot set a ID now this data is coming
from this website so we say others
thought get int the first problem is a
ID so we have to which the column name
so when I say get int you have to
mention the column name let's say a dot
set a name I will say are they start get
string because it in a string format I
would say this is a name you can also
use Paulo numbers if you want one two
three or you can use column names so
together safe side always use column
name it is safe right
you know what columns you are fetching
you don't have to remember these
sequence of columns and once we got it
that's it we don't even need to specify
the static value look at it I will be
coming to database now these are the
steps or one more important step you
have to close it but that's fine you can
do it in your code and after doing all
this thing like this twenty five it is
working I will right click here I will
say one I also go back and refresh and
this will say in the nine I will say
submit you can see we got nine media and
hardware if I say five submit you can
see we got five Renee and what I call if
I say one you can say we got Naveen Java
so it's working right so we have done
with maven JDBC servlet and JSP in one
code so this is how it works awesome
right again this video is not to not
fall bigness this was for people who
have already done JSP servlet and just
they want to revise it or if you just
want to see this stuff you know some
people have the curiosity war of how I
mean what exactly it is you know so
let's say you are running code job when
someone says hey you need to learn
savage a speed future and they're not
sure what they are what they are going
to learn so this video will be helpful
for that so as I mentioned in the as I
mentioned out here so it's that awesome
now one stick once we once you come once
you watch the video just write the
description
well you have a we have a well you have
a link so I have uploaded this project
on github so you will find the naked
script in the description area and you
can add your own code now
so assignment for you after this after
this after wall after doing this port on
your machine is let's say I also want to
create a new alien because I'm just
fetching an alien right what if I want
to create a new alien so in this I have
one to the one common Java right let's
say if I want to have one but once your
to let's say Radhika and some technology
maybe let's say Python again so in that
case you need to create a alien and when
you specify the data so you have to kill
a page where you will it will ask you
for three values when you click on
submit it will go to a controller and
controller will use a dowel layer to
save the alien right get a new method
called a civilian here and write the
same steps and save it in the the thing
in fact the moment I will when I get
some time I will I will upload that as
well so you can check the description
and you will check the link it may be or
may not be available when you when you
check this video when you check the link
okay so that's it I hope you enjoyed the
entire session to let me just go for a
quick recap what we have done till now
so first you have a next page where you
are asking for the a ID when you click
on submit request goes to the servlet
and this is a way to solve it you create
a class and exchange with session you
solve it you have a do get method here
yeah and then in Duquette you are
fetching the a ID which is coming from
client you are using add a layer to
fetch data and from tau you are saying
get alien by passing that a ID and the
same data you are assigning to a one oh
this is one more thing we can do here
now if you if you don't want use
equities patcher you can also use
redirect so the way you do that is by
saying response
dots and redirect and you can specify
the name which is show alien dot JSP
so we can specify this as well but the
thing is if you if you're using this one
what will happen is you cannot reuse the
quest object because a client will send
a new request when I say client I'm
talking about browser here so in total
you're sending to request one to
controller and second to the JSP as well
so in we taiked Europe response goes to
the client again and from client it goes
to the shoulder and show a lien so it is
a new request object so this will not
work so this request will not work in
that case you have to use HTTP session
so you have to work with session
management so we have cookies we have
web URL rewriting or you can also use a
HTTP session such a is the best thing I
feel sorry say session a session equal
to and the way you can get the hold of
session is by saying request dot get
session and now you have to set the
attribute in session
not in request object so I will say
session dot set attribute the same thing
alien and a1 you are passing a1 so
nothing changed the only thing is
instead of using request object using
session object now because it doesn't
matter how many requests you sent to the
server now this session will be
maintained and in show alien instead of
fetching from request object you have to
use such an object cool let's run this
port let's verify it is working I would
say don't ask or not let's do the server
that will be enough let's go back to the
page and refresh let's enter 1 again I
will say submit now look at the look at
the URL you can see now your colleagues
show is show area not a JSP in the
earlier case it was get alien because
since we are using Twitter act but it is
changing the URL as well so as a client
now I know that I am I got we like to do
a different URL that's the beauty about
sense we direct yeah so that's how you
use session object so that's it this is
what we have done in this session so we
will find the link it is description
area where you will find the code on
github and if you like this video click
