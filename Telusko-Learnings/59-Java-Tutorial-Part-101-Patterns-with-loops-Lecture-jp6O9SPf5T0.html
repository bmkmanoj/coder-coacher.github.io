patterns she will talk about different
languages you have C you have C++ you
have Java you know when you learn these
languages the one thing which comes
constantly is something one has patterns
now say we talk about this pattern you
know that suppose you have lots of star
you you know you if you want to put in
this you can do this if you if you know
C language or if you know Java language
you can print each of this line using a
statement called as system dot out dot
print you know a very light system that
altered print which star star star star
it will print a one line then you have
to again bring this star star star then
you have target in this star star star
you know if I want to print one star at
a time that means I have a statement a
my its system dot out dot print in which
only one star is now now pressure has up
to it see what do they do you can write
one statement for this star you can
write this again statement for this
target is not written for Vista for for
this then you have to write a println
line well look if you have to write
print a line because you want to come on
the next line so here when you again
print or get a free ride free to paint
this style you have to paint this one
you have to bring this one you have to
bring this one you know you are doing
the same thing repeatedly so what we can
do we can apply some or loops here now
pusher is how say here we are we are
doing two things first we are printing
each star second after every 4 star I am
coming on with a new line after every 4
star I am coming on the new line that
means I am doing two things repeatedly
one is printing stop second coming on
the new line after four star you know
you can do this by using loops mauka
showers up see before starting with
loops we never talk about you know you
know you have different
don't you have I love you have for hope
you have do I do the best loop when you
when you when you know the number of
number of things you want to print or
number of iterations so you should go
for for loop so when you know the
starting point when you know the ending
point you should always go for for loops
so here we required for you to do two
things one thing for one photo for one
thing second fondue for second second
thing now before i with this you require
to enables one for first for the second
for a second for them so let suppose you
have something called as Ocampo you have
column counter so to count the number of
those let suppose my variable is i to
count the number of columns my variable
is j so what we can do is we can write
up cool it's for your eye starts with
one eye ends 1 2 3 4 that means should
end at 4 then it's i plus plus now if
you concentrate in each row you have to
paint for 4 stars
that means to plate a star we require a
second for you so we have J equal to 1 J
less than equal to 4 and J plus plus the
4 because we have graphic print 4 stars
then you have what you have to do we
have to like a statement colorized
system dot out dot print mind you it
will be only plain then here my stuff
ready with super close and crystals what
we will do is we will print this problem
in line voice let suppose your eyes 1 J
is 1 it will be start J's 2 star J
Street starmon J is for 240 Finch I
guess foolish for stop but when J
becomes 5 it will check is it considered
satisfying it's false that means it will
not read it will come out in loop I
agreement your eye by two if an increase
implementing my no that means I'm at now
Adam second row that means I have to
come on new line so after every your
ending of inner clause he not nope you
have to you have to bring a new line so
it's system dot out dot print you can go
for it this way print slash tend to come
a new line you know you can use flashing
because fashion space you have to come
on new line the second way what you can
do is jog the visor function wanna has
bring telling using this println you can
directly come on your life without
printing anything so once you came here
you have to print you have to print new
life so when you say a prick Ln it will
die if you come to the new line and this
is your enormous normal a loop by using
this you can print this pattern so it's
dummies let's change the question let us
just make a new pattern in this way this
turn out to print or stars in triangle
format if your concept it on this
pattern you have photos so now it should
be we are we start with I the end at
four but the question is where my other
one is one I have to print only watched
on my otherwise - I have to bring to
star when I am I - nervously I have to
blink three star when I'm on my own I
want to create four star that means the
number of columns is depend upon the
number of rows so what I can do is if my
number of columns is depend upon my
number of rows if I write here I now it
will print this in this way when my eye
is one it will check
J is one yes what is less than equal to
one
yes it will print when my J becomes 2 is
mine still one so it will not it will
not go ahead it will comes to the new
line because this is how you can do this
now let's talk about this one
then suppose if you if you again have
this pattern
now if you have this something in this
way this time if I if if I have to play
this I get after idea for as my last
question but what if if I have to do if
I do not want to bring this this four
stars
I want to pinch as the bodice so see I
have four rows
so I one to four I have four volumes so
J 1 to 4 but the thing is I don't want
to play when my values are here so what
I have to do say if you concentrate on
this this question this is your first
row second row third row fourth row
first column second column third column
fourth column see if my eye is what I
have to drink if my eye is for I have to
print if my J is one I have to print if
my J is food I have to breathe other
than this I do not have to finish if my
eye is not if my eyes one ought to blink
if my J ice for I have to breathe with
my eye
J is one I have to break if IJ is full
have to print other than this I don't
have to print that means I have to check
before printing so here I have to check
first
whenever worth checking in programming
language in his big so if this you have
to do this if not you have to do
something else so if this want to check
if your eye is equal to equal to 4 or
his your eye is equal to equal to 4 or
this is your J is equal to equal to 1 or
is your J is equal to equal to 4 if any
of this condition matches you have to
print either n talked about this all
conditioning versus this way if you have
two things one is true second is false
this come toe comes out to be true we
did we talk about all that means in both
the thing if you have any one true that
means it will give our true conditions
now if I get a true condition what
happen you have to bring
his as no Phoenix emergency system dot
out dot print harder to do I have to
play stuff but now eleven this your eyes
one J is 1 is equal to one
yes it will bring star so this choice
winter when your eyes one it will treat
all the styles but when your eye becomes
two J becomes funny here here it will
check yes J is equal to 1 I do bring but
when your eye becomes 2 and J becomes 2
it will not print but again when your J
becomes 4 I becomes 2 it will print but
what about this face
I have not been at this face that means
when I'm not printing the stars have to
bring the spaces so it is else 5 I have
to write it's SOP just a novel space and
as usual after this inner dog I have to
say system dot out dot println so if you
do this code you will get a box-like
structure so that means doing working
with patterns are damn easy but the only
thing is you have to concentrate on the
battle you have to judge the number of
those you have to judge the number of
columns so using loops using his
conditions you can draw any damn pattern
if it is logical if you get a logical
patterns there is no use of working on
it
the only condition you have is print
print print you know you can do you can
solve any patterns by your own so let me
give you a question so you can do our
backs on it let us suppose you have
something of this
okay you can try it out by your over
this is your homework tonight
it's again a damn easy you have number
of those are numbers columns you have to
bring something what is it doing
yourself that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
