this tutorial we'll talk about how to
swap two numbers now to swap this to two
numbers let's take our two two numbers
here we'll say int a equal to five and
in B equal to four now what I mean by
swap is after this code when I say print
the value of a : so it should print the
value of a that should be four and then
when I print the value of B the value of
B should be five so what I want the
output has four and five now for that
let's see how to assign how to swap so
what we'll do is we'll assign the value
of a B to a that means a equal to B and
we assign the value of B a value of A to
B that means the value of B will come to
a and the value of a will come to be
let's try to run this let's see what's
the output and you found this code you
will see the output should be staying
some time come on
so by expecting the output as five and
four right but unfortunately the output
is four and four it's because when you
assign the value of B to a now a becomes
four right and here your value of a is
already four that means your B again
becomes four and that's why you're
getting output as for what I want when
you assign the value of B to a there
should be some variable which is hold
this value five so that in future we can
assign by the next step we can assign
the value of this value five to be for
that we require something called as a
temporary variable so we'll say this
variable as temp now now before
assigning the value of B to a we'll
assign that value of a to a variable
color stamp and then once you got the
value of a into time you can assign the
value of B into a and then the value of
P will be temp
and using this you can swap two numbers
let us see how it works so we have a
temp variable which is initially it is
blank and we are signing a value of a
that means your times
stem becomes it's five here your a
becomes the value of B which is four and
your B which comes from value temp so
your B becomes five and yes we have
served three numbers let's run this code
they are put we expecting is four and
five and the output is four and five but
if you focus on this code the amount of
memory we should be using is only four
bytes and four bytes which means it
comes to be sixteen eight bytes right
but unfortunately we are creating one
more variable just for the swapping that
means we are wasting extra memory right
and to save this memory instead of going
for the third variable we'll use will
use some other logic now one of the
logic we have to implement is a straight
for formula and they formalize this it's
a equal to a plus B then a equal to B
equal to a minus B and then a equal to a
minus B which means let's let's run this
code let us see how it works
so let's run this code first and the
output is four and five esters able to
swap it right again whoever with this
example they might be knowing what I'm
talking about but let's say how it works
first
so initially a value of a is five and B
is four which means when you say the new
value for a will be nine right and then
here your value of a is 9 now and your
value of B is still four that means it's
B equal to a which is nine minus four
and B becomes five in this code your a
value is nine and B value is five so
your a value will become four and you
can see we have swept the number now if
you if you can see here we are not
wasting extra any variable and as the
advantage of using this law
okay but you think it's it's enough or
it's sufficient to be a story we are
just able to reduce the number of bytes
by four but if we can focus here the the
binary conversion of 5 is 1 0 1 and the
binary conversion of four as 1 double
zero which means to represent this
number five and four we require only
three bits but during the operation your
value of I becomes so a becomes nine
which comes out to be the binary format
of nine is one double 0 1 that means in
the in the course of operation your
result some will go from 3 bits to 4
bits now let's see how to reduce or how
to how to save that one bit again you
will say what's a big deal when you
waste one bit
your system has lots of software it uses
medieval process multiple systems with
multiple threads each thread work with
multiple variables and if you waste one
bit with one variable you might waste
our MB with one software right so you
can see if you can it's basic possible
every time it possible just reduce the
number of bits not to implement that
logic what we'll do is instead of this a
plus sign here we'll use a caret sign
not exactly the scale it means is this
Garrett means this sign carrot is this
sign means it is a XOR operation not
exactly XOR is exhausting simply means
if you have a value which is 1 and 1 the
output expecting is 0 that means if both
the values are same it will be 0 if both
the values are different like 1 is 1 is
1 and second is with 0 the result will
be 1 that means if both are same 0 if
both are different it's 1 how about 0
and 0 again they are same so output and
the output should be 0 how about 0 and 1
since they are different numbers the
output will be 1
this is how exhibition works okay so
let's remember this logic off let me
just cut this code and it's cut and
paste so this is the logic for EXO okay
understand let us implement this logic
here so it is a a is 1 0 1 so let me
write here it is 1 0 1 and let X on this
X or with a value of B which is 1 double
0 so it is 1 double 0 and the output
will be so first value is 1 and 1 so the
output will be 0 second is 0 and 0 the
output will be 0 again and last is 1 and
0 the output will be 1 because since
they are both are different so it will
be 1 let's go here now so your value of
a is the new value is 0 comma 0 0 0 1
this should be exhort with the value of
B which is still 1 double 0 by few swap
if you if you apply operation here it
will become since we have 0 &amp;amp; 1 it will
be 1 next will be 0 and next will be 0
or next will be sorry last will be 1
because it is 1 &amp;amp; 0 so it will be 1 and
let us go for last one so so it is a
which is now 0 0 1 X sort where the new
value of B which is 1 0 1 and if you
write here 1 0 1 let's swap this so it
is 0 &amp;amp; 1 it should be should be one next
is 0 &amp;amp; 0 second digit is 0 and last is 1
&amp;amp; 1 it is again 0 now if you see this
number which is B this value is 5 and
this value here it's 4 that means we
have to
fact to numbers without even wasting one
bit and the advantage of using this
excel optician so as a good program more
efficient programmer you have to think
how can we use the number of bits
required for the code so this is how you
can swap two numbers so first logic was
using a temp variable second was using a
plus/minus symbol and third one is using
caret symbol so thanks for watching and
