talk about something called as it's n
capsulation okay so we have a topic
called as encapsulation now question is
what does encapsulation means right so
thinking about it let's suppose you have
a class again we'll go for a Class A
Okay and okay now in this class we know
something that we have what object knows
is variable right what object does is
methods so we'll focus now only on
variables so we have a variable paint I
okay so I have a Class A and in Class A
I have method one less paint okay so a
variable is paint now let's suppose in
order in order to use this I what we'll
do is we'll create a plus and as usual
my class name will be main class okay
and in this main class I will be having
a main method so we'll say p sv n now in
this what we can do is we can just say
like a half object of a so obj equal to
new a simple right so we have our object
a now
now what will the tour is when i say
when i when i create this object obj it
will create a box as named as obj so if
we have in a box service obj in this box
I have a variable called as I and was
the value of I by default all the class
variables will have a value cottonseed
oh right but working for my fans want to
set the value as five okay so in this
case I will say obj dot I is equal to
five okay and now the value of this I
becomes 5 simple why so the value of I
becomes 5
the problem is what optic knows and what
object does these are defined by what
object knows is variable
objectives is methods ROI so whenever
you create any object your variable
should be linked with your object or
with your methods right so in order to
change the data of your variables you
should use methods here we are not using
any methods we are changing the value of
I without using any method so there
comes something else encapsulation it
says whenever you have an object in
order to change the variable values you
should use methods to set the value you
should use method to get D value should
use methods right and the first step to
do this you should define your variable
as private so if your variable is
private so you have private int I so if
your variable is private this will not
work so this will give you an error
which because private variables are only
accessible in the class it is not
accessible outside the class because we
have to depend class right we have plus
a and we have main clubs so from this
class you cannot access this I right so
this will give you an atom so this is
hello so how to solve it right so what
we can do is to implement this concept
we can use something well as getters and
setters so what it means will write a
method public void something call s site
so we have to use a keyword or set and
the variable which is the variable and
we have to say I since again we have
them camel casing rule whenever you
combine two different words we have to
set second words first whitter should be
capital so since it is only one
character its i/o so and method method
and in this we will pass a variable J
and what we'll do is we'll say i equal
to j so what I've done is I have created
a method called as set I I am getting a
value into G now how to call this will
remove this line now in order to set the
value of I what my choice will say
obj
set I and in blackish we will say bye
since it's in public method you can call
this public method and in the same class
you can use I right so value Phi is
coming from this to this point in jay
from jay is going to I so we have done
it right so our variable is private I
make sure I'm making sure my data is
hidden right it was go into hiding so
I'm specifying my variables as private
and I will use those variables with the
help of methods what if if I not bring
the value before I get even so for that
we have to use one more method it's
public void gate I okay and now when you
say get you have to return why you have
to return and when you say return you
have to change your return type from boy
to change because the type of data is
int and will stay written I and to call
this we will say system dot out dot
println
SOP sister daughter painter and in
blackish we'll say gate by simple right
so this is this is how you can implement
something called as encapsulation so
encapsulation your variables your
variable should be private
next with those video boys you should
have something called as getters and
setters how many it does it does number
of variable so if you have n number of
variables are four you require for
critters and positives all right
it depends why this sometimes you don't
have to set the value so in this case
you can miss your setups okay like
example if I have three variables so
rather theoretically it should be three
it doesn't these letters right but let's
suppose K value is addition of I and J
in that case you don't have to set the
value of K because we'll be adding value
of K plumb ing alright so this is how
you can implement something but as
encapsulation okay so further
demonstration will do in subsequent
tutorials thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
