draw this pattern right and as I
promised we'll be doing this code of
this pattern this in this example but
before that let me rearrange the value
of I and J the thing is this this type
of loop will work but you know I comes
before J so it sounds much better to
have I as the outer loop and J as the
inner loop right so it's a habit of all
the programmers to have I outside and J
inside but that doesn't matter actually
you can have anything inside anything
outside but it looked good so if you
have so let's make it in that way so
when you talk about outer loop we define
it with I when you say inner loop into
four if we do find it with J either way
both will work but you know it looks
better now what we'll do is I can you
feel in this will be getting the same
output now if you focus on this box so
let's imagine this is one I mean the
number for this is 1 this is 2 this is 3
this is 4 and we also will also give
number here so which is 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 3 &amp;amp; 4 so
imagine the value of I as a row counter
so it is counting counting the number of
rows and imagine J as the column counter
so this is your column counters because
in each row your column will go from 1
to 4 second row the column will go from
1 to 4 third row column will go for 1 to
4 fourth row column will go from 1 to 4
simple now I want to print star whenever
you have a value which is whenever you
have a low number which is 1 I want to
print star whenever you have a low value
which is 4 I want to print star whenever
you have a row 1 whenever you have a
column value as 1 I want to print our
whenever you have a column value as 4
that means whenever you want to print so
before printing me to check now when you
will say you want to check something
will you will be using a flight so if my
I value is equal to 1
or if my I value is equal to equal to O
is the equal to sign equal to equal to
four or my J 1 is equal to equal to 1 or
my J 1 is equal to equal to 4 that means
if I is 1 all eyes for J is 1 and this 1
and J is for in any of the case you want
to pinched are simple if you want this
you got approximately something the
problem is I am I am printing star
whenever you have anybody satisfy this
condition but what if it doesn't satisfy
the condition I want to print something
right I want to print this space here so
in the else part
what was that channel in the else part
will will print just a space okay and if
you run this now you got a box there so
got the idea so you want to print this
only if your I value is 1 I values for J
values 1 and J 1 is 4 otherwise you need
to print spaces so that's how you create
this type of pattern will be going for
some more patterns so if you if you have
more interesting patterns you can just
click on click on the link below which
will take you the patterns playlist I
don't want to include all the pattern
example in the programming tutorials so
that that's the time for watching and in
the next video we will talk about
something more obviously programming so
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
