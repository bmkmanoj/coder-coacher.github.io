in in Scala so it's very simple now so
let's say I want to define a method I
mean a function or a method in scholar
and a mass show so I can say def that's
the keyword we use to define a function
and I can mention a function name as
let's say show and so we just have to
say define function show and now we can
in fact we don't have to provide yeah we
can provide the brackets there and we
have to mention the equal to sign and we
can do whatever you want we can say
print Ln it will print to let's say hi
okay that's it
that's how you define a function the
only thing you'll remember is we use
equal to operator when you define a
function again if you have multiple
lines of code then we have to use that
curly brackets which we use in Java so
we have to okay with that so we have to
use sunday packets only when you have
more than one line but if you have only
one line you don't even need cut the
packets okay now how do we call the
method we can just very simple as we
have done in the in Java itself we can
simply say show and you can see we
should be getting the output here or
show you lots of time you know there is
something there's there is some bug in
the system you know it takes lots of
time to iterate anywhere so you can see
we got the output as high so we can
define the function by using a death
keyboard and we can specify show we have
to use a equal to symbol and we can
write all our statements here now if you
have only one statement you don't have
to even mention the tangi package we can
mention equal to println and now even
even now it will work you can if you can
see we got the output which is high
right so that's how we can define a
function now what else
oh now let's say let's go back to Java
let me see what what else we can do here
so let's say I want to I have a main
main class here I will say this is a
class let's name this as a demo class
which has a main function and from this
main function I want to create two
student object I will say student
one equal to new student I I want to
pass some values here okay let me pass
one comma naveen comma let's say this is
just 80 okay that's one let me just copy
this and this is s2 and this is second
and this is Rahul and let's say this is
19 so what I want to do now is I want to
perform an operation here which is which
will compare these two objects so if I
say if I if I try to print if I try to
print s1 okay if I try to print s1 dot
greater I mean is greater that's how we
do it right so we can see is greater and
we can pass s2 so now in normal in in
Java normally we use methods right so
I'm going to compare two objects we
always use a function I mean a method
like is greater so if it is greater than
it will return true otherwise it will
return false but unfortunately I don't
have any method called as is greater so
I'm reading that method here inside my
inside my student class which we'll have
inside this inside this method will will
return a boolean value and will return
now how do we compare this two we can
simply say this roll number I mean this
marks how will you compare this Gators
we'll simply use Mouse so if this marks
is greater than s 2 dot marks let's say
I want to sort all the students based on
their marks so we can we use this with
week we can use this method which is
greater and if you can run this code I
mean not this one if you want if you run
this code you can see we are getting the
output as false because this is not
greater right and if I replace this if I
change this value to 99
and if you don't this again you can see
regard true that miss we can compare two
objects with the help of a method but
how do we do that in Scala
so in Scala what what we can do is
Skylar supports operator overloading
what it means is I can compare two
objects I can say this is h2 and this is
student and you can see the object Rahul
got the values which is one Rahul I mean
I will remove this stuff that means the
object which we'll be getting is one
Naveen 90 the second object I will say -
Rahul and let's say 80 88 okay and you
can see we got the we got two objects
one is 90 and when is 88 and how do we
compare here so we don't use I mean we
can use methods but we can also use
something else what is that something
else I can say s 1 greater than s2 so we
can actually use a greater than symbol
here but hold on before using that we
have to define that method here so we
can say def we can define this function
I mean this this method which is all
function which is greater than sign and
we can pass a parameter which is s2
because this is actually s1 dot this is
the function name and we are specifying
the s2 as a parameter again we have done
that earlier right with the help of a
plus operator
and now we can define a function it
returns you a boolean value so I can say
this is boolean now it is based on what
site is return marks is greater than so
marks is greater than Watch will compare
us to dot marks that's it okay there is
something wrong here
it returned s2
it's not working here what's the issue I
missed something I guess so we have oh
we have to mention the type of s2 right
so s2 is of type student my mistake so
anyway define as two we have to mention
the type right and you can see we are
getting the answer which is true because
s 1 is greater than s2 because of their
marks but if I change the value if I
change this to 98 and you can see we got
the God false hold on it is not yet
where is false come on come on come on I
want false eyes output yeah you can see
the God false so we can so in in Scala
we can which it supports func it
supports functional I mean function
overloading we can also use the
operators as the function name so yeah
that's it about that's it in this video
in this in the next video we'll talk
about something else oh thank you so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
