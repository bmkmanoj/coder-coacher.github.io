ready from Toys for landings and in this
video we'll talk about packet tracer now
packet tracer is a software designed by
Cisco alright so basically it's a
simulation software so let's say if you
want to design a network and if you want
to also test it so now how many we can
design the network on the paper right
but on paper we cannot test it so what
we can do is we can use a packet to the
software where you can actually designer
design the network and you can also test
it so you can see you can see all the
simulations going enough you can send a
packet from one machine to another
machine and then the packet will go in a
simulated way you can actually see the
animation of it I think it feels better
you know it feels better but that's not
the that's not the main reason why he
equated to created package so just to
make you feel better so why we have
packet tracer is we can create a network
and we can Salter test it and we will
also see where something is going wrong
so let's say if you are sending a packet
from one machine to another machine and
if that is going from from multiple
networks and if something goes wrong you
would actually see on which I mean on
which router you are getting you are
getting your packet back right so you
can do all those things in packet tracer
now this syllabus is designed so the
entire playlist is designed from the BSC
iit syllabus so baat syllabus where you
have approximately we have eight videos
in this and we'll be starting with the
static configuration that will go for
dynamic quantification of the protocols
where we will be using our IP and OSPF
then we'll talk about DNS server how to
configure DNS we'll see how to configure
DHCP server how to auto configure telnet
so we have all this thing in the
playlist it's just that those videos
were created
way before from this video and that's
why if you see the quality of this video
this is much better but those videos
don't have that much of quality but then
it is you will you can use it for a bit
understanding so you've been learning
all these things in the entire playlist
software watching this video do watch
that video as well to understand how
packages of works but to give it an
introduction how what is packet tracer
so again packet tracer is a simulation
software regulate can design the network
it is created by Cisco okay so if you
can see
the tracer will look like a normal IDE
which we use where you have all the
components you can drag and drop all the
components which you need you can drag
and drop the computers you can drag
without those and you can actually
create the entire network okay
so you can so you can you use all this
thing to implement all the concepts you
have in your networking subject and it
will work and you will not learn
networking in a theory way but in a
practical way so that's how we have this
playlist so if you enjoyed the playlist
just click on the like button for each
and every video and if you have any
questions do come in so that if not if
I'm not answering anyone else can answer
that so that's it I hope you will like
the entire series and that's it thank
you so much for watching and do
