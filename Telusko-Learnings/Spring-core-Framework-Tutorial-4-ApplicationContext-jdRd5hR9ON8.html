about mavin so we have created a project
or the power structure using mavin in
which I have mentioned a palm file in
which we are mentioning the dependency
for spring and then we are we have we've
got this app file now what we'll be
doing is we'll be not using this app dot
Java so I hope you have seen my theory
you have seen my video which is spring
theory which is the first video of this
playlist and that we have talked about
why we wire spring so just to give a
quick recap why we require spring
framework so spring provide multiple
features so spring we can use spring
with web we can use PU spring for a
dependency injection so what is
basically dependency injection is so
let's say you want to create a car in
that card you have lots of parts you
have tire you have engine so instead of
creating so so instead of creating
everything by yourself at runtime what
you can do is whatever dependency you
need you can ask someone else to give
you those dependencies so that in future
if you exchange your dependencies you
don't have to change your code now what
what what I mean by all this thing you
will understand when I start with the
code so initially it will you will find
it very difficult or maybe confusing
maybe I am NOT maybe a I was not able to
explain clearly for clear to you how
what is magic what is active spring is
but I'm sure if you if you see some of
the videos in you know in the further
tutorials ie you will get some idea
about it start creating applications
start working on it and you will get the
clear idea I will also suggest you to
read a book of spring with this tutorial
so that this video will give you the
basic idea of spring not the detail or
what you say in detail description so
I'm just teaching you spring just to
make sure that you can build an
application but to understand this
concept you know purely you have to read
some book I will suggest there is a book
from rod Johnson a soft copy of this but
or you can find it on spraying dot IO
which is the official website of spring
which is amazing book noida but you know
to buy any hardcopy book from
maybe online stores you can just use
that reference so let me split this top
let me start with the actual work okay
just be with me you will get the idea
why why we have to use brain so let's
start with building a car so what I will
do is in my tedisco package let me
create a new class okay and is in your
class
oh yeah I'm looking up okay so file and
I'm going to class here right package
okay new other and I need a class
okay and package will become dot lovin
telesco and the class they will be like
say I want to build a car okay and
finish
now just to build this card what we need
is this card will have some features
let's say will say this with this car we
can drive this car yeah and this will
say okay I might use some hindi words
here because I love this language Hindi
so what I will do is just dry I will say
Childre he hey it's implements its
droids it's working so or child oh hai
has to be sound cheesy so now let's open
my app can you say this thon somewhere
what's wrong with my package I can't see
car you I can see you
inhalation on jump it's okay you know
that part okay so in that app what we
can do is we could be afraid to create
object of that car so we say God God
equal to new car so this car is the
class name and this car here this is the
what you say a difference and we can
simply say car dot right simple and let
me just run this so if I run this app so
I can see it will show me the output
children that means it's working right
so you can see it says bribe and it says
children let me do some modification Oh
the problem here is when I talk about
car let's say in future I don't want to
use a car I want to use maybe bike or
maybe I want to use I don't know what
maybe some other other other vehicle so
the problem is if I change if I make a
different class here let me let me
create one more class and we'll name
this class as bike okay the problem is
in this bike also going to be having a
method Paris public void we don't fly be
right by right so let me use light and
French so it I will print here again if
Varga dies thanks running hey so in that
in the car class I have child raha hai
and in bike we have hog raha so I just
want to yeah doesn't matter and then
just to make it similar will drive a
bike this time no I know it's we should
drive it but you know just to judge us
for the same what you say for example
will make it drive maybe la bike lover
will hit me up to this video but it's
okay yeah so what I want so in future
you find a change so I have to change
both wire to change this also I have to
say this is bike and I have to change
this to bike and then we can say well
not say this is car we'll say this is
just to make it simple obviously this is
obj okay and okay so we can say oh we
should I Drive and have knife I done
this I will get bar graph which is bike
gloves right the problem is if I update
my classes I have to change the source
code why I need to change the source
code I want to make it I want to make it
in I want to run it such a way that it
will not depend upon the class a guard
or class bike so this main function here
or this object should be independent of
this of this classes here now how to
remove this depend
and since so we have to use a concept of
dependency injection so before
implementing deeper dependency injection
let me remove this bike here so we have
two dependencies we have a dependency on
right side and we have dependency on
left side what I'm saying yeah left
right yeah so we have one dependency on
left and right so what we can do is I
know maybe let's let's create interface
so if I create our interface the
advantage will be both bike and car they
are vehicle right so the advantage will
be in this vehicle I will say a public
void dry which is just declared and
since we are defining our interface we
don't have to use public because by
default all the methods in interface are
public right and then we'll this will
say this car implements this car
implements vehicle and even this bike
implements Oh implements vehicle and
that's why I display okay just just to
make sure we we drive a vehicle and then
it's not bike what what if if I keep it
as vehicle now the advantage is even if
I want to change from bike to card I
have to change only the right part which
is from God from bike to car or from car
to buy it so we have to change only one
thing but why to change that one thing
also we want to make it in such a way
that we don't have to change that side
part and just to do that what we need is
we have to use way to use Spring
Framework so what we'll do is we'll
we'll ask
we'll say I don't want to say new car I
want to say get me up be simple get me a
beam and that beam should be a vehicle
doesn't matter which vehicle is
available I want a vehicle so let's say
I want to go to a college or I want to
go to office I will say give me a
vehicle that's it so if I have a car
available I will get a car if I have a
bike available I will get a bike so I
will say get be in vehicle but hold on
what is get beam now campaign is a
method which belongs to we can we can
you can use bed get beam from two
interfaces
the first interface you can use is built
factory and the second interface you can
use is application context so either you
can use bin Factory or you can use
application context both this belongs to
Spring Framework so if you want to use
bin factory you have to input a package
and you can see the packages comp dot
Spring Framework dot beans don't factory
if I work with application context the
package is the package it's not working
it should be should work just because of
the error values so this application
context so it also belongs to what a
spinning framework now which is better
so if you're creating a small
application you can use bin factory but
if you are creating a enterprise level
application or web application you
should always go for application context
so application context is a superset of
in fact between so whatever features
provided by bin factory is also provided
by application context so why not
application context so in this
application will be using application
context and believe the object as fun
text itself will say next or neo now the
problem is application context is the
interface so to implement that we have
to use glass a glass spot class path XML
application context ok now if your
question is how will I remember all
those classes the problem is when when I
started learning Spring Framework so
even at that time I was not doing how to
what are the class name or interface
name is once you start making
applications you will get a habit of
remember in all these class names ok so
that's ok no initial you have to use
some book order for some book but after
having hands-on experience you can just
you know just type all these things and
this yeah so that's it and then we have
to say context dot get bean and then it
will give you vehicle but this a problem
this get mean will give you the object
so you can see we are getting an error
so it says cannot convert
from object to vehicle so Gedman will
give you object of object right so we
have to typecast earth to vehicle so we
have to say it will give you the object
of vehicle okay that's it it's working
so I think everything is perfect you are
asking application context to give you
the get beam of vehicle I think it
should work let's try a sensor on this
application it says illegal State
exception big factory not initialized or
already call refresh nor zero the
problem is whenever you work with
application context or whenever you work
with class path application XML
application context it says okay I will
give you the object of vehicle but tell
me what is this vehicle this is not a
class thing this is just a keyword right
how would I know which class instance
you want because vehicle itself is
interface become an you can only create
instance of a class right and that is
your bike or car so you have to define
it somewhere you have to mention
whenever I asked for a vehicle I need a
car instance so to do that we have to
create a XML file okay in an XML file
you can mention Oh which object you need
whenever you call a vehicle okay now how
to create a XML file
how to complete this whole application
that will say in the next part of the
video okay so thanks for watching and do
