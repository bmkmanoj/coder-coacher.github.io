create a module so what we can do is we
can simply right click on your project
and you're getting an option of putting
a new module and once you create a new
module of course by specifying a name
that the wave I have done here
you can see I have two modules here one
is there is code out main and the other
one is the Cisco dot util in the first
module so in fact in every module we'll
be having your SRC folder and in the
first module you have your package as
there is got mean it's not composite to
have the same name same package name as
the module name but then in this example
I'm going for that and then you have a
class runner now that is the class where
I'm performing some act of performing an
operation where I'm printing hello
that's it but then I just don't want to
print hello I want to add two numbers
now the way you can do that is by is by
writing the code here itself odd you can
take help of some other class maybe I
want to take help of a calculator class
I would say calculus C equal to new
calculator okay so a new calc ooh
calculator and then once I got this
object I can add those two values but
then unfortunately you can see we have a
class defined here if you remember in
the first video we have hidden splash
but then that is a different package I
want to have that in my in my module and
but particularly I want that in this is
a in this Java and then is quote util
module so we already have our calculator
here right so what we do is we'll simply
create a capital class here in this I
will right click here I will say new a
Java class I have an in this class as
calculator right calculator and instead
of typing the code by ourselves we have
already done that right so let's copy
this code and you can see this
calculator needs another class for this
helper now first of all let me paste it
here
oh I guess I've copied is the wrong
thing okay so you can see in this
calculator first of all I want to move
this guy on a particular package I will
say package there is code dot util
right normally we put our classes into
the package so let's say this calculator
is there in Java
neutral package and I will simply moved
it to that particular package and you
can see we have done that so in this you
till now we have a package called as the
disco dot util in this module we have a
package cartridge called util and we
have a calculator but then unfortunate
Calgary is not working of course it will
not work because we have a class here
which is ad helper
now again you might be saying this
structure not properly formatted now
it's done ok see we want an object of AD
helper so for that we need to have a
plus vs ad helper I will do the same
package I mean it's not in the same
package but in say module and I will
name this class as ad helper so we can
create multiple modules and everyone who
can have different classes the only
thing is I want to move this class to a
different package I will say package
that is called dot util dot internal so
we can have a different package name
right so we can have our plasma in
different packages and as the name
defined by this package it also means
that they are come in this class need to
be internal we don't want anyone else to
use this + so Java dot util this one
module mat is under module I want this
class add helper to be a part only of
this module can we do that let's try so
first of all having a biggest class and
this class need to have some methods
with that ok I will I will not type
everything by myself I have already done
that here so I will copy this code and
put that in a new helper class ok done
and now we can actually go and see so
everything is working you can see we got
ad helper you can see we called and in
the puppet then you have to input the
package for that I will simply say
control space and import now as you can
see calculator and internal the both I
mean the calculator and an added per
belongs to say module which is 12 or
what you tell and this mean below I mean
the day and Rona belongs to another
module now can I use calculus you can
see is not working oh that's a problem
now it is not working how can you use
how can we use this calculator will
enrich in another module so we are
trying to line 2
in module zero okay now that's our
challenge here how can we link this true
so let's try to understand how can we do
that now to use another module in your
parent module what you do is you have to
use this module module
- info dot Java file in this you have to
mention hey so you are you're informing
your a project hey I'm expecting so I
require a module here which with a name
that is co dot util so if you want it if
you want to make it work you need to you
need to have this are going to have this
module real okay so we're just showing
an error we can fix that
I will not define a module not found
that's that's weird
we have a module here okay so to make it
work I guess first of all we have to
build this module and the way you can do
that so again different different IDE
have a different way of working
so I guess unless you have to first
build the modules so that once you've
got once you build it it should be
available here you can see that it is
available now in the output folder and I
guess it will be available now oh it's
not working what's wrong do we to do
something here oh you can see that we
don't have a module at it for class here
of my bad in fact they should we need to
have that file right so let's get that
file and so now we are defining a module
okay will it work now so if I have done
everything now I have made my Java class
let's build it once again since we made
some changes I will say build and it's
it is building is it is it done building
it okay so it should work now I don't
know why it's not working
okay so module is not in a dependency
yeah so now it is able to find the
module but it is not your dependency so
this is again specific to IntelliJ let's
add that you know dependency because it
is you have a different way of working
with the project structure if you are
doing it come online you don't have to
do that dependency part but then you
don't you just have to make sure that
whatever modules you are creating the
way we have the I was facing is shown
here and this is the way normally show
you know
so if you're facing issue you have to
make sure that you have module - in
photo Java because that's what makes
your normal fold as a module and you can
see that your are able this you are able
to get this module and perfect
everything is working you can see the
got of a module we are saying hey to
work with this module you need a util
module and if I go back to runner oh we
are still not able to get the calculator
that's weird because this main needs you
tell and they are done that and still
the cap it is not available now what if
I say all the packages in a module are
by default private and this this is the
beauty of modularity all the packages
are by default private so how can we you
how can you make it public now first of
all you don't make it public what you
simply do is you inform your module a
module this package which is Java
emitter is what you tell I want it to be
exported for all the other module to use
so you have to export so in this module
- info dot Java of a tech util package
or util module you have to inform your
module that I want to export so that's
why we have one more one more keyword
remember which is export so to say
exports and you have to mention the
package name the package name here
asterisk Oh dot can you score dot util
that's the package name we are trying to
export okay so that's the beauty so you
if you want to export one to the package
you can mention that so you can simply
export that package and once you make
the changes build your module once again
and now if you go back to the Runner and
let's import the package and you can see
that we are getting it it's so easy now
you are able to use this package because
we have done we have done this code
which is export but can I use helper
let's try to paid object off add helper
I know it is internal but then can we
use it the moment I do that you can see
I said I'd help oh and then maybe help
and if I give a semicolon you can see we
are getting error here itself it says
the mall
Denis Parvati O'Toole does not export a
package called as the disco dot util dot
internal and that's why you are not able
to do that so if you want to export that
as well then mention that so mention
here exports that is co dot util dot
internal then only it will work ok
that's how yeah that's how you use it so
if you don't want to export one package
you can simply skip it so by default all
the packages are unique about how the
all the packages are private and if you
want to export a particular package you
have to mention that in your module so
we have seen two keywords here one is
requires and the second one is export in
modules so the in requires you mentioned
so if one particular module needs
another module we say requires your
current module want to export the
packages to so that someone else can use
it you have to use export in fact if you
have some other module you can also
mention hey this particular module
requires maybe some other module you
want maybe Java dot SQL module you can
do that so John word or SQL is a module
or is a package it's a module basically
so you are trying to use a module maybe
you want to have something else you want
also want to have Java dot movie what
else we can he was maybe cool but let's
say you're building upon application
just mention Java dot Java it's just
that it is deprecated and that's why it
is you are getting single line there
okay so you can see we are saying we
need two modules one is SQL and one is
pole bar so you can mention whatever
module you need and if you want to
export a particular package from your
module you can simply use export the
point remember here is by default all
the modules are all the packages are
private in the module and if you want to
export a particular Mac package you just
have to say exports and that's the
beauty about modularity you have a
control in your hand right and if you do
if you do if you're skipping some
equipping some modules let's say this
module export this class is and if you
miss something and if you make a mistake
it you will get a deride compile them up
at one time at least so yeah that's how
you you you work with multiple modules I
hope you are enjoying
on Java 9 if you're enjoying it do click
on the like button and do let me know
your it is in the comment section I do I
will read your comments and I will try
to make modifications and if other
videos so that's it thanks so much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
