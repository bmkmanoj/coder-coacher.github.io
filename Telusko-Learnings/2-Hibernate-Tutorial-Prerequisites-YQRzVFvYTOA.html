place for learning and in this video we
talk about pretty quizzes for hibernate
so you have started with me - I tried
you have seen one or two videos so we
have talked about the interruption we
have talked about how it works but let's
say if you want to start learning
hibernate now what next
so you should be knowing two things
before starting with hibernate first
obviously Java right so if you don't
know Java you use by it very difficult
to understand what I'm talking about
those objects stuff those oops concept
so kochava concepts is very important
for hibernate because we will be dealing
with poles which is object will be
dealing with inheritance will be dealing
with a for loop and all those stuff so
your cordial concept should be should be
good next thing you need is the SQL
constant because see what we are doing
in hypothesis we are working with data
right so we are spreading the data from
the application and they are storing
that data into database so so we have
the application here and then we'll be
having our database view so of course
you should be knowing this part as well
as the database part I mean not just
basic I mean let's say if you know about
select query if you know about table
column that's not enough you should also
know what is joining table means how do
we create Samara key foreign key how to
normalize our table and all those stuff
so you should be good with SQL plus it
should be good with your constant
because see and also median application
will be working with some classes and
one class educating object in the other
class the B we need to pass the object
from one class or the class need to
create the constructor we have to work
with interfaces right so on the Java
side you should be good with Co Java on
the database side should be good with
SQL how your database all those things
work now if you have good luck this
thing we need one more thing which is
the kind ability between these two you
should know how JDBC works so this are
some liquid JDBC yeah so this is some
liquid pre requisite for hibernate so if
you know the things you are going to go
for the for the tutorials but in case if
you don't know this stuff that's very
easy so in the description section you
can see some links one link is for Co
Java so again Adira there are normally
even very less videos for Co Java it is
only one
videos and you will learn goes out from
that you don't have to watch everything
for that you can watch till interfaith
right and for masks you'll also have
some videos and buildings in the
description you can watch those videos
are not everything till you know how to
create an American foreign key and then
for JDBC have one you have to watch two
videos the other again you will find
that in description area okay so the not
expiry quizzes for Hyper tonight I never
doing this you're good to go for
hibernate but in case if you know this
continue with the next video thank you
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
