okay that's good
okay so one is watching I guess that's
me
is it you okay
so I guess it's hush
hello hush and then we have for people
watching now that's good I guess
stripping is also good today there's no
lag okay so that's awesome six people
are watching that's good
okay so let's start this session
derivatives supposed to talk about how
to utilize the vacation to learn
something new okay so let's start in
this way vacation are meant to be
enjoyed
okay so if you are thinking that in this
vacation you will learn you will do some
hard work you will enjoy I would I would
suggest if you are getting a chance to
enjoy your vacation do that because the
whole year you spend your time you know
studying and doing all those stuff this
vacation it is time to enjoy okay so do
one thing plan a big vacation to go out
somewhere okay and enjoy your vacation
okay because the thing is if you don't
enjoy your vacation you have your in
your life you're missing those important
moments you know so example if you spend
a vacation and let's say some remote
place and then you know you're spending
it around you know you're going there
for at least one or two weeks it will
refresh your mind and bind you guys if
you are into technical field refreshment
is very important right your brain needs
that refreshment to you not to work hard
for the next time if you're not spending
this vacation doing doing something what
you know I mean you know not enjoying by
going to some places that means you're
not keeping your you're not keeping your
mind healthy so make sure you enjoy your
vacation go somewhere may not be one
week may not be one year or one month go
for at least two days you can just fly
it out something so this vacation enjoy
okay in fact when I posted this on on
Facebook that I will be going for a live
session I will be talking about how to
how to utilize your vacation one of my
friend who is in us now I say is okay
you know vacations are meant to be
enjoyed
and yes vacations are meant to be
enjoyed so enjoy your vacation okay but
let's say if you don't have a choice
let's say you're not going anywhere and
you're spending your vacation at your
home that's very bad now and if you're
spending your vacation at home getting
bored it's time to increase your skills
if you are getting time to enjoy if you
if you if you have a plan of going out
if a family is forcing you to you know
go to native place and somewhere go okay
enjoy it but
case if you at home then what this is
the time you can improve your skills
okay now how would you improve your
skills okay I guess I got some message
yeah so you have to increase your skills
in this two months so what you can do is
so you'll be having at least two months
right or one or two months okay okay so
you'll be having two months so what you
can do is in fact I have talked I've
talked about this a lot of time in fact
a streaming went blank
okay so I have talked about this for a
lot of time in fact in some of my
sessions some of my videos I have talked
about how ta how can you you know be a
better programmer so I was going to why
I'm doing this session today is because
in the morning I was going through some
images on Facebook and then I saw image
from hacker rank so they were talking
about how to be a good programmer so it
says you have to I mean it's okay let me
just perfect mind yeah so it was like
you have to every day you need to quote
something again this is only for
programmer okay if you want to do
something else in your life that's
that's okay right you can go for other
things yeah so you have to code a lot
when I say cold a lot every day you have
to code for at least one are what code
doesn't matter okay you can go for
palindrome number you can go for you
know you can create your own e-commerce
website in those days but make sure you
spend at least one are coding not
learning anything but only coding
whatever you know doesn't matter if you
have learned it in C programming or C++
or Java whatever you know code it okay
once that once you have done with that
then go for something which you don't
know so first one I'll do that thing
which you know which you or they're you
know example if you know about file
handling in Java
maybe file handling in C++ or maybe
pointers in C write some code on that it
doesn't matter what you write but write
something I know it will improve your
skills it will improve the and when I
say
skills I'm talking about you know with
their two different stuff we have
knowledge and then we have skills
knowledge is something you know skills
is something you can do example um so I
know what to talk so that's my knowledge
but I'm talking now that skills right so
it needs so you need practice to improve
your skills so if even if you know code
you have to practice example think about
without colony one of the best batsmen
in the world right he knows all these
shots but still he practice them every
day right so you have to work with those
you have to work with that code I mean
even if you know those concepts do it
once again it's not that if you know it
once then you it's not necessary to
write but make sure you write the code
what you have you already know at least
one hour a day maybe thirty minutes will
do I guess
now what next now next one are you have
to spend on something which you don't
know example let's say if you know C++
you don't know Java then it's the best
time to learn Java right maybe you know
Java now again I guess you have watched
all my videos so now you know you might
be learning Java right the next thing
you can learn some other language you
can learn Python why not write some it
is a debate I know there are two top
people in the world one who loves Python
they say Java is you know they don't
like Java then there are some people who
like Java they don't like Python right
it should not be the case you should not
you should not hate any language if
you're loving language that's good but
you should not hate a language except on
it so so if you talk about the
programming world you know you have to
learn new stuff so now if you know Java
or learn Python there's no harm in that
the advantage would be if you learn
Python there are something in Python
which is not that in Java right so you
can actually implement that concept
which is there in Python in Java okay so
that's the advantage okay
so may you would and Roger I'll be
answering your questions once once I
have done with this session I mean I
want to talk about something once I'm
done with that I will I will try to
answer your questions okay so the first
are you have to spend
I mean code on things you know second
are you have to spend time on something
which you don't know so learn some
new in fact there was a question last
week how I I mean I I know Java right so
how can how can you be like me the thing
is I teach right so I teach the same
concepts multiple time so if we talk
about Java I have taken Java batches or
at least I have to connect oximetry 25
batches for Java just imagine how much
experience I have in one code example if
I teach if else I have taken that for 25
25 times right if talk about palindrome
I have taken that for 25 times so I've
done the same code multiple times and
that's why I know it better right so you
have to do one thing you have to you
know code what you know and then you
have to do something we should don't
know now what next now how to spend next
time next one next half an hour there
are lots of people think that if you
want to be if you want to be successful
programming is enough and the answer is
no programming is just a tool to
implement something but beyond
programming we have lots of stuff like
example you should know about the basic
IT knowledge all the stuff like founders
of the company you can learn about which
company is working on which project all
the stuff so it will it is very
beneficial for you you know when you it
is it will be beneficial for you when
you want to debate with someone I used
to I should I loved the debates example
there are some people they are very good
that they like who they like psyche Blin
I don't like say given just for the
example I like say given he's a great
guy but let's say if I if I want to
debate on I don't like Sergey Brin then
you should know some points right who is
sorry brain who way is working now I
mean which project is working with so
you should know all those stuff right so
if you want to debate with someone you
should know about the basic things
example if I want to debate about what
which I don't know so let's say I want
to debate about medical field some
medicines let's say government is
banning a medicine I don't know about
that medicine right how can i bait so
being the technical way in a technical
field you should know about you should
know everything about the
technical field wide you should know
about the founder of the company should
know about who which company is working
on which project who is the CEO of that
company example we know about all the
Indian guys write Microsoft CEO Satya
Nadella then we have Apple CEO that's
Tim Cook
that's not Indian but Google CEO is
sundar Pichai I know I'm gonna forget
that so we have all these engines we
know about those guys right but why not
what about other people also CEO of
SpaceX CEO of all those companies
I like Oracle right so learn about this
thing then question is from where you
will learn you have internet right so
you can just go to Wikipedia that's bad
so you can go to Wikipedia you can
search for any company name doesn't
matter which company search for Oracle
read the article you will understand
what is Oracle even understand how they
work if you hate reading you can also
use YouTube go to youtube and search for
documentaries of each company you know
in a while while I take sessions you
know I take lots of sessions so in my
sessions I teach okay but just to make
it more fun I also talked about some you
know technical stuff people if you're my
student you know what I'm talking about
right so I talk about lots of stuff
about companies I talk about which
company is working on which project so
how I know all the stuff so I normally
go to YouTube in my free time and I
search for any company let's say if I
want to talk about Oracle so I will
search for an Oracle documentary so in
that documentary you don't have to read
anything you just have to watch okay
so there will be some there there are
some great documentaries on YouTube just
watch it okay it will improve your
thinking power you understand how
exactly technical field works how
companies works okay oh is it another
lie look as I look same maybe because of
the hair style but he's a great guy if
we cannot compare and look wise you can
compare not by brain wise he's a great
guy anyway
yeah he was I was talking about
talking about you hush I forgot the
point now yeah so you have to you have
to you have to watch lots of
documentaries okay so for every company
have to talk you have to you know watch
documentary so you understand lots of
stuff okay now what next
so you have spent on coding I'm not
saying you just have to spend ten hours
a day running but you know you can
change the time half an hour coding
which you know half an hour coding which
you don't know then half an hour on
something technical right from from this
field whether we are talking about
founders right so let me ask you a
question if people who are live you can
answer this question now the question is
what which company has a project college
project zero I can't come which company
has a project colors project zero okay
zero okay so we have a question from him
on show how can you get free images from
Android how did you get free images
under developer how to get free images
is there on on Android platforms on
there then
okay so I got this idea from one of my
Android developer so what you can do is
there are some websites which provides
copy free I mean copyright free images
which there's just search for those
links do you have that link okay if I
find that link I will do I will I will
share it for sure I don't know any
images any free images for - using
Android project
okay so let's let me check let me let me
have let me just get the link okay so
the question was what was the question
yeah so project zero is the project of
Google that's great right answer Mukesh
and my huge you know that's a girl right
okay so you don't want to be in in front
of camera that's that's the issue not
everyone likes to be on camera would you
like to come on camera Himanshu I'm sure
you HOT okay anyway so okay so by the
time if you're talking about this
there's a like button in the coming in
the video there is a like button if you
liked this session make sure you like it
okay now come back to the point so your
half is half half an hour you have to
spend on the coding which you know half
an hour which you don't know and half an
hour on the technical stuff okay around
stuff founders which project is working
for which thing and then what next from
now itself okay who's my dog Allah okay
dear just Google three times okay yeah
so what you can do is so for next thing
is you know you can actually oh you
would love to okay question
question coming from there okay so
they're talking about if I were at the
point again my the mic is not working
properly today I caught up so oddly
today and I caught up at 5:30 today
because I had an online session in the
morning yeah what was talking about okay
yeah so you have to spend half a half an
hour on the technical stuff and then
next half an hour you have to spend on
the thing you want to be example let's
say you know I want to be a trainer at
Google so if Google people if you are
watching me give me a chance to speak in
your campus okay so I want to I want to
work in Google not exactly I want to
work at Google but I want to give one or
two sessions at Google to the Google
employees maybe not today but some you
know not Google CEO but I want to give a
session in Google so that's that's my
aim right so you will be having some
sort of a my do you want to be a
programmer you want to be a hacker you
want to be a trainer so work on those
skills example if you want to be a
hacker you need to be very good with
mats okay so if you hate math that's
your problem you have to you have to
learn match and you have to you know you
have to be we have to be really good
with maths
next let's say if you want to be good in
programming so again you require Matz
let's say you want to be a trainer you
want to be like me you want to be like a
you want to be a trainer what you can do
is you can you know yes if you want to
be a trainer you should be very good
with the communication power
communication doesn't mean to English
commish communication means the way to
convey your message you know so if you
we have lots of we have lots of point
sets in our mind right we we like to you
know express our feeling the problem is
your ideas if then it is there inside
inside your mind but sometimes it's very
difficult to find those words to express
it so I should be very good with your
communication power okay you should you
should have a
very good body language not just what
training you know even if you are going
for company introduced you have to make
sure that you have good communication
power you have good in a body language
so daily practice in front of a mirror
that's the best way you can practice in
fact better than that or teach you know
if you have trained this vacation you
know in your area there will be some
people some students who have just pass
out there you know six standard seven
standard then just school and not take
those people and teach programming there
and teach programming C programming C++
or Java when you teach it will
automatically improve your thinking
power it will improve your the
communication power it will teach your
body language okay otherwise if we don't
want to do that you can actually go
forward you can use a middle in front of
a middle you can talk okay so this is
what you can do in your vacation daily
spend half an hour
what on coding the things you know half
an hour things who don't know and then
and then all the stuff now what next
let's say you is it any better option
than this so first enjoy your vacation
if not spend this time to us daily on
some works and the third thing is do
internship okay now this is very very
very important internship maybe even if
even if you are doing internship for
free that's okay but you will learn lots
of stuff there in colleges what you
learn you learn about topics right you
learn about concepts an internship will
you will understand how actually you can
make project okay so do internship from
where doesn't matter
I know maybe small company maybe big
company you can go for mid-level
companies you can work for free right so
what you can do is go to Google search
for the websites where you will find
free internship go there apply again
they will be interviewed on rounds but
that's okay right to get something you
have to do something right so yeah so
search for the internship search for the
internship and get yeah let's do
internship for one month and you know
you will bless me for that so that's
these are the three things you can do in
your vacation so that's it from this
session I guess
it's time to answer some questions so
the others don't worry I'm saying your
questions so let's start with the first
one I'm doing first one right I'm doing
engineering in third year exams will be
end at one first June how should I do as
my holiday
okay so I've answered your question
right my you'd so that's what the whole
topic so you can do internship but
you're also going to your mom's village
right so do that first
you know keep your mom happy that's very
important so go enjoy your the vacation
in your mom's village your mom will be
happy with you so do that and after that
come back to your place where you stay
and join the internship right you can
join the internship or you can do this
stuff which I have told you about okay
and okay there's one more thing I need a
Content writer okay so if you want to do
internship with me you can do that
people who stay in Mumbai so if you're
staying in Mumbai you can do internship
for me I want a contender I want a
Content writer okay I believe you I will
be giving you some content thing you
have to just you know make it more
attractive and all the stuff so if you
are if you are an interested in
internship content writing we can join
me okay next question is from Raju I
don't know any programming language very
good i okay what should i do then learn
programming Raju that's the only option
you have I know it takes lots of time to
learn programming but once you know one
programming language you can learn other
language very easily so learning the
first language is very difficult okay so
I would suggest start learning I can
start learning you can use YouTube to
learn you can use books or you can also
go for some classes right join classes
if you are not comfortable with YouTube
if you're not comfortable with books
join classes because there are some
people they they cannot understand from
YouTube they cannot understand from
although stuff join class there's no
harm in that right
okay my uder I think you should start
with basic C or HTML okay talking about
your answering for Roger right that's
okay so we have d dodge I haven't
learned C or C++ can I start with Java
directly you can do you can directly go
for Java that's not the issue but you
know sometimes we need basic concepts of
Java before starting with any I mean so
you need basic basic cons you should
know the basic concepts of programming
the thing is when you learn Java there
are lots of trainers they assume that
they assume that you know programming so
the main the meaning the you know what
we what we having it in our mind that
you know some programming we have to
teach you about okay I guess I have
shared the link just follow okay I'll
come back to the question students so I
was talking about yeah so you can
directly go for Java but the trainer so
when when you come to me to teach you
Java so I will I will first you know I
will assume that you know some
programming language maybe maybe Java or
maybe maybe C not not Java maybe C or
C++ so you know programming what I will
teach you is the concepts of Java like
oops and all the stuff but it's okay to
start with Java directly okay so I feel
if you go for if I go for a training
well a trainer is not assuming that you
know programming earlier that he's
teaching you Java from start without
even knowing C and C++ go for it okay
you can learn Java without sin without C
and C++ there's no harm in that but I
feel when you learn C C++ and then if
you are going for Java it will improve
your majority of the programming so
still my word it is go for C first then
go for Java even if you are skipping C++
that's okay but C and C++ okay C or C
and then Java okay okay so next garage I
know C language I'm planning to learn
C++ in this holiday
I know this intercept is a plumpers C++
I don't have any tutorials for C++ as of
now I'm not even planning to do that I
have my C videos I have my java videos
so for C++ you can actually go for some
other channel I don't know which which
channel is good mmm
not sure just you just go to youtube and
search for C but C to C++ tutorials and
you can go from that okay just hold on I
guess we I guess we got a guest here
okay I can we can just continue
okay
yeah then so we got some guests here
that's okay let's continue so we have
okay next question is how many of okay
so yeah there's a question from Iman
show how many are huge how many of you
how many of them has joined the live
session okay that's a tricky question so
live session I guess 10 people have
joined I guess nine or 10 10 people have
joined talking about the paid session
right here so 10 people okay imagine you
can join if you want you are my favorite
trend right okay I can get the code okay
this is a question but can I increase my
coding skill to write to get particular
output
yes bouquet shop see when you are doing
palindrome and I'm strong make sure that
you're not copying the code from the
internet okay do it yourself and then
you can also go for your own you know
own concept create patterns you know if
you watch my videos I have taken some
patterns create your own pattern and try
to solve it okay you can do this stuff
you can do let me give you assignment
now itself the next assignment you have
Mukesh from my side will would be take a
name
okay very big name take typical South
Indian name okay something like what -
Swami Venu Gopal Iyer okay so take this
name and find the number of vowels in
this name okay what was it which is I a
I I forgot the old AE IOU and count the
number of vowels
if the number of vowels is less than
five okay then show the output that you
are not eligible to have this name okay
so this is the assignment let me repeat
the question take the input from the
user
any big name count the number of bubbles
if the number of votes in the name is
less than five friend you're not any
cheaper - you know you're not eligible
for this for this name change your name
something in that way
okay I mean you can take any you can
take any questions okay that's your
that's your choice
okay again D - I haven't learned C and
C++ cannot start with Java okay not
answered that my maths is not good so
I've got two times KT but I love
programming that's great may you even if
you you don't like maths right so I'm
not saying you should like maths I'm
just saying you should know the basic
concept of maths you should know how to
solve a given problem you can also try
one more thing as I talked about
competitive programming you can actually
compete with people I don't know in
which city you stay in every city there
are lots of competitions between
different colleges you can just
participate there okay what is the
difference between BSC comm signs and be
a CIDR same with BTech CS and B Tech IT
so the basic difference between C s NIT
is comm science people concentrate more
on computer technology and IT people
focus more on information technology
example if we talk about what if we talk
about something new in algorithms that
will matter more for computer science
people but there's some new type of
applications like some new api's that
will matter to IT professionals so V IT
professionals or ITB CIT people we focus
more on application side and constants
people focus more on the backend side
you know algorithms OS and all the stuff
so I'm not saying it is good and it is
bad it's just that they have a different
mindset but in India both are same okay
we have it's just University wanted to
earn more so that's why they have many
courses okay so you can blame in your
city here so both are same basic comm
science is difficult to crack compared
to be a CIT so if you want to get past
very easily go for be a CIT if you want
to work hard to go for PSA chrome
science and if you're comparing BSC IT
and engineering I will I would suggest
go for engineering if you want to if you
want to join MNC a big company go for
engineering one don't go for BSC IIT
okay what can one do after Java this is
from Iran okay that's a good question
what you can do after Java there are
lots of stuff you can do you know
there's there there's a field called as
mobile programming so to to me to make
the app for Android we use Java so once
you complete Java Java no one should
know Java then you can learn Android
programming you can make Android apps
next let's say if you're not going for
mobile mobile devices you can go for
websites you can build a website you can
learn sublet JSP you can build a website
if you know Java next let's say if you
don't want to go for web sites you can
let's say if you want to work on big
data which is which is handling with
handling huge amount of data we have
Hadoop concepts so once you know Java
you can actually go for Hadoop in fact I
have taken one batch which is online
course the there were lots of people I
mean they learn Java just because they
wanted to get into head you filled so to
learn Hadoop Java is compulsory okay
in fact it is a company they trained on
Hadoop so there they asked me to you
know make videos for them so I have
created some videos Java videos for them
and then before they actually start with
the Hadoop session with the students
they they asked students to watch my
videos ok just to have Java knowledge so
there are lots of option available you
can go for Android you can go for web
development you can go for big data you
can go for big data stuff and what we
have more what you can do after Java
there knots of stuff available you can
just go to Google and search for it but
I would suggest Android and web
development is very good
okay so we have maybe will again yeah
but I know only see in basically will
have those only at iteration level so I
have how can I saw our internship okay
so I'm not saying my use I'm not saying
you have to do the internship as a
developer I'm not saying that okay you
can do the internship as maybe network
engineer may be a hardware person you
are you're going there just to open this
of the screw of the computer that's okay
it's just you're not doing the actual
development stuff it's just that you are
there and you are actually seeing what
is happening around you know you're
talking to other people let's say if you
join Mike if you let's say if you're
joining my office and if you don't know
any programming language and you know
how to start it out or how to configure
a machine how to how to open a laptop
that's okay right do that what you can
do is you can in lunchtime in the tea
break you can talk to my you can talk to
your colleagues which are my employees
they know lots of stuff right you can
talk to them you'll you will get lots of
knowledge right and then maybe if you
you will get motivated to learn all the
stuff and then you will learn a lot
right and then next time next year this
year you are doing only the hardware
part next year when you join the same
company as i intern you will actually
code right so you're starting somewhere
so when I say internship I'm not talking
about only development the internship
can be of any type you can be a Content
developer here and then next year you
can do development if you if you know in
in one year if you are learning lots of
stuff then then you have again Adrian is
it Java or.net what you would use
suggest okay
it's a very straightforward stuff from
my side it is Java okay dotnet is dying
now okay I don't want to hurt anyone
it's just that dotnet is dying okay
let's go with this think about mobile
market you know any of used to have
Nokia phones right and then we had
Android phones and then Microsoft
launched Nokia Lumia and as far they put
less than one person devices runs on
Windows okay so there's no market for
dotnet on mobile platform and world is
moving towards mobile right so we don't
use even if you want to check your email
we don't use laptop right we check
mobile phones all right next one if you
talk about any big technology which is
work which is running now maybe big data
or maybe web servers and all the stuff
everything is using open source
technology okay and dotnet
I guess adobo Fidalgo for Java okay
next thank you for the input okay
Himanshu no need to join I have learned
enough from you I know tutorials I'm
making an app with oh you you're walking
together now harsh and Himanshu that's
great your friends all I mean you're you
people are already friends are just you
met online

mean what we're talking about data
structure application
I just every application needs data
structures so make sure you have the
basic concept of data structures I don't
know what your answer would be but yeah
okay where I missed I guess I have
skipped some questions okay so again
from entry so we can use your channel to
learn yeah you can learn java from my
channel from start to end there's no
issue with that okay
can I learn medium level or complete
Java on YouTube you can learn complete
Java I mean everything on YouTube it's
just you need commitment see there are
some people they cannot learn from
YouTube but if you're that type of
person you can learn then you can learn
everything YouTube has lots of resources
available ok so when when you will come

forward if you're comparing this to but
technologies and Android I will suggest

upon your maths okay if you have if you
have good marks go search for the
college

good for designing okay you need to be
very creative the designing is not a
feel you can actually learn it's a field
