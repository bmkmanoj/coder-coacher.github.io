the last one which is this or using a
triangle pattern now let's play let's
try to build the mirror image of that
now to build this pattern what we need
is so in the first row we have four
columns in the second row we have three
columns in third row we have two columns
and the last row we have one column so
your column your zone number is
inversely proportional to your column
number so you as your column row number
increases your column numbers decreases
right so what we can do here is so
instead of starting j with four what if
i start a j with so instead of starting
with one let's start with four and
instead of saying j is less then we say
J is greater than 1 or greater than I
and since we are going from 4 to the
last value of I made to subtract the
value so it is minus minus so this will
count the number of columns so at number
of rows so I is is possible to count the
number of rows and here we'll be we'll
be counting the number of columns so
when you are the door number is 1 we
want to print this top of four times
right so it will start with four then
three two one so it will print four
times when your a value is 2 it will
start J we start with four so it will go
from four three two one two three values
when your I value is three J will start
with four so it will be 4 and three and
at last when your values for J we start
with four it will end at four and you
will get only one star right and that's
why I run this code you're creating this
image simple now what if you want to
print this format the triangle with a
middle image so you can just copy the
loop we can use the same loop and we can
paste it here we can just paste it here
again we start with one and this will be
less than equal to I as it was before
and now if I run this we will see okay
so you can see we got our middle image
here
simple so that's how you create this
type of pattern so that's it
