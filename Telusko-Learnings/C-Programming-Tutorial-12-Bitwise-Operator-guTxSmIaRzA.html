bitwise operator now it is bitwise
operator so when let's say when you have
double ampersand this is called as and
operation and when you use single
ampersand this is bitwise and operation
okay
now when I talk about bitwise so how it
works so let's take an example let's say
we have our value which is 25 so first
we have to convert this 25 into a binary
format so between the binary format of
425 is 1 1 double 0 1 so that this is 25
in binary format and let's say we have
one more number which is 15 and 15 is 0
1 1 1 1 so this is 15 in binary format
so when you apply a bitwise operator
here so when you have 25 odd 15 so this
is bitwise or operator okay so we have
simple single pipe this is bitwise or
operator so when you apply bitwise odd
operator here what it will do is it will
give the answer as so it would apply a
bitwise operator and the value will be
so 1 &amp;amp; 0 so when you have or it will
give you 1 this is also 1 this is also 1
this is 1 and this is 1 so it will give
you five ones and five ones in by this
is a binary format so the decimal
version for this is 31 okay so five ones
in binary and 31 in decimal so we should
get an output which is study 1 so let's
see if you are getting 31 is we are
getting 31 now let's use bitwise and
operator so when you apply bitwise and
operator it will change this value so
this will be so 1 and 0 so if anything
is 0 here it will be 0 so it is 0 then
we have 1 because both are ones then
this is 0 0 &amp;amp; 1 so this 0 1 double 0 1
is actually nine in binary format so it
is equal format
so if I run this code it should give me
nine and run and here we go we got the
output as nine so that's how we use
bitwise operators</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
