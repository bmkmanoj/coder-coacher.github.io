something today I will start a new
tutorial students on Android okay in
this lecture we will understand what is
android is how to set up android
development environment in your machine
and how to write a simple hello world
program okay so let's so Android
architecture since before this started
and tried Philip but I just wanted to
give you some idea of Android that to
Android what isn't right this is a
question so Android is a not a software
or operating system it is a stack of
softwares point with the operating
system okay because Android we cannot
say that Android is the operating system
okay android is not operating system
android is a stack of software along
with the operating system it is see on
my screen that is indoor architecture is
there so if is you can see that the very
first layer the application so android
has a dot provides minneapolis along
with application frameworks like
activity manager window manager content
provider and many more for now just
ignore it just this just just understand
that there is something called an
application and for application Android
provides application frameworks okay
along with frameworks there is may their
various libraries available in android
along with libraries the colonel with
the colonel is based on linux okay so
along with this all enter also provides
something called as douek virtual
machine EVM which is used to execute
applications ok so this is the android
simple this is simple android
architecture how Android finding logs
start with Android mysterious I didn't
understand that or what are the building
blocks of Android is so Android building
looks you can see there the activity
view intent service broadcaster Seaver
content providers and just above
dissolve we have something called
Android manifest dot XML so and
manifest or XML is nothing but someone
who finds this all together okay so if
you are not understanding what is
activity views intent service
broadcaster saber content providers just
ignore for now in later tutorials we
will understand that in details okay so
Android tools is to start and start with
Android which tunnel designing Android
applications you need some Android
adequate rules so in market we have
Eclipse ADT and sdk i'll also we have
something called us android studio now
just I wanted to give you some idea
about it eclipse is nothing but I de so
in that I de you can install LED Android
allotment tool and sdk sdk software
development kit and then it will start
working on android if you want to use
eclipse the problem is from last october
google has stopped using unity plugins
for eclipse okay so i would recommend
you to go with android studio now to
start with android you should have GD
kill stored in your system once jdk is
installed you can install like really
plugin you can add anything in eclipse
and you're going to start exploring
android but if you want to go get
android studio then you need jdk and
then after installing GDK when you
install and produce to do at that time
everything whatever is required it get
installed in your system now we'll see
the steps to stall and register you so
go to developer.android.com okay on that
you can see the in right side you will
get a link or download android studio
and aesthetic tools click on that link
you'll get another ph okay and that
phase you can simply click on download
and radish to do you can see that i have
highlighted if you are going to download
and/or distribute today so you will get
android 6.6 6.0 marshmallow platform
also 6.0 l director system okay image
with the Google API is an entire studio
ide okay and enter
sdk tools okay so as I told you if
you're going to stall introduced to you
you do not sdk separately also I would
like to recommend that before is turning
and earnest to view your system please
read system requirements as like you can
see that Android needs 2 gb ram minimum
and 4gb is recommended okay now take a
love like the after installation of
Android restore you like here you can
see it provides something called you
later also if you want to work emulator
is nothing but what I say after
developing your application if you want
to taste that so you can taste that on
emulator if you want to use defaulting
later provided by google then you have
to make sure that in bios settings your
android virtualization sorry your
virtualization is on so that is a little
bit tough for like to walk with bio
setting and service so i would recommend
you to install dailymotion plugin okay
and delivery nothing but another
emulator which you will get on freely
available you can install it in your
system and you can just add the plug-in
of jerry motion in your in rubbish to do
and then later you can start a story
android with jeanne motion city Muslims
is lightweight and like it's lightweight
so your sister will also not get hang if
you are using android defaulting
relatives then it will be like it is
like tough to manage if you have 4gb ram
laptops or desktop ok so to install
Android virtual device plug-in simply go
you start and produce should you go to
file in files you get settings in
settings after going to settings will
get to the my left screen which I'm like
oh the left is in left screen there is a
plugins so click on plugins after
clicking on plugins click on browse
repository and just after browser you
pull it free this search for Ginni
motion and you get genymotion so here
the install button you can click on
install and after click on install GD
motion wicked generation plugin
get installed in your like get added in
your Android studio and I believe that
already you have installed Genie motion
to install gentoo ocean simply go to
google and search for Ginni motion Lynn
emotion is gurus in immersion download
link and there you will get to get the
genie motion okay if you have virtualbox
like if you have Oracle's virtualbox and
or any vm virtualbox then you can simply
click on catch any motion but if you
don't have virtualbox i would recommend
to go ahead with kept genie motion so if
you click on get genie motion so it will
install virtualbox also and JD motion
emulator also so if we have emulator and
if you have plugin you can simply start
hitting project how do we create new
projects in android digital so it is
very simple go to file click on new
project and after new producers put
application name and application in bike
hello world I am going to start it so
there's a hello world then company
domain complete omen is nothing but
suppose if you have some company like
google com so you can put your packaging
like comrade google ok and like there
are many like if you see PT and pd am
calm so they are packing able to be on
top BTM and complete it will be paid him
calm so that that is only you that what
you like you can just put it change it
later or not a problem and letter in
like then you can see that project
location where you want to save your
project so like currently i am storing
that in f drive youtube hello world ok
so it will be to get a student s Colin
slashed you to folder so click on next
after people next you will get a window
to select Arcanum as the gate for which
has to give read from you wanted to
design your Android application
currently I have selected to get cap
because i am going to design for kit kat
you can choose any you get many option
starting from what is it you'll get the
very first android their honeycomb
KitKat gingerbread you let many more
options there so currently i have
selected android 4.4 kitkat ok then
again click on next after click on next
you look at add an equity to mobile
the list for here this select blank
activity okay after selecting blank
activity you look like you're another
suitable we give you a default screen
which will have your fault project okay
so next that's all for starting with
Android in next tutorial will understand
aspects and models of another studio and
hello world robe and we will write and
will execute hello world program using
Android thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
