tutorial we have talked about at least
in which we have added ten hundred
numbers and we have sorted all those
values dependent but depending on the
last digit of that number again now what
what next will do is let's remove all
this valve instance let's start fresh so
we have a main function let me remove
all the imports so what we have to
remove out all the inputs again just
click here and say remove all unused
inputs or you can use a keyboard
shortcut which is control shift I now
want to do that let's create our class
and we'll name this class as prudent
okay and in the student class let me
have two values one is roll number and
second will be let's say their marks
okay and to create object with values
we'll have one more pass we'll have a
constructor which will accept two
parameters again you can do this in
advance directly with the above right
leg insert code then we can use
constructor with both the values and
generate so it will it will take a
constructor which will accept both the
values here what we can do is we can
create a collection of students which
means I have to create at least option
and the type of the list will be student
and for the package and we'll name this
as stood equal to new now to use our
class will use a de least a type of
eligible student and then let's add some
students so how to actions we can simply
says to start add and bracket we can
specify new student so we say object of
student and we can pass values as 1
comma let's say 55 so 1 is the roll
number of a student and 50 pies a mouse
you can see it will call this
constructor it will assign the values
okay I will add few more few more
students
let's add five students here well number
two or number three row number four and
go to five marks let's say 95 then 35 50
45 and let's say it is 85 okay so we
have five students and we have their
name now what next we can do is we can
simply just print all these values at a
print or student obviously somewhere
here we require a tostring method it's
because if you don't override our to
stream it earlier it will use the
default method of object class which
will bring the class name with its hash
code what I want I want to put in the
details of his children so I will use a
tostring method I get to do that we can
use something on a two string and
generate now so if I print tostring it
will print the value which is dis values
okay so let me just use a for loop to
bring their students the type of student
a student will say s in stood and then
we can print s so if I print L as it
will print all the students let me run
this code and this code and
which happened all the five objects it's
good it's venting all the five objects
right but what I want to do here I want
to print all these collects all these
values in a in such an order that the
highest marks will come first and the
lowest marks will come last that means
we have to sort this story collection in
as highest match lowest marks for that
again we can use a subway we can use
something while as collections dot sort
so as you know we have to we have to
pass two things when Institute's comma
then we have to pass a object of
comparator so we can use a lambda
expression and then give a bracket open
close now here we'll say return into the
turn again this will take two parameters
one will be s1 let's just remain 1 and
s2
so I should return s 1 dot marks if if
this is greater than as two dot marks
yes to dot marks it should return a
value which is minus 1 because we want
to print in reverse order now which
means descending order so we have to say
minus 1 otherwise we should check s 1
dot marks of this less than has to dot
marks and then we'll say : and should
bring one otherwise you should print 0
this question ma okay so if you don't
know what I'm doing just to go back to
the previous video to clarify your
doubts and then we can simply done this
so it will then in the order of see the
highest marks is first and the nourish
marks is last right so this is one way
we can sort this elements so this is the
way we are using a competitor to sort
students
now the next tutorial will talk about
how to compare how to sort this by not
using comparator by using something else
and then something else is something
that is compatible that we'll see in the
next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
