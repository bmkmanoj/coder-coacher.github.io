discussion of servlet now in this what
we'll say is we'll see the importance of
this get a good method and Porsche
method now in an ideal example let me
run this again so lightly run now in
this if I pass a number like 25 and 36
if you add these two numbers the answer
will be 61 right but you can see the
variables of my HTML or the of the
fields of my HTML are coming in this
address bar which means this servlet
this add servlet is fetching the values
from our fetching the values from
address bar what it means is if I go to
this ad when I say get parameter it will
fetch this value of t1 from address bar
which is 25 then if I say get my amulet
t2 it will face the address I fetch the
value of t2 from address bar now to
prove this let me change this value from
36 to 1 ok and if I say enter now you
can see the output is 26 which means 25
plus 1 is 26 so this is get the problem
with gate is is not secure like example
if you are going for login or user name
and password so it will reveal your
username password on address bar which
is not secure to make it secure what we
need is we have to make it as post so
what this post will do is let me run
this code you will understand by
yourself if I say post and two numbers
are studied
okay 34 and 12
there should be 46 and the answer is 46
white but you can see there is no value
of t1 and t2 then question arise in the
case of post from where this request
parameter T 1 value come will come from
and the answer is cookies so by default
when you say post it will store your
data in some low
storage from where this request
parameters will fetch the value now now
question is which is better
is it your post or get now as we know
post is most secure but because we don't
have any values in address bar but in
case of post your data will be stored in
local storage then your HTML page or
servlet page will fetch it it will take
some time for the processing right but
if you talk about your gate method it
will directly fetch data from address
file that means it's much faster than
post but post is more secure than gate
so which one to use is depend upon the
requirement if your requirement is
security then you have to go for post if
your requirement is speed you can go
with gate right and then now let's see
what is this service method means now
service is a method which belongs to a
generic servlet which belongs to class
version reserved it but because of the
introduction of HTTP servlet we have
some two new types of service and those
two two new types is one of them is do
post and second one is to get the depend
upon client page if your client is
requesting for post it will call do post
if your client is requesting for get it
will call do gate now let's see in a sec
current scenario if I make it as get it
will call do get if I make it as get it
will call do get let me on this code as
you can see it's 6 56 second 36 7 1 2
and it's working with get but what if if
I make this ass up oh if I make my HTML
as post now what it should follow it
should follow a post method or you
should follow a get method first let me
see if it's working it fit it works or
not
when this code notice till now because
in HTML you will hardly find any errors
and
then when I click on add it will
generate an error which says actually be
method post is not supported which means
you're calling a post but there is no
specific method but is do post you
that's why we have to say do post it
will call do post now and now you find
the detail has 88 and 99 and the answer
is 187 which means it's working with
posner now question is how would we know
as a programmer that which type of
method a client will use client can use
post client can you skate right and it
should give output in both the cases now
if you want to restrict your client only
to use post you can use do post if you
want to restrict your client use only
get you can use Google but what if you
want to give your client of freedom to
use any method for that you have to
define both the methods you have to
define to get also and your emitter you
have to define do post also so what it
means is copy the code and paste this
time instead of do post will say do get
now depend upon if user say post it will
call do post if user will say get it
will call do get but now you can see we
are writing this code twice right we are
writing the same code toys so what we
can do is to solve this problem we'll
say we'll create one more method as a
process process request again it should
it should take two parameters one when
one is a should EP servlet response the
same when we are using a bow and we'll
say req and then I should EP servlet
response will say adios
again I want to throw the exception so
we'll say copy the exception paste and
then instead of defining all this in
both the instead of defining all the
statement to functions what we can do is
we can just define this in only one
function and then we can we can call
these functions from our do get a do
post we can do the same task in here
that's it and since we don't want this
we can hide it we can hide these two
lines and our main focus is processing
will be done by this so if you say do if
you say get if you go if you say post it
will call this it will call this post
and in post you're calling this is the
quest or it will get do all this
processing if you say get there it will
call this do getting again it will call
the Pacific West so that means you have
to write the main logic only once and
you can run this multiple times or you
can call this from any function now and
that's not now what if if I create a new
solve it let me show you the actual
servlet what the Java provides on it
bean provides you let's say finish you
can see when you run this code by
default you get a method call this
Pacific West and here you have do gate
and do post right it is inbuilt so most
of the time when you write up servlet by
default you will get lots of thing and
you have to focus on your business logic
all right so this is the code for the
addition of two numbers using servlet I
hope you got some details about servlet
here and do subscribe for the further
