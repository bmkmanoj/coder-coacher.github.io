called a static keyword now what exactly
static means for that let's let's create
a class and we'll name this class as
let's say ABC and in this class let me
create a method called as public void
show so how do you find a method we have
to say public void show which means I
have a method show and this let me print
is out hi
and now to call this we require a main
function I draw a main method now I want
to call this show
now this to call this show and this show
belongs to ABC V we need to instantiate
this ABC now identify instantiation it
simply means creating an object alright
so what we'll do is we'll say ABC obj
equal to new ABC and now I can call obj
dot show that means to call this show
you need an object that means we need to
instantiate this ABC in order to call
show now now let's say I don't want to
create an object I don't want to create
this object of ABC and still I want to
call this show that means I don't want
to instantiate any class to call a
function that means this method should
be a static method so if you have a
method which is static it belongs to a
class that means your static methods
don't need an object we can directly use
a class name so you can simply say it is
as ABC dot show and knife and on this
the output is oh and the output is high
right that means to create a or to call
or not a static method we require at
last name that's it we don't need an
object now what of what if I have a
variable here let's say I have a
variable int I
like how to how to assign a value from
here from this main method again this
eye is not static that means all the
members of this variable and this show
is a method right so all the members
they can be static or they can be
non-static this method show is a static
method but this variable I here is a non
static non-static variable so in order
to call I from here we need to create an
object because we don't we have a
non-static variable here we need to
create the object and then we can say
obj its obj dot I and then we can assign
a value and this obj here will be the
object of ABC but let's I don't want to
instantiate any class I can simply say
it's as static int so that you can use
this variable from ABC so we can say ABC
dot I equal to 5 simple now let's see
some features of starting methods now
let me remove this now so let me create
a variable again let me create a
variable I and the value of I will be 5
I will just try to print the value of I
here if I say I you can see we are
getting an error it says non static
variable I cannot be referred from a
static static constant context which
means we cannot use a non-static
variable in a static method since show
is static we cannot use a non-static
non-static variable in order in order to
call in order to use a non-static method
well we have to in order to use this
variable I we have to create it as
static so we have to convert your
variable from non static to a static
variable and now you can see you can use
this I simple so sorta static static is
a keyword used in Java with the member
functions or member variable of your
class so that you can call those members
without using the object or we do not
need to instantiate any class to call
those members and I just started keyword
in Java
