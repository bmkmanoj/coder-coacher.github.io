running it's time to configure Tomcat so
before configuring Tomcat first you have
to make sure that you have downloaded
Tomcat and we don't have it here right
so let's go back to the browser and
search for Tomcat download now it will
take you to the official website of
Tomcat so let's go for the versions now
you can see we have getting option of
Apache Tomcat 7 Apache Tomcat 8 I would
choose 8 here and you can see we have
certain versions now this is 8 point 5
point 2 4 and the below one is 8.0 I
prefer the complete version so 8 points
there is something which I will be using
here you can also use 8 point 5 that
nothing wrong with that now in this
which would you select again depend upon
your OS I would select that or zz8
because it works on Mac perfectly so I
will click on this one and it will
download the software and then you also
need documentation now while we need a
source code here or that we'll see later
but time bein we caught this too so
first one is the the Tomcat and the
documentation or we have to click on
that as well so it will download the
documentation as well now I have those
things here so if you can see I have
this set up for Tomcat and the source
for as well time in let's not think
about the source code thinking about
this Tomcat double-click this one and it
will unzip and it will give you the
unzipped version of Tomcat you can see
that we got Tomcat here but how do we
use it of course we can use it on
command line or terminal but then we
want to configure that to eclipse so go
back to eclipse and now you can see in
the server tab now maybe you will not
see a tab there on your machine how do
we get it so in case if you don't find
this tab here just go to window and say
show view click on servers it will show
you the tab there now we have a tomcat
downloader we just need to connect it
now how do we do that just click on this
one now it will ask you which software
you want to connect on which server you
want to connect so click on Apache and
you can see it shows a lot of versions
this is all version let's click 8.0
click on next and then it will ask you
for the
location where you have your Tomcat so
click on browse and move to the location
there so I came to a folder where I have
my Tomcat can see that this folder
double click that and click on open
so there's no error click on finish and
this is how you link your efforts with
Tomcat but you're still not sure will it
work now how do you verify if your
target is perfectly working right click
here and say start now if it is getting
started perfectly you can see it's a
started that means your Tomcat is
properly configured and it is working
but maybe some time it will not work now
when I say some time there might be
different issues one of the most common
issue is the port number which Tomcat is
running on is used by someone else maybe
you already have a HTTP server on your
machine let's say Zam server let's just
omit some other server which is using
the same port number
now which whatever I'm talking about so
if I double click here this is the port
number which is used by Tomcat which is
8 0 8 0 which is the HTTP port number
now if you have any software which is
using this port number then your Tomcat
will not start now in that scenario what
you will do is you will double click
here and you will change your port
number you can change your port number
you can make it a generate one so now
your Tomcat will run on a generate one
if you save this what I do I don't wanna
do that I will say I'm happy with age
right you know so since it is walking on
my machine I will not play with that now
how do we access or how do we use Tomcat
here so what we can do is you can just
go to localhost and type colon 8080 now
before hitting Enter what I will do is I
will go back to my Eclipse and I will
always stop the server just to see if I
if I don't have this over there so if I
stop it and after stopping it if I go
back to browser and if I say enter it
will give you an error it says this site
cannot be reached because of course you
don't have this bottom or running here
now if I say start let's see what we get
so if I start here and go back to the
browser and say enter now can see that
we got a different error
it says the page not found but that's
fine is it your tomcat working yes can
you see that the response is you got it
from Tomcat that means this URL is
hitting the Tomcat that's what we wanted
to check but you can also get the
amazing home page of Tomcat if you do
one more setting now you can see in
these sour location you can also choose
who's used Tomcat installation it will
show you the summer page if I go back
here okay we have to reset the server I
click and restart this is how you
distract the server and go back to your
browser I hope it will show you the home
page of Tom caddy I can see that we
caught the page now in which you can you
can use this options as well if you want
deploy any application but this this is
for only saying stuff because since we
are using Eclipse we'll be deploying
everything from the Eclipse you don't
have to use this page anymore but it's
your choice you can use it so your topic
is working your Tomcat is up and running
now the next step would be how to create
a project and how to test on how to
basically print hello world on the page
that's what we're doing in the next
