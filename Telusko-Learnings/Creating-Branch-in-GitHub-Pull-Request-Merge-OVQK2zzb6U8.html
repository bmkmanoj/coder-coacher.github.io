called as the city's dot txt if I open
this file you can see we have this thing
we have not removed chicken thigh yet
now what I'll do is I want to add some
more details and some more recipes if I
click on this
let me just add some more recipes I will
say being and then I will I want to add
some more stuff let's say oh yeah what
else we can have we can have a pizza
okay so let's say we have this two thing
but I'm not sure if we really have to
add these features if you're working on
a project and you have added some to two
modes or two of the features now if you
think commit that those features will be
added in here in your project maybe you
don't want to do that in the current
project you want to have that in the
next major version because normally when
you build a project you go for two
different things we get - we go for -
versions we can go for major versions
maybe you want this thing in a major
update so you have a choice of
committing this in the same branch you
can say I've added beans and okay
watered beans and Pisa so add it now you
know I need to state two things
now you can commit directly to the
master branch because by default you
will be having a master branch now it
gives you one more advantage here which
is called as one more option which is
create a new branch for this commit now
these advantages if you create a new
branch let's say I will name this dodge
as could have this simply means that I
can have these features I would say
could have branch so this might could
have branch and say it suppose file
change now you can see okay so okay just
saying the peas are added that's fine
that's fine okay I don't want to do
anything now so that's my thing so if I
hope if I go back to code can you see
that it gives you or option of branch
here okay so that's branch
it says could have branch now this is a
new class which are created if I see it
as it is here it will have all the
respect is the old one and the new one
which you have created but what if I go
back to my own branch which is master
branch okay so that if you expand this
you have an option of master branch
there
go to master branch vacation as we don't
have beef and teaser here because we
have added those things a new branch
that means this is a branch where you
can actually work on on the current
current version so imagine this is 4.7
versions which you are working with on
your software and for sure which
features you want to add you can add
those features via example let's say you
want to have extra features okay what
features I will have already I will say
thank you and later I will say final
copy I'm added this text now I'm going
to add this text and if you say recipes
this will say done with current version
okay uh current version line now if you
commit this changes you can see we have
two versions now in two different branch
in your master branch you have this text
which I cannot see now hold on is it
refreshed 0.80 case okay so that we got
final copy that's my master branch and
if I go back to my could have branch
then this I don't have that final
version done now what I would do is I
want to reflect so we have two depends
on choose wise can we merge these two
branches I want to combine these two
files right because I felt you know this
is perfect I want to have this visa and
maintain the current version itself can
we do that can we just merge this two
files let's try what do we do is I will
click on this edit I will say done my
changes imagine you're adding some
comments so then my changes and I will
say commit once again I will say done I
also commit now what you can do is you
can just merge this two files but how do
I do that
we have to search for the option to
merge this files now where is the option
I guess mine that is not working
properly just give it is working very
slow okay now we have to search for a
place where you can very well get to you
look at the option of merging these two
projects or to this to these two
branches what we can do is we can go to
tasks and here you can see we have an
option of compare and pull request
now if I click on this you have to send
a pull request so you can see we have a
base which is master branch and you are
comparing this to could have because
these are two different things and it
gives you I so it says can't
automatically merge normally it happens
because what we have what we have is we
have some conflict here the conflict is
we have we have two different files ok
let me get a pulled equation let's see
what happens so let's play click it a
pull request it will show you where is
the issue is and if I go ok circus that
week it says this branch has 1/6 that
must be resolved now why this conflict
because if I click on resolved console
you can see there is a conflict because
we have added this file in between ok so
that one file is saying done bit changes
and other file is saying final copy and
this is done by could have and is done
by final copy so as a human you have to
solve this issue now what you can do is
you can remove this thing you can remove
this space and you can remove this so
this part came from could have at this
this part came from a master and now you
can merge remember this one is this one
is also coming from good hat and once
you have done with the changes you can
say mascaras all this is how you can
combine two files but get you smart
enough to combine this two the problem
is AB there was a problem with the
spacing of the sentence that was it was
not able to do that but normally it does
ok so it says conflict removed and now
click on merge I mean commit much so
these two branches are getting merged
now so your could have features are
going to the master branch and let's
hope it is done you can see it is done I
want to merge 3 comics ok now finally
you have to say this it can see that it
says no branch or this branch has no
conflict once you have solved your
issues you can click on merge push a
quest confirm much and going on is going
on and it is confirmed
ok so can you see that the merging is
done but how do we verify go back to
code go back to master and you can see
much branch master into could have so
that
done virtual recipes okay now you got
beans and pizza you've got done my
changes and you've got a final copy
awesome right so this is how you can
create a brand so if you are working on
a project you can create a subpage
branch and you can work on that project
or that branch and later you can merge
okay but then let's say if you have
multiple people working on this should
we create multiple branches that makes
sense we can how much about the answer
is there but this because get I mean get
a provide to you but you want the ranch
that doesn't mean should create keep
creating branches write your branches
should make sense
next what if you have someone who want
to contribute to your project now we
will see that one so in the next video
we'll talk about this walking and we'll
see how someone else can contribute in
your project so yeah that is on this
video I hope you enjoyed this video and
let me know if you have a ratios in the
comment section and that's it for this
video thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
