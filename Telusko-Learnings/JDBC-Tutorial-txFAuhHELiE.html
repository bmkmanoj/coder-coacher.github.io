so the table to talk about all the
amazing concept called as JDBC now JDBC
stands for Java database connectivity
now say if we talk about this software
world where we work with different types
of software so basically we require
software to work with information right
so what's more important is information
so we require a database where you can
store information and to retrieve that
information we require some friend end
where we can insert data where you can
retrieve data so that front end to
create that front end break what a
software and we require a language that
is your Java and for database we have a
DBMS for as mask you now one but only
Java and mask units because they both
belongs the same company and they have
the best compatibility so if you talk
about Java and master they work together
very firmly now so you have Java and
mask you to connect these two things c1
is language of programming language one
is a DBMS so connect this to require
between a connection which is your java
database connectivity to work with this
again you require some ID is again you
can do it in this notepad or you can use
some IDs so one of the best ide is that
it means all you can use eclipse is
depend upon you I go for it NetBeans
again you will find this practical in
next video you have the link below so if
you want to see the practical you have a
link this is your theory firstly the
theory then you can go for the practical
now to connect this to equal JDBC again
you have to follow anybody talk about
any programming language with database
you have to follow some steps now if you
call someone right if you want to if you
have to ask someone like what's two plus
two
so if you want to call your friend and
if you want to ask two plus two so you
have to do something right first you
have to pick up your phone then you have
retired the number then you recall then
you will get a connection so after the
connection is established we will say
you have to create a state
your mind what have you asked so you
have to ask 2+2 so now he will return
you answer that is full right to cash
peaceful so he will get answer for after
that you will say ok so job is done you
will close the connection that means if
you want to connect to someone you have
to follow some steps in the same way
going to connect Java and mask will have
to follow some steps and those simple
steps only we have seven steps so
starting the first husband so first step
is you have to input a package input the
package that means you have to import a
SQL package again because when you work
with Java you have to work with lots of
library files so you have SQL package
second is so if we talk about this Java
and MySQL you have JDBC JDBC have four
different drivers okay so we have four
drivers we have to use at one of them I
mean if you talk about minus QL my skill
itself provide a driver for Java which
is called as MySQL connector or you can
say MySQL JDBC driver so we have 2 or we
can say my subtitle or we can use
mascara you see drive and in NetBeans
you have something else library files so
you can import or you can import this
library file as MySQL
JBC driver I can how to do it we have
impactive then second step is to load we
have to lower this dry one and we have
to register so next type is lower and
release now this prime third time we
have to create a connection right and to
create a connection we have establishes
create connection
ninth step is create a statement so if
you want to ask something to database
you have to create a statement
so it's create statement now next is
once you get this plate when you have to
execute a statement and that will give
you some results so the next step is we
have to retrieve results once you can do
this you have to process it so next step
is processing results and last steps
once you're done with all that string
you have to go with close the connection
so these are the seven simple steps you
have to follow this - - that is a
connection between Java and masculine so
it's not that difficult but if you
follow this seven chefs it's damaged so
first one you have to input a rescue
package second one you have to load and
race to the driver which is delivery
driver for Maskull third step is to
create a connection next is to create a
statement next used to retrieve the
diesels then you have to process the
results and after all the sudden things
are done you have to close the
connection again this step is optional
again it's your wish you have to close
it or not because once a program is
comes to an end it will happily go close
the connection then it's depend upon you
you have to personal research or not so
this is also optional right again there
are some statements like so if you if
you say select queue it will return you
something so you'd have to read
provisions but if you go for insert
statement it will not give you any
results so again this step goes with
optional so if you do something you have
to follow these four steps properly
first you have to create and put a
package load of a store driver
create a connection then you have to
create a statement right again you have
to follow this test again this is
optional you can do it or you can skip
it
so you start with all these step in
so possible so as we know we have to
start with first step I get the first
Turkish import the package and in
programming way we have to import
package in this way so it's import its
java dot SQL dot star this is your first
time my feet otherwise second step here
we have to provide a driver name now
before you load and register you have to
provide a driver thing and fortunately
we have of single driver name the driver
name is driver so now my name is driver
so this is our class if you if you go
for that library file in that we have a
class as private but to use this class
we quite package so driver package
belongs to JDBC this package is belongs
to my school and this mask will be
launched to come so it's calmed out my
skills or JDBC not driving okay so here
is to install this driver we have to use
a function so that function name is for
name so to the east of this travel we
have a function corresponding and this
for the function belongs to a class
called as class so we have class dot for
them and in bracket we have to pass this
driver name which belongs to a class
je-vc which blocks for trash mass some
package masculine and this package
belongs to a package from is calm so
calm
don't masculine or Jamis did not driver
now your third step is to create a
connection but to create a connection we
have our interface called as connection
and to create object we have corn again
this is the interface you cannot use the
economy object of interface directly so
you have to use a method called as get
connection so it will provide you the
connection now question is where to
collect
we have to pass three parameters I get
we have brackets here so if you have to
pass three parameters first parameter is
database name second parameter is
username and third parameter is possible
so you take notice in the index opposite
again with practical I have used my
database name as demo so my dear M is
name is demo my username is root and my
password is zero so from my skill I have
used my password as zero this loon as a
user name and this is my database name
now the thing is when you want to
connect your Java with database you have
to use something called as JDBC so Java
will communicate with JDBC JDBC will
communicate with MySQL and MySQL would
communicate with database but Maskell
provides you amazing feature where you
can have your database on different
machine and you can access your database
from different machine that means this
too much changed it to be connected on
LAN LAN connection so again if you talk
about line you have to provide an IP
address I mean my database are in the
same machine so I can use something
called as localhost and in localizing
our database for us demo so yeah this is
called no connection string so you can
say JDBC connected to MySQL connected to
database with the help of localhost but
if you talk about this method calls get
connection this will belongs to some
class and that class name is driver
manager so you have connection on equal
to DA manageable connection and you have
this connection string this
fossilization string again if you don't
remember it's no issue you can search
this string online you will get your
exact string so database changes mask
rhetorical string changes SQL server
string changes then you have this ms
access string changes so data DBMS
changes connection string changes
programming the same again this also
changes first step is to create a
statement to create a statement
have an interface colors straight me
interface we have st now to create
object of this we have to use a method
called as create statement now this
creates treatment is not non-static
method belongs to a transpiler special
so we have to use object name as phone
so we have one dot create statement so
first step is to create a statement
v let's suppose i am going to get like
in practical I have created database
where you have we have one database demo
in which you have a table participant in
that table student we have two columns
roll number and s name so roll number
you are having one two three four roll
numbers and we have some names I want to
get a name or a number two that means I
have to use some SQL query again we can
given a string it you know so we have
this second step before this I will
write I will create a string variable
strname at initial of others on SQL
query so I hope you are familiar with
the skill so SQL says if you have to get
something he required a keyword or
select I wanna get star so select star
from my table name is student and where
I want to get a name of one number two
so well roll number is equal to two so I
will use the same line or same variable
here so my next step is to retrieve isms
to retrieve reserves we have st dot
execute 20 and they have to pass the
steel so we have to pass this as
calcutta here it will give me something
right again if you if you ever work with
mask you'll already DBMS it will provide
you data in a probably enough format of
a table so if I execute this statement I
will get something so let's suppose if I
say I have two variables a and B so both
are end yes
even his 5b values for so if I say a
plus B I will get nine so what I'm
getting is the integer value so I have
to store that value in in type of
variable so I can say int 3 is equal to
a plus B but here we are not getting a
proper value by getting the whole table
so to store a table let's suppose I am
getting a table in this this way because
I'm saying star it will give it two
columns the first column will be role
number second column will be best thing
and data will be it's row number two all
right I will get my name which is no
because in database I have with rule
number two I have the name dubbing so if
I execute this I will get this table so
to store this table require an object
let's suppose object name is RS and this
object is of enterprise called as result
set so result set is equal to SP not
execute query and you have to pass SQL
string here okay now the thing is if you
execute this I want this name out so I
require a very well that suppose I
require a variable here so pesty proper
variable name let's suppose we have s
name so I put it all in here but
nevertheless name or you can say
directly name so in this variable which
is a string variable so we have a string
name here I to get this thing lovie
question is from where I will get from
Alice so if I say Alice don't I want to
take some value so if you say if you
have to get something you have to use
something that's get whatever you get
you want to get some string so get
string now from which column so first
column or second column again second
column right so we have to we have to
create or we have to pass to so it will
forgive from second column
but if column is when talk about result
said it was with pointers so by before
your pointer will be pointing in this
column or this room we have to shape our
pointer to download here so to shift
this we have to use
method of Rs we have to say are
destroyed next so it will shift my
pointer from about Oh which is column
name we have to shape to data so we have
to use our s dot next okay if you have
multiple data you have to use our s dot
next next next for moving your pointer
from one row to different row if you go
up I get previous good if you want to go
above first thing you know on the top
its first last okay so this is your B
results so in name we got a name for
this lemon so once you are done your
last name again you know the exhaustive
is this your 610 so this is your sixth
string last step is to close a
connection and to close a connection we
have to use conditional object so we
have gone dot close so this is what JDBC
is all about so it's again it's not that
difficult but if you want to work with
this advanced programming sometimes we
we work with insert statement so called
insert statement we told them execute QT
we have execute update okay now in a
talk about statement again strictness of
three types so again you can refer some
books or you will get types of
statements so this is type in our
statement then we have prepared
statement and we have Colleyville state
statements I can how to work with that
you can use some books or you can use
online again YouTube is the best
education education school so you can
use this all this concept again you have
Java database JDBC seven steps then you
have all these paths so if you execute
this you will get some output again how
to do it
below you will be having some practical
link so click on that and you will get a
new video when I have used my laptop
legs to demonstrate how to use NetBeans
and to work with masculine so I hope you
got something from it so if you have any
doubts please post your comment and
please subscribe for further videos
thank you so much
