keyboard now we can use final keyword
with at three places we can use final
keyword with variables we can use final
keyword with methods or we can use final
keyword with class so let's try to do it
one by one with seat with variables
we'll see it with methods and then we'll
see it with a class so it's start with
the first one which is a variable so
let's say if I have so we have a class
here which is Class A in which I have
created a constructor which is doing
nothing here and then I'm creating the
object of a of course it will call the
constant right so if I create a variable
which is I and the initial value of I is
let's say zero and as soon as I create
the object I want to change the value of
I to ten so I can say I contend right
now since I is a variable here because
whenever you say I I mean whenever you
say a video type and something that's a
variable right and we are allowed to
change the value so I'm changing the
value of i from zero to ten and that's
working perfectly and if I try to print
the value of it if I say obj dot I and
it will print the value which is ten of
course because we are changing the value
of it right so as soon as we create the
object we are changing the value of I to
ten and that's why we are getting the
output as ten but how about if I make
this variable as final now as soon as
you make a variable final you can see we
are not we are not allowed to change the
value of weight it is giving you some
error here and if I go to that error it
says the final field which is a dot I
cannot be assigned because once you make
a variable final you cannot change the
value of it okay so that means if you if
you make a variable final it becomes a
constant okay so I mean why why to use
constant because there are certain
scenarios that you want to create a
variable whose value should not change
example when let's say we talk about a
value of pi' I mean we don't change the
value of pi' right let's say you want to
find the area of a circle now your
radius will change based on your radius
it will change your circumference but
value of pi will not change right so in
your code what you will do is you will
make your value pi constant so if you
need to make a constant will be using
final
we have said in the naming convention
video that when you when you talk about
a constant it should have all capital
letters so let's say if this is a
constant here let's say this constant is
my a date or a day so we'll say this is
a day right a date I want to say I want
to make a day as constant so I will make
it as day equal to 0 and even this will
be d and this will be day so we use a
capital letters for constants but again
the thing is once you assign the value
you cannot change it right but how about
if I if I change the value okay I mean
if I don't assign the value here I can
assign the value in constructor also so
once you assign the value then it
becomes constant example if I again try
to assign a value here which is let's
say 19 now it will give you a row
because you know it will give you error
because once you assign the value to a
constant you cannot change it okay so
that's the that's the use of final
keyword with the variable so once we
create a final variable it becomes a
constant now can I use final final with
our method let's try to do that so it
will remove all this stuff so what I
will do here is I will create a class I
will create a class okay B before that
we see with class ok can I can I use a
final with a class first of all why
would we create a class final it's
because let's say in this class okay we
don't have a constructor let's let's not
take a constructor here let me remove
this concept also so any class can
explain your class right so let's say
this you have created this class a way
back and then someone else is trying to
extend your class so when you extend a
class let's say if you actually a class
and in this class we have a function
which is our method which is probably
quite sure so you are providing this
feature which is show feature rights
because this this is your class a is
your class and in your class you have a
method which is show and you're printing
in show so anyone can extend your class
anyone can create a class B which
extends your class and they will take
all the credit side because if I create
object of B now the object can call show
and as a user you will think okay I'm
getting this show method from B but
that's not the case you are getting show
method from a so B is taking all the
credits here
so and there is add a certain scenarios
where you
don't want your class to be extended so
you can make your classes final because
as soon as you make your classes final
you can see it is giving you an error
now you cannot any other class cannot
extend your class so the reason why we
create a final class is so that no other
class can explain your class so we can
make a class final also but let's say
okay so point remember we can use a
final width variable which make it
constant you can use final with a class
which will make it not in a table and if
I remove that let's say I want I want
other class to extend my class but what
the other class is doing is other class
is creating its own method called a show
and they are overriding my method let's
say in NB show so they are trying to
override my method and that's I mean
initially it was okay they are using my
method which prints in a show that's
okay but now they are overriding my
method right which is wrong because if I
call show now it will call in B show
right they are taking all my credit
grades again so I don't want anyone to
override my my method so I can make it
as final because if I make a method
final no one else can override my method
you can see that it is giving you an
error that cannot override the final
method here so yeah that's it so that's
the conclusion one you can use final
width variable you can use final width
method and you can use final width class
so when you use a final width variable
it becomes a constant when you use a
final width or method no one can
override it
and when you use a final width class no
one can extend it so that's it that's it
from this video we have talked about
final thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
