and how to use for loop we can also talk
about Leafs now now if you remember in
Java when we talk about collection API
we have different we have we can create
leads to object right again we can use
added East here we can add the values
but when I know the values by default we
can use something like this right
otherwise we have to create object of
added ease and then we have to add this
value one by one by putting add add and
instead of that I can put all these
values here itself and then we can also
print the values so this is how you use
a for loop to work with least as well
right
now how can we use that in in in Kotlin
so what we can do is I can create so I
can save add nums equal to and in order
to create a list we can simply say at
least off and in this bracket you can
mention the values 1 comma 2 comma 3
comma 4 so once we got the values now
this nums is not a normal value this is
a list of values so with this list of
values we can print all the values the
way we can do that is by in fact first
of all it means to prove my point I will
say num start you can see we get all
these methods now connects from where
you're getting all this method so if I
say get and if I click on this get
method we can you see that it is coming
from collections
now when I say collections list is list
extends collections right so this is at
least a list of values here this is the
least so how do I print all the values
so I will say 4 and ok so 4 and then we
say I hold on I in nums now we can print
1 1 value here we can say not system dot
out dot println we have to say print n
itself and you can say I here the moment
you do that you can print all the values
let's see the output now ok and you can
see we got the output as 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 and
that makes sense right we got this
values within the list now you might be
wondering you know in Java we have this
option of using normal for loop as well
and then we use normal for though what
we can actually do is we can take the
entire list and we can iterate to the
enter into entire list using a normal
for loop and we can change the index
number and we can print the value both
in this case we are printing only values
what if you want to print index number
as well how can we do that here so what
we can do is this nums has a method
called as width index so with this width
index method it returns you two things
it returns you the index number it's
also in return you the value so what do
we do here is I will use I will use a
bracket I will represent that value
something like this I will say I which
will represent the index number and II
which would represent the element right
so all we can say values so we can say
element or values I can print the value
of I I can say dollar I I will put that
in double quotes I will put that in
double quotes so I will say the index
number first and then I will give a
comma of course I should end that here
as well and I will say dollar E so by
this what we are doing is we are
printing the index number and then we
are printing the element both let you
want this let's see what happens now and
you can see the output now we got the
index number and they got the element as
well so don't get you know don't feel
bad in Java we have now evolved loop
here we don't have that but we can do
everything which a normal for loop can
then with normal for loop can do in this
situation in this way so as you can see
numsa some ethical is with index and you
can print the index number and the
element both again we don't have to do
this every time the best way would bit
up with the things which we have done
before so that's how we can use lists
but let's imagine you have a map okay
let's imagine this is not a list this is
a map now if you remember in Java we
have a concept of map as well right
something like this so we have a map and
what we do in map is we have a key value
pair so we'll be having a key and then
we'll be having a value here example my
name here is a key and this this is an H
now thinks I'm an alien we don't have a
physical age we have a virtual age we
have our age depend upon the number of
hours we work so let's say we got this
543 this is my age and record one more
guy here who is Kishore and the age of
Kishore is 4 0 9 so this is key and this
is a value right now how can we do that
in how can we do that in in Kotlin
so what i will do here is I will
create a map now how do I create a map
here again we can use stream app or we
can you stream app we can use a hash map
whatever you feel comfortable with
timing I'm going for tree map just to
show you the example how we can use Java
in here okay so what do we do here is I
would say bad I would say aliens equal
to and I would say tree map okay
now this tree map will take two
parameters one will say this is I mean
it we have to specify the generic type
also right we have to specify a string
and ain't again we give it we give a
semicolon oh we are getting on a bit
onion semicolon there and you can see we
are getting an error error here now why
error it's because not three map is and
is a class right and it belongs to Java
package and we are working in Cortland
and in fact in Java also whenever you
want to use some classes which are not
there in default package we import them
right so what I will do is I will import
this so we can say control space after
the P it will import the package
automatically and you can see this
coming from Java dot util and this is
the power of Cortland you can actually
use Java code inside Cortland and we can
use quadrant code inside Java so yeah so
we can you can see we got where aliens
equal to three map and then we got the
object let me add some let me add some
values here the way you can add it it's
very simple we don't have to use any put
meter or something like that we can use
alien square bracket and you can specify
for name Naveen I want to assign the
value which is 543 which is the age of
Naveen and I will say aliens and we can
say this is Kishore and we can say
Kishore age is 4 0 9 so you can see we
got this name and age both so this is a
key value pair okay now how do you fetch
this value because in in Java we have to
use key set and using key said you will
get all the key values and once you got
all the key values you can fetch one one
value now cotton mix is easier for you
you can use and you can use a for loop
and there is a concept of tuples again
we don't use that double concept
incontinent but then what
couple means it holds two values so we
can give a back in fact we can have you
have done that before for four numbers
with index so what we can do is we can
say name gamma age and we can say in
aliens now what will happen is you it
will take two values so this numbs and
each has two values one it has a name
and which which is a key in this case
and this one is a is a value like so we
got a key and a value let's print both I
will say print Ln let me print a dollar
a name here which will plane the name
and I will say a colon and I will print
a dollar age which will print the age so
I'm printing name and age both so I'm
printing the age and name of an alien
it's that easy to work with map now if
you still don't know about map map is
basically used for creating of key value
pair and map is used actually a lot in
in the development in Android
development maybe if you are not using
map directly there are some classes
there are some objects which we use
which indirectly implements map let's
run this let's see what happens now okay
and you can see we got the output as
casual 4:09
and naveen 5 4 3 so that's how you can
use you can use map and in in Adlon so
yeah that's it from this video in the
next video we'll talk about something
else maybe we will see about exceptions
so that is something we can hang social
watching and do subscribe for further
