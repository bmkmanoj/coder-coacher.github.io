we'll talk about
tennety operator so if you if you have
used on each operator in C so you might
familiar with those operators in Java
also so Java is a paternity operator so
what exactly Tania operator is so let's
say I have a variable which is R here
with the value of I is 1 and I have J
value which is 5 ok and let me print the
value of J so if I print the value of J
here and if I run this so answer is 5
right but let's say I want to change the
value of J depend upon the value of I so
I can simply say if I is equal to equal
to 1 I can say J is equal to 6 else J is
equal to 7 so now it will print 6 or 7
so it will check ok the I value is 1
which simply means it is this is this
condition will be true it will change
the value of J and will make its X so
when you print this the value of J will
be 6 right so if I run this the answer
is 6 but how to convert this into a
complex code ok like so you want to make
it more know in one line so what you can
do is instead of writing this statement
here which is if-else statement you can
actually use a totally operator now to
use terminal ternary operator we can
simply say J equal to now what is the
value of J is it 6 or 7 so we can simply
check F or J is equal to I is equal to
equal to 1 if this condition goes true
so it will print 6 otherwise it will
bring 7 cool so instead of writing this
a line here we can simply specify this
thing so if this condition is true it
will execute the part after this
question mark if this condition is false
it will go directly after the colon
which is 7 again I fire on this now
again the a size 6 but let's say if I
change the value of 1 as 4 and now if I
done this so the answer is 7
right so this ternary operator is just a
replacement for a fence but hold on is
it really is it ternary operator really
a replacement for events let's try to
find out with the next example so for
now just just remember you can replace
your if-else condition with ternary and
we'll we'll try to prove it wrong so let
me remove this part and this awesome
now once you've got the idea about
ternary operator let me write a code
here again this code sum goes in
something in this way so let's say I
have an object okay so let's say famine
object here which is let's say o 1 okay
I will say obj 1 and 1/2 something
called or will say obj 1 and if we let
me check if if it is true so directly
I'm going for the condition which is
true if it is true then obj 1 is equal
to a new in teacher and we'll pass a
value let's say 1 and it's a but we pass
value 10 cool so if my the if my
condition is true it will it will assign
the value of 10 which is integer and in
else part what I will do is I will say
obj 1 equal to new integer and we can
pass not this time we'll go for a double
so we'll say double and let me pass 2015
dot 0 cool so I have this integer which
is 10 and if it is false if this
condition is false it will print double
but anyway since we are writing clue it
will always execute the first part but
let's see how what is the output and let
me print the value of obj one here and
if you print the value of obj one here
it will print n of course right is
because we are assigning a value which
is integer now if you try to convert
this code into ternary operator so since
we said that a ternary operator internal
replacement for if-else let me use one
more object here which is
- okay and let's try to write this in
Penry operator so how to write this we
have to say Oh Bridget - equal to if it
is true that's we know it will be always
true question mark if it is true we have
to return new integer with value ten :
new double width value 15.0 now question
arise what will be the output of obj -
so let me just run this and obj - now if
if your if this ternary operator is just
a replacement while if else it should
print and right let's see if we run this
the answer is 10.0 so for the if-else
output advances time for ternary
operator is 10.0 it's simply because
whenever you work with ternary operator
it will check the type of both the
values so this one also and this one
also whichever is maximum it will occupy
that type so by default this time here
this integer part here gets converted
into a double value and that's why the
output you are getting here is 10.0 cool
so that's the use of ternary operator
and there's a trick of using ternary
operator so thanks for watching this
