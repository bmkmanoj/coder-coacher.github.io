seen how to use for each method and how
to use method efference and this video
what we'll do is we'll remove this part
and let's go ahead with some new methods
let me remove this part also okay now
stir it now let's say I want to use the
same list and I want to print the values
by doubling all the values so what we
can do is we can double all the values
with the help of enhanced for-loop
now how to use an enhanced for-loop here
as we'll say
first we'll define our they find our
method variable which is result and by
default the value of this world will be
zero and then what we can do is we can
use enhanced for loop or a for loop or
the traitor to all the values we'll say
int I : and this values will be coming
from this values and then we'll say
result equal to result plus then it's I
into two so what we are doing is we are
doubling all the values and adding all
the values which will be stored in this
result or Y to double let's let's first
add all the values so we'll go by step
by step so let's add all the values now
in once you got this let's let's let's
print the value of result here and if I
say run you can see the output s is 21
right but hold on what we are doing here
we are achieving something called as
mutation here it's because the value of
result is continuously changed for six
time in fact seven time first is here
and then it will be changed for six
times just imagine how much mutation you
are going for so every time you meet
mutate our value it makes your system
unstable
maybe not unstable but you cannot
achieve concurrency here so to make your
system very fast you need to achieve
concurrency to achieve concurrency we
have to reduce the mutation here
okay so even if I multiply by two we are
achieving one more mutation which is I
into two so so if I done this you can
see the answer is 42 right but then
question is how to how to ignore this
and how to ignore mutation how can you
write a code without achieving mutation
so what we can do is in Java eight we
got something called as stream API so
stream API says what you want to print
values go ahead bring the values let me
just come in this part also because we
don't require variables result now okay
what you want to print print the values
go ahead print the values but know you
don't want to put in the values you want
to play in the stream of values now it
is frame stream is a new method
introduced in a collection interface on
this interface you can see if I go to if
I go to this stream it belongs to
collection interface and it's a default
method okay so it saw it what does what
this method will do is it will convert
your a collection into a stream now once
you got the object off stream here just
just have a look
this stream method returns you the
object of stream interface now what is
this stream interface here this
interface here let me check its
interface here if I go to stream yeah so
it's the interface which has multiple
methods will not go into the all this
methods here okay so it has multiple
methods and one of the method we have to
use here is to double the values we'll
we will use something else map so map
needs an object of function but instead
of using function object here we can use
lambda expression we can simply say for
every value of I for all the values of
this value values collection take one
value at a time which is I and apply the
operation which is 92 so this map will
give you a stream of values and on that
stream of values you have to apply you
need to find the addition of all the
now this reduce method will use object
of binary operator but in
self-organizing object we can simply use
a zero comma zero the initial value so
it will take two parameters when is the
initial value and then the manager
operator so we can use two values here
one will be C and E C means carry a
means a value and we can simply say C +
e okay and I'm damn sure you will not
understand anything in from this don't
worry I'm not I'm not here to scare you
I'm just showing you the way a stream
API can achieve the same operation
without mutation and in less number of
lines then you will say what they use
when we don't understand how to use it
hold on once you're done with this video
in the next video I will explain what
exactly this method interface or how
this map method works so if I run this
now you can see output is still 42
that means it's walking so this thing
here is same like this thing then
question right how is walk that we'll
see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
