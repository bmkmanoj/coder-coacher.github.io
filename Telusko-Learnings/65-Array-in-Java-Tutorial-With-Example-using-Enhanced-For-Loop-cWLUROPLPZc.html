a day now what we'll do is instead of
assigning these values to 6 8 4 1 let me
assign these values 1 2 3 4 5 om is 3 so
it's 3 4 5 now in order to print or you
know to save this value so we'll say it
should be a of 1 it should be a this is
a 2 3 and the transport and the value of
the last element when you fight now to
store these values we don't have to
assign it different differently what we
can do is we can use a for loop to
assign those values and we can run this
for loop again with the variable I it
will start with 0 and then we'll say
less than 5 and I plus plus that this 4
that will run 5 times right so what we
to do when to assign the value to add it
so we'll say a of I equal to what now if
I say a of I is equal to I it will store
the values from 0 to 4 what I want it
should be from 1 to 5 so what we can
simply do is we can say I plus 1 so this
is how we can assign the values and that
this is how we can print the value so if
I run this code now so the output is
it's 1 2 3 4 5 simple now so this is so
this is one way of printing added right
so we have we can use this this for loop
now since we are printing this values
from the first element to the last
element about how would I know the
length of array say this I am writing 5
here right is because I know the value
now but what if I do not know the size
of the array so what we can simply do is
we can use a property of array which is
called as length so if you say a dot
length it will go to the last element
which is 5 so it will say I less than
equal to 5 so this is the property of
padding now so so let us print this in a
different way now this is called as
normal for loop right so if you are
about if you know I have one of my video
on something called as enhanced for loop
so what is enhanced for loop instead of
using of normal forward low barrier to
specify the starting point and the
ending point why we should do this
what
taken take an array pick up the first
element go to your last element I don't
know what a number of values I have just
go to the array and fetch so what we can
do is instead of writing I integral to
zero what we can simply do is we can say
int I pick up all the values from array
a so what it will do it will go to a it
will fetch the first element I it will
print so instead of a of I I so it will
go to a it will fetch the first element
and print the value again loop will
increment it will face the second value
and print it will face the third value
and print so if you don't know what is
announced for now we can jump to my one
of my video called as enhanced for loop
in Java in that you will understand what
is enhance for them so if I run this
code now so these are the values clear
so you can use normal for loop or you
can use enhanced for loop now they only
drawback here is it is you need to start
from the first and two you have to go to
the last but if you are using a for loop
you can specify the starting range and
ending point clear so yeah so this is
this is what this is how we can fetch
values and print values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
