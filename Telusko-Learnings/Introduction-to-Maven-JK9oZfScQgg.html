it spring right so we start with
spraying code but before styling with
spraying we have to talk about some
lovelies we have to import now many when
you work with any framework maybe
hibernate or spraying our skirts you
have to use you have to input some
Lebanese now this library is are your
dependencies right because you cannot
achieve hibernate or you cannot work
with hibernate without libraries you
cannot work with spring without
libraries so we have to input all this
libraries right so the first the first
issue here is we have to download we
have to import those values the second
problem is whenever you make an
application so to make the application
you have to create a project structure
then you have to compile by structure
you have to create a zip file on a Val
file now to import those libraries and
to create a zip for zip code what we
need here we can simply you know we can
use a very tool maybe our ant very cool
all babban so using mavin so this is
this opposite of Mallon so using map and
you can you can import all the others
you can create a project structure so in
navin we have lots of templates in build
templates
now this templates are called as arc
types okay so in Miami terminologies if
you talk about mavin so we have
archetype so what is our time so this re
or what you say they are your templates
then we have artifact so artifact is
your project name so if your project
name is let's say
tusks or telescope so that will be your
artifact then you have something called
as group ID so your package name so when
you say so every software need to have a
unique package so if you have worked on
android so when you deploy a package or
APK files on please tow your package
need to have a you know a fixed group ID
or a package name so for me it is called
dot tusks okay so that should be your
name so let's say blue ID so you have
three terms here we have one is
archetype which is basically a
template you have a artifact ID which is
your project name and then you have a
group ID which is your package name so
you basically you have these three parts
now if you talk about the template so
for different if antenna projects like
example if they have a string project
you have a web project you have maybe a
normal Kojo application for different
different things we have different
different templates so when you work in
a band so I will give you all the list
so manager has a central depository
somewhere so in that Central Depository
they have lots of templates which is
often they have all the libraries so if
we're talking about hibernate so they
have hybrid liabilities if we talk about
spring they have spring libraries so any
future if you have any new framework
maybe a PC framework so that ABC
framework will make sure that their
libraries is there invalid okay now how
can how to import those strategies by by
using maven so what we can do is you can
create a mammoth project and again we
will discuss that how to create a
mammoth project when we start with the
coding part so step one you have to
create a gravid project well in Eclipse
so you have you can you can use multiple
you can use any of the IDE available you
can use eclipse you can use NetBeans you
can use our behind we have IntelliJ
cigar box of ites
so let's say we are using Eclipse so in
Eclipse what we can do is of create a
project not a normal project but I'm
avid project so create a maven project
do you clean the mouth oh it will
give you a list of our time so after
selecting archetype for us it I will be
using a web app out of time so by
selecting web app so when you when you
finish the project or video grantee
project structure so you'll be getting a
purge structure I get how to what is the
exact structure that we'll discuss when
we start with the practical so in the
present structure there will be a file
for the spawn dot XML which is P om
which is project object model rights
so let's say you want a spring library
so in that XML file just mention I want
a spring library not actually you have
to do you have to make sure you have you
are using a tag type of things so you
have to use some tags is in which you
have to specify our spring lab use what
probably will notice it will go to the
central repository a remote repository
basically and then it will download all
the required languages amazing thing
right so you don't have to go to spring
like spring website to download those
that is you have to go to speak fabulous
you have to go to spring website to copy
that
thank you what you need again what an
exactly is that we'll see in the
practical so you have to do some some
modification in that file let's say you
want hybrid fabulous just update your P
om dot XML file giving it all the hybrid
values and as advantage of using ramen
so in the practical layer saw in the
further tutorials I will be building a
spring application using mavin so first
we'll learn what is how to work with
Pamela and then we'll move towards this
spring part clear so I hope you have
basic idea of what gravity is not
something very different is just a build
tool okay so don't be so and also don't
get so much attention so that's it so in
this video and the further details will
die if you start with the practicals so
