different ethical learnings and in this
video we'll talk about constructors now
if you remember in our earlier videos we
have talked about class and object right
we have seen that in brave now let me
just go for a quick recap for that and
then we can talk about constructors so
in in Cortland we can actually create we
can actually create a class the way we
do in Java so I can get a plan score as
a lead here
again I will start with a human class
will go to alien later so let's say we
have this human class here and then in
this human class we have some functions
now how do we define a function we say
function and we say let's say walk so we
walk we have we have a function which is
a walk and our may be think so every
human thanks right of course we have a
brain so we should use it right so in
your thinking so of course we can think
anything you want so I will say playing
- Ln so what I'm thinking now is okay I
would say Kotlin is awesome so this is
what I'm thinking in my mind now now how
do we create object of this class so we
have this human class right I want to
call this thing so the way you can do
that is by saying where again you can
use VAD or you can use Val or if you use
where that means you can change the you
can change the object later so we'll
keep it red now and we'll say this name
as let's say Navi am in human I'm you
can I mean also an alien but then you
should have an human right so let's say
now if you remember in Java we use new
keyword in quatrains we don't have to do
that we can simply say human and we can
give up like it that's that we got an
object the way you can call them is by
saying I mean dot think and if I don't
this code you can see I mean you can see
in time way and okay so can you see that
we got the or we got the output as
Kotlin is awesome now that's great right
now question arise if you remember in I
mean in C++ or Java maybe in operating
every object-oriented programming
there is one thing which is common and
that one thing is called as a
constructor right now how do we use
constructors here now first of all what
is constructor so whenever you create an
object object calls the constructor I
mean the object creation
actually cause your constructor so we
don't have to call a constructor right
now one more thing constructor has the
same name in Java Mumbai in Java we have
constructors which are the same name as
as class name but in Quadrant we have
some difference we don't have to create
another another type or another method
which which has the same name as class
name so don't you don't think we will be
lighting something like this I mean of
course in your mind daily there will be
some thoughts right we have to create a
constructor something like this now this
is not how we write constructors in
Cortland now what we can do is how do we
create a constructor here so okay so we
got this constructor right let's say I
want to pass some parameters and how do
we pass a parameter here so let's say I
have a name I have a name as a variable
here and the type of variable I'm
creating here can you see that I am
putting semicolon everywhere
that's a java habit have okay so we got
a string and then by default is blank
what I want is I want to assign this
value name from here so when I create
this object human I want to assign the
name I would say I want to assign a name
which is Naveen which is capital n in
this case how do I pass this value here
there is one way you can do that is by
creating a constructor now how do we how
do you get a constructor we can say
constructor and in this constructor you
can actually specify a value so we can
say we have a VAD which is taking a
string argument so we say well name
equal to or name : of tied string right
okay so we can see we have a same name
so that will be an issue so time being
what I will do is I will use this as
maybe n for that for that for timing so
we can save at any colon string and then
we can assign n here so whatever value
you have assigned here that will go here
and then we'll print my name as well
here of course right I use a bad thing
so I can say dollar name so whatever
what I will get is courtliness awesome
Devine and now I fit on this code and
then I'm expecting that output now let's
see which is well if you are getting
that output so we can say regard
Cortland is awesome Devine right so what
we are doing here is we are creating an
object of human and then we are passing
the beam there and what we are doing is
we when you pass that naveen it go
- this string it is variable N and then
we are assigning that n to name and then
you're printing it so the way you can
create a constructor in Cortland is by
using this keyword called as constructor
and you can pass a variable but then
this doesn't look that attractive right
now when you say coordinates a new
language it should have some attractive
things Y even we have to use this
keyword constructor here so Cortland
says okay if you don't want to use that
keyword that's fine the only thing is if
you are using some modifiers like if you
mention public if you are using public
modifier here then that key word becomes
compulsory but if you don't have any
modifier if you want to keep it default
you can remove that keep order even if
you don't mention the keyword that's
fine this is your constructor let's
verify let's run this code and you can
see we're getting the output here which
is codling is awesome Devine right so to
get a constructor that constructor
keyword is actually not necessarily we
can directly say a bracket round bracket
after the class name and this is your
constructor now is it the only way can I
create the constructor inside the class
as well and the answer is yes so the
constructor which we have created now is
called as a primary constructor so
whatever we have created now is called
as primary constructor we can also
create secondary constructor but how
that we'll see in the next video but
then let's say if I don't want to pass
this value I want I don't want to pass a
value do we have any solution for that
now if you remember in when we when we
talked about methods our functions
before we can actually assign a default
values right so let's say if I don't
pass any value I want to say the value
is a P right so we can do that you can
so you can see if even if you don't pass
the value that's fine
if you don't pass the value the default
value will be P let's try this out if
you run this code you can see we got the
output as cotton is awesome so if you
are passing if you don't want to pass a
value you have to make sure that you
give a default values right so default
values also are default parameters also
works here but then if you don't specify
default then you have to pass something
I will pass now in here but then is it
the only way of carrying constructor no
right we already have we have always
seen that we have
memory constructors and we have
secondary constructors but how to use
that that we'll see in the next video so
that's it thank you so much for watching
