reverse words in a string now what we
want here let's say we have a string as
my name is Naveen and the output we want
here is Naveen is name my so we want to
reverse the we don't want to reverse the
string but we want to print days ago we
want to print the words in reverse order
now to achieve that the first thing we
need here is a string STR which is
string STR equal to in double quotes
will mention my name is nubbin and so
now the first thing we need here is we
got a string now first we need to
convert this string into a string a day
so that we can do us so we'll create a
string array as a and how to convert
this spring into an array so we can
simply say STR dot and winds we can
simply set your dot there's a method
called as split ends for string and this
plate will say okay I will split the
words but tell me the exact point where
we have to split so I will say okay
after every space you have to split so
my is one word name is one word and then
is which is is and now it okay now the
array consists of four elements now if I
try to print this so let's let me use a
for loop to print the element I will use
a father will start which starts with 0
and then which it will end at a dot
length I mean less than a dot length and
I pig I plus plus I will just print the
values here just to see the splitted
values so I will simply print the value
of a for that particular element and it
will also print a space make sure you
are not using print Ln your using print
because printer will Ellen will print on
new line so we want on the same line
right so for this application you can
see it is my name is Naveen simple but I
don't want to print in a normal form and
I want to print in Reverse format so
there are multiple ways to do that the
first way will go for
so when you print printed the values
here we have we are printing from the
first value to the last value here what
we'll do is we'll do reverse so we'll
start with a dot length so if my number
of variables or number of values are
four I want to start with three so we'll
say minus one the next is I greater than
equal to zero and I - - we are going
into the worse format and then we'll
print the values instead of yeah so
we'll use print well print a of I with a
space and now fear on this application
you can see it is
oh it's printing on the same line I need
to print the second statement the new
line so I will simply use a new line
statement there and you can see it
prints my name is Naveen and the second
line is knowing is my name so that's how
you can reverse a number so does the one
does it first way we can we can do this
otherwise what we can do is ensure
directly printing the values we can
create one more string and within this
string as string str1 which is initially
blank and the initial of directly
printing like we can assign the value to
string one so with a string one equal to
string one plus the value of I or the
value of a Plus this space and then at
the end we'll be printing the value for
STR one simple and now if I run this you
can see it prints my name is Naveen and
now it is my name so that's how you have
to reverse a string or the worst words
in our string so that's it thanks for
