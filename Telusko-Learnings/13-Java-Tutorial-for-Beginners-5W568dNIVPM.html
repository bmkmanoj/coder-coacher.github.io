start with the first session of Java now
in this series we have lots of videos
and all this video will cover the
content of core Java ok so let's start
with the first part now anybody learn
any language you should know something
about that language right and that
something is polish history now the why
history is so important is because it
defines the evolution of Java or if
defines the evolution of that language
right so if you know the past of the
language you will know the present and
it will signifies your future in that
language
now Java was created by sun microsystems
so sun has a team in which the lead was
taken by james gosling so he has created
a language which is platform independent
now this isn't for a job or creating a
java language it's at that time they
need a language which will be a platform
independent language right so they came
up with the language was oak so in 1991
they came up with oak then in 1995 they
wanted to make a patent on you know they
wanted some legal rights on that on that
technology cause I spoke so the problem
was oh you cannot use any whatever US
oak there was some problem so they came
up with a term they came up with a name
for this Java so from 1995 till then we
have a neighbors Java now Java the main
features of Java is its platform
independent
some of the most important language in
today's IT world is Java is because all
these cloud servers are always secured
websites
Mobile's they all use Java if you
install if you install JDK you will see
it returns three billion three million
devices use this Java now those devices
are mobile devices there are computer
devices there are embedded devices like
your like you have smart card then you
have your AC's fridge so all these have
Java implemented right
so Java is everywhere now if we talk
about Android phone which Java right so
if you know Java it's very its
benefit you in many ways first if you
know Java you will know different
languages right it's very important you
know when you when you learn one
language completely other language are
very easy okay
so if you learn Java you know you will
know c-sharp like because C shop is the
exact copy of Java
so like the volution start with C
programming so are they I used to have C
programming then we came up with C++
then now we have Java so let's start
with a simple core of Java now in this
course of this well we have this
sequence of the chore we have collation
of this lectures so this is the first
part again most of the part will be on
my computer screen because Java is
political technical oriented language
so maybe between you will be having my
assertion otherwise all this video will
have a a consolable programming or you
have this screen casting you can sleep
so I will be using my screen to do that
okay so basically some theory part will
cover on Bowl otherwise everything will
be on that computer screen okay so when
you talk about Java are my main focus in
this collection will be the cool part of
Java which is your coach out the coach
are simply means this is the programming
term of Java now when you talk about
dotnet so dot need is a platform right
and we have baby as language we have say
Chavez language so these are languages
VVC shop is languages don't need is a
framework for the platform in the same
way in Java also you have platform and
you have languages the good part is Java
itself is a language Java itself is a
platform it's a combined pipe right so
cool job ideas with the programming part
of Java
otherwise when you talk about advanced
Java then we have to talk about those
frameworks then you have to talk about
some implementations Kochiyama days with
the programming part right and not that
difficult but you have to cover them so
we have Co job now when I talk about Co
Java it's it's you know everything
starts with some some keywords the very
talk about Java you have to focus you
know you have to keep in mind you have
to think about keywords you have to
think about some some way of compiling
some way of running the code now when
you talk about Java the most important
Java has is called as its dot Java file
now whenever you create a Java code you
have to make sure you have da Java file
then to to run any java application you
need something or less JVM now JVM is
something where you can run your virtual
event where you can run your java
applications now see if you say you have
a software now that particular software
works only on the particular hardware
right now if you want if you like a java
application you need a Java machine you
need a Java hardware right but practical
you don't have a Java hardware you have
the normal normal Universal compatible
hardware so in that on that hardware you
have a layer and that layer is JBM it is
Java Virtual Machine so this should be
installed on your machine ok so when we
talk about java application it will work
on those machines in which you have JVM
so let's suppose if I buy a new laptop
it will support Java only ap digit if it
has JVM so Windows by default handshape
you leanness by default heads even
that's why Java applications are
platform independent right we have to
convert this Java file we have to
compile it right and when you compile
this code using compiler we have to use
some compiler so when you compile this
code you will get dot class file now
this dot class file is your pipe put
also called as pipe code and this
bytecode will go to JVM to get the
output point so when you want to learn
your application so application will be
run on JVM but you have to compile you
have to create a by cut out of it so
this is your dot dot class file so first
you have to create a dot Java file
when you have to create a dot class file
by compiling it then you have to run it
again how to do all these things we will
see on practical implementation right
then now now if we talk about a simple
Java code you have to focus on this
thing whenever you create a simple java
application you require a class
okay now class still I suppose we have X
in this class you should have um you
should have something right so now when
you going to talk about this class you
might be knowing about oops concept so
when we talk about jaycation you have to
get a class in this class will be having
something write some data members or
some like data members like variables or
some methods so exactly how to implement
all this thing we will see in our
computer implementation okay
so when you talk about Java you have to
focus on this part again we will be
saying each and every part in computer
based thing but theoretically you should
know you have to put in a john dot java
file you have to create a dot class file
you have to you have to use something
called as JVM so Java file class file
and JVM
so we will see how to implement this in
computer so hope you hope you understand
this concept now - please do subscribe
for the coiler videos ok and if you want
the links for downloading java we will
find the link below thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
