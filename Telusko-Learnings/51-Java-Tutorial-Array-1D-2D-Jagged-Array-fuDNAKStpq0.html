so once we have seen the theory of a day
so we have talked about one dimension a
day we have talked about two dimensional
array and why we even need an a day
because if you have multiple elements
and you want to ensure storing those
elements in two different variables we
can use one common variable where you
can store all the values so let's try to
implement that in a practical scenario
here so let's say I want to create an
array of integers so I would simply say
I have to say integers ain't I mean I
will use end of nums
equal to in Java added an object so we
have to use a new keyword and we'll use
a int to specify the size of an array
let's say I want an array of four
elements now it is composite to define
the size of an array because if you miss
to define the size of an array it will
give you error now once you say for this
size is fixed as soon as you write this
line so inside your inside your JVM you
can see in your heap memory something
happens in this way
so inside your heap memory you got this
you got this box where you have these
four boxes so the first box will have 0
in fact all the boxes will have 0 is
because since we are getting adding of
int so if you create or adding like that
it will create add it off and with all
the values as 0 just to prove my point
what I will do is I will I will print
the values so if I want to print the
values I would simply say system dot out
dot println let me pick up any value so
let's say I want to pick up the third
box there the third box index number
would be too because index number starts
with 0 right so you can see the first
box is 0 then we have 1 then we have 2
then we have 3 so I want to fetch the
third box which is this - which is -
right so if you if you write - you'll be
getting the output which is say we are
getting 0 now why 0 is because the the
value by default is 0 now let's I don't
want the values to be 0 I want my own
values there so what we can do is we can
specify the values individually here so
we can say in nums of 0 i want to assign
the value let's say 8 then we can say
num start 1 we can specify 12 we can say
nums
of 2 we can specify 76 and I mean any
value will do here I'm just specifying
the values so if I say 3 let's say 54
just to have that all numbers
not in sequence so we have 812 for 76
and 54 so we have all this numbers and
you're fetching only two here so if I
fetch two it will of course give you 76
right because we are fetching the value
of this second element which is of
course I mean third element which is in
terms of two so we called 76 now we can
also change the value I mean we can
change the value right once you define
it we can also change it we can say nums
of two we can again change the value
because anyway this array is variable
right so you can change the values of it
so as soon as I write this line I mean
after this line you can see the box
there it has value eight 12 76 and 54
but as soon as you line write this line
you can you can see the change there so
now 76 becomes 99 and that's why when
you fetch this value it will give you 99
simple but what will happen if I try to
print so let's say I don't have I don't
have a value at forth location because
the size of my array is 4 and I'm trying
to access the fifth location now and you
can see outside the box we have nothing
so I put on this code it will give you
an array which is array index out of
bounds exception because there is
nothing nothing after that box right it
only has four elements and you're trying
to fetch the 5th element here so what if
I assign our values to norms of 4 equal
to 77
will it work now you can see while if I
run this code now you can see we got the
error on this line itself on line number
13 we cannot assign the value there now
let's say I have assigned all the values
I want to print all the values now to
print all the values we have to say
number of 0 then we have to say num nums
of 1 then you have to say in terms of
two and I'm sorry right so sure if I
think four lines what we can do is we
can write only one line here we can say
for int I which will start with 0
because adding starts with 0 and will
end I it will give a semicolon there
else will say end at 4 because we have
to end at 3 right so we have to say less
than 4 we don't have to specify equal to
sign there and then we can simply say
nums of i so it will print all the
values i can as you can see we got we
got 8 1276 and 54 so using a for loop we
can print all these all the values here
in fact in the next video where we will
also talk
would enhance for the witches they knew
not knew exactly it was it is there from
a long time so we got one more way of
printing the values from default from
the Attic called as enhanced for-loop
we'll see that later okay so this is how
you use a one dimensional array so this
is one D added now there's one more
thing here when one when you know the
value is predefined when you already
know the values instead of saying new
int we can also specify the value here
itself we can say 8 comma 12 comma 76
comma 54 so if you know the value spree
hand instead of knitting this this thing
here we can directly assign the values
even if I long this code now it will
give the same output so that's how you
can create an array one dimensional
array you can print it in fact we can
also create the object I mean the array
of objects example if I have a class
here and if I have class student' and I
want to create in this student to have
two things we have a roll number and we
have string name what we can do is we
can create multiple objects here of
student we can say student s1 equal to
new student that's the first object I
have again we can specify the values
there but let's see if I create multiple
objects here if I'm creating four
objects this is as true this is s3 this
is s4 so if I'm creating four objects
here I can create instead of that I can
create the object of students I will say
as I really use a square bracket then I
will say new student okay I specify I
have four students here and in this s in
fact we can issue of writing this line
we can also specify s 1 comma S 2 comma
S 3 comma s4 ok so we are creating the
added off students so I will recommend
you to do some experiment with this you
will get the exact point what I'm
talking about in fact you can also apply
a for loop here and you can do that also
so once we got the array of student let
me remove that so this is your one
dimensional array and we have seen how
to use it in the next we'll talk about
two-dimensional arrays
now once we know what is one dimensional
array let's move towards two-dimensional
array so just to define that what I will
do is so let me create an array let's
say this array is let's say a so I have
this a array and which has a certain
value so let's say I want to assign a
value which is 1 2 3 4 so I have this
array which has four values right so
instead of creating 4 variables so
instead of creating 4 variables I'm
using one addy
now let's say we have one more array
which is B and the values of B is 2
comma 4 comma 6 comma 8 and then we have
one more array here which is C which has
let's say 5 comma 6 comma 7 comma H so
these are the values I have so I have 3
arrays and we have 4 values in each
receive instead of creating 4 variables
I have created one array right so
instead of creating 3 arrays can I
create one big adding we can do that so
you can see we can create a table we'll
name this as D now this D is a
two-dimensional array because this will
this is an array which will not have
simple values so D itself will have
small small arrays so D will have a
comma B comma C and the values of a is
not just a it is so that's your first
array then in the second array what we
have is and the next array which you
have here will have values which is 5
comma 6 comma 7 comma 8 right so we got
this two-dimensional array which has
array I mean we which itself has an
added ok so now what if what if what if
I say system dot out dot println D of 0
so when I say D of 0 it is representing
the whole array here okay so Diop 0 that
means the first row so you can imagine
this thing as a row and column so this
is first row second row third row and
then we got columns so we got 1 2 5 2 4
6 these are columns so if I say D of 0
it is the whole row right so I don't
want the whole row I want this second
element from the first row so I can
specify the second element as 1 so first
row second column so we have to specify
0 comma 1 and if i underscore you get
the output as - okay that's that's the
way
if you want to put into all the elements
what we can do is we can use a for loop
and now this for loop so the outer for
loop we'll use this for loop for the
number of rows to count a number of rows
semicolon less then we have three those
rights are going to use three and we say
I plus plus define the number of photos
and we require one more for loop there
which is in J equal to zero and J less
than equal to not equal to let's say I
have four and then J plus plus so the
inner loop will be counting the number
of columns so this loop will count the
number of rows and this local corner
number of columns and now if I want to
print so I will not use println I will
only use print to specify the particular
form because if I use print L then what
will happen is if I specify the of I and
J which will change in some time if you
run this code and if you if you run this
you can see we are getting all this
output here
I don't want output in a linear format
so what I want is here it should print
only in the same line with some space of
course and after this inner fondo we can
print a new line so that we can get the
perfect structure so you can see we got
one two I mean we got the same blocks
here right now how exactly is walking
just let's run through a loop so you can
see this image we haven't added there so
in this array in this box I mean we have
a square box where you have three rows
and four columns so all the values by
default are I mean we have all the back
all that if all the values there one two
three four then all these values so
initially when you have I and J so I
value will be 0 and J value will be 0 so
it will point to the first box which is
1 so it will fetch the value as 1 then
the loop increments your J becomes 2 I
mean J becomes 1 so it is fetching 0 1
which is the first row second element
which is 2 and then your J becomes 2 it
will fetch 3 your J becomes 3 it will
fetch 4
now once it once you are fetching for
you can see we don't have any element
after that it will jump to the second
row so when you say your jump into
second row that means your I value now
becomes 1 and then we can again your J
value becomes 0 so you are fetching 2
then you can cream in increments it
fetch 4 and then 6 and then 8 so that's
how it will fetch all the values from 2
a dimensional array so in
two-dimensional array we can have the
address of same size
now what if I if I change the size if
what if I say this is six okay I'm not
sure I mean in the first row I have four
elements in the second row I have three
elements and they fit in the third row
let's say I have I have five elements
now in this scenario since the number of
columns are not fixed we cannot say for
year right because the number of rows
are fixed so we can say three we cannot
say for year so what we'll do
I will say D of I I mean for that
particular row so if I say D of I so it
will be either this or that will depend
upon the I value I want to fetch the
length of that row and it showed three
year we can also say D dot line so it
will give the number of rows to you so
it will give number of rows I mean the
number of arrays you have first add a
second array throat array so it will
give you three and here depend upon on
which added you're working with or if
you are working with the first array
when your I value is 0 it will return
for if your value is 1 it will return 3
when your I value is 3 it will return 5
and if I'm this code you can say this
you got this type of output so this type
of array where you have the number of
columns are not fixed are normally
called jagd
arrays so if you have all the columns as
same that means it is it is normal to D
adding but if you have different size of
the column that will be your jag daddies
so the only precaution you have to take
his this precaution here ok so that's it
that's how you use two dimensional array
and jag daddy
in the next video we'll talk about
enhanced for-loop so that's it thank you
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
