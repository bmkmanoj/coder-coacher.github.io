increment so for that let me remove
everything let me just put the value of
let me print the value of I for that way
to define I here so we'll say I equal to
1 so the initial value of I here is 1
and if I done this code you can see the
value is 1 right now let's say I want to
add I by 1 so I can simply say I equal
to I plus 1 in a standard way or we can
use shorthand by saying I plus equal to
1 there is one more way to do it we can
also say I plus plus so anyway you say I
plus plus it will add I by 1 so if
you're insured al U of I is 1 it will
add I by 1 and you will get two so I
plus plus will give you - how about I -
- if I learn this it will be subtracting
I with one you will be getting busy you
will be getting 0 so that is that's how
you increment and decrement a value by
one simple but with this we also have
something called as let's say we have I
plus plus and we are just running this
during this and you are getting value as
- right now what happens if I comment
this ok and here I am saying I plus plus
to give again let us give a guess if you
run this code you are expecting a value
maybe - right because you can do I plus
plus here or you can do I plus plus here
doesn't matter the output should be two
right and when you run this code and we
are getting 1 why is the case it's
because this thing here which is I plus
plus is called as post increment which
simply means this this is called as post
increment which simply says this
operation here will do two things first
it will fetch the value of I the current
value of I which is 1 and it will then
increment so for printing it will give
only 1 so it will first fetch the value
and then increment that's what is far as
post increment after the operation
increment then you will say so we do so
we have post increment so we should also
have pre increment right and you are
right you can also use pre increment so
in pre increment it will first increment
the value then it will assign the value
so you can see if I run this code it is
two so this thing here is called as pre
increment so whenever you say I plus
plus that's your post increment whenever
you say plus plus I that's your pre
increment okay just to demonstrate this
example more let's create one more
variable which is J and the initial
value of not no value for J initially
will simply say J equal to I plus plus
and I shall printing the value of I
let's print the value of J so let's
let's get let's try to guess it
so when you say you up saying J equal to
I plus plus so it's this since this is a
post increment it will first fetch the
value so the value for J will be 1 and
then it will increment the value of I to
2 so if you are printing J it will print
1 let's also print the value of J so
that's also in the value of I so first
I'm printing the value of J and then I
and if I run this so the value of J is 1
the value of I is 2 but what if I say
plus plus I it will be both to write so
because it is it will first increment
the value and then assign the value
simple so that's how you have to use pre
and post increment but there's a catch
here what if if I say I equal to I plus
plus I will say okay we don't have J so
let's remove J from here and let's move
J now what will happen with this we need
to work let's see now we have I equal to
I plus plus so it will first fetch the
value which is 1 so it will assign 1 to
I and then it will say plus plus so it
will increment the value of I to 2 so
the last value of I should be 2 and will
run this code each one again why is the
case so will solve this mystery in the
next example yeah so make sure you watch
