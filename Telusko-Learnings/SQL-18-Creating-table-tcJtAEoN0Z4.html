manipulate existing table data using DML
queries in next few tutorials you are
going to see how do we define the table
structure using some DDL commands that
is data definition languages so the
first in that is we are going to see
about how do we create a table in Oracle
SQL so in order to specify or to create
a table we first specify the list of
column names that a table will have and
along with the data type for each column
that is the most basic or simplest
example structure that we can have for
creating table we can also specify some
of the default values for each column
that is optional case and if applicable
we can specify some of the constraints
for each of the column for now we will
see some of the details of how do we
specify column names and their data
types in the subsequent tutorials we
will see about specifying a default
values and specifying constraints so in
the most basic form the syntax for
creating a table is create table table
name then within a brackets we just
specify a name of column and it set a
type column data type and so on so one
of the simplest example would be create
table then table name employee then we
specify employee or employee number with
iterator APIs number then name and its
leader type and so on let's just try to
execute this yes so it is getting
created so right now this table is just
created and it does not contain any data
so if we just write a select star from
employee it will give us empty result
okay so before going for that we will
just quickly discuss about some of the
data types that are available in Oracle
okay so basically there are four types
of data types that are available number
one that is scalar then composite
reference and the user-defined types
scalar are something that are we are
going to mostly going to use this
composite and reference and let's say
use your different attacks all these
three are mostly in case of pl/sql so
for now our focus will be only on the
scalar data types that are mostly can be
considered as that hold a single value
you can see
single well for one column and in case
of composite reference and is a
different area types they can hold
multiple values okay we'll just have a
quick over through with scholarly types
there are basically four scalar data
types that is numeric types that are
available character data types datum and
lob that is large objects in case of
numeric I have just given out some of
the list of the relatives that are
available within each data type but this
list is not exhaustive I have just
included some of the most widely used
did a types in it so in numeric the
available are number int integer decimal
float and double in character we have
care where care to and n where cut we
also have n care for that matter it is
for fixed length so if I say care of six
that means the value that will be store
will occupy six character space so even
if I specify the value as ABC it will be
stored as ABC along with three spaces so
it will always use number of characters
that are being assigned to it
where care if I specify where care to of
six then it means that is the character
length is up to six means a value can be
a one character to character or up to
six characters so each column did not
take necessarily six characters but up
to six and n where care to and anchor
are both are similar to character and
where care to but these two just
provides us a capability to have
multiple language support then we have a
date related data types
the first one is date that is used to
store a date value timestamp we use this
retype if you want to store date along
with of time and interval it is used to
store difference or interval difference
between not exact date we can say two
days three months sort of things and the
last data types are large object types
that is blob blob blob club that is
first one is binary large objects
character large objects a blob and club
are usually used to store the binary
files so in this case if you want to
store an image file a song file or any
other documents file then what we can
use is blob data type and if you are
going to store a text-based information
that is a txt file
then we use a glob if you want to store
information such as Microsoft Word and
Excel then cloth cannot be used we have
to use block because Sulabh only
supports characters or a text based
information it does not hold information
about let's say fonts and the font size
and all those things so if you want to
store a file such as a PowerPoint or
over document then you should go for
below that is block envelope as the name
suggests it's a sort of collaborative
only with a multiple language support
and be fine it is used to store the
reference of a file means in this case
in first Street or log data types what
we used to do is what we actually do is
we store the file in our data DEP
database but in this case we do not
actually store file in database but it
is stored in our underlying operating
system and B file is just used to
reference that file ok so with this
information we can go on to our create
table syntax
suppose I wanted to add another column
to this let's say manager ID and that is
also number
it will give an error because if the
table is already created you cannot have
another table with same name say if you
want to create this table employee then
we'll have to first drop the existing
table okay so once the table is dropped
we can create a new table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
