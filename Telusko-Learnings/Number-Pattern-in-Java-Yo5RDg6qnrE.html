to print this pattern okay so we have
already done lots of coats for pattern
in Java now this is one of the code
we'll be focusing today now so before
starting with this we'll try to print a
pattern which is this one 1 then 1 2 1 2
3 and 1 2 3 4 so if you can print this
one then we'll move towards this example
now for this what we need is we require
a for loop in fact we require an extra
for loop so I will start with 1 and then
I mentioned for there because we want to
print for those since we have 4 dozier
so we have to say I equal to 1 and I
will go to 4 and in each row we want to
print some elements so we require one
more for loop which is nested for loop
here and which will start with J so J
will start with 1 now J will go till the
value of I because if I if I go till 4
it will print 4 values I just want to
bring the number of values we depend up
on number of rows so for the first show
it will print only one for second
regular plain tools for thought oh it
will plain three and the fourth row will
be plenty for for that we need to print
so it's not a Len being to print the
value of J because J is incrementing
continuously and then we'll provide a
space there and after the astral for
after the inner father we have to give a
new line and now if we run this you will
see the output is this one so you can
see 1 and then 1 2 and then 1 2 3 and 1
2 3 4 so that's this is what we got here
right but this time we are focusing on
this example right we want to print this
pattern so this is one there is one
difference between this pattern and this
pattern and this pattern the below
pattern we are just printing the values
but in the above pattern first we have
to print this spaces so from here to
this point we have some spaces from this
point at this point we have spaces and
we have a space here so that means
before printing the actual values we
need to
spaces so this for dope is responsible
to print values ID so before this farlap
way to use a one more for loop which
will plane spaces so we start with K so
that the counter will be K here so k
will start with 1 now k will start with
one I it will go tell so in the first
row we are way we want to print three
stars right in the second row where to
print only two stars in the sorry two
spaces in the third row wait to print
one space so for that instead of
starting with maybe one we'll start with
three and we'll say less greater than
equal to I and K minus minus and for all
this is not printing a space let me
print a star and space okay so that we
can at least see what's happening here
so if I run this code
unfortunately mentioned and then there
so if I run this you can see we are
getting that pattern by addition of
printing spaces I have printed stars so
this is the this stars are coming with
the help of K loop and this 1 2 3 these
are printing with their power I loop so
you should have star if I print a space
and if I run this so this is how we need
to print spaces and then the pattern
cool so that's it from this video thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
