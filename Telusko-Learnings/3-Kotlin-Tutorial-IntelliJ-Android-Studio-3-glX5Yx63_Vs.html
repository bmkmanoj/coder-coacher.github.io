wanted to show you how can you create a
Android studio our Android project in
under studio using Kotlin so I have
already downloaded Android studio in my
system so if I open Android studio here
which is a preview version now which is
under Studio 3.0 and it will take some
time to open as you can see it is also
saying it is powered by int in Egypt
that form is taking some time and let's
create a new project so I will click on
the start new project and ok so this
option of include Cortlandt support now
if you don't select this option it will
give you a default to Java project so
whatever code you write will be a Java
code but let's see if you don't want to
go for Java code you can simply click on
this it says enclosed quadlings support
and you don't have to install any other
plug-in which is coming in in I mean it
is coming with Android studio now just
click on next I will go for a lollipop
nothing else and then I will click on
basic activity click on finish I think
nothing else here so the moment I click
on finish it will give you a android
project now that Android project will be
based on quarterly not Java again I mean
ultimately when you compile your code
you will get a bytecode but then let's
see what what happens so if you
underscore it will take some time to
open since it is Android studio so okay
here we here it is we got an Android
studio project it is taking some time to
create a project behind the scene okay
so you can see the main activity here so
if you have worked on Android before you
know that we get main activity to add
Java but since this is a quatrain
project you will be getting main
activity dot Katie and if you look at
this code this looks similar to Java
code right because this is Cortland
which is based on Java the thing is we
don't have exchange keyword now we have
a colon we have the import statement as
it is if we do in Java we use we don't
use any we don't we are not using public
void anymore we are using one here or we
are using colon and we specify the type
here right so it's almost same like Java
right so this is a quarreling project
that means in understood your now you
instead of learning Java you can
actually learn Kotlin so that's what I
wanted to show you now let's go back to
IntelliJ let's see how to use this in
IntelliJ so I will close this and we are
not going to look at Android studio
anymore
in fact we'll be doing that once we
learn
if we are making videos an Android
studio but then this course is not for
Android this course is to learn Cortland
you can learn you can use Android you
can use cotton enjoyed anytime you want
so I will open an IntelliJ now so to
download IntelliJ you have to go to the
observer side of it so go to
instructions it will take you to the
official website or who is that or it is
not looking to you okay so what you can
do is you can search for integer so
search for IntelliJ and this is the
website okay so you can download in
Tunisia from here just click on download
now there are two versions for this you
have ultimate version and you have a
community version it's just that you
have to buy ultimate version and it will
cost you some money okay so you can see
that is available for this I would
suggest to go for community version
because we will get everything what you
want you will get Java you will go at
Scotland you will get dovey you look at
Scala when you use community version ok
so download this one and when you
download and install this you will so
when you open IntelliJ that's how it
will look so it this is how you're
intelligent egg form looks like so again
this is almost same like understood
you're right so if I create a new
project let me just do that let me get a
new project and I will be creating up
quadlin projects so you can see I have a
quatrain option here and you can select
copelan here and just click on next now
you can give a project name I will again
go for a project which is demo I love
this name demo and it will use a cotton
Java Runtime and click on finish you can
see we got a project again this looks
like Android studio as I told you but
that this is IntelliJ now if I expand
this you can see we have external
libraries now this external libraries
has the Java libraries and it also have
a cotton libraries I am this asana see
we don't have any file here so let's
create our first code so we'll just a
right-click new and let's create a quad
link files we like the same code which
we have done earlier so we'll name this
file as first once that's weird so first
what's happened to my keyboard first
code and click on OK now it will give
you some ok ignore that so what do I do
is obviously function now you can now
you can help me with this just be with
me so you can see we got our
: and you can say this is of type a day
so array of type string we want so I
will select array of type string and
trust me if you are not used IntelliJ
before but this is one of the best IDE
available in the market so I will
increase the font so we got fun main and
now let's plain something so I will say
print Ln and the other point here oh
that's weird
hello aliens so we got our code and
let's run this now to run this code you
just simply have to go to run and say
run like we take some time to load run
for the first time as you are doing it
for the first time so it's taking some
time and here we go here we go here we
go shrink some time come on okay so once
you've got the output you can see we get
the we got the output as hello aliens so
that's how you can write a code on
IntelliJ platform in fact from from from
this point we'll be using only IntelliJ
for our for the entire entire course we
try to see some of the things in Eclipse
in between may be required but then most
of the time already using IntelliJ so
that just on this video we have seen how
to use IntelliJ and we'll see you in the
next video thanks for watching and to
