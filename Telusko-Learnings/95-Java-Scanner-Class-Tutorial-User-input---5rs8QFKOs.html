take input from user using
bufferedreader now in this video we'll
see how to use scanner but before that
let's say I don't want string I want
integer input so what we can simply do
is this grid line will give you as
string so we can actually use a method
which is pass int which will convert
your value from string to integer okay
so we'll use this with scanner directly
so that you will understand both now so
instead of using bufferedreader we can
use scanner so how do you scanner have
the same I want the same way which is
taking the input and printing it with
hello now what we can do is first we
have to fix the import we don't want all
this extra and push not even this close
exception so I can remove this and I
have removed all the packages now do use
scanner so for that we have a class
called a scanner so we say control space
for the package so it's a package is
Java dot util now we'll give SCS name
again the name can many things and we
have to say new scanner now when you
walk with scan ok scan all say ok I will
give you the output I will give you the
user input but tell me from where I'll
be getting the input so we have to
mention you're getting the input from
input device which is in object and this
in object belongs to our class which is
system so same like out object as we
have seen the last op launch to code so
I have to say system dot n and then we
have to say STR equal to now SC will
have a method called as next line okay
so in buffer Ida we have to use red line
in scanner we have to use next line
simple and then we can just simply run
this keeps waiting for the input will
say Naveen and the output is hello now
in but just in case if you have if you
want to take integer so what we can
simply do is let's say I have integer I
initial value of I is 0 and instead of
printing this Hello string let me print
the value of I so will say I is plus I
so if I understand with the output as 0
but I wanted to get it from user so in
that scenario the input you'll be
getting a string so we have to convert
that string into integer so for that you
have to use a method called as pass int
okay and this pass in method is a static
method belongs to our class for this
integer so when you want to convert a
thing from string to integer we have to
use integer dot passing and in back we'd
have to pass the source of the data of
string it will give you integer so you
have to say I so i equal to integer
percent and then SC dot next line let's
run this and let's pass a value which is
seven so it's the output is is seven
simple but hold on when you when you
talk about scanner scanner provide you
some extra features scanner says if you
know your again up if you know the
output also the input will be integer so
why take a string input and then convert
into integer but this is what we have to
do it with more fighter but the scanner
class says for different type of input
how a different type of methods so if
you know your input will be integer so
instead of using next line you can
actually use next int you know sounds
much better than the conversion right so
now if I run this waiting for the input
with say eight and it says I is eight
simple right so use working with scanner
is much easier than before dido and
that's why when you work with when you
are going to take input from user always
prefer to go with this kind of class and
that's it now this is how you have to
take input from user so we can use read
method we can use bufferedreader all we
can use scanner okay so that's it from
this video or so for the further videos
do subscribe if you have liked this
video so there's a thumbs up button
click on it and thank you so much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
