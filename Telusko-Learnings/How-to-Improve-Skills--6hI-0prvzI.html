how to improve your skill set now see it
doesn't matter in which domain you're
working maybe you are a cricketer maybe
you are your technical person maybe you
are in Management Studies or maybe
adding a job right so you have to agree
or increase your skill set maybe I mean
you know you want to improve but you are
not able to improve you know I am
getting lots of questions on Facebook or
YouTube making comments then how to
improve a skill set now from a very
famous author there is a rule called as
one person so what I will suggest
improve your skill set by one percent
every day that doesn't doesn't matter
from this domain you are it is
applicable for everyone
improve your skill set by one person now
what it means so let's say you're you
are doing your daily routine job so
let's say you're working for a company
and you have to achieve a task maybe
your task is repeated you you are doing
the same thing every day so how will you
increase your skills so what I would
suggest complete that task so yeah let's
say your boss is assigning a task
complete that task and in the evening or
maybe in during your break from your
domain learn something maybe something
new which you have which you don't know
so let's say if you're a technical
person you are working on Java domain
and you're working on Spring Framework
and suddenly you feel you want to
increase your skill sets so in spring so
if you are working on spring maybe MVC
you can learn spring batch you can learn
spring security maybe you're into
management
so in management you have different
different topics so what you can do is
you can select a different topic in
management which is which you don't know
you can increase your skill set they're
getting a point so maybe you're a
student so you know in the normal
college life you learn lots of things
but you you feel we are missing
something because this syllabus you have
in your college is outdated may not be
outdated but it may be old so let's say
if you have so if you have a Java course
so in Java you have maybe they are
teaching your Java 5 and industry we
have Java 8 now
what you can do is learn Java in your
college and in the evening learn new
things in Java 7 Java feed one person
now if you follow this rule of 1% in a
week it will improve your skill set by
7%
now just imagine it's it's your 100% of
syllabus and every pig here going 1 7 %
up now just imagine if you are you are
doing the same thing for one year
and that's this is to find days my
friend you know it will increase your
skill set by 365 person amazing right
but hold on there's a catch here if you
miss one day you know if you are you
know working hard you're working hard
you're 7% 14% if you miss one day it
will decrease your skill set by 5%
again that's the catch so let's say you
are working hard for one week and you're
taking a break again you come back to 2%
now because you lost your 5% so what I
want or maybe what you should do is you
should not skip one day walk
continuously I'm not saying work very
hard or learn lots of things just at 1%
so yeah that's it
so just remember that thing which is 1%
and you'll increase your skill set
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
