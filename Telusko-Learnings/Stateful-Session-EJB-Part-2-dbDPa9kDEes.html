session being first way to create or the
mote interface to create interface will
say new and click on Java class to
create the interface what we can do is
we'll name this interface as we'll say
this is laced with laced elements
saliste elements remote so this is a
remote interface and we'll see the
package name is EJB and we'll click on
finish now once you click on finish you
will get a class but we want our
interface what so what we can simply do
is instead of writing a class here we
can make this as interface okay and in
this interface what I need is I would
need only two or three methods first the
method should be element I will go for
new two methods one is add element and
second will be remove element so this
are the element which are these are the
methods which will be used to add and
remove the element and the third method
will be will use a limit method which is
get elements and this get elements will
give you a list of integers okay so we
will say least integer let's import the
package for least impact package done
right so now this this is the interface
will be using for as we'll be using this
as a remote interface now to specify
this as a limo remote interface we need
to use an annotation is because ejb 3.0
is annotation based EJB so what we can
use is we can use ER annotations at at
remote and if you import the package so
this should belongs to Java X dot EJB
dot remote so if you are getting
confused how to import you can simply
press control shift I which will fix all
the inputs and click on ok so you can
see we got a package with Java X dot e
JV dot remote so this is how we have to
create a remote interface so once you
done with this this step so first step
was to create a project second was to
create this remote interface now the
third step will be to create a class
which will implement this interface now
how exactly we have to
that class that we'll see in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
