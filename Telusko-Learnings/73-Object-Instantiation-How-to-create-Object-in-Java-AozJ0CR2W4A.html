for the earlier video now so let's again
discuss about that object and reference
now just to make your concept more clear
just imagine this example now let's say
you want to travel or long distance in
train in maybe mail train so if you want
to travel for one or two days in a train
of course you will be booking a ticket
in sleeper class and you want to take
some some amount of nap maybe for five
to six hours now to take a nap of course
you require pillow right now you will
not take your home pillow to in train
and you will carry to your village of
course not because it will look weird so
what you will do is you will buy a air
pillow now just imagine you have a air
below but if you want to buy this air
pillow when you go to a shop they will
give you a pillow which which will not
have any air it will be a flat pillow so
in order to use that pillow we have to
blow some air
now how much air so let's say that
pillow will take around 2 liters of air
ok and you have to insert exact amount
of edges because if you if you insert
less air it will be it will be
uncomfortable right if you put your head
here the air will go on that side if you
blow extra air it will they know it will
last so that's that's not how you have
to blow the pillow right so you have to
insert exact amount of air in the same
way if you create this class reference
so let's say let's say we have a obj in
order to use that obj which is a flat
pillow now way to kiyosaki one was new
now this new keyword will blow air
technically it will blow memory it will
give memory to your reference how much
and that's why we require that
constructor there as a promise we'll
discuss constructor in the next session
ok in the incoming sessions time being
you have to focus on constructor they
will only provide the exact number exact
amount of memory you require so in order
to use this object or reference we have
to instantiate it with the help of new
keyword and the constructor
now people coming from this C++
background so they have this habit of
just measuring the class name and there
are
his name but in Java we also we have to
also instantiate the object using new
keyword so yeah thanks for watching and
to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
