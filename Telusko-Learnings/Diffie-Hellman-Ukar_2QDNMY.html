called as Debbie Hellman now what is
defi Hellman it's a key exchange
algorithm for symmetric key a symmetry
kick kick kick trophy now in this what
we have is we are let's imagine let's
suppose we have our two person they want
to exchange the keys right the both the
key should be same now the daughter add
we have an algorithm for this DFP
Hellman now to implement the efi Hellman
will name this class SDH for the film in
okay okay well you've got a main
function so this is a main function now
what we have in this is III hope you
know the theory part of this so if
you're not about up to theory part so
you will find a link below for
diffie-hellman theory okay now how its
implemented is we have to put two people
a and B they will they want to share a
sick secret key for that they have to do
some some calculations and some value
exchange so that they will come to a
conclusion of two numbers right or two
keys now so for that first we need is a
two person a and B then both will select
a secret key called s x and y then after
some calculation they will they will get
k1 and k2 and both this value will be
same to implement this concept we will
take input from user so with what we'll
do is up again let me take entry from
user we can take input from user using
scanner class again you can use before
it or you can use cannot class it's your
wish but for this example scanner will
be very easy to implement so we'll say
scanner STD standard input and new
scanner system dot in again we have to
import the package so in package is
imported okay
now now if we required variables right
we required variable like so we'll
declare a variable and we'll it because
I'll record a variable G then it will
require variable X will require Y will
require what next we require yeah so
required this this variables right again
with the quad k1 and k2
so we'll require K 1 comma K 2 now the
problem is in future it's sure that we
have to show Todd okay we have to do
calculations right one of the
calculation is we have to calculate the
value of a and value of B again required
two more variables here this time we'll
go for two capitals because in algorithm
we have in in theory part we are going
for capital A and capital B now in
future we have to calculate value of a
as G raised to X mod n right and B as
Jesus to Y mod n that means we have to
do operations of power and mod now for
that we will not doing that operations
we will ask Java to dot on to do that
operations right and that that means we
have to use some methods and to get
those methods instead of using int we'll
use a class called as big integer now
big integer is a class in Java which
offers you certain features like
calculate power mod and the value of
your integer can be big because the
problem is when you go for the power it
will give you a big number and to store
that big number int is not enough and
that's why we require big integer so
we'll import the class yeah it's Java
dot math dot big integer now if we have
to initialize all these videobuzz right
so we'll start with two values of first
is G and N and G we will ask user to
enter this details so we'll will ask
user so we'll say enter two prime
numbers so we'll store that number in N
and we store that number in G so G n
equal to some value and J equal to some
value so we'll say new big integer so
credit to create object of big integer
we have to say big integer and this you
have to say yesterday n dot next so
using next you will get the value same
goes for this one so it's again it's no
big integer here it will be
yesterday in dot next okay now what next
now we'll ask a user a to enter the
value of k1 and we'll ask a user B to
enter the value of y so we start with a
we'll ask a like we'll say a person a
enter your secret number then he will
enter the secret number so we have to
store that number in X so we'll say X
equal to new big integer and we'll say
study in dot next now once you got X
then we'll find define the value all
we'll find the value of using X it will
find value of e right so a equal to we
will say we have G G will be to find the
formula of G - 2 X mod n we have a
function for this mod power which will
accept two values one will be X and
second will be n all right so by this we
will get get a value of e ok now II will
say we a will send this value to B then
what next will ask B to enter his
details
so we will copy the statement in fact
will copy everything because we have to
do same task here this dimension of a
will say B instead of X it will be Y
instead of a it will be B instead of X
it will be Y so a will calculate G H 2 X
mod N and B will be G raised to Y mod n
now once you got the value of a and B a
will send a to b and b will send B to a
that means a will calculate K 1 now so
k1 will be equal to it will be your e
which is about the formula is a days to
Y Mauryan right so its will be mod mod
power you have to power
you have to pass bo4 my song to find the
category of calculate the value of k1 we
have to use Venus 2x so multiple it's
been H 2 X mod n so this is how you'll
find K 1 and then you have to find kata
which will be it is 2 mod mod POW this
will be B these two riders to n now once
you got the value of k1 and k2 both
should be equal right so let's sit let's
check so I will say is a secret key is
will print here k1 and we'll say B is
secret key which will be K 2 okay and
you should get the same same values
right so if we are getting the same
value that means the code is done let's
send this code now asking for a 2 prime
number so as you know the book acoustic
book example we have number 11 and 7 now
with into may be to enter 6 see both
both a k1 and k2 is 5 right so this is
def you husband depend on rhythm by this
they have exchanged the value of k1 and
k2 both are
see and that's it for this video for
next video stay tuned and do subscribe
thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
