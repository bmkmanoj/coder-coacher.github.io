if we have instead of creating the bin
object manually we can use something
less use bin so the advantage here is
whenever you create a bin it will check
that bin is available in the particular
scope or not if it is available in the
particular scope it will not create the
new instance it will use the same
instance so since we are mentioning it
as session the scope of my application
of this page of this bin it will be
session so it will search that bin in
the particular session okay so in this
scenario and the load page it is getting
the instance and in display page it is
using the same instance and that's the
advantage okay now let's say so I'm sure
that till now you have cleared all your
concepts alright so before moving
forward I will ask you because this is
the ideal time to ask something from you
if you like this video do do do let me
know by liking my video you can see a
thumbs up there please like it so that I
will know that if this type of videos
are working for you or not and please
comment if you need some modification if
you need this color to be changed or if
you need some more tutorials so I will
make sure that your comment will be
processed and I will create a video on
that and you can also subscribe so let's
continue with that so that was the
promotion part yeah so now or what we
can do is with if you see how many
parameters I'm passing and passing only
two parameters right I'm passing that
one number and I need let us imagine
let's say you have a bin and you which
you have ten variables and all the ten
variables values will be coming from the
user site when you know you have ten
objects in your ten variables in your
object and user will be sending all
those ten values then why you're setting
the properties manually what if you can
just ask the order set property to do
the favor what I mean by that is why to
mention which value will go to which
property
what if it done it it's doing all the
things automatically that is possible if
you are using something while I start
here now what this term means in fact
you don't have to pass specify the value
also so what this task simply means is
it will assign all the required values
depend upon the name since I am using a
name here which is the OL number it will
give this type this value to the
particular bid a particular variable of
your bin so it does it automatically
just mentioned just you have to mention
here star and then in display you can
fetch the value you cannot know you
cannot use stuff while fetching you have
to mention each and everything here now
enough of this line you can directly use
use mean you know of this line also we
can directly use use bin just look at
the code how many number of lines we are
using they're just using use bin set
property for what they request we are
going here display and just we are you
creating the object of bin and we can
use this bin in the same page multiple
times you don't have to create it again
and again you don't have to cast it just
because we are mentioning the class name
we just have to read they fetch the
properties and now if we run this so I
hope you remember we have used a star
there we are not fetching specifying the
values individually so there if record
any other so that's a bad luck we'll say
this time the name is Mei hole and if I
submit oh it's working right so with
those stars also it is working that
means whenever you use views bins you
get lots of advantages so we don't have
to specify this scope we don't have to
set the attribute we can't we have to
specify the scope we don't need to
mention the set property for each and
every variable we can just specify the
star there and we don't need to create a
new instance we can fetch the last
instance available in the particular
scope so in fact when you talk about the
scope you have lots of option you have
option of page you have option of
application you have option of
session and you have options that you
have
yeah you can also have optional request
this time going for this session
sessions go so that is from use bin so I
hope you got the idea how to use use
beam in your project in your application
