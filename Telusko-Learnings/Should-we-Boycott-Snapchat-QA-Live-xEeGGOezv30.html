is even evens piggle if i'm not wrong if
I'm not honest this name wrong oh ok so
this is not so we are not sure because
the news came out on one of the website
was variety and what they did ok so what
happened is this guy called us Anthony
he was working for snapchat and he and
snapchat fired him in three weeks ok and
then he fired a lawsuit against snapchat
ok and currently just called a snap Inc
the company they have changed their
company name from snapchat to snag the
snap Inc so this company which I mean
this guy for us Anthony he filed a
lawsuit against snapchat and that
lawsuit now he's in public so if you
want to read about it just go to I guess
if you if you can search on Google the
lawsuit against napping you will get the
actual lawsuit what exactly the case was
and that guy Anthony he claims that on
in September 2015 this guy avan who is
the CEO of the company in the meeting
room he was talking he say that we will
not focus on those country which are
poor countries and one of them is
mentioned as India and Spain everyone
knows India is not a poor country in
fact i know you know i have seen lots of
tweets on on Twitter lots of messages on
facebook and all funny messages you know
we people have more gold than he can
even he can even imagine Ambani is
richer than seven times which other than
that guy and Ambani can buy snapchat
seven times awesome tweets right i mean
it is good in a funny way but then
uninstalling snapchat just because you
got some news from somewhere I mean it's
a good product wide sea by no means I'm
some weddings I'm supporting snapchat he
okay I'm not a snapchat user I have
never used snapchat in my entire
time I heard about snapchat a lot from
my friends from my interns I mean they
take selfies and they put that in on
snapchat they use some dog filters I
don't know why people are so much so
such I mean sighs so much grace about
that dog style filter but then just
think about this if you are using a
product because if you love it and
suddenly you are saying that we will not
use the product because that guy said
something how can you be so sure that he
said something right it was someone else
it was someone else who posted that
thing on the snapchat website I mean he
sees e-posta that some that thing on
some I mean some other article about
about at evens I mean even saying
something about that he never said India
is poo on record okay and you are
getting this news from somewhere else
see all this media company they have
this problem okay all this media company
they have they want to do Jen took to
create use to create fake news if you
read the entire article if you read the
entire article it's all about what he
said I mean what Anthony thinks about
snapping and what they were doing but
then he never said that him the the guy
who is a man who is a CEO he's never
said something in public how can you be
so sure in fact i was when i when i got
this news i was searching for this on
youtube I was watching for this on
google know where it is mentioned that
even say this in public it was Anthony
who is the ex-employee of that company
he claims even see it something like
that and the people are so careless of
even checking this source what we do we
go to the App Store right and they give
the bad ratings okay I'm not saying
everyone is doing that but you have to
use your brain right we are living in a
world where we have social network we
can do anything
you want so we I mean we should always
check the news right we should always
check what is the source I mean is it
real that that guy thinks about India
like I mean see no one no one will think
about India like that okay because India
has lots of potential we have lots of
money and this is the next big power
right no one will think about india is
who I no one will say that in public no
one will say that in on the in the
meeting room I mean if if I'm if I'm
guessing right what might have happened
is maybe this guy Anthony this so let's
say we have a meeting room and then we
have even who is the CEO of the company
standing here on the on the main table
or on the main chair and then we got
some people here one of them is Anthony
and maybe Anthony proposed that let's
expand let's expand our let's expand our
thing in India as well maybe in some
other countries and the problem is
expanding is not that easy when you say
you want to expand your user base you
have you want to expand your you want to
expand your servos people it is not easy
to expand the servers okay so maybe
mostly they will focus on those
countries where they have an axiom users
and India vs currently we are getting
more users for snapchat but earlier we
were not having much user base in India
so he might have said maybe that we have
to focus only I mean currently we have
to focus on the local region which is
the u.s. region in fact facebook when
Facebook come into existence they
started from us and then this spread out
themselves to towards different
countries right and of course it's a
us-based company they will focus on us
and UK first and then they will go for
the asian asian countries right so don't
get so emotional about it again I'm just
saying is always check this source from
where you are getting the source okay I
guess okay just I would just want to
check some weights from from from
Twitter so let's let me just search for
some to it so it is snapchat not
snapdeal snatch
twitch I mean it was it was amazing you
know it was amazing ok so we got some
points from here we got points from
minimal label says actually work is
masternodes and they see india i slave
nodes you can say that you can say that
because we Indians what we do we learn I
mean we go different colleges we join
IIT we join nit we go to all these
colleges and what we do once you
complete your education you go to us to
work right and how can you blame us and
this it is you who is making all this
thing right so submitter so it's you who
is making all this mess so if you're
thinking in your slave is because of us
you know we study here we do iiit from
here and they go to us to work and then
the same that they stay in u.s. if you
really want to think about this just
come back to India and make I mean start
any company you want if you have an idea
and then you're good you're good to go
okay so I'm getting lots of messages
here so let me just focus on some more
messages okay so some some ill-lit worth
hating on snapdeal okay in fact I saw
that various let me check the android
app store ratings first naturally just
one star then if you see if you see a
snap snap chat on android it is only it
is four stars four stars why okay and
what I was not deal there is it it's not
be affected if get a quad affected with
this let me take this let me just a
rating for the snapdeal so that's
perfect is 4.1 I know it is not
affecting snapped in any way ok so you
okay so we have a very good channel or
thank you so much an animal says IPL
sucks I know and it is Mumbai and
Gujarat match now which is going on
so hello from hyderabad snapchat onions
uninstalling it okay see if you are
installing uninstalling it go ahead but
uninstall something which you don't like
okay I never used snapchat in my life
because I was I know it's not useful for
me but then just installing it because
you got some news on internet that
doesn't make any sense you know I was
just wondering if something goes wrong
with my channel let's say if somebody
says in some news channel regard let's
bike or tennis for learning and trust me
everyone will do that so you know I'm
really worried worried about this don't
just bike or anything think about it
what you are doing why you're doing
check the news check this source because
your words matters if you think if you
put some if you post anything on
facebook it doesn't matter your post
actually matters to people okay you
matters okay so your post will matter on
facebook so make sure you think and post
something on Facebook yeah actually we
you know okay who wouldn't be thing to
become rich edition of blaming you
actually write my history oh right so
you should focus on becoming rich
instead of blaming snapchat about
anything so if you really want if you
really want to be a true Indian do
something for yourself and do something
for India so that we will problems you
know instead of just blaming something
so yeah okay okay so any more comments
ok so now it's not deal yeah i know it
is not as nuts is this not snap dedica
snapchat okay so it's not checked okay
so you listen in lots of and abroad and
yes poor I'm getting frustrated here
this ok so if you see if you heard about
India is poor if you go to abroad of
course you will see that because
something you can blame movies you can
brave bollywood movies because what
showing bollywood bollywood movies let's
see when you watch hollywood movies you
only see casinos you see all the flashy
street of New York right but when you
watch Bollywood movies what is what you
see is lungs right and even if they even
if I'm bollywood movie ish is getting
shoot in US they wish they will show all
the awesomeness about that right does
you can blame you can play movies for
this again it's not deal not snapdeal
it's not okay so cannot snapdeal our
money is a businessman and he will
develop its again not invest money to
buy of course the UI is bad in snapchat
yes if you wish wonder if you think it
is a bad you i uninstall it okay don't
install snapchat because it has a bad
you I ok that makes sense ok so you I is
man of snapdeal also correlated organs
use Amazon oh we are not talking about
snapdeal here ok we are talking about
snapchat that was a what you say a fun
of making it a snap deal ok so meet us
so sunday say so you mean that the news
is not true don't know the news is not
true ok damn it i deleted my account
when it just just again you're gonna
create a new account droid oh yes ah
where are you from I like the priest I
like your peace policy ok so say this
you should come in public on in that can
serve it yes media sucks exactly and
something is with something someone is
writing with the language of meditation
I don't understand Chinese language so
sorry of 21st belongs to Indians yes
again ok so even Chinese are supporting
else fans has only emotions no logics
they are kind of kind of we don't use
logic nowadays you know be unlike blind
followers nowadays Apple is awesome
let's buy Apple devices it will be all
our logic less people nowadays ok by no
means I
iphone a macbook just because of a fan
was like a let's tap it out okay next
while you are wasting time here than
learning a lot exactly right sunday shut
up we have point we are wasting time on
facebook by cording snap snap chat and
that i think there are lot okay so so
though jharia says Bashar they ought to
name hi oh thank you so much for Julia I
hope my videos helps okay so your shine
okay what I'll say is my head shines
better than your future yeah makes sense
I just took a haircut now I so ok what
next are talking about something life
project after you have we talked about
life legit as well why do you bother so
much when it not start worked to think
about other words he exactly so he was
right ok so we are getting lots of
matches is difficult for me to read all
the message we need price control in
India yes we need to do the advent of
controlled applies ok ok so the nurse
says what is sap what is snapchat I like
your vignesh Vegas don't even know what
is not chat ok so snapchat is basically
a social media application where you can
take the selfie so mostly it is for
selfies I ok I have still not use
snapchat yet okay I am Telling You from
others experience so what I heard about
snapchat so you can just take the pic
what's what is the difference between
Instagram and snapchat is on Instagram I
guess when you take a photo it will be
there for a longer time on snapchat when
you take a selfie with the dead for a
limited amount of time so that's how it
works ok so I wonder who ever used
snapchat in India I mean people you do
use natural India as well people
especially people who have iphones they
use snapchat a lot ok so far says let's
bipod telesco learnings ok so that is
what i was talking
if someone says let's buy cottage for
nothing and trust me it will happen ok
so the channel will not be any more if
people started so let's just imagine
let's imagine if you get a news on
Facebook nobility of the risk on landing
is supporting even Spiegel right who's
the four is the CEO of snapchat and
trust me the moment anyone says that and
I'm not supporting even by any means
okay I'm just saying always check the
source before before tweeting I mean
anything or before before doing any post
on Facebook but let's say if you're
getting up or something like this trust
me everyone will unsubscribe from the
channel it will happen okay so I'm just
worried about myself that's why I will
take I'm taking this session of camp
they can during this live sessions okay
nishantha say is why only IITs only
exactly right so why only IIT people who
will improve the standard of India so we
can do it right so work hard and you can
make I mean you can have over the one
companies here right see we have we have
to charge not clip we have lip card here
right I love flipkart anyway so we have
to e-commerce we have different
ecommerce company in india right we have
amazon we have flip card we have
snapdeal I know amazon is not intent
company but then we do have amazon india
in india right so whenever i want to buy
something my brother always insist you
know you should always buy from flipkart
so i have so we do always have this
debate my brother says always buy
anything from indian companies bar-ilan
flipcard guy from snapdeal and I all
these people amazon i don't know why i'm
a big fan of amazon but i always prefer
to buy something on amazon because see
we are living in a world when we need
better service if you get a good service
of course you will buy something from
them right if flipcard is giving you
better service
i will never buy something on amazon i
will always buy from flipkart right so
if Indian companies can provide good
service of course we will use in the
products especially like potentially now
right so potentially is providing better
products and that's what we are buying
it right so if something gives you i
mean if indian company gives you a good
service of course you will use that I
mean what about geo we have a water
phone company what upon whether phone is
not an Indian company and now we got geo
and everyone is using geo i use two
phones now I hope I just this android
phone here I got that phone there so
that is my what up phone simcard I have
that and in this point I have a Geo sim
card right so so if someone is giving
you good so I mean if someone is someone
is giving you something good you will of
course use it doesn't matter from where
you are getting it okay so but effects
you're not okay I think everyone in the
world ok what next yes naturally they
use this app of course even I feel that
is a user's app it is only for doing
some time past nothing else ok also no
one is taking about in fact not just
this news when you go to in fact Indian
media you get so many news nowadays on
indian indian television decently we got
this kapil sharma use right and no one
is sure about what happened but then we
all went against kapil sharma again I'm
not supporting commissioned by here okay
my point is you should know the source
of the information forever it is coming
from okay never support the only
so what next one is not nice yeah that's
it about snapchat let's go for some some
potion some okay so okay so this this
time for so we talked about okay okay so
we got the first question
okay Jade will say is I will unsubscribe
you then if you support him yeah exactly
like that's the point if I support
someone who is doing something wrong of
course no one will like me right oh
brother this says is that mic working
this one you're talking about random ish
no this is this is not connected yet I
was just making some spring videos now
and that's what is here currently I'm
using this mic for the life for the live
sessions I use this for screen recording
so i don't use this for a live session
because it is very difficult to you know
connect this with my mobile phone so so
this works on look at the laptop because
we have this cable here where is that
cable so we don't have what you say I
which port we have an iphone USB the
Lightning port so we don't have a
lightning port you can see we have a
very big port here so it has a reason
okay so okay so next question is it any
fun is gonna parent company or these are
the corrosion is there any fun as a
dollar pointer company oh sure okay oh
you've gotta push so we gotta push up
some um atomic say is is there any fun
as a developer all you just pressure see
first of all the first thing is which
company you join if you join a company
where they have fun of course you would
have fun but also what matters is how
much knowledge you have so if you have a
good amount of knowledge in that terms
if you have a good amount of knowledge
in mind programming of course you will
enjoy it the thing is your company will
give you only those those amount of work
which you can do if you good at
programming if you would I'd software
development things if you not do that
software development and if you are
getting any work it will be a pressure
for you so always improve yourself so
actually enjoy your life as a programmer
okay so we've got a question from hush
so by indian mobile seriously micromax
I'd better then don't behave it has a
point wide hush if Indian companies are
not making good products why you should
buy intent products so that's the thing
okay so little was intent company no
Dino is a Chinese company and in India
which is a mobile best mobile company I
don't think we have so time the problem
is we were having all this production
marketing China now I'm until now now
because of Mary make in India thing will
be having mobile factories in India as
well so I am sure in next one or two
years with India will be having a better
mobile companies than Chinese okay so
but I mean we don't have good mobile
phone companies in india as Indian based
companies because the market was in
China for last 15 years now it is coming
to India so let's so for the bed there
so far they retain okay can you upload
videos on how to make MapReduce even I'm
not sure about MapReduce now so okay so
what is the cost of this Mike okay this
is my constant me nine thousand rupees
so this might cost me nine thousand
rupees I know this is a costly one but
then for me it is important so I'm doing
that okay we've got a point from promote
Gupta mr. CEO just mr. CEO of snapchat
just improve your language and status
that's the point you don't even know
that he has said something like that and
we are so again stood against him okay
okay so I you said nothing sir should I
perceive see us if I am bursting mats
okay other thing is if you are good at
Nats you will be good at programming by
default because that's how your brain
works but then if you're not good at
maths it will
difficult for you to understand program
it will be difficult for you to grabs
grass thanks but it is not impossible if
you love programming if you love
software company does not matter how
good your max is you can still pursue
your CS and you can be a better software
developer but then of course when you
when you're good at match it will help
you in the programming things okay so
everywhere Matt's here math is
everywhere I did man did that Mahesh but
I again so my head says what is google
adsense so okay what is adsense
basically so when you watch when you
watch any video on youtube you can see
some advil right so YouTube provides I
mean as a Content developer we can
upload all the videos for free so how
YouTube earns so youtube earn from ads
example let's say we've got a new
product now let's a new mobile phone in
the market let's say iphone 7 and I
Apple want to promote iphone 7 so
whatever you do they will put an ad on
youtube so David so Apple will pay to
YouTube to promote their ads but then
question arise youtube don't have their
own content wide so you don't have their
own content then question arise where
YouTube will post this this adds so as a
Content developer when we make some
point and we make some videos so that
video goes goes on youtube if somebody
else is watching that video so just
before the video they will see an ad so
that ad revenue so fifty percent of the
ad revenue goes to the content writer or
the content creator and forty-five
percent of the revenue goes to the
YouTube and this will be managed by the
google adsense so when i upload videos i
already have an accessing adsense
account so in that adsense account so if
you are watching this video before going
ahead if you're watching this video just
click on the like button because i can
see this is the maximum dislike for my
video still now i'm sure it is because
of the snapchat title okay but then I
CMAC or more lights than so if you're
liking this video please click on the
like button and if okay so I got one
what is like that's great okay so yeah
so I was talking about Adsense so as a
content content creator I do have itunes
account as well so when I upload video
if you watching if you are watching that
video and if that video gets thousand
views so we approximate see now how much
we do we earn from thousand views it is
all depend upon from which country we
are getting the views if you are getting
views from Asian countries with the CPC
which you call it as or CPM is very low
and if the same video is watched in you
UK us Paris will will we will get a
higher CPM okay and that's why some
Indian changes they don't get lots of
money because all the viewers are from
India and from Asia and the CPM India is
very low okay so maybe in future it will
increase but time it is way low so
that's how we on okay so that's that is
the Adsense okay so
I think Apple manufacturing plant is
coming to India yes they are having that
plant in bangalore now it will start
from next month I guess from not wrong
okay so adam says do you polish your
head to get that shine okay this is not
sure you know we don't have to polish my
head for that it is natural okay which
language to learn first please apply you
can start with see all you get started
PHP so either you can start with C PHP
or Python okay so or JavaScript don't
start with Java directly I mean if you
can start with that okay is java dead
okay if java is dead then how why i am
making videos videos on java think about
it java is not that java is everywhere
actually cosigner has better content
then you can city maybe i don't know
applications of python no java data
warehouse is important yes when
affordable has is important okay please
upload a live web project soon so yeah
so the light project found to model from
from monday evening will be starting
with a live session so we will be doing
the live things okay so let's see how it
goes so i guess tomorrow at 4pm will be
going live so we will be doing the live
coding for the first time so we'll make
a database so tomorrow we'll make a
database will will actually code on java
so will will will be using spring MVC
for the development if your defeat don't
know spring MVC duel on it so so that
just says is it composite Leon spring
for getting jobs inaudible so the answer
is depends which company you are joining
if you are joining mncs then yes knowing
spring will be helpful but if you are
joining startups I would suggest to go
for data structures and basic java
language ok ok nice travel guard any
fears from the future industry do you
predict the industry to go to only grow
yes the industry will only grow for time
being if you're talking about online
course I'm not sure about what yet what
you're saying painted of music but then
if you are you thinking about the the
online courses yes it will be increasing
soon and soon ok so I mean the education
industry online will be going ahead
because people are normally preferring
online polls then often post nowadays
because online course gives you lots of
flexibility like learning anywhere you
can watch the videos once again right so
okay so someone says vago says I look
like good angle ok I will take this the
compliment again some tips on computer
programming so the best way to compete
in computer programming is by competing
start with the slowest lowest level
first learns of
we just learn data structures solve data
structure by yourself make your own
algorithms and then start with the
company to programming just go to any
website and learn and start working on
comedy program okay so okay so
engineering nation says what you think
about snapchat CEO comment about India
so I guess engineering nation you joined
late we have already talked about it
it's just that we are we are actually it
is very okay what you say we should not
give so much focus on on some post which
is given which is not given by the
official person know where it is
mentioned that even which is who is a
CEO of snapchat said something about
India on recorder there is no YouTube
video on that there is no google post on
that there is no tweet on Twitter
display this thing is claimed by Anthony
who is the ex-employee of snapchat so so
so nothing is sure who like who is right
okay so I'm not supporting snapchat by
any mean okay so I say so should I learn
Java or Python for future jobs okay if
you're only focusing on getting a job as
soon as possible go for Python if you
are thinking about a great future ahead
in big companies go for java I mean it's
also depend upon what you want to do in
you in your life so first try to solve
the problem and then you can choose any
language you want okay so if you have
okay
ok for haces that is for nothing has a
better content and you versity plus dude
i mean oh thank you for us that that's
awesome compliment is it come ok so
Roger says I guess I have answered your
question ok so saga sees for live
project which is which is which we are
going to do from tomorrow ok before
going ahead if you are if you have not
subscribed to channel do subscribe and
do share this video with your friends on
Facebook or do chair the share this
channel with your friends on Facebook it
will be helpful for us to increase the
what you say we can increase the family
right so do share ok so we've got a
question from Rogers here so so the life
course which are which we will be saying
from tomorrow yes or spring is necessary
to learn ok so
okay next Nancy say sorry or handsome or
Thank You Nancy okay sue sue honkies is
my project yes I were doing that lie
project are you putting that on youtube
as well ok so now go then can I say so
freshest only kochava is sufficient yes
ok so should you learn advanced part or
so Java is efficient so kochava is
actually sufficient to get a job but
then there are some companies they are
focusing I mean if you see there are if
there are multiple people and if they
are going for the same post and the
company want people I mean they want the
best person so they will go for the
person who knows link as well so it's
better to non spring as well so nothing
wrong with that right so nothing but you
are right the more you learn the more
the child what are your chances ok so
last five minutes then again channel
you'll be our huge traffic so you want
me to create a testing channel as well
ok

ai don't know machine judging am NOT
good in that so sorry it's funny for
that it was sometime I feel like my
subscriber think I am an account okay
what a fact is I don't know everything
so that's the thing okay okay how's that
chart colored and roll for coach our
souls okay so who senses tell me how to
