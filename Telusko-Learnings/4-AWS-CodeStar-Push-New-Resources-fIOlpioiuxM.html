where we have we are talking about code
star now whatever we have done till now
as we simply created a co-star project
and then pulling it on in Eclipse and
then making some changes right and the
changes which we made is just changing
this from congratulations to telescope
but that's what we have changed and then
this very important change which isn't
have been ready here but then what if
you want to make your own pages and if
you want to display those pages now
first of all when you talk about web
development nowadays be everyone is
using MVC design pattern yeah now we
also have a framework visit using which
you can build his application and one of
the framework which is very famous
nowadays is Spring Framework now there
are the frameworks available as well
like we have stores but spring is very
getting very famous nowadays because it
provides you lots of explained ones
features now how do we implement MVC or
spring MVC in this project now luckily
this project is already built using
spring spring or spring framework spring
MVC to be specific how do we know that
so first of all if you can open this
dependencies with libraries if you say
expand haven't dependencies you can see
B have spring context playing bean
spring code so of course to understand
this series you need to have a spring
knowledge they're not going to learn
about how spring works or how to make a
code work in spring for that I have a
different playlist but then yes for the
prerequisite for this video would be
annoying Spring Framework now in spring
what we have is behalf of we have a
module called a spring MVC now using MVC
you make your work very easy which is
spring MVC now in MVC what we have is we
have a controller yeah and then whenever
Center request request goes to a
controller and that controller send
request to a specific I mean we have a
front control especially and that front
controller will call a specific
controller and then it's done by your
dispatcher servlet
now we don't have to do all those things
here it will be done in internally yeah
because aw gives you the parish
structure here you don't have to do all
those configuration because if you
expand this you already have a config
files here so if I expand all these
three different packages you have a
application config and MVC configure
otherwise if you want if you want to
build a project by yourself and do all
this thing by yourself trust me
okay I'm not saying it's not it's not
it's impossible all it's very difficult
to do it but then yes you need to do all
this configuration the different ways of
configuration we can use XML way of
configuration or we can use annotation
based configuration on a Java based
configuration so if you look at this we
have we are doing configuration here and
then this is Java based configuration so
basically for every thing you need to
create one bean I don't know how
comfortable you are with spring so I
will I will show this say you have to be
comfortable with being a spring
framework first now if you have to get
multiple beans here or one for
especially this one for the internal
resource beauty solver now just to give
you a glimpse of anyway sent a request
request goes to a controller in this
case the controller is hello world
controller so when you send a request
for slash example like remember this is
the home page and when you request for
slash slash means the own page hope it
itself you can see it will call the home
page that is this slash so when you say
slash it will request to the request
will go here and then you're saying hey
whenever you get a home page request
call index page but in index dot what
index dot HTML index dot JSP that thing
we define inside this configuration so
if I say in BC configuration here it is
you know you can see we got suffix which
is dot JSP and the prefix is the path
where you have your where you have your
file which is in the in which is in the
index dot JSP so if I say mean here and
if I expand this mean which is web app
inside web web app you have web ID
inside my behind if we have views you
can see we have index dot JSP there and
that's the same path in web content you
have I mean your in web app you have
ever INF and web in web and if you have
view so you have to specify the path
here which is prefix if you want to
create your own JSP niche to that he'll
so I will say right-click and let me
create a JSP call as my page okay simple
simple thing no fancy stuff here because
I don't like fine sister unfortunately
because I don't know it how to do it so
let's do it
so I would say my page dot JSP so I got
my JC page and here I will print welcome
to my page again you can do whatever you
want you can bring some data or you can
print you can do all those all those
things here but we got a page and the
important thing is not to understand
Spring Framework as I mentioned but then
how do we deploy our old pages
because deploying on other servers like
if you already know how to deploy on
different servers what we do is we
create a bad file and be deployed but
here we don't do that right we simply
right-click and we say commit so all the
things is happening behind the scene so
do we need to configure something to
make it work now first of all you cannot
call a JSP directly so we need a
controller here and we can create a
controller here itself in the in the
hello controller or we can create a new
car new class for that but let's do it
here itself I will say model in view for
a public what does in view I would
surely recommend you to watch my
spinning MVC video to understand more
and I would say this is welcome page so
I will say welcome page and to mention
the page there but then we got a welcome
as a method and in this I want an object
of Model View so I will say what is view
model and and view yeah and then I would
say MV equals your new model and view so
I will say control space Model View and
here I will say MB dot okay I will say
MV dot in fact end up in double quotes
itself I will mention the page name and
the page name for us is my page again we
don't have to specify dot JSP because we
have done the conjugation inside MVC
config and that's it just return mb so
by doing this when you send a request
hold hold on hold on there's some day
something missing how do I call that my
page so when I say my so anyway I say
slash my or maybe slash my it should
call my page unfortunately we have not
done that you know you can see that we
are getting four not four because we
have not done the configuration how do I
mention that if anyone you call a slash
my it should call that one so we can do
that with the help of request mapping
using the quest mapping annotation we
can achieve that and here we can say
slash my so whenever I quest for slash
my it should call oh maybe I'll simply
say my so it which it should call my
page
yeah now will this work that's a pushin
now how do you verify this in the last
video we have discussed this if you want
to if you want to see the changes push
it on the server and if it works that's
good but can you change till you check
locally because doing testing everything
that everything every time on Saba will
not be a good idea right how do you test
it locally so we can simply run this
application on a local server so inside
your Eclipse if you have a tomcat that's
great
should work so just install Tomcat or
the add Tomcat on your Eclipse and run
it on the on the Tomcat let's verify
this working and it's taking some time
oh gets working you can see the home
page at least is working what about my
so if I say slash my you know it's
logging you can see we got a page which
is welcome to page yeah oh it should be
welcome to my page I provide that to
type my there my back yeah so you can
see I'm dreading welcome to my page and
if you make the changes refresh and it
works yeah but then it will it work on
the server side so this is my Firefox
browser let me just go back to Chrome
but I have or the deployed one and of
course it will not work here for one
reason because we have not done the
changes right we have not pushed the
changes but even before pushing okay let
me let me just push this thing and let's
see what happens I'm still I click and I
will say what I was a team commit so I'm
pushing this project on the server I
would say AAA of course the commit
should be proper okay should have a
proper commit message okay which files I
want to push locate I mean I will push
everything I don't want to check which
while I'm just signing so I would say
commit it will send all the files now on
the server and hope so it will work yeah
you can see this it has pushed it on the
server and you can verify that by going
to Chrome I mean your AWS account and it
will it should say there's a commit
called as a a you can see the record to
commit here okay it will take some time
to start with the source bit I mean
source update and then build and
application it will take some time by
the time it do it does all those things
I will go back to my Eclipse and here if
I see one more thing you can see that we
have a big respect God yml now a wyman
is a different type of confirmation file
normally we can use xml or we can use
property files but we nowadays people
are also using Vimal it is more you know
it's more intuitive it's about inspect
language so if I open this of course I
just getting open in my local editor you
can see I'm not able to open that in
Eclipse because to open yml you need a
special
plugin so you can download the plug-in
by going to help and install software it
will it will work but unfortunately in
my in my Eclipse especially in this
workspace I don't have that
plug in so it is getting open in the
external external editor it may be not
bad it may be some other idea for you so
I'm using sublime so it is working here
so you can see there's so many things oh
this is phases for the build phases so
in build watch to be done so you can see
we have way typing all these messages
here yeah and then this is the files
which is used for building on the server
so you can see it is it has all the
things the class names which you are
working on
then the libraries the Java files and
the resources now I feel if you look
closely here we have our resource which
is index dot JSP and know where we have
my page dot JSP oh we forgot to do that
right you have not updated it but will
it work
so let's verify so I will go back to my
Chrome and I hope it will be done oh
it's still in the sauce phase it will
take some time so what I will do I will
just pause the video till till that
point and let's see after completing all
the steps let me just let me show you
the output so now it says you know it
says all the things are done so is
building an application let's verify
let's go back here and first of all I
will open the home page open just
working and that's the first thing you
should verify if everything is deployed
and let's say my ad is still not working
it says it is able to search it okay
that's so what step one is done it is
able to search it but then it's not able
to find my paste or JSP that means the
controller is working but your page is
not found you know why it's very simple
in other clips we forgot to do one thing
which is we forgot to update the DJ's
page here so you need to update that
file so what you will do is you will say
enter and then you will put one more
thing which is so you have to mention
all the pages now you might be wondering
this is a tedious task white why you
have to mention each and every page and
it say if you have thousand pages or
that that's not possible let's say if
you have ten pages will you update for
everything or what about the JavaScript
files will you do it forever is every
page now we don't have to do that we
don't have to put every page you can
also put star because the moment you say
put star it will take all the files it's
even upon you if you want to manually
configure it because some time you don't
want to upload or push all the files
sometimes you just want to test some
things you don't want to upload
everything on the person server so we
can skip that
yeah so mentioning everything is not a
bad idea yeah so instead of adding stars
you can mention all the other stuff but
in case if you know that everything will
be should be pushed put star it should
work
and the moment I saved this file and
again we have to push it I know it will
take some time but then I don't have a
choice
yeah I just wanted to show you the error
as well and again level let me just push
it so I will say team commit oh it is
not showing any push I might have made
the changes right you say save okay so
it says I have to move that interstage
80 and I will say build spec update it
okay
and now let me just push on commit and
push again it will take some time
yeah so let's let me just pause the
video till that point okay first let's
go back to this server on this site okay
so it should say that you have done a
new commit which is build a spec updated
is it I've committed no so you saved
here it what's wrong maybe my eclipse is
very slow or the or the page okay ah
maybe my internet is very slow okay
let's verify okay so you can see we got
bailed come we'll build spec updated it
is going in a source phase again I will
pause the video I don't want to waste
your time here okay so all the stuff has
danced the source build an application
deploy and let's verify now so let's say
enter and it should work now
I hope yeah so you can see that we got
our page there so we got our page
deployed in the sabha and that's how you
can add in number of pages not just one
page you can add multiple pages so you
have to do now is create multiple pages
and make sure that you create a
controller as well or you can edit the
existing controllers or you can create a
own class but again if you are updating
your own class you have to make sure
when it's sublime or in your specs
expect oml file you mentioned those
changes like we have the class files
here you have to make make changes here
as well and of course you can make the
changes to your project
package as well you know the package
name is comm dot a WS dot called star
you can rename that
so this is how you work with do you
created one resources or you deploy it
on the server in fact that we will also
talk about how do we configure database
and how do you interact with hyper
spring and hibernate with database and
that will be interesting topic right so
to know about all those concept do
subscribe my channel and do say this
with your video friends and thank you so
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
