requires here
so this reduce method requires the
object of binary operator so let's
create object of binary operator now so
somewhere here we'll say binary operator
so again money the operator is in
interface which is defined in which
which is in a package function so it is
introduced in Java 1.8 and we'll say the
object name is B and we'll say new
finally operator
now if you'll see its definition it only
accepts 1 integer value so it's it takes
one integer value and it returns one
integer value okay so we'll say it is
integer and define a function here
because it's an interface where to
provide a definition and let's see which
method this valid operator has now if
you see by the operator function of this
interface it's a function interface okay
and it's exchange by function interface
and in this interface you don't have any
method which is declared so you can see
you don't have any method which is
declared all the methods are defined
what if if I go to by function and you
can see in by function we have a method
which is apply which comes to this
binary operator so the only method in
this way we define is by func this value
operator it is except does it except
it's it's apply so it's a public and the
signature is its it returns some value
will say value 20 is paint
it's integer and it the method name is
apply it accepts our integer value we'll
say it is I and what way to do here is
we need to add this number so let's say
we'll say in total or in result that
what we have in the last videos we said
int is a result will be 0 and every time
to get a new value will say result
equal to result plus I so this is what
we it does and the in the background and
we can do it simply certain result okay
and I guess there's a problem here okay
it takes two parameters it takes two
parameters okay it takes integer integer
I an integer that's a J so we don't
require this here what we'll do is we'll
say we will simply return I plus J the
demeaning part will be the remaining
thing will be handled by your jdk we can
simply say return I plus J so every time
it takes two values and it will add so
how it works here let's say if I pass
the object of B here so how it works so
initially another object cannot be
converted into stream reduce what reduce
returns or reduce it turns it will not
return a stream it will return or int
value will say end so end result equal
to so this returns our integer value
it's 20 integer integer and we'll just
cast it here we'll say it is integer oh
yeah so this reduce so it turns some
object which you can convert into
integer part now how it works so this
map will take all the values for one to
six and it will map it to two will
multiply each number with two so this
stream here will take all the values
this will take all the values and apply
reduce it will apply a reduce function
now in this video is what we are getting
is so your values are so after mapping
evaluable four or two four eight ten or
twelve and we'll have this six numbers
here
I'm missing some number missing six yeah
so you have this six number here so
initially it will take two and 0 so 2
Plus 0 is 2 so this 0 and this 2 will go
to this function as I and J it will
fetch the value it will calculate it as
us to then that 2 plus this 4 it is 6
then 6 plus 6 is 12 12 plus 8 which is
20 20 plus 10 which is study 30 plus 12
it's 42 let's let's print the value of
result he also will simply say result
and if I run this you can see the answer
is 42 now this is how your stream API
works so what we have done is we have
created multiple objects we get into
object function or we have greater
object of function interface vacuity
object or bunnyhop binary interface now
how can you make this code more
efficient now we will make this code
more efficient in the next part of the
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
