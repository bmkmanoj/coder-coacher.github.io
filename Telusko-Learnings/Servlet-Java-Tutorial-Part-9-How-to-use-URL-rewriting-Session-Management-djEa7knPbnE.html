merging session and that is URL
rewriting so how to use your rating so
let me remove cookies this time and this
one also so see what we need okay let me
remove focus from this side also say
what was the own or the whole purposes
when I call this page which is input
input text well I will enter my name it
will call first servlet I am getting t1
here right so I am getting STR I am
getting my name in STR and then I am
calling second Sabich and what was our
requirement I want to send this STR to
seconds outlet right that was the whole
purpose so what we'll do is we'll say
string STR equal to request its request
dot getparameter and we'll say the value
will be coming from t1 but hold on we
don't have t1 here right but still let's
try to run this let's see what happens
if I run this file since I'm working
with get request if I enter my name here
which is nothing if I say ok so you can
see I am getting address bar here and it
sayings welcome null it's because
whenever you work with this value here
request dot getparameter if it is a get
request it will fetch this value from
the address bar and unfortunately you
know address bar we don't have any t1 so
what we can do is if what you what
happens if I say question mark there a
second sublet question mark t1 equal to
Naveen and if I say enter so you can see
we are getting a value which is welcome
navin's cool so when you say get
parameter from t1 it will fetch that
data from address power so what I can do
is while calling second servlet while
calling second sublet from the first
servlet what if if I just send that
value here itself something in this way
so I will say second sublet question
mark t1 equal to plus STR so when you
send a request now ok let
this so if I send a request now so you
can see that t1 equal to now innocent we
are able to sign here and we are saying
welcome now in cool so it's working
right then if this is so flexible why to
use session and cookies is because we
talked about only sending a string when
you have a get method then it will work
what happens if you have a post request
so it will not work second problem is
let's say if you are if you want to send
lots of details data which we want to
make it secured dancing audio you cannot
use you are waiting we have to use
session or we have to use cookies right
so we have seen three ways of handling
session we have a URL rewriting then we
have session HTTP session we have
cookies there is one more way called as
hidden form fields which should be done
we do not normally use it but we can
also go for hidden form fields basically
the top three is session cookies and you
are rewriting also that's it from this
session in the next session we will talk
about some advanced topics so thank you
so much for watching and do subscribe
