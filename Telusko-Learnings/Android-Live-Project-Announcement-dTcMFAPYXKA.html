toys for learnings and finally we are
starting with Android Android life
sessions from last week I'm talking
about this right and people are waiting
because in fact I'm getting lots of
messages on YouTube and Facebook as well
when I'm going to start you the live
session so we are starting that from
tomorrow why not today is because I
wanted to announce it because I want
people you can know that we are going
live from tomorrow because then I get
lots of complaints you know you don't
you don't let us know about the live
session how would I envy know so this is
the announcements for that we have the
starting gate tomorrow and there's one
more purpose of this video let's plan
what we are going to do in tomorrow's
session again I will try to make this
type of videos for the next live session
because you would be knowing what we are
up to and what you can expect from the
live session so in the last session
we'll be doing something like this so
you can imagine you can see we have a
simple a simple layout where you can see
some codes the topics like Java or
spring and when you click on one of the
topic you will get these subtopics and
once you click on the subtopic you will
get the code of that topic example if
you click on Fibonacci you will get the
code for Fibonacci but hold on we will
not do the entire thing in one video
right because it will be very very
lengthy video now so what we will do is
we'll Mick will try to keep it short so
in the first video will only discuss
about the layout and how can you show
this dot show those details easy one
right and how exactly to fetch code from
the server that we'll do later in the
next life session so you can expect this
but the thing is you know I also tried
this last time in fact I went live for
the web sessions as well so the entire
web site we're trying to build live in
the in I mean earlier and I learned
something from that
the problem is initially everyone wanted
to contribute but later since it's a
high-end technology like spring
hibernate and not everyone is interested
in those technologies and also people
who wanted to do that they were not
knowing what are the prerequisite of
this of this live sessions because see
if you don't know Java if you don't know
how advanced technology works at first
you cannot attempt the live sessions
right because live sessions is a
different experience it's it is
something happening live is we are not
writing a cold partition of two numbers
we are not writing a code of finding a
prime number we are actually
implementing something visually we
deployed in the server
right so you need to have some knowledge
so that you can you can use this live
session efficiently I mean of course
what anyone can watch it but then to
make it more effective if you know those
basic things it will be very very easy
for you so what are the prerequisites
for the tomorrow session I can you will
get all the links in the description
area what are the prerequisite but then
let me just leash it down so first of
all you should be knowing kochava right
I mean not everything about Co Java but
object creation how how to return some
values how to pass a value right so you
should know all those things or you
should know how to get to classes I'm
talking an object so make sure you know
basics of Java because what is the
Android it's full of Java right of
course when you go with quadlin in
future you shouldn't you should be
knowing Cortland as well but then time
being you should know a co Java the next
thing you should know is the Indian Java
itself you should be very good with
multi-threading okay when I say very
good I'm talking about the basics of
multi-threading how I mean what is
threads and what happens when you
request I mean when one thread works and
second - it has to wait and all those
things so again you will find the video
in the description description you will
find the link in description area so
first go Java sankt second
multi-threading the third one is now if
you see this layout in fact with the
layout which you have seen earlier that
layout I mean that code we have already
done in last year so when I was teaching
about Android in last year I mean the
the videos which you have available on
YouTube in fact I already have around 35
videos on YouTube for Android so if you
in one of the one of the video is called
as expandable list in fact this the view
which you have seen is expandable used
example so you have to watch that video
as well because this session the live
session will be starting with that video
so watch that video practice that video
and once your frame is ready once your
layout is ready with that code we will
try to achieve what we want to achieve
and the data will be coming from server
this time okay so watch this in the
description here you have some links
watch those videos so that will be ready
for the tomorrow session again now
tomorrow's session will be done on the
disco program trying to do that okay
tomorrow session will be done on that is
called learning but then the future
sessions will be done on that is co pro
so tomorrow's session live will be doing
on that is called learning and the
recording of that the
video of that of that live session will
be uploaded on telescope low now there
are lots of advantages of being a member
of telescope low the future live
sessions will be done on telescope row
and there are lots of advanced videos
are coming on that is copra because not
everyone want to learn those
technologies and you might be thinking
how you'll be part of that that's very
easy you just have to be a member of
that and if you're thinking it will be
very costly don't worry at the startup
package we are charging or the 95 rupees
per month okay only 95 rupees for
learning Android I mean just imagine if
you go out you have to pay around 10,000
12,000 fees for Android for that other
technology as well like REST API is a
Spring Framework all these videos are
coming there okay so you have to pay
only 95 rupees per for the membership
again I'll be having a separate video on
that why you should be member dr. disco
Pro that's a different thing important
thing is be a member right it will be
beneficial for you and we are going live
from tomorrow to do Android I mean to
build something in Android so I hope
you'll excited I mean I'm excited so
let's let's get started with that
tomorrow okay I will update the time on
the free though okay hold on what's the
timing and where do you find the link
that's a good point
the thing is I know that something was
coming in your mind right how to see
this so timing is not fixed yet it will
be somewhere around 4:00 p.m. or 5:00
p.m. ist so to get the updates you have
to make sure that you like my Facebook
page because that's where we'll be
updating over the life session you have
to make sure that you are also being a
part of the Facebook group so we have a
Facebook group again you will find
