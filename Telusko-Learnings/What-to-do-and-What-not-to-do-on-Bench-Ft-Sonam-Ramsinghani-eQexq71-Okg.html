different icicles are things and in this
video we'll talk about what to do and
what not to do when you are on bench now
if you are thinking what bench means so
when you join a service-based companies
like tech tech mahindra we Pro Accenture
maybe I'd CL so when you join any of
this company so this is these are
service based companies right so what
they do they hire people in bulk maybe
thousand people from I mean in one year
so what they do they hire maximum people
because they are proactive companies so
they are looking for clients and if they
get a project they need people who are
ready to work on that project so what I
do they take bunch of people they train
them I mean they will train on different
technologies and then once the training
is complete most of them will get the
project and maybe some people will not
get the project and these people they
will go on bench so bench is the awesome
period right because you are getting
paid and you don't have to do any work
right you will be sitting on your on
your table with a computer and you are
doing nothing right and you're getting
paid for that so that PDU it is called
as a bench period ok so it is passe
bench so now the problem is I mean where
we have two perspective now so one is a
positive way and negative way so you can
take it in a positive way
Wow before we are on bench now and now
we can enjoy your life you can just go
to the company you can just swipe your
card go out watch a movie come back and
you can swap out right that's what you
can do you can you can you can enjoy you
can watch movies you can play games no
one will ask you anything right that is
benched period or something right but
that's the bad thing right because you
are wasting your bench period because
normally some people get bench period of
one month maybe two months over three
months maybe 14 months because I have
seen people they have they were on bench
for 14 months I mean it's not just that
key when you join a company will going
to go on bench it may also happen that
you were working on the project and the
project is just completed and now you
are released from the project you will
go on bench as well so I have seen
people who are there from on bench from
a long time so if you are wasting those
days you are actually wasting lots of
time you are wasting lots of resources
right so let's say even if you are
sitting on bench for six months and
maybe up two years when you want to
a company what will happen the next
company will ask you they want ask you
from which company are coming from that
doesn't matter what matters is what
project you have worked on and what you
will say I was on bench
how many can can you imagine that if you
are if you are going to interview and
you're saying maximum time you have
spent on bench that's a bad thing right
so then you will feel a negative way
right I don't want to go on bench now
but just imagine this is not in your
hand right you will go on bench or nod
is depend upon the company's depend upon
their requirement is depend up the
number of a number of projects available
and that too it goes then it goes and
grind down be okay I mean they will not
select best people they will select
people randomly I mean some people do
select on their scores other companies
they select based on there may be
alphabetical order may be random numbers
so I was working for the company where
they simply said you know we go in a
random way so this is software that
software will choose and it I mean they
will choose any any any employee and
then they will put that into a project
right so if you are lucky you will get
the project if you are unlucky you will
not get the project then question is
what to do now there are lots of people
they go in depression they feel you know
they are not doing anything they are
wasting their time so what to do now so
to make you understand what you can what
you can do in the in the bench and what
you should not do we have
Sonam here so Sonam is working for one
of the biggest immense in India and
she'll be sharing her experience with
you or when she was on bench hello
everyone and Sonam and I have completed
my BA in computers and I am currently
working in one of their menses and in
all I have 18 months of experience in IT
industries today I am here to share my
bench experience with you I was trained
on advanced Java buying a bean sir and I
must say that he made Java much more
interesting than it was before
so after completing my training we all
were on bench bench where you don't have
any project and you just sit idle doing
that thing and initially we all used to
enjoy this period I was I used to enjoy
this period by chit-chatting with my
friends and going to the recreation room
and
playing carom and a lot of fun things
with them but sooner my all of my close
friends caught project and I was the
only one amongst the amongst my circle
with without any project so it was like
quite depressing for me that and the
only one who is doing nothing and
everyone has got project so I thought of
keeping myself busy with something and
utilizing my time so there was one
website in our company where we used to
learn we can learn anything
actually there were lot of online
trainings there and I thought of
learning angularjs because it was quite
interesting to me and I learned
angularjs and spend my trial time
playing carom and I also make new
friends it is very important in IT
industry to make connections and grow
your network so if you are on a bench
try to learn new things try to make new
contacts and just try to be not on bench
for longer at a time because it really
affects your performance appraisals and
make you make use of your time very
wisely
thank you so that was so no sharing
experience of our bench PDA so now
question arise what to learn and where
to learn because you don't want to be on
the bench bench whether for a longer
time right so what to learn so what you
can do is increase your contact so that
you will understand what are different
projects are available in the company
and this technology they are they are
working on so try to learn those
technologies and which interest you of
course so let's say if you are if you
are if you want to go in designing I
mean if you want to be a part of
designing team you can learn angularjs
if you want to be a part of the backing
team you can learn
database or Java so based on your skill
set based on what you know just try to
improve that and from where to learn it
again you so every company have that
internal portal so they have their own
learning system where you can learn or
learn from and if it is not not
available we have three spells and
things where you can you can watch all
different videos and that's it
so make sure you increase your skill set
so that you will not be on bench more a
lot of time so that's a thank you for
watching and do subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
