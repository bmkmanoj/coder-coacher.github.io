from political earnings and in this
video we'll talk about gstl SQL tags so
anyway you want to use SQL tag we cannot
use code we have to use SQL okay now
what is the use of SQL 2x here so let's
say you have a JC page and you want to
connect with database now what you will
do so to connect with database you need
to write some tags using which you can
connect with database normally what
happens is you have to write Java code
you have to follow those seven steps to
do that but Jo still says hey don't
worry we have some tags using which you
can correct with it can you connect it
to the database and you can fetch the
data let's see how to do that so what
we'll do is first of all let's create a
database in the map in the in any
database you use maybe MySQL Oracle I'm
using mask you'll here so if I go to
MySQL I already have a database which is
Mario inside that database I have a
table verse gadgets okay and if I if I
see what is what is there inside gadgets
you can see we have G ID G name and
price so we have one two three we have
iPhone as name then laptop and then one
plus 3 we have this price here I want to
fetch these elements or this values on
the page so of course we have to connect
database right now do you connect that
first of all we have to use something
called as a data source now data source
will define what is the database name I
mean first of all which database you're
working with second what is the database
name then username and password and you
can do that with the help of data source
tag so we have to use recursive stag in
which you have to first mention the
database I mean the variable which we'll
be using for 2 therefore that will say
DB next you have to mention the driver
name because every DBMS will have a
different driver and for me the driver
is comm dot MySQL dot J DB C dot driver
ok and then you have to mention the URL
I will say URL is JDBC : mass kill again
for different DBMS we have different URL
I'm just assuming that you know how to
connect database with Java in database
they are the same steps then I will use
my port number which is theta 0 7 for my
machine
Mario the database name and then you
have to mention the username which is
user equal to root and then password
which is the next one in fact when you
say it will type this it simply say
control space it will give you thing the
amazing thing about my machine is I
don't have a bicycle password so I don't
have to specify that if you are doing
this for the first time if you have a
magical password set it that now what
next now once you go onto database we
have to use the query so I have to say
SQL colon query okay in this square you
have to mention your SQL query rich
query you want to execute now once your
query get executed it will store the
data somewhere and that data is your Val
so we'll say RS so it will store the
data inside others now if you have seen
my data if you have seen my video on
JDBC we normally use object or result
set the same thing is here which is our
result set here then we have to use data
source which data source you are working
with and we have to connect with this DB
so we'll say we'll use the expression
language you I will say DB okay we with
double quotes now once you have done
that let's mention okay what else you
have to mention here then you have to
mention the query so we'll finish this
here we'll say in tag and inside this we
can mention the query na so here you can
mention select star from gadgets okay
now once you specify query so what what
will happen is when you execute this
code now it will try to connect with
your database now once it is connected
then you will you will get your data
source by DB and then you will you will
execute this query and the results will
be will be stored inside others now
question as how to print all this values
but to print the values we have we can
use we can we can specify individual
values why we can say C colon out and
then we can specify value right and we
can we can fetch the value from his own
set and we can print but it's I want to
put all the values or do that that we'll
see in the next video but you have to
make sure that if you want to execute
this thing you need a MySQL to eyeball
okay so you
to add your mass co-driver here so again
you can connect you can download that
from Google or somewhere so to make sure
that you are adding a mask of Hunter
here so what I will do is before
starting the next video I will be adding
the mass of vector here just go to
Google and search for MySQL connector
for Maya so connector J's didn't just
write it here
this mask Y connector / j download this
charm file and save it here in the live
for you now once you do that you can use
the master connector and yes so in the
next video we'll see how to how to print
that but make sure make sure you
subscribe my channel and like this video
if you liked it thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
