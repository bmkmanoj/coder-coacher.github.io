set up Android studio how to create a
project in this we'll talk we'll talk
about some terms used in Android because
of course right because when it when you
go for further tutorials we'll talk
about lots of things we talked about XML
we talked about Java we'll talk about by
turns text view layout then we'll talk
about the draw images all those things
so before starting with this let's talk
about sometimes we have we will be using
in this videos or in this series so I
will start with the first one which is
the Perl structure ok so what's a finish
structure here in your project it will
give us app and inside that will be
having got subfolders one of the
important folder is your important file
is your manifest I will discuss about
manifest at the end of the video so just
remember we have to talk about manifest
now next we have is Java so what is Java
value so all your working files all your
operations will be inside this jar of
files and that Java files will be inside
this jar folder ok so maybe you will be
having thousands of thousands of pluses
or thousands of files so all these files
will be enough particular folder your
package so let's say you're talking
about com dot that is go dot addition
calm dot that is cannot login comp out
to this code or sign up but maybe you
have a different operations now you're
talking about you logging so we'll say
komtar telesco dot logging dot logger so
it will be creating lots of files and
all these files will be on different
packages so all this patterns will be
inside this jar folder now what next we
will require some images we require some
value some strength so that will be in
this our es folder which is also called
as resource folder so inside resource
will be having layout should be having
drawable which means you'll be having
all the images you can have your xml's
here also so that image is like let's
say you want to go for the background
image you want to provide some effects
in the background you can use XML there
so all those things will be inside this
draw able fold out the next one is value
so let's say you want to use some
strings in your project so throughout
your project you will be using lots of
captions or string so let's say on the
button you will be having some string on
the label you will be having some some
string so you can mention everything in
this values folder okay and then we have
something called us grad alarm now for
sure when you are building an
application you will be you have to
specify some things you have to specify
the minimum SDK which is your the
minimum minimum android version your app
will support and you have to also
mention the target SDK which is the
maximum API level or the maximum Android
support so let's say if your if your
mentioning that the minimum SDK is its
Ice Cream Sandwich that means your app
will not support on any phone which is
below Ice Cream Sandwich then we have
target API so let's say if you are
specifying it's as lollipop then your
app will not support it about lollipop
so it will support it will support only
lollipop right I'll then below so that's
that those those things you have to
mention in this file which is gratis
file ok notice great idea so grad is a
build tool okay so if you are familiar
with mavin mavin is same like gradient
here you specify the project structure
you specify some settings for your
project and you also mention the
dependencies now was that so let's say
in your project you want to use some
extra libraries so that is from face
book like so you want to use YouTube API
Z in your project you have to download
you have to use some dependencies so
your app is dependent on YouTube API so
does it dependency right and how going
to mention these dependencies you have
to mention everything inside this gratis
file every time you change the gradual
file you have to sync
ok so your project need to be synced
with the gradual file again you do not
do it every time you change gradually
you will see the option in the drop that
you have changed there was some change
at the gradall
sync knobs it you just have to click on
that button automatically please sync
with your project amazing thing right so
that is greater here now what next
now let's say you have quitted the
project you called upin structure now in
your application you'll be having
multiple layouts right maybe a multiple
forms so each floor form here will be
called as activity now this activity
here so let's say you're working with a
login form so once you open an app the
first page you see is a login form
that's one activity once you login so
let's say your
working for successful the next activity
you will say is let's say home where you
will find all your feeds so that's one
activity so you have multiple activities
right now to create this activity we
require two things one to design the
activity we require XML file second to
make it work the operations you want to
achieve that that is possible with the
help of Java file so with every activity
you will be having a Java file if you
want to provide the working ok so if we
have a form dot XML here in which you
have you are asking for the username so
that's the so that is possible with a
pop edit text you want to show an image
a user image a user profile page you can
say that is with the help of image view
so that's these are the components in
your designing thing now in image view
you can assign the image again from
where it will come you get reply get
which will come from tribal right so
because you have all the images in
drawable folder here and you can file
this image here and that's not my pic ok
that's just my some kind of my logo so
we have or then we have two things here
I'm sad or I'm happy so if you look my
face now I'm happy but if you say this
is sad right so you have to check here
that is sad so this will select only one
that's radio button right if you are
familiar with job of course you know
about this thing this is radio button
and then we have a button so once you
complete the form you can click on a
button here which is done we also have
textview for the labels so let's say you
have to enter your name so that's that's
label right so that's touch textview
here so to enter text we have edit text
to show the text we have textview sounds
quite right and once you click on the
button it should it should do something
now where to mention it has to do
something and that is your Java file
here ok as soon as you launch this
activity the first method will call is
on create so if a family with Java so in
Java we use a main method so as soon as
you create an object it will call
constructor so test does the start does
the starting point here on create this
is the starting point of your activity
every time you are not if you open your
activity the first thing it will call
this on create and you can do all this
task here
so let's say once you click on a button
so before that you need to link this to
files so you have to link your Java file
you act with XML because XM is just a
design right so you to link this draw
file with this XML and how to link that
so you have to create the object of edit
text here so how do you object of in
text you have to say edit text
okay that's edit text ignore the
spelling and then we have that civil
name it as et now you have to link this
eating with this but this thing right
because once you type some data here you
have this data which is loving should go
inside the inside your Java file that's
why you have to create this object here
and how to get that so if you have to
use some method in here which is follows
find view by ID so you have to mention
this method here and you have to mention
by which name which is represented so
this is this this name is a name any
text name you can go for anything all
this simply say this is et to be more
just to make it simple and then inside
this you have to mention that it is from
80 that's not the actual syntax will see
the syntax and punch to start with the
working ok so we have to use a method
which is called as find view by ID right
so you can do this for all this objects
here but turns out there is a problem
here let's say you have printed the
object for button but every time you
click on a button it will not provide
the event for you because by default
your buttons are done you have to add
what you say a listener to it and how to
add a listener so we have to say every
time you click on a button you have to
add a listener and that that nothing you
can do with the help of a listener
method again we see that in the
programming how to add a listener but
you should know some terms here so let
me go for the caps so we should know
about the pin structure where you have
the app you have you have Java you have
RDS you have griddle we are still
remaining with manifest right and then
will be having the activity so in
activity you have you will be having two
things the design part and the working
part so design use xml and walking is
your java and if you want to achieve
some operations you have to like
your Java file with the activity with
the above find view by ID method and
yeah so that's your activity and
structure now let's talk about the
manifest no what is exha manifest is so
let's say you have lots of activity in
your project so let's say you have five
to six activities now in manifest you
can specify with which activity you're
working with all you have to define all
the activities you are working in your
project and you can even specify the
starting point of your activity so you
can set the launcher activity you can
set everything inside manifest sounds
good right so I can see that in the
coding part how it works so for if you
have multiple activities you can set all
these activities if they are pop
manifest okay so you just have to
remember all this so that we can start
with the actual coding part so that's it
thank you so much for watching and make
sure to subscribe the channel and thanks
for watching video and there's one more
thing
soon we'll be doing a QA sessions notice
QL session if you have any doubts just
post that question in the comment
section and once in a week I will do our
QA sessions so in this QA session we'll
talk about the actual if you have a
doubts in the concept any concept of one
maybe Android Java I think you can ask
the question
second you can ask question about your
anything you want to know anything
anything in fact anything you can want
you want to know and I will try to make
that session as live session ok so
that's it for this video thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
