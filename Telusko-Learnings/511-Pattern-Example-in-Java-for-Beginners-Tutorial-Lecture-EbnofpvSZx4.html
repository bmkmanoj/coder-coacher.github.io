video we'll see we'll solve this problem
here now this is the pattern here now if
your question is why we should solve all
this pattern while learning Java as when
you talk about Java so if any
programming language in that matter so
if we talk about C programming or Java
so we have two things one is this syntax
and second is the logic so while you
learn all the syntax what you remember
only syntax right so where you struggle
is the logic so to increase your logic
you can you can solve this patterns so
there is not the ultimate step but this
is the beginning you can start where
this is the beginning for you so let's
start with the pattern so this you have
this pattern here so if you focus on
this pattern so we have a 1 here a 0 1
and then 1 0 1 then 0 1 0 1 and this
goes on so basically it's a pattern
where you have number of rows and number
of columns so if you say this so this is
your number this is your first row here
if this is your first row first column
element second row first column element
and then second row second column
element now before printing this what we
can do is we can just fringe stars so
before going to this 0 and 1 we print
star so we'll print 1 star here so I
should have all this number we'll try to
put in star so once you complete that
task and then we'll try to convert this
into 1 and 0 for that let me go go back
to my NetBeans so in NetBeans to do this
whenever you have to print a pattern
something in that well let me draw that
pattern here also just to make it more
effective so we'll say star ok
so we'll draw this those pattern here so
it is 1 we have 0 and 1 and we have 1 0
1 you have 0 1 0 1 and lastly we have 1
0 1 0 and 1 so this is the pattern here
right now before this let's print all
the stars so in order to put in star
your task should be we
have to print those and we have to print
in columns so to count the number of
rows to call the number of columns we
require some what you say a counter so
well what we'll do is we'll say int I
comma int J so this will be a counter
just so this I and J will become our
counter okay now so once you count is
once you got this counter with user for
loop whenever you try to print a for
loop we have to use so the outer for
loop so this foreigner be responsible to
count the number of rows and the inner
for loop it should be using there will
be for number of columns so we start
this for loop by one and we'll end it at
five so since we have five rows we have
to start with one and we'll finish at
five now this is the outer loop which is
responsible to count the number of rows
now what we'll do is we'll use our inner
loop which is responsible to count the
number of columns so we'll say J equal
to 1 J less than equal to 5 and J plus
plus now say if you start with I and end
at 5 it means you will be printing
number of columns as 5 so number of rows
as 5 so this is here which will which we
will be using as to count the number of
rows and this loop will be 4 columns but
if you use this one which is 1 to 5 it
will print a box structure because we
will be printing 5 columns every time
okay so if I if I print here let's say s
out in the box if I print star that's
what we want to put in now and if I use
this so it will print star but let me
just run this so how to run so shift F 6
it will take some time
oh so if we run this you can see
everything is of the same line it's
because we are using something well as a
print so whenever you want to print on
new line so what I want after printing
the first first row it should come to
new line
so after this loop what we can do is we
can simply say sour tab just to get a
new line here and now for than this it
you can see it's a box structure now why
we are getting this box structure is
simply because we are we are printing
the number of columns as five what I
want is for the first row it should
print only one element for the second
why it should print only two elements so
for that we'll finish it that I so if
your value is one that is your first row
it will print only one column if the
second row it will print the number of
columns as true and now if we run this
and that's the output right so this is
what we want but hold on not stars we
want numbers right we want something in
this format so for this what we can do
is see for sure this is your first row
first column so if I add one and one so
first row first column 1 and 1 plus 1 is
2 okay so whenever you have 2 it is 1 so
for this you know your though number is
to your current number is 1 right so it
becomes 2 plus 1 is 3 ok odd number so
odd number is 0 what about this this is
2 plus 2 which is 4 number is 1 which is
even number is 1 so if you if you find a
logic here so whenever you add these row
number and column number if it is even
number you should print 1 if it is odd
number you should print 0 right as an
object so what we can do is before
printing this with the if I plus J ok so
this addition mod 2 is equal to equal to
0 that's an even number you need to
print 1 okay in else has been the same
thing but with our group printing here 0
okay so
we have even number it will print one
odd number will print
simple and now for them this attach the
pattern you wanted right so that's the
answer
cool so this is how way to print this
pattern here
okay this vegetable which is this
pattern so that is from this video we'll
see the next pattern in the next
subsequent tutorial so thanks for
