and this video we'll talk about
encapsulation so we'll divide the video
into two parts I mean not the videos but
the topic well in the first part of the
video we'll talk about what is
encapsulation if the second part of the
video will talk about why do we need it
so in caption so basically means is
you'll be having a class and let's say
this class is student in this class so
normally what happens is class will so
object know something object does
something right and we have done we have
we have seen that from a long time so
object knows something with the help of
variables object does something with the
help of methods so whenever you create
any variable let's say we have roll
number and we have name we have to make
sure that those variable data so those
variables need to only be changed or
fetch with the help of methods so if you
want to do anything with the variables
you have to use methods okay
example if you want to set the value of
the roll number what we can normally do
is we can create the object of student
we can say student s1 equal to new
student and we'll say s1 dot roll number
is equal to 2 and we can say s1 dot name
is equal to let's say Naveen so when you
have when you are signing the value of
s1 roll number two and I mean so we are
trying to access that from main method
so it is not right so the only way to
access the roll number and name should
be through methods so normally those
methods are basically called as ghettos
and setters know what what exactly it is
so to set the value we have to use
setters and to get the value we have to
use gaiters example so let's say I want
to set the value for roll number I will
say public void since I want to set the
valuable name I will use a method named
as set roll number we have to make sure
that is our is capital and will accept
or roll number they will say roll number
or we can also say our and now I can say
a roll number is equal to R so we are
assigning the value of R to roll number
that is one way how to fetch the value
of roll number so we say public now
since we want to fetch will should
return int and we say get roll number
and now this will not accept any value
right but this will return a value we'll
do it it will return a roll number
and now if you want to access that we
have to say s1 dot set roll number by
specifying two so we are not assigned
the value directly right we assigning
the value through a method that means
the only way to use the variables is
through a method and we can also fetch
it now so let's say let me fetch the
value I will say s1 dot get roll number
so show up saying s1 dot roll number I'm
saying s1 dot get roll number and if I'm
this code you can say it will work so
you got to so the only way to access the
variables is through methods and since
you accessing the data through methods
we can also make this variables as
private so you have to make sure that
your variables are always private so
variables should be private and the
methods who will access those variables
should be public that means you are
binding your data within methods and
whenever you bind your data with methods
the concept is called as encapsulation
so the concept of encapsulation is it is
binding data with method there is
binding data with methods so we have a
data here and we have some methods here
so the only way to access the variables
is through methods but we have done that
for the whole number guide we have not
done that for name the thing is if I
don't do this for names how to type it
right but encapsulation is so famous you
just you can simply ask your Eclipse to
give it for you so you just try to
right-click you have to say so so you
have to click on generate getters and
setters can see that and select both the
variables and click on ok as we have
seen in the Constructors so you can see
it is giving you both the both the
methods here public eight roll number
and set roll number and get name and set
name and we have also seen how to use
this keyword right so you know about
that so instead of assigning the value
now so you can see we are getting error
on this line because we have made name
as private field right so if you see the
if you see this it is giving you an
error which is student dot name is not
visible so what we can do here is we
cannot use name now we can say it's dot
set name and we can pass the name there
so that's how it works if I run this
code we got to because printing only the
roll number let's also bring the name is
a get name and if you want this code
record roll number and name both so this
is this is how you can use your getters
and setters and this is encapsulation
so that was the first part the second
part we have talked about is why we need
it the need for encapsulation is we have
to make sure that your data is safe
right so this data need to be saved
see if I want to assign the value if you
want to assign the value using to assign
the value to rule number the only way is
with the help of methods right we have
to use set roll number now let's say if
you make it if you make this variable as
public anyone can access the variable
right
what we want is even if people is -
people are trying to change the value I
can simply print a log file right I will
say I can simply maintain a log file we
can say value of roll number roll number
change I can maintain a log file because
when you talk about several programming
we always maintain a log file if you on
this code now it is assigning a new
value but it is also printing value of
roll number change at least you can
maintain a log file so you can do that
methods right you cannot do that tightly
with variables if I if I if I say s1 dot
name equal to Naveen and if I have a
public public variable there no I mean
how can I meant analog file
changing the values of the variable or
fetching the value of the variable you
can also maintain a log file that user
has sympathy value we can simply say a
user is accessing the value at this you
can it will maintain log file for you
you can see that it is saying that user
is accessing the log accessing the value
so you can maintain log file you
organize one use second use is before
fetching the value of roll number you
can also check for the login of the user
if user is on a log Indian system are
going to do that in this line in this
code you can write those statements so
it's always better to access the
variable with the help of methods
because that's the only way you should
be able to access your variables you
have to make sure that your variables
are private and then you need to have
our gauges and setters who will access
those variables so that's it that's
about encapsulation that's it about this
