something called as a days see we talk
about a days in lots of programming
languages like C C++ Java or C sha we
always use as is in some other way
now what exactly Adam means see before
starting with array let's go for this
example let's suppose if you take a
variable int I normally this int I
variables can store lots of values it
can store integer values from mass some
number two plus some number now if you
take a second variable J it will again
take some values if you can say k equal
again take some value now a I is a
different variable J is different when
different K is different with even let's
suppose I am saving a marks of a student
in I as 50 I am saving a marks in J as
60 I am saving a mask in K as 70 now if
you can see this is 50 in saved I 60
which is K between J and 70 which is
saved in K now let's imagine this thing
as a normal bus see when you go for bus
let suppose you see your bus okay this
is one bus this is second verse and this
is your third bus a normal travelling
bus now when I talk about this bus this
bus maybe is I this bus name is J this
bus name is K every bus has different
value I was 50 when you J has 60 value
and K has 70 value this are totally a
different verse which toes are number
one is 50 60 70 somewhat integer values
now problem is when I know this all buzz
of same time integer you know I can
create our train out of it
issue calling a bus we can call it as a
bogie a bogie of a train right this is
one bogey
this is my I connected
second bogey this is my connected third
bogey now I have a train with three
bogies a bogie I a bogie J and a bogie K
or you know a train car train bogies now
I say a train - a a bus every person
individual was its I was HJ BuzzFeed
escapers if I create a train I can
create a train of I this whole train is
called as I having different even bogies
this is bogie 0 this is Goku one this is
boogie too because we will talk about
bogie number you have to give individual
boogie number this is working on boss
zero booking number one bogey number two
again the whole train is called as ina
this is your eye now this book is it all
the same 50 this bogie Jay will say one
say will say a 16 this bogie - will same
70 again here we have three different
variables here they just have one
variable I which is able to save all the
three values having different index
number this is bokeh numbering also
collects index number so whenever you
talk about arrays arrays are nothing but
collection of elements the only
condition is this should be similar type
of elements it should be in throughout
ink it should be flowing toward float it
can be character to your character that
means you have to maintain the elements
this example yeah here you have the
element engagement in the element when I
collect all this in Tana mint I got an
array of int named as I and if you have
to represent this in if you have to
create this added in C you can create
this are using high after I haven't
defined the variable and you have to say
this size this will define the size of
your train or size of your array here we
are taking only three so sign of the
idea is 3 if I were to say I want to
store 50 in zero location I
is in this way it's io0 I am saving a
value 50 in I of 1 I am saying a value
of 60 in I of - I am saving a value 70
that means it's your I of 0 15 i of 160
i of 270 this is how you can use a DS
since you love using three different
variables I have used only one variable
with three locations it's 50 60 70 50 0
Caucasian 16 first location and 17
second location
this is index number of atoms see now is
this Ana can be of any size it can be of
10 it can be of 100 it can be of
thousand also it is depend upon variable
how much you want again it depends upon
which type of programming language you
are going with you can go for see also
you can go for C++ also you can go for
Java also everywhere add-ins are same
the only thing changes is the type of
declaration is the type of making it
when you go for Java Java treats
everything is object so if you are
creating an ad in Java you have to
create object of n but in say everything
is primitive so if you have to create an
array in C you have to create a limited
intellect as a visible name and size of
it takes three now let's take a proper
example of adding
let's suppose I am dealing with a sleep
see program as main function anomaly
function because career is open cannabis
close now here if I define a variable
int I and I born this variable I should
accumulate at least five values it will
have five values I want to assign five -
in this way if I am you're I'm having a
trail with number of bogeys as five
bogeys so this will be having five of
these I hope you side one two three four
five the numbering of this bogey will
start with 0 then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4
that means the size of a the maximum
size of an array is 5 and the maximum
index the bodies for because it's
starting with 0 0 1 2 3 4 now if you
have to store values you know it's very
easy to store value it can be in this
way it's I of 0
I want to store I observable a new one
so it's 1 I understood I have money
value 2 so it's I of 1 equal to 2 I want
you three about your 4 and 5 so it's I
of 2 is 3 I 3 is 4 i of 4 is 5 you know
if you see this code it's normally very
easy to see this code is actually you're
assigning values to individual blocks
again if you are taking 5 variables
because you require PI locations you can
take if it's I comma J comma K comma L
comma and you have to take 5 variables
rich enough that we are taking only one
variable in this one variable you can
store exist why later
the problem is you are doing the
assignments repeatedly as you know if
you do something repeatedly you can go
for loops and the better you'll be is we
can go for fondue because it for though
if you are not a starting event do if
you know the
you can go for four loops so we are
doing all this thing you know we can go
fun under code here see we have to use a
for loop again
let's go far for nabob Jay Jay we start
with one J less than equal to because we
are using 500 stuff I and J plus plus
again whenever you work with a adage and
it always start with zero so starting
with one is not a good task you have to
start with zero so Jake what you should
be zero and J should end before the five
so you have to remove your equal so it
will start with you it will end it for
because you have written less than five
now what you have to do you have to
assign value like if you are signing I
of zero I of one I of two out of three I
have four we should have I think this
zero one two three four we can write J
so it's I of J is equal to now if you
are value if you have occasion zero we
are sending 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 and 4 5 that
means our increment of the jet value so
you can going this nozzle and it's J
plus 1 that means whichever the J's by
the way if ej 0 it will store 1 if j is
1 equals 2 it will store 2 that means
you have an array of pi events which
having value from 1 to 5 then you have
to closing that's it these holes what is
converting into this value therefore
normally when you use a days it is
better to go for loops when you are
signing some bad news and added it now
many use menu a big you require of high
amount of elements of same type to be
stored in a single variable again
sometimes we don't before to go for a
days because see if you know the number
of variables you can go for this if you
don't know his number of variables how
much you require like that then this
example we use video to store the number
of the marks of students again your
choice can be 10 dishes can 15 but if
you give a size of 15
to accumulate all the 15 if 16 person
come it will create problem because you
are any size is 15 second problem if you
have 15 I have student attention and
only you will you know you are
unwantedly deserving that 5 locations
and each location will carry unit 2
bikes so 2 into 5 location is registered
at is 10 by it's a vegetable so if you
know the number of size or if we know
the number of blocks if you know number
of variables you can go for a DS see
them solve this problem in Java you have
below if you if you want a variable
length added in Java provides you a
variable in that is something one is
arranged if you don't if you are not
traveling with Java let it be your
concentration is only on a DS so we
talked about add eggs is a adding
individual bus you can go for a train
with only one variable I or you can take
any variable name every bogie has this
number and shutting with index number
with zero and will be ending by n minus
1 if you have any location it's n minus
1 location okay so now this is single
dimensional array this is something like
an addict what if you have to go for a
cable let's suppose I want in this way I
have 2 rows and 2 columns this is my Row
1 Row 2 column 1 column 2 you can go for
this by creating a two dimensional array
this is this was what dimensional this
is two dimensional that means you have
to define a variable I this time it is
not one dimensional it is two original
one is two second is to and semicolon
the same way you are using but a problem
is this is your eye and this is your J 1
2 belongs to I 1 2 belongs to J or in
some ways I suppose change the variable
name as a it's for better use because
whenever you go for a row count it
always go for I anybody
Collin College it goes with J let's
suppose I want to store something in
this way whenever I want to save fun if
I want to see a fire you okay and then
you go for a days is not going to it
goes from 0 to 1 so it will be 0 to
occasion it will be one location which
will be 0 location it will be one
location so I start with 0 and 1 J start
with 0 and you we have one now I'm going
to store something in this block it is 0
and 0 so it is a of 0 and 0 it will be
fine
if you have to save your 6 it's a or
first is no number divided by 0 carnauba
is 1 so 1 equals no 6
if I have to store something here as 8
so it's 1 because it is second row and
first column it's 0 equal to 8 if it is
this vocation I will just show you a 2l
it's a of its 1 and 1 it's 12 you know
these these are you can store values in
adding again if you want to go for a
better way if you have to use for them
you can do it it's very simple if you
have to use father again you have to
take two for the one for dokkan second
is for column count and then you have to
go for nested joke there is a different
task well thing is if you have creating
a single row it's one division rate you
are going for tables multiple rows you
can go for two dimensionally this is two
lows two columns if I write here three
it's two rows three columns if I not
here for it's for those three columns
this is how you can create two
dimensionally in fact most of them uses
three dimensional a also if we want
something in cubic way because this is
low this is stable if you want a cube
you can go for three dimensional right
example two like AHA photo at one side
three bottom and to backside so you can
also go for cubes this is what when you
talk about aliens exactly mean right
normally when you go for advanced
programming we certainly use arrays in
multiple things like when you go forward
if you have to create or table like two
twos approve two threes of six you can
go for a days if you have two straws
same element same type edge eventually
number of in same block you can go for
atoms and this is what when I say is all
about
thank you that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
