the remote interface and we have done
with the class which implements that
interface and this class need to be a
straight for this because we are working
on stateful session bean to make it work
or to check if it's working or not we
have to create a JSP page
so using that JSP page I will enter some
numbers and it will add that numbers
into a list even we can remove the
elements so what we can do is we can
create a new JSP psoriatic on your
project and say new and click on JSP and
we'll name this file as index because I
want to create this is a first file and
we'll click on finish so once I click on
finish it will give you our JSP file so
this is your JC file let me remove all
these extra comments for you and in this
body if I remove this body ok ok so let
me have that body here will remove that
later now what I want here in order to
write your JS because we have to use a
script let right but when you will write
something in scripted it will added
those lines into your service method now
when you want to work with this EJB or
straight for HIV you need to provide
something called as initial context now
initial context is the class in Java
which provides you the initial
configuration because using this initial
contact method you can you can use a
method let us look up now look up will
help you to search for your
implementation it's because the object I
will be creating here will be the object
of it will be object of a remote
interface and it should get the memory
from this class so in order to face the
memory from this class I will ask EJB to
the to that each IV will say ok just
give me the name of the class I will do
it for you and for that you have to use
a method for this lookup now what
exactly I mean by that is let me create
a a script it if I write anything in
this query like it will go into that
method which is service but I don't want
this line should go into service
I want this lines to be outside
which means I want to create one more
method here that's why I'm using my
declaration syntax here in the index in
declaration what I need is I need a
first object which should be private and
I want it to be static and the object
name here is it is the interface name
here is it is list elements remote and
the object I'll be creating here let's
say it is say values only use this new
values okay
and will declare it you I'm not creating
object of these two and just creating
our reference so in order to you know in
order to import this package what I can
simply click on this bubble here and say
add input ej v dot least least elements
remote which we have put it in a package
called as EGP now so when you work with
initial context you have to run your
initial context in the first stage of
your page loading which is in each stage
now in order to work with in it we have
to define a method which is public or
void so whenever you work with JSP JSP
says give me JSP in it and in bracket
you can provide a bracket here and in
Kedah basis the first thing we need to
provide here it is with something was in
each of context but there might be some
critical statement this block will use a
try-catch so that we can avoid errors
here so we'll say it is exception e and
this i will simply print it is system
with a system dot out dot println and i
will print the error here simple right
let me give a semicolon now in this I
need to create object of initial context
versus because it will help us to find
to use a lookup and initial context
class belongs to a package for the Java
X dot naming because we want to search
for the implementation I don't want to
provide the actual IP address of the
server so you can search a server with
the help of name and that service
provided by Java X dot knee
me so we'll say initialcontext IC equal
to nu initialcontext now once you cook
once you got the object of initial
context we can create the object of
values will set its value is equal to to
fetch that those values like we can
simply say I see dot so there's a method
with IC colace lookup the lookup will
ask you for the name of your project or
the class the name of the class is least
element so we'll say it is list elements
okay and this should be included in
double quotes because it will search for
it okay
but this linked list interface it
belongs to some project right so we have
to also specify the project name and the
project name is a JV state full now what
next now when you want when when you
want your eg bitch should search for
this class ejp says okay first give me
the type of search I want to apply is it
local so it will be a global search or
you want some other type of search now
what other type we have is something
else module level search or you have a
playable search since as a beginner
level we can simply go with global level
so we can say Java : global and given
give a slash so this is the type of
score by mentioning here so this is my
scope here now the problem is this
lookup will give you an object but I
don't want object of values or the
object of object class what I want is it
should give me object of list elements
in fact least elements interface name is
Ramon okay done right so by this we have
done with the object creation of value
so this is how we can achieve dependency
injection so even if you have in future
if you move your class somewhere you can
just change this path okay so that's the
advantage of using this initial context
class now what next I need here next I
want to take the input from user so how
do how will use our intern internal
input for that we need to provide some
for
thank you so we go to body here in this
body after hello world instead of hello
world we can simply print it is as
welcome and in this I will create a
board I will create a form tag will say
form since I want to call this same form
again and again I can just give a form
name I will say the form name is say ABC
doesn't matter was a fun what's your
form name and then we'll use a method
you just to make it more powerful I will
use a method which is post and from tag
close now once you've done with the form
tag what I what are the what are the
things I need here the first thing I
need here is a text box where you will
enter the data so again you can use a
NetBeans for this you can simply go to a
window IDE tool and a palette using
which you can drag and drop the elements
from here but it's easy to type when you
have a simple form so I will say it is
input tag input type it should be text
then we just specify the name and we'll
say name is t1 okay and we'll use a br
tag now what next I need two buttons one
button for addition and second button
for removing elements so to take button
will say input type equal to so when you
want button you can simply write a
submit and you can give a value so first
button will be for add and second I need
to specify a name also because I have
two buttons on the same form so we can
use this as ad number or a denim so done
with this button also and let's go for
last one which is in turn we can just
copy this code down and instead of add
here we can simply say it is remove not
so let's say remove and the button name
will or the name will give as r.e.m num
so which is remove num simple so by this
you have created your form let me just
test this form it's
King or not so you can simply say run it
will take some time to compile and get
get to this get to the container okay
it's compiling
strutting a server okay so let's go back
to the code before it runs so we have
our text field we have two buttons value
so it is add and they move so if I click
on add it will create it will add the
elements and in history if I click on
remove it will remove the elements from
the list they depend upon the specified
value so if I give any string type value
it will give you an header who is taking
a lot of time was the issue let me go to
the console
it says GlassFish it's starting okay
stick a lot of time simple stoats okay
okay so it is deployed now so now it
will open that output in Internet
Explorer is because I have defined
specify the default browser as ie I know
it's a crime but no choice here we can
change it to Firefox also okay so now
you can see we are getting a welcome
page and if I type V of five and one
song once I click on five if I say add
it should add the element and the output
should be shown something somewhere here
now how to how to add that element there
and how to show the output that we'll
see in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
