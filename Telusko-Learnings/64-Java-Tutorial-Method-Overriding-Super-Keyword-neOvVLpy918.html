so once we have talked about inheritance
and then constructors then we have
talked about transitive overloading and
we also talked about super keyword right
so now we talk about one of the amazing
concept in Java for this method
overriding so what exactly it means to
define that let me we have two classes
here we have Class A and Class B and
Class B extends Class A right so this is
your superclass and that's your subclass
right and I'm trying to create object of
surplus so as we know now that when you
create an object of subclass it also
gives you the constructor of superclass
why what we do now is we create a method
here which is public void show in this
show I will simply print in B and I will
look at the same method in Class A also
and if I say Class A in a time it let me
remove that let me remove this from
method here from this main let me call
obj one dot show the moment I say that
the moment I run this code you can see
we will be getting the output as in a
but in in this class B we don't have any
metal which is show right so this show
is getting calling from a now since in B
we don't have that method is getting
called from a and we have done we have
seen that in the theory video right we
can begin simply call OB j 1 dot show
which will call the method of class a
but let's say if i if i have that method
here if i have that method which is show
inside B itself if I run this code you
can see we got in B so this method here
so this method overrides the method of
Class A Class B method overrides the
method of class a and that concept is
called as method over dividing okay so
what is method overriding exactly as
method overriding is child class method
will override the parent class method
which is this show now let's say if I
make a mistake here let's say if I'm if
I'm making a spelling mistake here job
show let me say show one again we that
was an intentional mistake but let's say
when you are typing a code and then you
know by mistake you have written show
one but as soon as you say dot show it
will call the method of a right we are
trying to override my intention here my
intention of writing this method
here is to override the existing method
of class a but the problem is we have
made a spelling mistake here and as soon
as you say dot show it will call this
show method of class a right we don't
want that so that's a bug right that's a
logical bug compile-time
others are much better than logical bug
so we can what we can do is we can use
an annotation here called as override so
by mentioning at world wide which is an
annotation in java you're saying that
this method here overrides the method
from class a but hold on we don't have
any method while a show one in Class A
you can see in Class A we have show we
don't have so on so that means at
compile time itself you are getting to
know that you have made a mistake here
so when you solve that issue you can you
can see now everything works good and if
you run this code the expected output is
in B so the intention was to override
the method of class a and we have done
that using an overnight gives you an
advantage which is if instead of getting
a logical error you will get a compile
time at or if you make a mistake in
overriding the method that's your method
overriding so overriding a method or
adding a superclass method using a
subclass method is called as method
overriding but let's say I want to call
okay I want to call this method of class
failed I don't want to call the method I
mean I want to call method of class b
here which is show but i also want to
call this method so what you can do is
from here you can say super dot show
okay but as the moment you say super
nacho
so obj one talk show will call this show
and this show will call this show method
of class a so if you see the output we
are getting both the output which is in
a and in B so we are getting in a
because we are calling this method here
from your method in B which is super
nachos super is a keyword which is so
super is a keyword which we used to
represent our superclass method again
you can also use super with our variable
so let's say if you have a variable here
which is ain't I
and you also have a variable in Class B
which is int I so we have a variable I
here and I here
so when you say I if you refer I to
eight you're talking about this I so you
can see it is we assign the value in I
equal to eight
this value if I want to assign the magic
to this I again I can refer to it with
the help of super so we can say super
dot I so basically we use super to
represent our parent class object I
don't need that now
it was just for example let me remove
that stuff and this this point here so
that is your methyl who was riding in
the next video what we'll talk about
we'll talk about the dynamic method
dispatch which is the powerful concept
in in Java next to overriding so that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
