is we have created a collection object
or the least object which is values in
this value I had a value which is from 1
to 6 so I have used a arrays class here
with a method called as as list so what
we have done is we have used something
as external for loops or external loops
to iterate from this collection but
instead of using extra iterations what
if you can use a internal iterations so
in order to achieve into an iteration
you can simply use something or a stream
API now what is stream API in Java 8
they have done they have done lots of
modification to with your collection
interface also a collection API also
what I simply mean by that is you can
just type our values dot so they they
have introduced a new method called as
for each and if you go to the definition
of for each you can see some weight will
be returned that it was introduced in
Java 1.8 so you can using for each
method so you can use a for each method
here now this for each method needs an
object of consumer interface you can see
there is something else consuming to
face here but since your consumer
interface is lambda X page or this is a
function interface you can simply use a
lambda expression here now if you are
not familiar with not lambda expression
you can go to my tutorials of inner
classes in that I have defined what is
lambda expression but still if you don't
want to go there I will be repeating the
concepts with the same concept in these
in the subsequent tutorial now so let's
see what is lambda expression just
define a so let's go to this consumer
interface okay and it defines a method
which is a method name here defined ok
the method name is accept and this
accepts accept a object which is one one
parameter so what will do will say I a
bracket and will say s out again for
sure you will not understand this
concept
start but just be with me I just slowed
by a slow and steady will complete this
a concept of stream API so what we are
doing here is instead of using external
for loop what if we can write this
treatment and yes if you write this
statement or let me come in this for
loop and if I run you can see the output
is 1 2 3 4 5 6 then question arise how
it works see phone each is a method
which accepts a object of consume
interface and what we are writing here
writing i/o system dot out dot println
and in bracket we have I notice
happening here is this is your
functional interface so if you have
family with functional interface it
simply says for for every value of I it
will print the value of I so it will
iterate from the first value of the
values to the last values of the value
ok and so it will equate from 1 to 6 and
it will print all the values so this
concept is called as internal iterations
but the question arise how exactly the
what exactly this line is not to
understand what exactly this line is you
can see my subsequent tutorials in which
I will define what is consumer interface
why how can you create a novel
exhibition of out of it and what are the
different features available with this
stream API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
