ready from fiscal earnings and in this
video we'll talk about rating bar in
Android so what exactly ring bar is so
if you if we download my app from
Android Play Store and if you can just
go to the drawer if you click on
feedback to give the feedback and
somewhere I will ask you about my rating
so I will ask you about my knowledge
innovation interaction and all this but
here they are rating bar example if you
click on 3 here so my knowledge is 3 and
innovation 5 interaction 5 may be
communication 4 and overall 0 &amp;amp; 1 so
that's how you can rate right so and as
opposed to click on the submit button so
this this rating will get converted into
numbers and then you will and on this
other side you'll be sending this
feedback ok so so we'll be we'll be
looking at this rating bar in this
session okay
and yeah so since we have complete we
have talked about reading bar just
download the app and rate it so that I
will get to know my teaching style if
you like it so now let's go back to
Android studio let's try to code it so
so this is the blank project we have
here we have a linear layout as are they
out and in this we need some stuff and
we also have a main we also have the
Java file for that let's go to the XML
file and this will require three things
will take will require only two things
but it will take a rating bar and will
take a field or a text text view in
which we'll show which what the user has
rated you okay so we go to design and in
this design you can see we have a rating
bar here okay
so just drag this here on the screen and
you can see it here now and we want to
leave some space above talking let me
just keep it in centre itself okay so
let's go to the text and from here let's
keep some margin from the left side so
we'll say this is margin margin from
left we'll keep it 20 DP so if we keep
some space and we also need margin from
the top so we say margin top and we'll
say this is
DP okay so once we have set the margin
next we require a text okay so let's go
to the design here and let's take a text
field okay which is text view which is
text to be able to take a larger text
view here we'll keep it here and by the
text we need to assign here is it should
be by default value okay : and then once
you click on the rating so let's say if
your type if you are clicking here so
this is rating 3 right this is 4 this is
5 and automatic it will change this
value to of 3 4 and 5
okay and we also want to some leave some
margin there so we'll say we'll cover
the same stuff margin from left and the
top so we'll copy this and we'll paste
it somewhere here and you can see regard
to same margin okay so once we got a
design so does the idea here which is
rating bar and this is textview we will
make this ideas value so that we can
access from the java file and once we
have done we have once we have done with
the designing let's come back to Java
file and in here what we'll do is we'll
first we'll create those two objects
which is rating bar and the textview so
we said this is rating bar and we'll
name this as RB the next one is textview
we'll him this as value itself and now
let's initialize those two objects so
we'll say RB equal to so in order to
initialize we have to use fine view by
ID as we have done in the last few
videos so we'll say we'll cost it with
rating bar I will say fine view by ID
we'll say r dot r dot rating bar the
next thing we require is value so which
is a text field or textview to be
specific that textview find view by ID
we'll say r dot r e dot value now once
we got these two objects now what we
need as soon as a user clicks on the
rating let maybe one two or three it
should show that rating in the value
text view to do that we need to add a
listener to the to the to the ratings
will say RB dot set on rating bar change
listener can see that we have a very
small method name here which is set
on rating bar changed listener and by
this you are adding a listener to the
rating bar
so whenever a user clicks on the rating
by it well it will it will it will
listen to this this event and you can
perform some action now what type of
action we can perform so we have to say
on rating bar change listener that's a
class name and in this you have a method
called as on rating change in which you
get is passing three parameters one is
the rating bar itself and then the
rating so if you if user clicks on the
third rating which is three the value
for this rating will be 3.0 and why
float is because it's also support the
point value so you can also rate me as
2.5 or 3.5 and then you can say from
user doesn't matter now from here in
this method what we'll do is since the
value is then the rating will assign
that value on the field will say value
dot set text okay I also want the old
value there so I will say value is and
let's assign rating okay so that's how
you can set the value I think it will
work now let's run this code so that
we'll get the output I will be using X
is 5x as my emulator here and if I open
this it will take some time to load it
will refresh this app let's wait for
some time so you can see it is loading
that app here so we got a rating here
which is five ratings and then we got
value so if I click on to here we got
two point zero can you see that and if I
click on this four or see we have
clicked on the half part of the star
right which is three point five so it
also provided the point value so if I
click at the end is it working
so we got three point five and four so
it is working with 0.5 okay so it's zero
point five then we got two then we go
out to the point we can also say two
point five here right so that's how you
can rate any any app or any person with
the high power rating bar but we can
also do some tricks here right let's I
don't want this point values I want only
the perfect values maybe one two or
three or five so in this in this
scenario in order to make that perfect
what we can do is in the rating
you can set one more property which is
called as step size and you can mention
it as one now when you specify this step
size as one now it will directly jump
from one to two it will not be one point
five or two point five okay we can also
change the color of it we can to change
the color we have to use so we have to
use any property here okay and the
property name is progress yeah so it is
progress Trent will say Android and
inside that we have color we can set any
color let's say this is a blue dark blue
that will do right okay now let's run
this let's see what's the output so we
got this output here if I click on one
two and even if I click in the
in-between you can see we are not
getting three point five it by getting
only four because we have specified this
step size as one okay so that is how you
use rating bar in android it is quite
simple right it is very helpful for your
project so do implement this if you if
you require so that's it thanks for
