login module in servlet and JSP so we
have always seen the theory of this
right so what we need we have a login
page here which is login dot JSP we have
welcomed our JSP we have videos JSP so
if I go to login dot JSP it should give
me two it will give it should give me
two text field where I will enter my
credentials username password and if I
not click on the button if the username
password is correct it should call up
pages welcome to our JSP in which will
welcome the user and will print welcome
space username and will provide a button
or a link for videos page and once you
click on the videos link it will take
you to videos JSP page and here will try
to show you some I will try to show some
video or something like that so we have
this three pages and what I want I want
this welcome dot JSP to be a secure page
and this videos dot JSP to be a secure
page which means if you are login then
only you can access these pages let me
have one more page here I will name that
page as let's say new and JSP I will I
will say this page as about us dot JSP
and in this page what I will display as
I will say this is Snowie ready
from telesco telesco Lovings ok that's
what we want to show in the about Us
page again the view will not be that
good ok just we are just focusing on the
login part I'm not concerned about the
view how it looks so we will try to keep
it simple so we have this about Us page
which prints the about Us data so what I
want this page should be open page it
should not have any restriction to open
so if I go to login page so login page
and about page they are unsecured pages
and this welcome and videos they are
secured pages so if I play this if I run
this curl login to a JSP now if I run
this ok wow it will open in my browser
if I hope
we'll be in Firefox okay that's Firefox
here so that's my login page okay so I
can access I can access login page I can
access a welcome page welcome to our JSP
so I don't want my user to access this
welcome dot JSP page okay so this should
be accessible only when the user is
login so what we'll do is we'll try to
provide a login button here or we'll
provide a form so we say this is form
will say form action and we'll mention
let's mention so we'll say double quotes
and we'll mention here form action we'll
call a servlet here which is let's say
this the sahabat name is login okay and
we'll keep the method as a method as get
now we require a username so we'll say
enter user name and we'll say this is
input type equal to text and we'll say
this name is equal to you name okay and
we'll say BR the next thing we acquire
is enter password okay and we'll say
this is input type equal to this is
again this will this will set as a
password so that you will see that a
star symbol there and we'll name this as
pass okay and then we'll say BR now next
we require a button so is it input type
equal to text or not text this time it
will be submit and we'll say value what
it should show as a login button right
so now once you type all this codes once
you click on this login button it will
call a login dot or login to a java file
which is login dot class file which is
servlet right now let me create a serve
it here so we'll say not here when the
Java file so right click new let us
create a servlet and it belongs to our
package which is calm dot login I have
already created that created that
package here conduct login and the class
name let us say this is login dot Java
once I click on finish it will give you
the full source code for servlet right
so we are not concerned
and about this thing let's make it
simple
we don't want do post we just want to
get here okay not even comments okay say
we just want do get and inside do get
what we want so let okay so now way to
first first fetch those details of its a
string you name equal to and we say this
is request this is request dot
getparameter and inside this get
pedometer you have to mention that you
want data from you name now this you
name here which is the request dot
getparameter you have to fetch data from
this field that's why you name and next
we have to fetch password so we'll say
string pass equal to request dot
getparameter and we'll say this is again
pass okay now once we got this two
details now let's call let's verify now
how to verify we'll say if I can you can
fetch this or you can verify this data
with the help of database so you can
create a doubt layer you can request
your database to give you the username
password and then you can verify but
time and let's make it static we'll say
if my you name is equals if it is equals
to telesco and and the password need to
be equals with let's learning's if this
two are same so if my username is
telesco and password is learning in that
case we can call welcome dot JSP now how
to call that
so before calling me into also very we
need to also add the data into session
right because how will you verify by
when you are calling welcome to our JSP
how will you verify that the user has
login or let's not do that first
initially let's keep it simple let's say
directly we'll call welcome JSP we'll
simply say this is response so this is
response dot send redirect we'll say
send redirect and we have to mention
here the page name which is welcome dot
JSP that's it right it's that simple and
when i on this code it should call
welcome to our JSP let's try so
well on this code now get sewing okay so
here it will ask you for two things
let's enter it is telescope and we'll
say this is a I guess I have entered a
wrong details or learnings and if I say
a welcome you can see we got welcome to
a JSP but the thing is this page doesn't
have anything we'll say welcome that's
it okay now let's go back to this enter
we got welcome right now if let me enter
once again I will say learning's enter
be caught welcome JSP right but what you
find a wrong password and if I say login
you can see we got a login page or the
login servlet and it's not it's not
showing anything so what we want if the
username and password on if any of the
one is wrong we'll call the same page
again we'll call login page again
service response dot send we direct or
send redirect and we mentioned this is
login dot JSP so it will login called
the same page so let me show you this
and if I Center so I got login page let
me enter in and hit any data here if I
say login oh it's not your deployed I
guess okay let me just refresh again
okay so let me try something else if I
click on login you can see we got the
same page again right so if your
username password is right it will call
welcome dot JSP if it is wrong it will
call login dot JSP now what will happen
if if i if i'm not logging it okay let
me just change my browser let me use
opera and inside open life a page type
if I paste this line which is welcome to
RJ's we can see I've not login right and
let me go back to this and say welcome
dot JSP and we got welcome it's because
we have not mentioned that we need to
check for the login now how to verify
that user is login anyway you are able
to access the welcome page right so what
we can do when a user login we'll we'll
set the data in
to a session now how to use session we
can see HTTP session will say session
equal to now if you don't know how to
use session just go back to the video
well have talked about how to use
sessions and then we'll say should he be
session will say this is request dot get
session okay so once we got this session
now we'll set the data into session
let's input the package okay now it is
session dot we have to set it data into
session so have to say set attribute
we'll say this is we set the label which
is let's say username as a label and the
data we need to send is the you name
which he has entered while login so this
is this is you name sounds good so we
have set we have a we have set a data
into this session now in the Welcome
page we had to check so before executing
anything they will to be to check that
was the data is entered so how did how
to check that so we'll check if if this
session dot gain attribute since we are
when you assign data you use set
attribute to get the data we use get
attribute if the attribute with username
is equal to equal to null because if
users directly trying to access this
page without login this will be null
right if that is the case will again
call response dot sand redirect let's
call
login dot JSP okay if not then it will
print welcome let's try let's go back to
opera
so is it open this is what this is
opener now I'm trying to access welcome
to a JSP without doing login and if I
say enter you can see we got login page
awesome right
it's this is this is possible with the
help of this thing here which is session
now let's say if I am logging if I am
trying to log in here we'll say this is
the new school and the password is
learnings and if I say okay we got login
will be got welcome page right but the
thing is I want to show the user name
also so we can use J htl here which is
the expression language and it can
directly write it taller and we can
invite your what username so this
is Jay STL so whatever you have so let's
say in session we have this one-way
session so inside session we have user
name Lloyd
so in this welcome page it will fetch
the user name from this session so
that's how you used a steel which is
Java standard tag library or the
expression language to be specific now
in this welcome page what we need really
quite a label we require a what what we
require we require of a link for videos
dot JSP
so what we can do is we can provide a
anchor tag we'll say a H ref equal to we
say videos dot JSP
we can mention a anchor tag close and
we'll mention this is videos will say
videos here and once I click on that
link video Co it will go it will take me
to video dot JSP right let me just enter
this and we can say we got welcome to
disco and it says video Co if I click on
videos it will take me to videos page
and how to include videos so can I
include my video there let me try have
never tried it lets me get me go to
YouTube and let me search for my let me
search Naveen let me search Java
tutorials that's me
I let me fetch this video okay copy the
link okay and let me paste it here and I
will it work
will it work I don't know it will not
work of course I did this is just a link
right so let me just show you the link
not the actual video but a link right
for that we have to use our video link
so we got the link for my video you can
X you can actually use a video link on
your video tag on your website and you
can embed this link there what we want
is we let us imagine sure of this we are
getting a video so if I try to access
this page directly without login so let
me okay we have we already login right
let me use it now this time we'll use
Chrome and inside Chrome let me paste
this link and you can see we are able to
access this page right without login so
what we to do we have to do the same
thing just go to welcome page copy this
code and paste it here sounds good and
now if I go back to my Chrome and if I
say enter it takes me to login page
awesome right so that's how you use
login but there's one more thing let's
say if I am providing a logout button
here so if I say logout so let me
provide a logout button so we say form
action I will provide logger only on the
welcome page so I will say form action
it should call the log out dot servlet
or logout dot Java file and we'll create
a button here so we'll say this is input
type equal to submit and in this the
text we can show as value we'll say this
is log out simple and once you click on
this log out button it will call or log
out JC page so we'll say new log out GSB
log out dot servlet so we say new
servlet this will be comm dot login and
it belongs to the name it will be log
out right and let me remove all this
extra stuff here let's only focus on the
get method and inside this will mention
but whenever you click on log back
button what you should have what should
happen is it should remove your data
from this session so we say this is
session request dot get session right
and we can just import the package by
pressing control shift o and we say this
is session dot so while login your set D
session while logout you remove the
session or remove the attribute which
attribute we have to use we have to say
this is user name and we to do one more
thing which is session dot invited so
that it will remove all the data okay
now let me I hope it will work now so it
may run this and again this will be
opened in a Firefox that's my default
browser for the Eclipse okay
now let me enter let me login service a
telescope and this is learning's okay so
we got the log we got the Welcome page
so I am logged in right if I change my
tab here if I go to videos JSP I am able
to access this page is just because I am
log and let me log out okay that's it
I have logged out let me go to videos or
JC page or different tab and if I click
on ok you get the login page awesome
right so that's how you manage this
session or you manage the login session
in servlet and JSP we can even navigate
from after one so click on logout button
you can navigate to the login page we
can simply write this is what response
dot sentry right right and then we can
mention this is go back to the login
page so every time you log out it will
take you to login dot JC page awesome
right so that's how you walk with the
login module in sublet JSP so let me
know if you have any doubts any
questions let me just go for a quick
recap before that
that's a login page when you click on
this login button it will take you to
login to login sublet where you will
verify your credentials if your log
username is right it will take you to
welcome to our JSP otherwise it will
take you to log in to our JSP but we fo
going to welcome to our JSP it will set
the attribute as a username when you go
to welcome JSP you can print this same
username but before that it will check
our you login if you how can you check
that you are login you will check for
the attribute if it is not if it is null
then it will take you login dot JSP
otherwise it will show you the button or
link for videos once you click on this
button which is videos it will take you
to this page and if you can also click
on logout button here once you click on
logout it will go to logout sublet and
it will remove the attribute so that's
it if you have any doubts just comment
in the comment area and if you liked
this video make sure you like the but
like on the like button and that's it
