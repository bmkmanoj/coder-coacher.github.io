labels and we have added those two
labels with the help of flow layout so
well let's again run this code so if you
say run you're getting this output but
let's say when you close this window so
it should close right so when I say
close it is going it's it's invisible
now but still the code is running if it
has not stopped so we have to stop this
manually
that means the button here the button
this button which is your cross button
is not working properly to make it work
you need to write some statement and
that method name is we have to say set
default close operation so there's a
method called a 34 close operation and
you have to use a constant there and
this constant is a static constant
belongs to a class called a frame and
the constant name is exit on flows so we
have to say set default close operation
it is jframe dot exit on close and the
value of exit on close is 3 again you
can just print the value you will get
value 3 so either you can write jframe
dot exit on close or you can directly
use a number 3 but this time we'll use
j4 m dot exit on clothes right so if I
run this code now if I say run we are
getting the output and let's say let's
close this so if you say close now you
can see it is audibly get close that
means now that button is working so that
means for every code we need to write
this for statement so you can also write
this set layout down here so it will
work so for every code when you try this
for statement side for sure so let's run
this again to verify so we are getting
this layout when you say close it's
working so far every code in future so
from maybe if we have 10 to 12 to 20 to
do this all the tutorials will require
this 4 lines so what we can simply do is
we can use that means to create some
short code what I mean by that is let's
say let me just copy this code
but atolls and we'll say options there
is something called in editor there
something else code templates and we'll
say new template we'll say my code and
we'd say okay my code oh it's already
there
let's go for new I will say swing code
yeah so we have this swing code and
we'll paste this line here with a tab
obviously and we'll say apply and okay
so now in future let's say for this in
future if I know if I know that if I
need that code I can simply say swing
code tab so if I say swing code tap you
will get this line so in it further
tutorials I will be using this thing
every time I will say swing code I will
get this number of lines yeah so this is
how you have to use this set default
close operation for closing the window
and set layout for setting the layout
set visible for make it visible and set
size for to specify the size of your
frame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
