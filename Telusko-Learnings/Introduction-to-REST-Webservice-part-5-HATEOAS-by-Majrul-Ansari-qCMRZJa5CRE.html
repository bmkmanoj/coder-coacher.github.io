the engine of application state means
what exactly are we talking about it's a
very interesting concept and if possible
you should try achieving this any
restful web service that you create so
the idea is like this so let us do some
comparison then the points will be clear
to us when we develop web applications
we start with some homepage let's say we
call it as an index page and we have
many other pages in our application I
have a login page I have an info page
and let's many other pages I have a
welcome page now what do we do in web
development we create links presented
without links well internet won't
survive today now as an end user all I
need to know is the URL to reach the
home page that's it I just need to know
yahoo.com that's it just need to
remember the URL to reach the home page
of that website I don't need to remember
the URLs to reach the login page of that
side I don't need to know the URL to
reach the login page because I know on
this home page there will be some button
or hyperlink which I need to click and I
don't care about what is the URL to
reach that you page in that website I
don't need to know what is the URL of
that info page as an end user I don't
need to know about that welcome page and
no matter how many pages the system
contains all I need to know is the URL
of the home page that's it I stopped
over here and this page is designed in
such a way that it helps me navigate
further into the system only we are
looking out for achieving the same thing
in Web Services
so now let's fit this concept in web
services now it's challenging and
interesting and it is easy also if you
want this then the comparison which I
will do will become very easy for you so
let us take an example we are talking
about web services now let's say I have
one rest web service with me now think
in a way that you have many web services
with you in your applications
I have many lists web services with me
let me just put it in shorter this
the believers I have lots of web
services that I have developed now
you're looking out for doing the same
thing this web service should be able to
create links to the other services that
you have in this application so the idea
is the same how can we create links to
the other services that we have created
in this application or the system now I
know without an example this whole thing
will be of no help to us whatever we are
discussing so let's take an example
this web service provides me customers
data so I have a web service which
provides me customers data like his name
and email address and other information
that I need I have another web service
with me which provides me let's say
insurance details of the customer now I
make a call to this service this service
returns me back some data now generally
when we will communicate with web
services what will be the form in which
the data would be it would be lets say
XML or JSON these are the preferred
formats which we use for sharing of data
between the two ends the client in the
server let's say in this example okay so
we have this client code for example
which invokes this service this service
returns me back the data about some
customer ok let's take an example that
the data what the customer is coming in
the form of some XML ok so I am getting
an XML back from this service and there
are tags to describe the name of the
customer his email address another
information now all what I am looking
out for in this example is if I want to
know as a client the insurance details
of this customer I need to know the URL
to reach this service that's what my
primary intention would be on the client
side I need to the URLs without the URL
I cannot enter into the system so I need
to know the URL to access the service I
need to know the URL to access this
service
the idea is to embed the link into the
spawns so what I will do now as a
developer is in this XML that I will be
returning I'll add one more tag let's
say insurance now what I will do is the
value of this tank
I will embed the URL to execute this
service which I have in this application
so that's the idea over here how do you
embed links in a web page you try
achieving the same in your web services
so what I as a client developer need to
do is if I am writing the client-side
code I will invoke the service I will
get this data now if I need to pull the
insurance details of the service I don't
need to know the URL of that because the
response from this service contains one
tag which lets me know the location of
the next service that I need to
communicate with that's it so the idea
is the same how can you make your
applications a bit dynamic and this is
just one technique by which you can
achieve the same and there are many ways
of doing it you might want to generate
in the response a tag with the URL to
the other services you have or you can
use HTTP headers there are multiple
options available there is no fixed
answer how to achieve it there are many
ways it's up to the developer what exact
strategy he wants to use in the code
which he will get anything so this is
just one simple example hope it helps so
these are the things you will take care
of by default in a test web service I
would like to take a small break over
here and see after the break then thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
