part 4 of the video now and which we'll
be talking about some some more thing
about Java with java keywords now see in
this tutorials we'll talk about some
something called as variables not
exactly variable means is let's suppose
I want to act I want to write a code in
Java to add two numbers right it's very
simple for white we have to add two
numbers now for this what we can do is
again to add two numbers we need we need
to do something way to write some
statements all this straight men should
belongs to our main function or main
method and your main method should
belongs to a class right so we have done
all this thing Cley viously also so this
time we'll add two numbers so if we have
the same syntax we will time in will say
it has a class add in this class add our
main function so it's public static void
main and in brackets we'll say string a
so
okay so now here what we can do is we
have to add two numbers right and when
we add these two numbers let me I will
print it so to print it we required
system dot out dot println and in
bracket so what I can say I can say it's
I want to add two numbers so let's
suppose my number is three plus and we
can say Phi right so let me save this to
save this we can say save and we'll name
it as same as filename so it's a dot
Java you say safe it saved to compile
this open open the CMD and we'll say
Java C and we say add dot Java
now when I say add dot Java it's
compiling yeah it does so now we have to
learn this voice of for running we say
Java and class name and we got the
answer eight but what if I want to
change the number so what made to do is
we have to go here and we have to type
six right so by this I have changed the
number again I have to compile then I
can say output so I got I got not nine
right now the problem is this thing is
called as hard coding because in a
statement in a processing patterns only
we have specifying the calculation right
but what we need is we need to store
this data somewhere so that it can be
used later also like if on my phone I
use this number later later part also so
are going to have to write the number so
if I change the number at one place I
have to change that number at every
point in every statement so what we can
do is we can between we can just store
that number somewhere
okay so we'll say I want to store this
number six in some box or in some it's
at some place right and we have to name
that place so what we can do is we can
say I have a variable I have something
called as num in which I will say value
six
okay or we can say this is number one
then I have second thing well as num2 in
which I was told three again let we can
add in any way because add you know add
in we can exchange the data also
so in this noun 1 value is 6 num2 is 3
that means there is something there is
some box called as num1 in which you
have a value palace 6 there is some box
called as num2 in which you have value
as 3 right then what we can do is we can
just say it's num1 plus num2 right but
the problem is when you create this box
you should specify the size of the box
right how many bytes the box will
require right and what type of data this
box will hold so for that we have to
specify something and that something is
called as that something is called as
data type so when you talk about data
type we have list of data types will
discuss list of data types now so we
have so we have data types okay so in
return X we have so we have a type
called as Inc now in to uses 4 bytes so
its uses for byes and it will store all
these integer numbers then we have float
again it will take 4 bytes
it will also it will take your real
numbers there fraction numbers if we
talk about the major part which is
double it will take 8 bytes it was also
for support to the year numbers but more
number of decimal points again this
decimal numbers you can have then you
have sort of ask ad which it supposed to
bytes and we took extra character then
in int only in the in the scope of paint
you have short int which takes only 2
bytes okay if you feel number is so
small you do not have to waste 4 bytes
wide you can use 2 bytes then you have
long it if we have a big integer then
you can use
which is again eight bytes right and
then we have something called less byte
now by takes only one byte so if your
number is so small you can use byte if
your number is bit larger you can use
short int if I go for normal range go
for a if you think the number is huge
you can go for long int right so we have
this all this type of it right so what
we can do is we can specify this the
type of this number and for that we can
say in here and then we have to specify
in to you that's it so now what we have
is we have done is we have created some
box type of int value is six second box
is none to type of type is int and value
is three right and this box is called as
variable now what is called as variable
is because you can change the value of
it let me demonstrate something here so
if I run this if I just just clear this
screen if I run this it's Java C ad dot
Java when I compile this it's compiled
right now if you learn this it's the
answer is nine now it's because we have
added num1 plus num2 but what if I want
to change the value of num - so now
until this time I will say num2 is five
all right so if I compile this again
whenever you make changes in your code
make sure you compile it so value is
different right now this time of your
value is 11 it's because we are changing
the value of none - and that's why this
thing is called as variable because we
can change the value okay so that is
what about variable for remaining part
will talk in next lecture or next step
with you thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
