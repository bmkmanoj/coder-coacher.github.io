series of tutorials we'll talk about
Java 8 features so the latest version of
Java which is Java 8 has introduced lots
of features and one of the most
important features of Java 8 is stream
API when we talk about stream API it
helps you to calculate data or it helps
to process your data so in the world of
a Big Data and Hadoop we have something
called as functional programming so till
1.7 we used to work with object-oriented
programming so everything was object but
in case of Java 8 we got a new concept
called as functional programming notice
spunk functional programming functional
programming simply says you don't have
to focus on how to do things you just
focus on what to do the remaining part
will be curved the remaining part will
be handled by your stream API when I
talk about objectivity examine you have
to focus on both the things first what
to do and second how to do so we'll try
to use a stream API in this series of
tutorials but before understanding this
the importance of stream API let me go
with the example so let's say I have a
main function here in this main function
I have a added list so to create a list
you have to say add at least integer
mate we need all integer values and
we'll say L and to create an analyst we
can do one thing we can create a list of
other lists okay and then one of the way
to create the object of Adaline sities
using this arrays class so you can
simply say add is dot as list and in
bracket of two you can pass the values
so let's say values are 1 comma 2 comma
3 comma 5 comma 6 so you have six values
here let's import the package which is
add in so we'll say ctrl shift I to
import the package now in this scenario
what we need to do is let's let's print
all these values so in order to print
these values what we need a for loop
right so basically you can go with the
norm
for loop you can go with enhanced
for-loop or you can go with iterator so
initially let me go with the normal for
loop so have to say for I have to say
int I the value of I will be 0 and then
I less than or I less than let's say sex
and I plus plus since we have 6 elements
we have to reach till 5 let's print this
value so we'll say s out and we say L
dot so in this al you have method what
has get in which you have to pass the
index which is I instead of well let me
give a proper name which is values and
somewhere here in this L will say values
and if I run this code now you can say
the answer is 1 2 3 4 5 6 right so this
is how we can print values so instead of
using this logic what we can do is we
can use a second way so we can just
comment this part the next way of do of
printing this value is by using a
enhanced for-loop or we can use it later
first so we can define our Twitter so it
rater so it's the interface in Java
which belongs to a package I ordered
util we have to specify which type of
elements we have integer and we'll say
this is I and then since you want to
create the object of interface you can
use a least which is values because in
this values object you have a method
called as a traitor
so using this iterate emitter method it
will return you the object of iterator
okay now once you caught the object of
iterator will will navigate in that
iterator so all the values from all the
values from this values object will go
to this iterator object now so let's
navigate how to navigate we have to run
on a while loop and we have to check if
there is any element next so when you
when you are at the first position you
will say okay check the element okay you
have one then check to its you have to
when you reach six it will say what next
he says there is no value after six so
it will say okay let's break the loop so
it will run this loop from one value for
the first wire to the fifth value of the
sixth value
so in order to fare in order to print
this we'll say system dot out dot
println and we'll say I dot next so has
next we'll open your boolean value it
will just check the value and next will
actually iterate the value and now if I
run this you can see the output is still
same right now what next so this is this
is second way
now let's implement the third way but to
work with the third way we can use
enhanced for-loop so what is the
enhanced for-loop here you can simply
use a for loop and you should have
defining the starting point and ending
point you can simply say i : and you can
specify values so this I will fetch data
from values field or values least the
how to print will say s out and will
print the value of I a knife I done this
you can see the output is still same
then question arises why we have this
three different way it's because this is
the earlier way of doing it so let's say
if you want to print only from a second
value to sixth value so we can use this
for loop now iterators are used normally
to print to update so you can do
modification it with also or you can
what do modification in traitor but
let's say if you end up putting all the
values irrespective of the starting
point ending point you can use enhanced
for loop so if you enter print all the
values obviously the best option will be
the enhanced for loop but if we talk
about any of this loop this loops are
called as external iteration this it is
they are external iterations what if we
can provide a feature called as internal
iteration so we have something called as
internal iterations so what's the
difference between external iterations
in external iteration some for loeb
outside of your object it will try to
fetch the data from the object so same
goes here you can see all this loop they
do the same thing they fetch value
outside what if any other in your
collection you will be having a method
using which you can increment so that is
called as internal iterations
and we can achieve internal iterations
with the help of stream API now how
exactly we should be coding for stream
API that we'll see in the next part of
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
