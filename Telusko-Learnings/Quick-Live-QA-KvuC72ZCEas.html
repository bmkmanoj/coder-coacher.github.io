one is here I don't see anyone watching
this but I got a notification that means
I'm life so I don't know if everyone got
the notification there so like with the
questions so this is a quick life where
we are just a question answer session
yeah okay you can do that so yeah so we
are like here and then 50 60 that's
great
so everyone um so wanted to go live
tomorrow but then tomorrow I'm busy so
let's just go live today itself and I
can see a live chat here on the other
phone so that you know I can answer your
questions I can see the chat window that
as well but it is damn quick I can't
even see questions there so let's start
with the first one everyone in fact I
will take that question from there
itself okay so oh well first of all I'm
here in my cottage today after a long
time I visited my own college so it's
number but I did my graduation so we
have a cultural first year so I was
invited so I thought okay let's have a
visit as I'm available today so I'm here
in my college enjoying with my with my
teachers I had met all my teachers of my
graduation
not only is here by the way anyway so
this it's in it's a because column
really to be specific yeah mom in Mumbai
basically okay waste without the
questions all the questions are gone
okay there's something wrong with this
okay can't see questions is it I'm like
I have to use my second phone otherwise
I can't the questions
okay so pooja says give some points on
freelancing okay so it's the thing is
freelancing is damn easy if to straight
but then very difficult to get your
first client it's always difficult to
get your first client okay so I would
say improve your skills make sure you
make something don't do as though start
as a freelancer start with your own
purpose start for yourself make some
applications and then once you feel
confident you can go to finish calm you
can go to up work you can go to other
bunch of website just go to Google and
search for freelance websites go there
it accounts and so once you create an
account there are lots of people that
post about different different project
now you have to show them that you can
do this project there are multiple ways
you can prove yourself you can show
earlier projects you can you can show
them the demo so take the requirement
and show them demo if you can do that in
two days a small demo will be enough and
then that's how you start it's difficult
to get the first client but then once
you get the first client you can go
ahead with that so improve your skills
and that's how you start with
freelancing I can see 100 people are
watching this but only 26 likes that's
bad okay okay next question is okay it's
very fast it's very fast
I should have done that you know quick
chart in that option there but I will
pick the question from here okay can you
start by Treacher's I'm planning to
learn Python
okay I know Python a bit but then not
completely out of it of it I know the
Python language but not the framework
example we have different libraries
frameworks for Python which I have not
done that so once I have completed once
I start with Python I will sure they
make a video but as of now I have a
planning for different videos as well so
I want to complete data structure first
I want to complete
Sublette JSP videos I want to complete I
want to talk about blockchain technology
as well
but I think your support there because
blockchains of a new technology for me
as well so I'm running it now it would
take some time by the time you can help
me by sharing my videos and you know
liking the videos that's not motivation
okay okay so I'm confused in Java
effects need advice so what you're
confusing watch got off I don't know
okay so - shall say is machine learning
Kai say pate okay so how do you learn
machine learning it's very easy just go
to google and search for machine
learning tutorials I would say to learn
machine learning just go to Coursera or
go to EDD X dot o-r-g
or on youtube search for Andrew ng so
these are the three places you can learn
about machine learning so if you go to
call Sarah there are three courses
available and so if there are three
courses available and you can also you
know you can also get a certificate if
you are paying for that
so for certificate you have to pay for
it okay
okay next okay questions are going down
faster I don't know why so Java nine
totally different from previous versions
not exactly Jawa nine is not already
different
it's almost same as the previous
versions
the thing is in Java nine regard this
concept of modularity using which you
can create small modules the coding
remains same but then I would say the
architecture of your JDK has changed and
that's why the project you will be
building in future they will have a
different architecture the way you
create modules there you could the way
you create libraries or to know more
that you can just go to my channel I
have a entire playlist on Java 9 not the
entire place but then the basics what
are the new things in Java 9 okay so
when I say sublet and Jesu tutorials
please yeah sure those videos are on the
way as you can see from last 3 to 4 days
I'm uploading servant videos
continuously so yes that video is free
someone says make live sessions free see
what you have to understand this now
there are two things - they're two
different things one is videos and
second is lives
videos is something which I have to make
once and then I can make them free for
everyone I'm not investing more time
after that well that's what you get on
YouTube right so we get videos now all
the youtubers all all the content
creator who was providing the free
videos for free they are giving tupper
to a time but they're only to say live
sessions in life if I make all the life
batches free the problem would be the
number of people will be joining the
batch and I'm investing more time right
so every day I have to invest 1 or 2
hours only for the live sessions it's
not that I cannot do it but then I have
to keep my other work aside I cannot go
to corporate training I cannot go to I
cannot build projects in that time so I
cannot make live sessions free but then
this is live session right this is a
free live session yeah
but then yeah so I cannot take the
coasts live session free but then videos
as I discussed there will not be any
paid videos ok because you know the idea
behind paid videos is in other different
way of of helping people right
I feel making tutorials will be helpful
for people so yeah ok ok which organizer
you're walking in so I'm not a full time
of I'm not a what is a permanent
employee of any company I'm a freelancer
fitness a trainer freelancer I can say
more of an entrepreneur and a trainer
and are youtuber so basically don't work
when your company but then I was
obviously different companies for
training ok Microsoft services videos oh
not at this point it will take some time
ok which is ok now should I learn
graphics in C Oh in fact just to let you
know I love graphics in C I started my
programming excitement you know I was
excited with programming and what the
excitement was to make graphics in C
when I was doing my graduation in the
same College I used to build C programs
use I mean graphics in see I've used to
make cars a card which can move and they
used to make you know we also I
for defend in Turkish competition where
one in one of the college they have
asked us to build a graphics in s'ti
where you can you know you can fly kites
so it was day of Sankranthi you know so
in we have this kite festival here so
that thing is done so that that was done
on the computer using c programming so
we we animated the entire stuff using c
programming so yes it's an awesome thing
now is it useful yes in the game
development it will be useful for you to
understand the graphics on what point
you have to do what
so yeah knowing it it's helpful it will
not be the only thing you have to learn
but then landing graphics in C will be
very helpful for you okay what next we
have we are live for next for next 5
minutes because I have to go again back
to my event so people are waiting there
so just 5 more minutes there everyone
okay so try live on hair game oh I don't
need that I think I look good in this I
don't need hairs to make a personality
okay
okay I'm a manual tester I want to get
into development what should i do so
best thing is start learning programming
so you can learn Java you can learn
Python and get into programming so first
learn programming and build some
softwares and you can also go for
automation testing first it will it will
help you in the Tet as you're having a
freelancing as you got a point here yeah
so you can start with the automation
testing first now someone says
freelancing is for kids in that way we
all are kids here so I guess all the
entrepreneurs are first of all their
finances and then they are entrepreneurs
so if you are saying Mark Zuckerberg is
kid ok appacha is better all ngx ok I'm
still not seeing ngx
it's a part of so they provide micro
services features I guess because I get
mails from them so I don't know I'm not
sure about that ok which company to
switch after TC has no idea you can
switch to any company's depend upon ok
ok ok so many questions on different
topic
I want you to be like I want you to be
like you give me some instruction to
people like me okay so you want me to
like if you want me to be like me why my
like me you can be better than me you
can be you can bet you can achieve and
what I have achieved till this point so
I would say but to something some small
tips one yeah so one way is you can you
know increase your communication skills
not just English I don't know why I
people so focused so much of so much on
English I think this is not the most
important part in communication the most
important communication part is the way
you behave you talk to people the way
you understand people the way you can
you know you can you can think about the
thing about this it's all about sharing
so when I say talking it's all about
sharing the ideas which is there in your
brain to someone else right so it's all
about communication so improve your
communication improve your presentation
skills and work hard okay also works
much yeah but of course any way you work
smart you have to also work hard so both
are goes hand by hand so spend some time
with so improve it spend some time on
improving your skills okay someone says
how to meet me one-to-one okay so you
can meet me one-to-one anytime so as I
mean this college now if you have
somewhere here you can meet me there is
no issue maybe I will visit
I will be doing some meetups in future
so once I start with meetups so I'll be
available after February or March or so
after March I'm thinking about arranging
some meetups then we can have one-to-one
session no problem okay so next two
minutes everyone and let me pick up one
question you are the boss of what yeah
okay so okay hey once a is blocked
change surely i'm i'll be making Drock

watching this and seven seven likes come
on guys if you like this home videos let
me know okay so my hair sure is where
the human living in Mumbai I live in
Mumbai
can you meet in meetup in basic where
Zack is not in the least Matt at least
now but maybe maybe in future yeah
okay okay okay son age does age matters
in IT
okay so when I say big companies yes age
matters but startup nowadays they are
not focusing on so if you want to get
hired by startups they're not focusing
on age they are focusing on skillset if
you have those required skill sets you
are good to go
can you make spark tutorials as of now
no okay new phone no this is old phone
my toes it was my mom's phone initially
and then I'm using this phone now for
myself okay what's that
I lost my chat here that's bad okay let
me pick up the questions from here we'll
be making our DevOps
yes how JTA games are made I don't know
I'm not into giving the game development
okay
can you add more videos on Scala surely
I have some videos on Scala and more
videos are on the way
okay that's it everyone a last question
let me pick up one question there okay
how do you dive in okay okay I don't
know why all the questions are going up
oh yeah ada mr. Torrio's sure more
videos and items will be on the way
because I'm still working on AWS I know
the idea is I'm learning new
technologies and I'm working on
different styles example the last
project which was working on it wasn't
aw so I started learning AWS and then
implementing different stuff because a
the blows has so many features you know
you can't even imagine initially I
particle I will learn the entire SS but
then the moment I open it up to us every
day they are adding new features example
the new one is code start now which I
have already made video so yeah sure
they will do the starting udemy no I
don't so personally I don't like udemy
platform I don't like any platform where
okay so why I don't like you time here
okay first of all udemy is very
restricted they have certain terms which
I don't like example when I make videos
I want to make videos using life things
you know but then you let me have
different rules and regulations which I
don't like but sure they may be in
future I will try so that's it everyone
I hope you enjoyed in fact tomorrow also
