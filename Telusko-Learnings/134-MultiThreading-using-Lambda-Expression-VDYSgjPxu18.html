do this stuff with the help of runnable
right but if you look at this code the
number of lines we are using here is
approximately 40 lines right so what is
my intention here is just to reduce the
number of lines which we are using so
first of all we have to the user number
of lines second we have to make the code
more efficient using less number of
classes I mean less number of classes
overall so if you look at this class
here which is high I mean the only
purpose of this class high is to
implement runnable right and we are
using that class only once so whenever
you have a class which is which will be
used only once then why to create a
separate class for that I mean this is a
class which which will be used only once
and the purpose of this class is only to
implement runnable as we have seen in
the topic of anonymous class I hope you
remember if you if you don't just go
back to the concept of Animas class or
anonymous class with interface you can
create the object of interface directly
with the anonymous class here so can you
see that we get runnable obj 1 equal to
Newton able and here itself we can
provide the implementation of it so the
logic which you are writing here we just
cut this part and will paste it here
that means I don't need this class now I
don't need obj which we don't need high
high class there because we can create a
anonymous class right now the same thing
can be done for hello so instead of
instead of creating the hello class we
can cut this part and we can paste it
here so you can say new learnable and
you can replace that code here we will
say control ok it means do some
formatting here
that's that looks better but that's
better
then we remove this extra spaces here
okay and so once we once we have removed
this both the classes so you can see we
don't have hi and hello class now and
the number of lines has reduced to we
have registry lines of code and that's
awesome
and so by doing this we are removing
removing a class so we are using an
anonymous class now we have also seen
something right with you if you click on
runnable renewable is a functional
interface which means we can use lambda
expression here now how can use lambda
expression is when you have a lambda
expression you do not have to mention
this stuff here from here to here that
is something which we can imagine and
since we are removing this one curly
bracket will be also removing this curly
bracket so let us remove this let's
remove this and let's remove the whole
box and we just have to use an arrow to
represent that same thing can be done
here we can remove this stuff we can
remove this curly brackets and we can
use lambda expression okay and it is
done if you want this code nod is still
working right so we have removed some
number of lines there and you can see
the code it is only 23 lines now we have
removed seven lines of code what else we
can remove now if you observe this obj1
and Oh Bridget - we are using those
object only once right so what you can
do you can just copy this code because
we are using anyway that we are using
that only once we can cut this part and
we can paste it in obj one itself the
same thing can be done for this one so
we can cut this part and we can paste it
in obj - so we don't require obj1 obj2
now so we can remove both this so we got
this two threads so we one thread is
printing this stuff second second so he
is printing this stuff and then showing
the threads and if you run this code now
you got the same output and see the
number of lines we are using on it what
we are using one two twenty eight lines
first of all we have reduced the number
of lines second we are using anonymous
class we are using lambda expression so
we are making this code more and more
efficient so T 1 is doing this T 2 is
doing this and they are calling T 1 dot
start and it will start so that's how
you can use lambda expression with
threads so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
