from Tesco learnings and in the last
video we have seen how to create
functions how to get function expression
and everything is working when you when
you when you worked only with Scotland
now what I'm doing in this in this video
is you know I'm trying to create a Java
class now the question is if you have a
Java class which has a main method and
in fact we have we have have told you
before that Java and Scotland they are
100% interoperable which means you can
call the methods of Java from card in
which we have seen before what if I want
to call the functions of court Lane in
Java can we do that I want to call those
functions from here now first of all
will this function work because this
function returns a meta expression right
does it support with Java of course it
should right because ultimately you're
coordinating quotes get converted into
Java code right or which is a bytecode
not Java code button bytecode so Java
should know about this thing then how
can you do this
so let's let me just call a method
called as and so I want to call this
method our function add again you can
call this this function or method depend
upon where you need to go okay I want to
call this add now again I want to see in
the split screen so what I will do is I
will right click here I would say split
vertically so we got two screens here
God left hand side and right hand side
thickness reduce this screen a bit okay
so we got these two screens right so
what I do is I want to call okay on both
the side I got the same code I don't
want that I want this code to be here
come on Oh spot mobile okay not so let's
keep this one code here I want to call
this for this code from here now how do
you do that how do you call this code
from here so how do we call this ad now
there are two ways right whenever
whenever you want to call a methods from
Java of either it can be a static method
or it can be non static methods now
video static method which means you have
to create or you can use a plasma and if
it is non static method you have to
create object of a class
ultimately you need to create a class
right because that's the thing you have
to use our you have to use a class to
create object because as you can see in
this code we don't have a class but then
if you see if you see the bytecode of
this
see the bytecode of this file is first
code Katie let's see the bytecode of
just to get the understanding what
should be the class name of which you
can create this object so we'll go back
to my projects we have a project so it
is idea projects in which I have a demo
folder inside this demo I can see I have
out in production demo can you see that
we have a class file for this bytecode a
first code dot KD and the part the file
name itself is first called KD that
means your class name here so even if
you don't mention the class name for
this all this thing gets inside your
class right and the class name is first
called Katie dot class that means I just
have to create object our first code
Katie and then you can call this ad but
hold on you need object when you want to
when you want to create or when you want
to call non static methods right but
what if I say this methods here are
studying methods again we don't use
static keyword in Cortland we don't have
that keyword here example even if you
try to do that even if you say static
you know your content compiler will give
you some bad words it will not support
it now by by default they are by default
they are static so what you can do is
you can simply use the class name which
is first code dot I'm first called Katy
dot add so you can called a click call
those methods but then again you have to
pass two parameters right so you can say
five and eight you're passing those two
parameters and you're calling them again
ignore this thing for time being which
is a and B again that's not a part of
your syntax okay if I copy this client
if I patient somewhere else I will it
will not be including a and B it is just
a visual thing which is giving it to you
I don't know where to paste it now
should I place it here
I can see that when you picture it it is
it's not doing that a and B together
okay this is just a visual thing which
is given by your IntelliJ IDE
okay but you are passing five and eight
because in Java you cannot pass names
with two variables so ID so we are
passing five and eight let's verify this
let's write like this here okay here and
say okay we do have then okay so can you
sighs we got run mean and the moment I
run this code
oh I'm not getting an output because my
bad I am NOT printing the value right so
I should take the values
some well I would say in result equal to
I'm showing that value there and we'll
print the outputs which will print the
result and let's run this now let's see
what happens and we got 13 right that's
what we wanted that means we can call
these functions with the help of up the
last name but then the class name would
be your file name so your file name
itself is first code kiddie which is
small K here but then again you know the
canvassing rules right so you this
capital this K becomes capital here so
that's awesome right so you can call the
functions as well but I just have one
issue here I don't like this file name
okay see file name is first called Katie
makes sense but then why your class name
is Katie people who love Java of course
they will not love this Katie and in the
file name right they want some readable
file name so what I'm going to do is I
can change this this file name here but
how how can you change the class name
it's actually very easy you have to use
some annotations again when it comes to
Java when it comes to Cortland we will
be will be seeing some annotations one
of the annotation here is a great file
now with the help of file it has a it
has one particular annotation which is a
JVM name this is the annotation we have
to use and in this annotation if you
mention the name example if I mention
the name as first so when at the moment
I say first here let's go back to my
four files or it is not yet compiled the
word let me just go back once out
production demo oh I should run this
code I guess let's right click and run
okay can you see that we got a bytecode
which is now first dot class so that
means if you mention your if you
mentioned a JVM name annotation here
with elbow first it means it means that
it will change your class name from
first code Katie to first and now
wherever you want to use that class
again you can directly use of you can
directly use first that means if you
don't mention this annotation here by
default the annotation would be the
class name would be first code Katie so
I hope you got the idea how to call a
function from Java as well and this is
the
something right you can call cotton code
from Java and Java code from hotline and
that's why Java has a long life if
you're if you're anything I mean if
you're thinking that Java is losing its
a power then you're not cotton is just
making java better so that's it on this
video I hope you enjoyed this video so
