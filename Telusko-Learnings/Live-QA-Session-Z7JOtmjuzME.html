so welcome back doesn't have been ready
from those colonics and this is the live
session if you just set up everything I
just not moving that's bad okay so I
guess everything is everything seems
good live streaming is going on properly
let me just check everything is perfect
two people are watching I guess one is
kosher and second is we note grave nning
Justin hooked up before people are
watching now let me check everything
once
okay Hoss you're also on line seven
people are watching so we'll start the
session in one minute just check
everything is the proper
hmm everything seems perfect streaming
is going good eight people are watching
so you have already started asking the
questions and that's good
okay so 11 people are watching now it's
time to start this session then okay so
let's so before going for this session
let me talk about Vienna I talked about
news so finally we are eighteen thousand
subscribers now okay so I got eighteen
thousand subscribers thank you so much
and you are one of them so that's
awesome and and I feel very happy to be
to have so much of subscribers in fact I
have two channels one is now in Wendy
and second is that is called hardening
so i started with naveen ready and then
i felt i should start with the name
proper name so i made a new channel
called serese cole earnings and all the
new videos are uploaded on telesco
learnings so when i say eighteen
thousand subscribers and talking about
you new channel I'm not uploading my
videos on the old channel that's why
it's it is approximately 10,000
subscribers there so yes that's awesome
thank you so much for your support and
yeah so does the news approximately i
get i got around 2.5 million views or is
it million or billion amateur or
somewhere that somewhere around that and
even number doesn't matter right anyway
so let's start this session will will I
mean starting with the q8 session here
swimming is still going good
ok so we are going for the first okay it
is
okay so let's run with this where is
that yeah so first of all they start
with a V sang earlier if you are
watching this thank you so much for the
answers you are giving to the comments
so the lots of people asking questions
on youtube on the in the comment section
so you are the one who is answering all
those questions I guess you and low hip
both are answering the questions so
that's amazing in fact the other people
who are also answering the questions but
I can see your answers there so thank
you okay so 15 people are watching ok
let study the first question the first
question is from Ashok how to start and
how to start networking talking about
loving are I don't know if talking about
networking learning you want to learn
what how network works so depends upon
how much knowledge you have so let's say
you are learning a talking for the first
time you so you should know all those
networking devices you should know what
is router means you have hub switch
router then we have devices like router
switch you know we have lots of devices
you should know all those devices first
you should know about what is IP address
how IP address works how you know how
this port number works a different
protocol work so you should know you go
by step by step in fact I would suggest
you to read a book of Williams talents
of later data communication so search
for data communication on Amazon you
will get one of the one of the book from
there I guess it is William data
communication of from William styling or
you can also use a computer network from
Andrew Tannenbaum okay those are two
good books with Kendra for now so that's
next question is
from we note can I learn to programming
language at the same time you can do
that you can learn to deprogram like the
same time there is no harm in that it's
just that i would i would suggest to
focus on one thing at a time instead of
instead of going for two different
things go with one thing at a time you
know when you learn one thing that time
you can practice it you can understand
the basic concepts you can do some
experiments once you complete that one
language I will suggest you to go with
the second language or after that you
can go with third language and the thing
is you cannot even complete one language
properly because I have not completed
Java yet you know we have lots of thing
in Java which even I don't know so i
would suggest do doing the do the
mastery in one language why to learn
multiple languages same time right what
you can do you can do that you can learn
two languages at the same time there's
no harm in that okay amazing videos is
web designing is a good option I is it
option yes the good option to go for if
you are creative enough if you love
creativity then go for it I know web
designing is not just using HTML CSS and
JavaScript it's all about how creative
you can be I mean you have to create a
design which your users will like again
so make sure if you are good with
designing if you if you think your
creative then only go for web designing
then you have a life otherwise you know
earning 15,000 rupees ten thousand bits
per month that's not a good amount right
so I would suggest if you are creative
enough then only go for web designing
because you will earn a lot with your if
you're if you are good good with it
second there are certain technologies
which are not easy to learn right but if
you are passionate about designing then
you will love to learn it so if you have
interest if you love design if you are
creative enough then only go forward
with web designing okay so car tech next
question is from Karthik
oh that's a comment thank you so much
for cut thank you so much for that kotik
okay so early can we make tutorials on
socket and streaming java okay can you
make I have created a video on socket so
I do have a socket video on YouTube do I
i think i have i have the video if i'm
not wrong i do have a video on socket
okay so you can refer that you can just
search for socket programming from
telesco osaka socket programming telesco
you will get the video there and streams
also I do have a video and should be
talking about I do have a java string
video okay the in Java 8 we have the new
concept by java string i have video on
that okay so social websites like hikers
rank and coach ship are there but they
were very high level prior to the
solving problems which because should
use only for the question topic was in
java Oh books I don't know I don't know
any book tool like this way you for
problem solving what you can do for that
I feel when you go for a hacker rank
there are easy questions I I think
you're going into very difficult
questions you know there are different
sections you can go for the easy
questions I'm sure there should be
something otherwise I don't know about
the book but you can refer some channel
on YouTube which only does this quiz
stuff we know they have questions and
then they try to answer your questions I
mean they will give you questions and
then there will also be the answers for
that otherwise what you can do is create
your own problem data structures work
with that then algorithms designing
algorithms you can refer that you know
every language in fact in data structure
also we have algorithms we have computer
graphics in which you have algorithm try
to solve those algorithm by yourself
without referring to book I think that
will give you some level of practice
okay so we know planning to learn
android and iOS development together
don't do it okay learn one at a time so
for android analyze learn when time
start with Android you can do this thing
after learning bigness level of Android
you can start with the iOS
okay so let's say spending one month on
Android or maybe 20 days on Android and
then later 20 days on iOS don't learn
and white fully okay you should you
start with the big nerd level then make
some apps it will give you confidence
then go for iOS okay learn iOS basics
make an appt then go for Android again
you can do that way don't learn
parallely you will get confused okay
next question is from amazing video how
to be a web developer to be a web
developer is actually very easiest not
that difficult you should you should
behave like a spider I know you have to
make a web so web development comes in
two parts one is the web back end part
which is Java PHP all the stuff and then
behind web designing okay so designing
up page comes under web designing you
have to be you have to learn HTML okay
so two to be a good designer first you
need sgml to design a page okay because
you design a page of your page using
HTML you can make your page more
interactive or you can make your page
more beautiful using CSS okay and then
if you want to make your page
interactive you have to use JavaScript
so this three comes on the client side
so HTML CSS and JavaScript in fact when
you design a page you need some images
you need some gif images so it should be
good with photoshop also when I say good
I mean you should know how to use
photoshop when I don't know how to use
photoshop that's what not it is I know
but if you are designing a web page
website you should know all those stuff
and again you can you can you know you
can have a friend who is good with
designing I mean who's good with
photoshop you can ask him to design
images for you or you can do that so you
can be a web designer by learning CSS
tml CSS javascript and photoshop okay
then comes the back end part which is
java PHP so let's say if you want to
make a dynamic page so then you have to
learn back end programming if you just
want to learn website development go for
PHP it is very easy to learn you can
also learn java to make websites but
has a very big learning curve if you
just want to be a dollar per I mean you
can you can also learn java there
otherwise there are lots of languages
which works on this other side then
learn those languages and start making
website ok there is no rocket science
here just learn those things and start
making website you know time by time you
learn lots of things and then you will
be a master web developer ok then we
have a question from loll express that's
awesome name mca three years after BSC i
tol MBA after two okay which is better
career growth option you know what I
feel if you are if you are done with BS
CIT and then if you want to be I if you
want to be in technical fields you want
to be a programmer if you want to be a
developer may be datable a database
administrator if you want to work on the
computer doing something innovative
things go for mca okay go for masters in
IT which is maybe mscit all mca doesn't
matter but if you go if you want to be
in to manage management level if you
want to be a project manager if you want
to be in a HR I just art itself then go
for NB but if you want to be a
programmer don't go for mba you will not
get a programming job after mba if you
hate programming that's your weakness
then go for NBA types of it does the
good option so doing mba or knowledge is
depend upon you your future if you want
to be into development field of course
mca no choice okay next question is from
michelle joshi sir I'm a first year
computer science student I am confused
as of now which field it choose to do
major n I mean in cloud computing is
their network security oh so you are
doing ms RBS I'm not sure you're in
India or us i'm not sure but i would
such as to go for its all depend which
with what type of major you want to go
for if I am you then I would go for
cloud computing because I love it it
depends upon your interest if you love
security go for network security if you
learn if you love mobile devices go from
a while development
as a major if you love that web
development go for web developers a
major its all depend upon your interest
but i would suggest for the future its
cloud computing ok go for that if you
don't if you are confused with it i will
just go for cloud computing ok next one
from co shall i can uh where's the
question i lost it ok can a good
programmer can get a good salvage job if
you feel in academic year I mean you're
getting fade no you have to clear your
graduation at least you know if you have
done with your degree then you can think
about getting a good job ok so this is
the problem with India you know we you
need to be qualified to for any job
there are some startups you know there
are startup well even if you are too
well standard that's ok they will hire
you if you are good at programming but
they will not pay you much the second
problem is maybe the company will shut
down in two months or six months because
they are startup newly make company I
would suggest to improve your academic
things you know don't get filled okay at
least clear the exams or try to get 6055
person at least it's not that difficult
to get good marks in exams now ok so
what you can you can get a good salary
job if you at least complete your degree
in a proper way don't get fail at least
computer engineering then you can think
about being a good getting a good salary
you can be a good programmer or you can
you can start your own company if you
want to if you're getting fail in
academics I can start your own company
if you have a good idea go for that or
if you think you can you're good enough
to make to make some innovation and you
two things then go for it there are lots
of option ok then we have which pratik
which will be better to take up looking
at the future java or javascript that's
a good question oh ok the problem with
javascript is it is changing a lot you
know it's a very good technology there
are lots of thing based on JavaScript
now but I feel there's one little
problem here the problem is
javascript is changing and you have to
learn new things every year okay these
plain works are changing everything is
changing very fast if you are good if
you want to be into this field of
designing if you want to make everything
fast to go for all the JavaScript but
there are big companies if they want to
make enterprise software of course you
do not have a choice for enterprise
software you have to use Java example if
you want to make an ERP system if you
want to make mobile devices now or
mobile mobile software you have to learn
java so if you don't like Java then go
for JavaScript but if you are keeping
Java into option I mean if you have Java
an option go for java yeah ashrey no no
mean is there any specific academic
qualification for developers if you're
not fresher yes if you are a fresher
like let's say if you want to get a job
as a campus interview then you need a ba
degree which is engineering degree or
maybe MCA maybe BSA idea or something
like equivalent to that otherwise you
can also be from camas feel you can be a
developer but big companies they prefer
engineers but startup if you are good
with programming if you are java
certified if you are if you have done
the certification in one language you
can think about it okay so let me just
change the direction of my that's much
problem yeah so you can be from camas
field and you can be a good programmer
but there are lots of companies or they
don't prefer the only play for be e
people so yeah but you can there's no
Liam qualification would be a degree
okay maybe 15 years of education okay
next question is from nice shawl or just
for the update we have a live session
only for half an hour today maybe 15
minutes more okay just got lots of work
today today what to do okay I also
wanted to know which kind of programming
is required to enter into the field of
Robotics in future for the white look
for for the vortex I would suggest to go
for C program
I guess we also use prologue the
prologue and Lisp lis p so they are
there they are AI programming languages
I think they might be using that but see
is this starting step okay so we have
embedded c we have embedded java you can
learn those concepts for the vortex okay
next from Karthik apart from apache
tomcat which web server can i install an
eclipse you can go for jboss you can go
for the websphere you can go forward but
those are app servers web server is only
tomcat other things are observers an app
server inbuilt they have a web server
that's that's awesome right so you can
you can you can install jboss you can
install weblogic websphere a glassfish
and what what else we have why fly which
is the jboss advanced version yeah so
you can you can you start any of those
web servers no sure okay
okay that's
okay meantime you can also type your you
know from which from from where you are
watching this video your country your
city anything and your qualification
maybe it will be helpful for me for you
know analyze what type of audience i am
getting on youtube okay next is from
lokesh what is what is needed to start
for app developer for app development
you should have software's required like
and if you are talking about Android app
you need a I know studio you need java
jdk you should use it no programming
java programming language and xml if you
know this you are good to go you can
start your own apps but i feel to make
an appt you need a concept i mean
whatever app you want to build example
if you want to build a torch the lots of
thoughts available on Play Store right
why would anyone use your torch right so
honey I feel you need a basic idea why I
mean what type of app you are making
first is that second to implement that
you should know the programming java and
xml you should know how mobile works
right all the stuff and that's enough if
you know all those all the stuff you are
good to go okay so car tech when I want
to DC lies Jason response I can tackle
it is a rise to an object this is a
question of is it a question map ! I
don't know how to do sighs an Jason
response but you can you can use Jason
you can use JSON library which is watch
it Jason okay and in that do you have
lots of methods like get json object get
Jason Eddie you can fetch element using
that DC lives that's weird Karthik but
some people create class from result oh
it's better to create classes to accept
Jason response ok because you're Jason
will DC arises I as an object of
Plus that that works perfectly because I
we use that in the Android application
so when I made android application I've
used the same concept I've go to the
class and Jason response was to getting
DC rising to object directly that I I
feel that's a better option VIN vinay
hinata 7a so I want to go for ocjp
certification please do guide me okay so
first of all learn java okay so you can
refer my videos you can refer a book
after that by a certification book refer
to those questions and there will be
lots of questions demo questions there
try to solve those questions it will
improve your confidence level and then
by a walk by a watcher from Oracle
website or from any local institutes in
fact locally when I say an ID or aptech
they provide this they provide this
vouchers okay so because they have the
center exam centres prometric center I
don't know which centers they are going
for now but they i would suggest you go
there and buy the watcher but before
that learn java give some a demo test
buy a book in which they will be having
questions okay next question next is
from
why does java so ambiguous errors with
interfaces to because in Java 8 we can
define methods an interface and when you
when you are defining the methods then
of course it will give you a big
ambiguity problem so for that you have
to watch my video on youtube I have a
video on interfaces in Java what's that
ok next one
how to increase speed okay how to
increase speed of my programming I don't
know how to increase the speed but how I
have increased the speed of my
programming is by making by adding codes
you know every day you write code it
will increase your speed first of all
increase your typing speed okay you know
there are lots of programmers they
believe that there is nothing there is
no relation between the programming and
typing and there is the faster you type
the faster u make your programming or
case of make make sure you learn the
typing first you have to use your all
ten fingers okay so when I type
something I use those ten fingers don't
do this okay don't type something with
two fingers you know there are lots of
people they types so fast with those two
fingers don't do that next practice
codes everyday try to write codes every
day I don't know we what type of code
you write but write codes don't stay
away from coding what next be a part of
competitions you know there are lots of
online competitions offline competitions
all this competition try to participate
there it will improve your programming
skills for sure okay next tips for
Android beginners tips would be be very
good with Java and start mimicking some
apps I know any of mobile phone of
course there will be some apps right try
to mimic those apps create those apps as
it is and check how much you can match
the user requirements ok because
sometimes you know copying something
gives you some you know it will give you
exact requirement what you have to build
ok so try copying some apps from your
mobile phone and try to make it make
your own whatsapp that's ok right don't
publish on Play Store but make your own
whatsapp just to check how well you can
code ok Karthik I have been hearing
about angularjs a lot does this replace
jquery and what advantage of dirt
angularjs ok I'm alergias is not the
competitor for java JRE ok there are two
different things angularjs is basically
for single app application there is
something which I'm
j/s cannot do a javascript java jquery
can do i would suggest go to goo goo to
youtube and search for the video exact
video angularjs with jquery because i'm
not Dan core java with javascript so I
don't want to comment on something which
i do not know properly so go to youtube
search for angularjs with jquery i have
seen that video what I don't remember
the exact points so make sure you watch
that video it will give you more more
thing then I would provide here ok next
can I be kind of become studio when I
become student get a job as a developer
if he is yes you can you know if you're
even if I be calm you will get a job
with a dollop of it but make sure you
you do a certification ok so i would
suggest go for java certification or
maybe darkness certification if you're
going to go for dotnet but get satisfied
because when you go for the interview
they will check your certification
because how can you make sure that you
know i mean how would you you know
convince them that you know programming
so for that gets defied ok that's the
one thing ok next oh how chrome
extensions are developed even I don't
know let's check Chrome extensions
development Oh
programming
I know which programming they use but
let's let's see
so there's a there's a frequently asked
question on Chrome Web site itself watch
what technologies are used okay there
they have views JavaScript they have use
Java scholarship html5 and JavaScript
API is with Jason so this is the
technology they have used to create
Chrome extensions that's awesome thanks
for the question I got to know something
new so they use javascript Oh biswajit
the live streaming joint lately good to
see you again yeah kushan from but
laputa that's awesome but La Push Jessie
times at a time ok had the bar de Lucas
nagar but i am from orissa b.tech that's
good so b is C ok there's a question
from Hirsch so bcit or BSC chrome
science is it any difference yes there
is a difference difference is basically
slappers difference bcat focuses more on
a programming part and BAC calm signs
focuses more on the OS concepts you know
the basic hardware concepts so it
depends upon what type what thing you
want to do i would suggest go for BSE
calm signs you will learn you will learn
about more concepts then be a CIT ok
last 10 minutes then be a good to go ok
I have seen many websites offering
direct APK developing without any
specialized developing language ok this
website this apps are not customized ok
you cannot do things what you want to do
you cannot make up you're going to make
you cannot make your own wats app using
those websites i know i have heard about
those websites you just have to provide
the information and they will give you
the app but those are not the actual
apps which you can customize again
don't-don't-don't fell into those things
stop you know keep making native
applications that's better and
for that I just have to update click on
the like button if you have not clicked
on the like button make sure you click
on the like button because that is the
way I will know that you know people are
interested in this okay next question is
which is best python-based hosting
provider according to you in India
python-based I don't know and I don't
work on Python so I don't have much idea
but I'm deploying my website job website
on openshift and open ship openshift
supports Python so it's good it's not
that bad go to open ship com created
account and select Python there in fact
you can watch my videos on youtube on
openshift instead of selecting Java you
have just like Python that's the only
difference i feel when can we get
another Q accession actually nice
initial I don't know is neutral right
yeah the thing is I was not I was not
cheapo supposed and I was not planning
to make one more life session because in
the lives right in the last live session
itself i mentioned that i'm busy to take
one more life session but since today i
have completed 18 thousand subscribers
so i got excited and I thought about the
live session in the afternoon and that's
I'm taking the evening but maybe as soon
as I get 20,000 subscribers that will be
the next live session okay maybe before
that if I feel something is important to
discuss i will do a live session but
these are not confirmed as soon as i get
free example today when i was i was free
for some time so i thought about taking
the live session it's raining in mumbai
okay I just you know I just enjoyed the
raining outside and i'm totally this is
very wet now this t-shirt I can feel
line' so a wet I'm feeling cold also
sitting in bit of the AC
yeah so maybe I don't know
okay so unfortunately I went offline I'm
back okay eleven people are watching
people left I guess
okay so there was I was talking about
okay about it ethically hacking and I
don't know much about that ethical
acting okay I don't know nisha sometimes
I know the logic of a particular program
but in putting into programming language
sometime yeah for that you need practice
okay it's not that easy to convert the
concept into programming okay sometimes
we know how to do it but we don't know
how to put into programming things okay
so you have to trial error first of all
break down the task okay example it
means give an example here let's say I
want to fetch the YouTube playlist which
is on the server onto my machine okay so
I want to I want to display the videos
on on the page but the video should be
coming from the YouTube okay all the
videos all navin ready videos should be
coming on on the page so it's a big task
white I know what I have to do I have to
go to youtube I have to copy each and
every link and then come here on the my
web page and paste it but how do you do
it so what I will do first I will take
because the data is coming from the
YouTube API will be coming in JSON
format okay so first we should
understand how to convert json into java
thing but the problem is how to use
YouTube API then so first step first you
have to break down the task the first
task would be if you got a JS if you've
got adjacent from the YouTube what you
will do so create your own Jason demo
Jason and try to convert that into Java
part first task now since you can
convert JSON into Java that means you
can take the jason from the YouTube but
how would you get the Jason on the
YouTube that is a second task let's say
you've got the jason from the youtube
how to specify what exactly you need so
you have to first we have to break down
your tasks into small small parts and
work on that ok so it need it needs
practice ok so need lots of practice
next up from engineered Kessel ok how
can I be perfect in Java most of time I
forgot the methyl function practice
practice that's the only thing practice
I know this is one more thing you can
teach ok if you if you think you have
your 10 to four got thanks teach ok you
can find locally
do it in your area and go there and
teach does not matter maybe school kids
maybe kids from flip kids of 10 years
old of 20 years old I very excited today
you know nowadays so what you can do is
you can find those people and teach
programming them when you teach you
learn twice okay so i thought the
practice teach or you can make videos
videos on youtube okay by that in fact
what this is what i do i if i learn some
if I learn something new I make a video
on that okay so that people who are
subscribe the channel they will learn
something new and I will remember the
things this what my advantage I have is
let's say i have i've learned something
two years back and now i want to learn
it again I don't watch other videos i
watch my own videos alright so that's
the advantage to make your own videos
make your own notes that's the way you
will remember things next are we what do
you do apart from making tutorials on
youtube what I do I seek I eat I I go to
bed let's see that's what I do apart
from YouTube I get to be honest I'm a
corporate trainer no I'm a freelancer

okay when I go for picnic when I go for
vacation I've had the same t-shirt you
can ask my interns I know two days back
Abby went to lonavala and I was wearing
the same t-shirt I will pour okay
there's nothing like favorite here we
don't have a choice you know when you
say favorite when you have lots of
t-shirts out of that when you are
wearing one t-shirt I don't have a
choice you know when i open my closet I
see the only one t-shirt which is this

people can also do MCM mana i'm doing
BCA in my college there is only one java
core level is it important learn swing

development part but swing is not
required now so that's okay I can you
solve from tonight thanks a lot again
thank thanks thank you ok so from deepak
i am going for placement in up cup and
upcoming december i mean IIT i'm
learning java what else i should be good
o people from iit watching my video
that's awesome I got some students from
iit also now okay so with java you can
learn what else you need
hold on data structure concepts because
in IIT also when the company approached
they would they want your data structure
concept to be clear os concepts i would
suggest also learn about python okay
this booming now so learn python python
a bit learn about noble technology at
least one android/ios i think that's
that's it that's good enough for you
that's what they asked a lot while I'm
feeling that I have made some questions
oh I have missed lots of questions I
guess
do predict based companies a company
hire Android developers yes they do hon
Android developers if Jace is disabled
in the browsers so Java doesn't work
what the form get submitted if that's a
designing question I'm very bad
designing I told you ok ok you have done
your so amazing videos you have done
your job softening goes from niit your
loss are now learning an ID I don't know
how much you learned but make sure you
also certify yourself if you are
learning if you have learned java that
makes you a certified there get the
Oracle certification that's important I
don't trust this classes and IIT app
take the gist you know it they don't
have much branches who there are some
branches they trained well there are
some branches with they don't train well
so I don't know how much you know ok so
next what type of beat aqueous
difference I don't know about we take
all those things ok windows guy a newbie
here what is the best possible way to
think like a programmer and make ones
you people are aliens because we are not
dealing with real world things we are
dealing with virtual well thanks so we
as a programmer we don't live in real
world we live in virtual world ok so
you're not human you are Elliot because
anyone who don't live in real world
therefore this aliens so you are aliens
think about it then what set has given
you one feature which is seen right
which is not in SMS here we have
delivery but it doesn't prove that a
person has read your message right so
give some extra feature and everyone
will love your app so think like an
alien what else user needs because in
this world there are lots of things
where which people need but we don't
know what they need so try find this
find the problem and try to solve it
that's how you be a good programmer ok
next from she know you're great man oh
thank you so much straight ok so deeper
after after kochava you can learn some
frameworks you can learn spring
framework or you can learn sublet GSP so
Spring Framework sublet JSP and spring
MVC and learn how to deploy app on on
the website out how to deploy your
website on the cloud okay so you can
also learn openshift it will be very
beneficial for you and luckily I have
all the videos on YouTube ok and the
last question for the day
so last question is I've been searching
for PHP interpreter for look I don't
know the actual power on okay the
question from normal I'm not good with
PHP so no idea guy okay after learning
job of long yeah so after learning java
you can i go to the field between java
based android development like
understood you or native native android
development is java development when you
when you when your IT of software using
java you are making a native application
right so that's good that's thing okay
that's it then judy judy judy i started
so
there's some issue with the
interconnectivity here so i am going
offline frequently I'll get some
streaming
