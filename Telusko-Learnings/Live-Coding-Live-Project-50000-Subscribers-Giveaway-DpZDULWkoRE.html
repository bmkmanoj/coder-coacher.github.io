current number is 48 thousand eight
hundred subscribers we are still short
with 1,200 subscribers okay so I'm so
happy for that maybe in the next few
days we'll be getting that benchmark so
I'm so happy I'm going for a giveaway oh
no I'm not giving away I phone or a
MacBook or any other laptop okay I will
give you something which will be helpful
for your career so I always think about
this how can what can I do which will
help you to achieve something which you
want and you all want to get into big
companies right you want to work for
Google or Microsoft or Infosys or TCS
what what I can do using which you can
you can achieve that thing and I mean
you are working hard but then I want to
be a catalyst in your in your success
right so what can I do now so I made
this channel where I have uploaded lots
of videos so I made sure that I will
teach something which will be helpful
for you right so when I when I was
teaching Java so it was a it was helpful
for you I have made lots of videos right
which you are using but then learning
language is not the only thing right I
mean you cannot be a great programmer
you can you cannot be a great software
developer just by learning up a Grameen
language there are lots of thing you
have to take you have to take care of
right so when you talk about software
developers life cycle we have certain
steps you have to follow why we have to
talk about requirement gathering or then
design then creating the UI then
creating the coding the software then
testing it and deploying it so how can I
teach you all these things now I'm not
things for it okay
so when I say I know everything I can I
think I can take the requirements I can
design the software I can make the
software I can test it but then I cannot
teach you everything because I'm not
that good at teaching designing I'm not
that good at teaching testing testing
right I was good at teaching you Java so
I did that but then so what I'm planning
now is one way to get into big companies
or to get to get that huge success is
building this offer by yourself so in
the in my patches in online patches or
if I go for the corporate training what
we do is after every batch once the
batches batch gets over I give them some
project to work on right what if I can
do
here not for the badges not for the
corporate but for my subscribers what if
we together can build a project I mean
just imagine we can start the project
from scratch okay I will give the
requirements or we will take the
requirement from someone else or I will
give the requirement together we'll plan
our requirements together we redesign
this software together we'll code
together with tests and together we
deploy so what if we can do that I don't
know how to do that now yet I'm still in
the sub that this plan is filling in the
initial phase we are still running it
out how can we achieve that so maybe in
this week I will I will I will have an
exact plan how to achieve that but then
this is the start right we can start it
I don't know it will be successful or
not but we can start it right we can do
the coding together so it will be a life
coding okay so once you started the
acquirement phase we will do we will get
the requirement we will design the UI
and the data flow how I mean how what
different modules we need we'll design a
database right we'll be using Postgres
or my ask you again we will do that
together and then we'll also do the
coding part so on my machine I will do
the coding and you can even actually see
what's happening and how to make a
software again this is not for expert ok
people who are already working in
software industry this will not be for
them this will be mostly for those
people who are in college now so if
you're in college and if you don't know
how to build a software from scratch
because learning language will not give
you everything right you have to also
you should also know how to build a
software and that's what we are going to
do in this and this what do I call it we
can you call it us of course not exactly
we can focus a live thing right we will
also give a name to it
I would so the physicians are open if
you have any more solutions on this how
can we achieve that I'm you're always
welcome so you can send me a mail at the
disco training either a gmail.com you
will find that even ID in the
description area so send me a mail about
your suggestion how we can do how we can
achieve that and ok maybe I will not do
it live on YouTube because this is the
first time I don't
- I don't I don't know how it will be
going so I cannot use I will not do a
public broadcasting if you want to be a
part of it send me a mail okay well you
see how - how many people can join this
I'm still not figure it out so let me
know your feedback how we can do it and
let's see how it will go so that's it
from this video so do share this video
with your friends so that I will
complete that benchmark of 50,000
subscribers and do let them know about
this life coding so that's it that's it
from this that's it on this video thanks
