ready and in this video we are going to
create a very simple spring MVC
application using Java based
configuration now again when you make a
spring application you can use XML you
can use annotations or you can go for
Java based configuration and in the
earlier videos we have talked about
spring MVC using annotations or using
XML in this video let's see how to
configure that with the help of Java
which configuration so for that what I
will do is I've got a new project in my
in my STS again you can go for eclipse
as well your choice
I'll be going forest years because it
provides it just provides some extra
features for spring applications in fact
you know I will just change the
perspective to STS here to spring so now
let me get a project I will say new and
I will quit on my own project again you
can go for dank web project but then you
have to do lots of confusion by yourself
let's use maven and now I will say next
now in this you have to select web app
project because you are making a web
application click on next here you have
to mention the project name I can
mention in project name I will say this
is spring MVC Java so the job is
quantification yeah so I will click on
finished the moment I do that it will it
will try to create a project I'm having
project for you so where is that it's
you can see our project is here now it
is giving you an error because I have
not linked my Tomcat with this project
yet so let's do that quickly so I will
right click here now in cell properties
target one time select Tomcat here and
click on apply close and you can see we
have we have get got rid of those errors
now what I want is I just want to create
a very simple application so instead of
going for a complex one let's say I want
to add two numbers or maybe I want to
just print hello world so just to make
it more simple let's go for it of two
numbers because we are not concerned
about logic here we are concerned about
how do we create a project so we already
have our index file right so in this
index file let me just create a form so
I will say form action I will try to
call add yeah and then I will this will
accept two parameters one is t1 and t2
and then we'll click on submit button so
let's do that quickly
okay so as you can see I have just added
two text fill here T or 92 and then
click on submit the moment I click on
submit it should call a it should send a
request right and normally if you do
that in sublet what we do is we get a
servlet and then we extend that serve it
via HTTP servlet and then we have to use
two objects to face this value now since
we are working with spinning and we see
what we'll do is let's create a
controller here we can say new and I
want to get a class and that class would
be what first of all I don't have a Java
the source folder let's do that later
you can see it is going in a resource
folder now I just want to move that to a
Java folder if I say browse will it give
me object option of creating a new
folder it's not giving that let's do
that later then I will just name this
file as a controller has add controller
yeah and then I will say ok nothing
fancy here just click on finish now this
is where it will give you a very simple
class but then to make it work as a
controller you just need to use an
annotation called as add controller so
there's no need to X in any class or
occluding specific method you can simply
say controller and your job will be done
so you have add controller oh it's not
working it's because if you want to work
with spring annotations you need a
spring vijaya files right and if you can
see in this project I have not added any
Java file it's missing so how do you add
those Java files just go to your
parmesan file and this is where you
mentioned the Java files again you can
get this Java files from the mavment
repository just go to google and search
for MB and repository and by going that
you can search for spring MVC issue of
ensure of going there what I will do is
already have a thing or you have a copy
with me I will simply copied from there
and paste it here just to save some time
for this video so you can see I have
added a spring MVC dependency which is
which is four point three point twelve
you can go with a new version it will
work it will I mean it may work depend
upon when you are watching this video so
yes so this this version works as of now
now if I go back to the controller if I
say control space you can see we got the
record the import yeah so once we have
done with the controller now we need a
we need a method who will take the who
will take the request right so I would
say my method name is public
it will be ad which will add two numbers
of course and it will take two
parameters now how do you pass two
parameters again you can go with the way
simple concept you can create a request
object which is a stupid request object
and you can simply face the value
otherwise you can use some special
feature of spring you can say request
parameter paradigm and the request
parameter will be coming in a format of
t1 so the t1 or not this t1 you will say
the value will be coming in t1 and the
value will be assigned to paint int
let's say I or maybe num1 so in the
value now one will be assigned from t1
so whatever value we are sending from t1
will be assigned to num 1 now if by any
chance if you are wondering what that t1
is it is basically a name of the field
in HTML so if you can see we have t1 and
t2 so the same value will be assigned to
num1 and num2 here now we just need to
return a page name which you want to
call so after adding those two values I
will call a result page obviously ezel
dot JSP
technically what you should be doing is
instead of returning a page name of
course you will be adding two Stu value
so you will say int k equal 2 num1 plus
num2 so don't you think you have two
things to return now one is the value
and second is the page name because this
page will have nothing it will simply
have it will have a design of course and
the data will be depend upon this key so
as your k value changes the data will
change so of course you cannot make a
static content there you need to make it
dynamic so how do you make a dynamic
that's a question right so what we will
do is instead of using instead of
entering a string here we can also
specify that I wanna go for a model and
a view object so we can achieve a model
and view object here so we can say model
in view MB because in this object you
can specify both the things the model or
the the view name and the data so I was
a model in view so once we once we got
this object this key will be added so if
we can simply say MV dot add object and
we can assign the value of K and we'll
set that and maybe so we say add object
I would say this is my result and I
would say I want to pour pass so a
passing key with the help of a result
key now once you got this add object we
can simply specify this view name as
well so I'm trying
call a diesel dot JSP and again you
don't need to return now a string format
you can return em be because this MV has
both the things the data and a view name
and you can simply specify hey I want to
return a model the object a model and a
view object now if you if you if you are
wondering you know even if I even if I
return MB and it was string there I was
not getting any error why it is not
giving any error it's because you are
running you are writing your Java code
inside resource folder and this mistake
might happen when you work on a project
so make sure that all your Java files
will be belongs to a job folder so what
I will do is I will just create a new
folder inside this and I will name that
folder as Java folder so I would say
here in SRC in main
I want to have a job folder as well
which is missing in this case I would
say Java folder and let's move this add
controller here now you can see if I if
I make any mistake it will give you
error and we are getting added now so it
just none - thankfully it will it is
I've just moved it there so that I get I
can see the errors but it went to a
default package that's bad it should be
some into some package right so I would
say this is comm dot then usko so I
would say package kaamdar telesco dot
web yeah and then I just move it to that
package particular package done so you
can see in our you know this this add
controller in this in this regard our
controller everything seems good right
but will this work of course it will not
work because we don't have that page yet
which is reason why JSP let's quickly
make it I would say hey I want a JC page
it's JSP and the name of this JSP page
would should be result or JSP and also
gone ok in this I just want to print the
output or I would say result is : and
here I would say dollar and I would say
result so that's it it's just this is
how you print data but will it work of
course not but still let's see what what
other earth so if I run this code if I
right click and run as one on server I
will say Tomcat server I will click on
finish ok so this is where I got my
output can see that it is asking for two
values I would say four and five I click
on submit he's not working why it's not
working let's verify by going to st
and if you have not got any problem here
the thing is whenever you send a request
you have a very typical file here which
is called as a web external file and
this file is a main file for your
application right this is where you
define all the navigation and
unfortunately I have not done any
configuration now first of all we are
not doing a normal server application we
are building a splitter with the
applications so here we have to mention
hey web external file if you get any
requests just send it to this very solid
now if you remember in the spring MVC
theory video I have talked about you in
dispatch in spinning you have a concept
called a dispatcher servlet dispatcher
servlet is responsible to navigate the
entire application so it is your front
controller and we have not done that yet
so I can again we can do that with XML
but I don't want to do that I want to do
that with X with with Java Java
configuration so let's make quickly do
that so if you don't want to work with
the external file anymore
what can you can do is you can create a
simple class of a simple class right
click now and I want a class and I will
name this class as my run controller
again you can name this class as
anything you want but this looks cool
right my friend controller now this
class is responsible to load so this
this class is possible to mention hey
this is the spring application this is a
spring application which is based on
Java based configuration so how do you
mention the configuration it's very
simple just to make it work you simply
need to extend a very small class name
okay when I say small it's very big so
we have abstract so class name is
abstract annotation config dispatcher
servlet initializer okay you don't have
to buy hard this name normally when you
work on a project you can simply copy it
from anywhere so yeah so you just need
to extend this class so this is abstract
annotation web strike annotation config
this by the soft dispatcher servlet an
initializer so what I will do is I will
just write so this is the abstract class
basically so it will ask you for certain
parameter or certain methods to
implement it so I would say add an
unemployment methods don't get scared
looking at these three things it's very
easy actually now if you remember
whenever you when you've been able used
to do the quantification in XML file the
web external file you need to specify
the observe mapping right for which
request you need to use
this application and we used to always
say hey for all the requests doesn't
matter is it a request for a home page
or a contact page doesn't matter you
have to use different controller now in
this case as well how do you mention
that for all the requests we have to use
it so since you can see the return type
here is a string array so of course we
have to return something in a format of
string array so I would say neo string
array and the values since we have only
one type of request which we are going
to accept which is all so we simply say
star slash so when I said slash it means
for all the requests just use this my
friend controller is that simple I guess
that's it from this file now the second
problem is whenever you work with spring
applications you need to configure some
other things as well
now let's say I want some other things
I'm talking about you know we have a
very unique file for every every
application that is your something -
sublet dry kernel file
del you specify the configuration for
this by a servlet and we don't have that
XML file right and of course we don't
want to work with XML files we want to
work without with Java quantification so
this create a file which will replace
the XML file from there the filename is
let's say MVC config so it will repeat a
we are trying to replace a config file
XML file for for the participant softly
so in total you have to get to X to
confusion files one is this one is this
one so this will replace your web.xml
file and this will replace your the
despairs of an xml configuration now in
this class you just need to extend one
class to make it work and that is
extends web MVC so this M web MVC
configured up top so this will help you
in navigation navigate your application
so now you are enabling that hey I am
using spring MVC but you have to also
give the permission so you have to use
one more annotation here which is unable
where m we see now why we are using web
enabled MVC is because I want to use
annotation base conjugation so again you
can you can manually specify all the
beans here or so
if you want to specify all the beans you
have to create a bean flight controller
as well
but if you can see I'm using add
controller here right so why you have to
navigate it manually so you can simply
specify enabled web MVC connotation it
will use annotations everywhere does the
first engine we have to mention we have
to mention one more now if you remember
in the config file of XML if you if I if
you want me to show it I guess I have a
XML config
so if I say web app web and if we can
see that we quad we use these two files
whenever you want to configure with the
help of XML so we use a vessel file when
you mentioned the mapping yeah and then
we mentioned that is Co - serve it when
you mentioned the components can so
these two things are missing so this
thing is configured using MVC config so
we have to use one more by specifying
the components can so I would say
components scan and here I'll mention
the the component the package may have
all these things so I will say comp but
the combo to disco so complicated Co has
all the controllers in fact we have only
one here but we have to use that and we
have to mention that this is a
configuration file so I will say
configuration so on every class on top
of your plan so on top of your FD class
you have to mention something or
component right but in case of
configuration you just have to say
configuration again confusion comments
are almost same but this works yeah
that's it you just need to mention these
things and you have configured
everything so this XML the placement so
the XML replacement here is this one MVC
configuration and the web excel file
replacement is this my controller so we
have done both the configuration but
with the help of Java Java based okay
now only one thing is missing the one
thing is now you can see we have created
this config file right
how would your my controller my friend
kind of knows that this is the file you
have to load and that is what you have
to mention here you can see that it is
get route config classes so you simply
say hey I have to I want to return a
list of classes or array of classes and
if the class which want which I want to
return here is with name is its
MVC config dot class that's it we are
good at this point after doing all those
settings let me just restart nabla shut
my server
I just hope it will work and let's
refresh let's one more say three and
four and if I click on submit it's not
working it says they are not going to
disclose the one exists okay what's
wrong let's go back to the code it says
it's not able to map ad Y but if you see
if in this oh I forgot one thing
now every method need to have or request
mapping right how it will map then so we
have to say request mapping now since we
are using annotation so this is what you
do
I didn't hear you mentioned whenever you
get a request for add this is what you
have to call it's that simple
let's Richard once again and I will go
back here and on the output page con
submit and it worked off my card it
worked it worked but then the value
which we expecting here is something the
value right then but we are not getting
10 there so what's the mistake let's go
back to our code sometimes you know your
this is expression language which is DL
and sometimes al is not so when you get
a moment project by default it will not
give you support for Al or it will
ignore al you just need to say hey don't
ignore al so you simply say is ignored
false using not you have to say false
now let's go back to the page and say
submit and you can see we got 10 so
finally we are happy she is working and
we got the value which is 10 it's that
simple
yeah so just go for a quick recap what
we are trying to do here we got indexed
page we are asking for two values it
with the request will go to the head
controller where you are mentioning
controller and mapping and we are
fetching the values using t1 t2 we are
cutting the original point of view
because I want to send both the things
not just view name but the data as well
so we got an object we go out of you and
we took it written written by turning it
but to handle this
we need a front control all right and so
we have to choice we can go for an
xml-based configuration or we can go for
job is configuration in this example I'm
going for Java based that's why I'm
quitting on my own front controller
which exchange abstract annotation
config despite a servlet initializer you
have another choice we can go for web
application initializer that is just
that we have to do lots of settings
there using this you just need to set
minimum things like you have to mention
for which request you are accepting this
what is your confusion file name and the
confusion file is here and this you are
mentioning hey this is my car this is my
package will have all the components and
I want to enable web ABC annotations and
then this is the confusion file that's
it now I'm also planning to make a video
where I will be using a servlet and as I
mean spring em is the application with
hibernate and that to be job is
conjugation so till that point enjoy
