reading on physical earnings and in this
video we'll talk about validation now
when you talk about your computer the
brain of your computer's CPU right and
CPU does all the operations even if you
want to play some game if you want to go
to Facebook if you want to open an open
if you type of code everything is done
by your CPU right and all the operation
in your CPU is done with the help of
binary format now it is money format it
is your zeros and ones right so it
doesn't support to I'm three and four so
you have to anymore if you want even
want to save five you have to convert
that five into binary format example the
valet format of 5 is once in a 1 right
so all the operation need to be done in
binary format so one of the operation
which we normally talk about is one
aeration so when you want to add two
numbers when you say you want to add two
binary numbers how do we do that so
first of all we'll take vibrantly in the
decimal format we have to convert this
number into binary format is very easy
to do right so we can convert five as
one zero one does the money format of
five and then we got 3 which is 0 1 1 so
this is the binary format of 5 &amp;amp; 3 and
we want to add these two numbers now how
do we add it's very simple so before
adding this thing we will just learn the
rules for each of the numbers so how do
you add with say 0 &amp;amp; 0 if you are adding
0 + 0 you'll be getting 0 right and then
we'll be getting 0 + 1 now it is obvious
right it is 1 and then they got 1 + 0
which is again 1 so this is this is
normal which we have learned from our
childhood right but the moment you get 1
+ 1 something stuck to your mileage is 2
right but unfortunately in binary format
we don't have to we have 0 or 1 right so
this addition of 1 + 1 is actually 0 now
that's weird I know but how exactly it
works so we have 1 + 1 is 0 and we have
to carry 1 so that means in short when
you say 1 + 1 it will give you 1 0 right
which is 0 is the value and what is the
carry
same goes here we have we are getting
the output as 1 0 but then why exactly
we get 1 + 1
zero so for that you have to watch my
video so you know in the description
area you will find a video to do that I
mean know how it works once went +1 or
you can see a card that they can't the
card you will get the video there
so what 1 plus 1 is 0 and then you're
getting a carry as 1 so 1 plus 1 is 1 0
right so now if you want to add this
term to numbers will say 1 plus 1 it
will give you 0 and then carry goes one
right so 1 plus 1 is 0 they are getting
the carry as one when you're saying 1
plus 1 you are getting this as 0 again
and then one carry and then you get 1 0
so we got 1 0 0 0 so when you add these
two numbers you get 1 triple 0 and this
number is actually 8 right so when you
say if I plus 3 is 8 so 1 triple 0 is 8
so that's how you can add 2 numbers but
the column starts when you have a big
hierarchy of numbers example let's say
if I say we have a number 1 1 1 then 1 0
1 and then 1 1 1 and then we have 1 1 1
if you want to add this numbers how it
will be right because we have a list of
numbers now how do you add it so we can
do this doing this this way so we can
say 1 plus 1 which is 0 right so this 1
plus 1 is 0 then 0 plus 1 will give you
1 but then 1 plus 1 is again 0 so in
short we are going for to carry right so
this 1 plus 1 will give you 1 carry and
then this 1 plus 1 will give you the
second carry right and then ultimately
will be having 0 here and then we have
to say 1 plus 1 which is 0 then we got 1
carry here then 1 plus 1 we called 0
we got one carry here and then we we got
this one here now we got 2 carries here
so we have 1 plus 1 that is 1 carry then
1 plus 1 so we for this one we got one
for this - once we got one more one and
then regard for this - we have to go for
one more carry so the answer is 0
because we are not going for any one any
extra 1 then we have three ones so 1
plus 1 is so 1 plus 1 is 0 and then we
got 1 carry and then we got this one
that goes down and then we got this one
here so if you add this numbers you got
1 1 0 1 0 but hold on that's a very
complex stuff right because it's very
difficult to predict the number of
carries so we have a simple
what this the simple solution is if you
have this number like let's go for the
next number here okay so let's say we
are going for this number we want to add
these numbers right so if you can
remember some formulas or some rules you
will get the answer very easily now that
the formulas here so anyway you want to
add in the number of ones
if that number of one's is even number
the ultimate answer you're getting here
is zero so when you have one switch is
in even number the answer you will be
getting is zero okay but if this is even
number and this is odd number you will
get it one here so if the number of
one's is even you will get zero number
of one's is odd you will get one now if
you can see we have one two three four
five so we got one right now how much to
carry so we got the answer one here but
how much to carry so divide this number
by two so we have five ones divided by 2
which is 2 I can be a lot of 0.5 that
will go for two so we have to carry two
right then we got 1 1 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
right so when you have 7 again odd
number so we'll get 1 here and then how
much should carry you right by 3 right
which is divided by 7 divided by 2 which
is 3 so you have to carry 3 3 digits
here then we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
we got an even number so you're right it
will be 0 here right how much to carry
for once
so 1 2 3 4 then we got 4 ones here so it
would be 0 even number how much to carry
to then 0 how much to carry 2 divided by
2 divided by 2 is 1 so this is the
addition of this and when you have this
1 1 1 5 times right so that's how you
can add two numbers in binary in binary
format so that's that sounds simple
right again to understand this concept
of why one this one is zero that you
have to watch the video which is their
description area so that's it thanks for
watching and this is correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
