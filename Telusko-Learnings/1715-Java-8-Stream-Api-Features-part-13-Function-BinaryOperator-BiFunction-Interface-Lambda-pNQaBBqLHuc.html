so what we can do is since we are using
this object F only once so why made to
create the object so we can simply copy
this code and instead of writing F so we
can just cut this code we don't require
this part now so whenever you have F we
can simply paste the code so this is
what we have anonymous class right now
same goes for this B so whenever you
find B we can just write this code so I
hope you're familiar with this inner
classes concept so if you know what is
inner classes you will understand what
I'm doing here so instead of writing B
here we can just let me just cut this
code this is it and we'll go down and
instead of B we'll type will paste that
code so now even if I done this code you
the output will be same so let's try
let's try to run this if I say run as
application see the output is 42 right
so that means let me close all this
extra files here those close I can see
what we have done is we have created we
are not using any anonymous object here
we are creating two streams one s and
second is s 1 in s we are taking all the
values and s 1 we are fetching all the
elements by multiplying by 2 and then we
have found the result with the help of
reduce function or reduce method of s 1
which take two parameters initial value
and the object of binary binary operator
now as we have seen this function here
is a functional interface now it is
function what function interfaces in
Java 8 if you have a function interface
what you can use is you can use a lambda
expression in which you can remove all
the boilerplate code so if you search
from here to here all this code
by the boilerplate code the only thing
is important here is this I okay and
will give I in a bracket so this method
this mean this means this is the
parameter of your apply method and this
is the body okay so you can reduce the
number of lines using this now since we
are working with lambda expression you
don't have to specify the item type also
you can simply say I into two now since
I entities only one statement you have
to remove the semicolon and since you're
removing semicolon you can remove this
curly braces and you can say this is
lambda expression simple okay that's I
just specify the type of string value
zero so we have to say it is the type of
value should be integers forgot to
mention this since you are following
gender easier to follow Jen brings from
start to end and then we can simply say
it is we can write this thing in one
line so we can take out this int tube
and then we can remove this I we can
remove this bracket is because we have
only one parameter so if you are using
only one parameter you don't require
those round brackets after the with your
variable so you can write this in one
line so instead of defining our object
we can infinity instead of defining
anonymous class you can directly use a
lambda expression can be used lambda
expression here yes we can so what we
can simply do is this vanilla operator
takes two values not one value so
instead of defining all this thing let
me write in this way it takes two values
we can simply say I and J and what it
applies is it will simply say I plus J
so it takes two values i J it returns I
plus J so it works initially the value
will be 0 and the first value it will
get added that value will become I and
then it will be added with J now since
we are using a concept of carry here we
can use something of aluminum color C
and E which is more logical C is the
carry and is the value clear so we can
write this thing in one line
now can we make this coil more efficient
oh and the answer is yes we can
what if instead of writing s 1 here and
integer here what if I simply write a
start map function with I there I'm
justifying that of the previous the
previous statement here so instead of
defining s 1 we can simply write this
thing right so I've removed that admin
of the comment also so you can see what
we have written is we have simply
written as dot map dot reduce and this
function if I run this the output is
same now if you say we can make this
code more efficient why to define SEO
when we can write instead of s we can
simply write values start stream and
bracket so we don't require this thing
also simple and if I run this now and
the output is still theme then question
arise why to write result when you can
die to write this thing in the in print
Ellen so we can simply write it here so
we'll say it's pasted so we don't
require this statement and this is what
we have done in the first tutorial of
your map and these methods right so it's
that simple initially you will find it
difficult but trust me it's not
difficult it's just unfamiliar for you
so once you start coding with stream API
you will find it very easy to work with
in fact when I started with stream API
for the first time it was I guess in me
May 2014 I found I found it very
difficult to I just of it very difficult
to absorb but after after some time I
started working with this all this
different lambda expression now whenever
I want to define I don't know most
object I prefer to go with lambda
expression if that interface is
functional interface it is that easy so
this is how we can use different methods
which is MapReduce and they stream API
so let's run this code once again just
to get the file output it is 42</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
