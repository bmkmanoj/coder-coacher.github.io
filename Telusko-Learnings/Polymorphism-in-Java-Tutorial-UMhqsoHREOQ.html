upon something or less polymorphism say
when you hear this term polymorphism it
is one of the most important concept of
oops concerned oops
special defined while it's
object-oriented programming system so in
this you have a feature for less
polymorphism now see not you don't we
get confused to exactly what exactly
what polymorphism does say well
polymorphism you have two one is poly
the second one is morphism see poly
means many so when it all the way Pony
many you have morphism which is called
as behavior so you have poly many
morphism behavior in charka can save it
is many behavior in short it's one thing
many behavior now let me explain this
term using an example let me talk about
a class let suppose you have a class
here let suppose Class A in this class a
let me define a method call as public
void show so I'm defining a return with
0 parameters and it's a default medic on
a show now when I define this method
with certain line in it now let me read
object so if I'm wrong Jacob a x8 obj
equal to nu a so that means I have an
object of a year as obg now if I call
obj dot show this light will call this
show function because it research ok
another obj dot object of a so it will
search the methods show in class a so it
will Travis oh I bought a metal polish
show notion but let's imagine I have a
different method for this public void
show pin this ah
this time I'll click on a variable I and
that goes here again with statements and
come in here now again if I can read the
object of a obj I have an object of a
obj and when I call obj dot show it will
search again equal tothis so in a you
have two methods show and show I am just
get confused is it this show or is it
this show that means to clearly find
this show reference should this again it
will go for the number of parameters you
have 0 Magneto
here you have 0 parameter that means
this statement will call this show
method and that is you know you have two
methods you are calling only one method
and this is called as polymorphism same
function different behavior that means
it will call this method and this
concept in polymorphism is called as its
methods because we are dealing with
methods which is overloading headshot
you have two methods if you call this
statement if you call this function that
means you are overloading a function
let's suppose if I pass by here this
time it will call this function because
when it says you have a parameter as int
it will search for a method which is
parameter by eight so this star it will
call this function again you are
overloading this function using this
function this is called as method
overloading okay but polymorphism also
deals with a second method called as
method overriding so let's focus on this
already so again a second example
so first of all you have seen something
or less metroid over loading second
really focusing on methyl oh boy writing
now let me take an example let's suppose
you have a collosseum plus a now this
plus a defines our method are given a
gives public void show I get it will
define some things now I have a class a
recharge public void show I have a
different class called as B which
extends hey
now when I say Class B extend Class A
and if I create object of B again you
can see this is for the single guidance
now everything which is which belongs to
+8 now we belong to Class B and if I
create object of beam yure as B obj the
object as new new B when I call obj dot
show again B+ don't have any method but
this this function on this statement
will call show because everything which
is in the a now belongs to B so
indirectly this will call this function
total result with a problem arise when
you have the same function name here
it's public void sure again has some
shipment now when I call show it will
call this show this will not call this
show they pick an example let's suppose
if you have a mobile phone or if you
don't have a white hood your father has
a mobile phone now if somebody asks you
do you have a phone you will say yes I
have Nokia CC 1 0 that's not yours it's
your father's that means this will be J
so we'll call this function but now if
you purchase a new
a black wedding phone a blackberry curve
if now somebody asks you you do have fun
you will say yes I have black petticoat
you will not say I have Nokia because
blackberry is yours so if somebody asks
you you will say you will say you have a
phone blackberry you are not referring
to your previous one
that means when who bitch it will all
show it will Connie's own show that
means this show method is overriding
this show method and this concept is
called as overriding so we talked about
polymorphism same name different
behavior it depends upon the parameters
if you have two methods with different
parameters it is called as method
overloading
if we have two methods with the same
name same parameter and different class
one is a plus against big class again
you should have a concept of inheritance
this will be called as method over
writing okay most of the time you will
find this method overriding and method
overloading now if you say if I have
tavio with brackets and again I have a
second constructor then I was again
constructor with public a8i again as you
say as you see this is a a that means
this is a member function having same
name as class name it is four less
constructors again constructors are also
methods so when you go for methyl
overloading this is constructed ordering
and this concept is called as
constructor
loading so in short in polymorphism you
can cover method overloading methylating
and in Charlotte you can cover
constructor overloading and this is what
polymorphism again in simple terms
polymorphism many behavior one thing
many behavior it's something in this way
you have two things method overloading
method overriding one name the same name
different parameters method overloading
same name same path different class
within identity is called as method
overriding and that is polymorphism
that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
