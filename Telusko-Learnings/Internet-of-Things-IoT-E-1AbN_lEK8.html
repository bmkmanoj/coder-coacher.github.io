today we talk about i OT now iota stands
for internet of things right and you can
see everywhere we are getting this term
is IOT IOT IOT and in fact we have io8
io9 so important first imagine there was
a time in a way back when you had a
phone and you had a machine and you
cannot connect your phone with your
machine right because there were no
connectivity as bluetooth connectivity
there's and there was not no Wi-Fi it
just our normal nokia double one doubles
your phone and your desktop then they
got the time it you can connect your
desktop with your with your mobile phone
or maybe you can connect your laptop
with a mobile phone so that you can
control your mobile phones operation
from your laptop or you can you can
control your laptop operations from your
mobile phone right because they are
connected now just imagine at your home
if everything is connected start from
your tube light your AC your
refrigerator your maybe your desktop
your shoes electronic shoes so
everything will be connected and if you
want to connect all these devices we
require a connection right we acquire a
network between them now we have a
technology where you have multiple
devices connected to each other example
you can control your AC which is which
you can control your AC temperature with
a mobile phone your Q key we have
infinite sensors now which is not just
about sensors it's about let's say you
want to control your AC you know you're
not at home you're in your office and
you want to control your home AC
temperature so you can you can even do
that if your mobile phone is connected
with your AC right now your AC needs a
unique IP address of course right
because you connected your AC on
internet you required unique IP address
that means your phone knows about the IP
address of your AC your AC knows about
the iPad or sakya refrigerator now let's
say we have one example let's say if
you're going going going inside your
house and suddenly if you open the door
ultimately that the light should be on
and once you go out the light should be
off how to do that again we can use your
IOT now all these various sensors are
connected together to generate huge
amount of data and all this data is
stored on this server
and again that's why we have a
technology like big data right again you
can I hope you
watch my video in big data so we have
already talked about big data point of
data so technology specifies that
everything at your home doesn't matter
if it's a different box or knife or your
Tiffin box you have your scissors you
have your bag your water bottle
everything will be connected on internet
so every device needs and a unique IP
address and that's why we require ipv6
now right we have we have gone the days
we have ipv4 now we are working with
ipv6 so everything will be connected
with Internet now if you think this is
very awesome right you can you can
search for your socks so let's say you
have you forward your wave is your socks
you can search your socks from your
mobile phone you the location of your
socks from your boys mobile phone
awesome right
but is a huge risk here the risk is now
let's say you have a good in fly to your
home you have you have all the things
connected and in your laptop you have
something very secure data maybe you
have your confidential company data in
your laptop and suddenly every someone
tries to hack your machine again you
will say no one can hack my machine
because my machine is secured with a
firewall you are using world best
firewall right it is secure but just
imagine a some someone's hacked CX your
AC now you know your AC will not have a
firewall right anyone can hack your AC
they can control your tell is own
temperature with with with that hacking
tool right but the thing is you say ok
it's ok right and if someone is
controlling my room temperature it will
not affect my laptop right it may
because both these machines which is
your AC and your laptop they are into
same network and firewall works for the
outside network not for the inside
network maybe you can configure your
firewall to work on inside network but
let's say you're not configure that you
are working only with outside network
now someone will hack your AC and then
from your AC they can hack your laptop
and that's the risk with IOT so yeah
it's a very good technology to work with
but there are some certain drawbacks to
you know to solve so that's that's IOT
for you everything will be connected
with Internet and that's it thanks for
