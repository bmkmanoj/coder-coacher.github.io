video we'll talk about session beans so
session beans in EJB in which you have
two different types in fact three types
first is stateless then we have stateful
and singleton so we have already done a
video on stateless in this video we'll
talk about stateful so what we will do
in this video is we'll try to achieve
the example in which I can demonstrate
the use of stateful for this what I will
do is I will create a a project in which
I will create a webpage in which I will
ask a user to enter a number then I will
add those number in a list and will
display the elements or the browser so
every time I send a request with every
time I click on a button add it will add
those elements into a list and it will
be displayed now why stateful will will
be important is if I click on a button
it will call the same page without
clearing the data that will it mean it
will maintain that data and the only way
you can maintain that data is because it
is stateful now let's try to achieve
that let's get a project and it ought to
in order to project will say job
application java web application click
on next here will type a project name
and this save will say this is e jb
state full and will say next we'll
select our GlassFish server because uh
when you work with a JB you have to
select our application server here which
is a glassfish and then you have to say
next we are not going for any framework
so because the next window will give you
the list of frameworks and week and I
agree got to click on finish now once
you click on finish it will open this
HTML page I don't need is this HTML page
now in order to work with your state
full we require a remote interface so
whenever you work with this stateful
session bean the first step is you have
to create a remote interface now exactly
we can create a more remote interface
that we'll see in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
