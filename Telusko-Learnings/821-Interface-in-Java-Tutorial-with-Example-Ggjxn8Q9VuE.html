the Lascar learnings in this video we'll
talk about interfaces now what is
interface so interface is a block same
like abstract class but differences in
interface every method will be abstract
okay you cannot have a defined method in
interface so that may let me create an
interface here so how to get interface
we have to mention interface and so
that's a keyword we have to use and we
have to we have to provide our interface
name so I will say this interface name
as maybe what do you see let's say we'll
say a PC okay let's let me get let's
keep it simple let's say ABC so we have
our interface which is ABC here and in
this ABC interface we need to have some
methods okay so let's say the method
name is public or void show so by
default this method is public and
abstract so every method in your
interface will be public abstract now
since the by default it is public
abstract we don't have to mention this
right now I want to create I want to
create or instance of this ABC which
will call show okay because in order to
call show we need to create an instance
right because this is no non-static
method now how to instantiate ABC now to
instantiate ABC can we say ABC obj equal
to new ABC now unfortunately you cannot
create a instance of ABC is because ABC
is an abstract right so you can see
there is an error here so ABC is a
interface and you can see there is an
error here which says which is ABC's
abstract cannot be instantiated so in
order to instantiate ABC we need to
provide the implementation since in this
we don't have implementation for ABC so
we'll create a new class and we'll name
this class as a my implement I will say
ABC implement so we have a class which
is ABC implement now this class needs to
implement
ABC okay so whenever you want to
instantiate or interface we need to
create a different class which will
implement your interface now you can see
it as an error here which says ABC impel
is not abstract and does not override
abstract method show that means in order
to implement an interface we need to
define or we need to implement a method
which is show here so way to define all
the methods which is declared so you
have to say public void show and we can
provide any implementation here we can
write any statement we'll say in show
just for the examples of rewriting in
show so we have a class which is ABC in
pull which implements ABC and we have a
method police show which planes in show
simple so I we cannot create our object
of ABC but we can create our object of
ABC impel because ABC impel is a class
okay now we can use a reference type of
ABC is because ABC impel which is this
implements ABC so we can create a
reference of interface and we can create
a object of a class simple and then we
can using this obj we can call show
simple now there is one more advantage
of using interface even if you have
multiple interfaces like say we have one
more interface which is PQR and this pig
here we are defining a method let's say
method ABC or not ABC let's say XYZ so
we have some methods here we can use XYZ
here also which is multiple inheritance
right so let me remove that part okay so
we have interface ABC and we have a
class which is a B simple which
implements ABC let's run this code just
to check if it's working or not let me
run this code and you can see it's
planes in show so that's one way you can
create an object of an interface or you
can instantiate an interface
we have to create a class which
implements interface and we can just
create the object now what if we have
let's say we have do we have any other
way of doing this the thing is the the
sole purpose of this class is just to
implement ABC or just to implement the
interface other than that we are we are
we are not going to use this class in
any of the example so what we can do is
we can just remove this class but will
it work now since I don't have a class I
cannot instantiate this right so let's
go back to this can i you can i
instantiate now of course not because
ABC doesn't have interment have the
implementation now there are two ways of
creating any creating an object one way
is called as what you say invention and
the second way is called as discovery
now always imagine throwing things
around you so let's talk about a mobile
phone so it is mobile phone it's an
invention right so it's an object which
is created from a class so someone have
thought about a mobile phone he has
implemented a concept on that concept we
have an object so that means we have
first created the class of a while and
then we are getting object what about
laptop the same case right we have to
first create a class for laptop and then
we couldn't create an object but let's
say you are talking about this dinosaurs
skeleton or different animals so this
animals are not created by humans they
are already present we are discarding
them right so we are creating new
objects but not by inventing them by
discarding them in the same way this ABC
initially when you create a class we
always create a class and then create an
object but in this scenario I will not
create a class first I will create an
object and then I will provide the
implementation for this class so this is
like first creating the object and then
providing the implementation so that is
touch for
means discovering okay these are not
official terms don't take this terms to
your college or to your school just for
my reference so let's create the
implementation so imagine this block
here is the class okay so whenever you
provide the implementation it becomes a
class right now this class doesn't have
a name and that's why this type of
classes are called as anonymous classes
now let let's provide the implementation
so we will say public void show okay so
we have provided the implementation here
let me just give a proper brackets and
in this I will print let lets say in
show clear so you can see I am NOT
implementing any class
okay just we are creating an interface
and then directly we are generating it
by using anonymous inner class so we can
provide our definition here and let's
run this code now and you can see it
prints in show clear now so if you are
familiar with Java versions so we have
different versions of Java right we have
Java 1.2 1.3 1.4 and this goes on the
current version of Java while I'm making
this video is our 1.8 add in Java 1.8 we
have a very special feature now just to
demonstrate that feature let me do some
let me explain you something about types
of interfaces so basically we have three
types of interfaces the first one our
first type is called as marker interface
what is marker interface it's an
interface without any methods it's a
blank interface again was the user mark
interface you can see in the next video
next we have is what you say single or
in charge is called as Sam which stands
for single abstract method okay which is
Sam in which you'll be having only one
method and then we have normal interface
which is every interface normal
interface right but
what makes that makes them special is if
you have only one method it is called as
Sam which is this interface here and if
you don't have any method it will be
called as mark interferes but in Java
1.8 this Sam interface is also called as
functional interface okay so this
interface or the Sam interface is also
for this function interface in Java 1.8
now the advantage of Java 1.8 or the
function interface is just have a look
at this code now now whenever the aisle
right
ABC obj so for sure right hand side will
be new ABC right let's let me do an
example let's say I have a class called
as a okay so my class name is a and if I
ask you to create or instance of a what
you will do you will say a obj equal to
what of course you will say new a right
because that's the that's very common
whenever you have a class named as a the
constructor will be also a in the same
way if we have an interface which is ABC
on the right hand side will be having
new ABC right so this code is what you
say extra code right now in the same way
what about this line public void show
when you have only one method in your
interface so for sure whatever you write
here will be that show method so from
here to this point everything at this
point from new ABC to public void show
everything is extra code or also called
as boilerplate code which is extra code
right let's remove this part now since
we are removing one curly braces we have
to remove this one also what we had to
mention something else bracket here okay
let me just do the undo so we we need
this bracket we don't require show
because any case you might send some
parameters so when you require this
brackets now we need to mention this
code here belongs to a method right and
that's why we have to use an arrow
symbol so this part here is called as
lambda expression so lambda expression
was introduced in Java one point a
eight so if you are if you if you have
1.7 y in your system this code will not
work and even if you though if you even
if you don't know this code it's okay
because most of the college's most of
the companies they are still working on
1.7 but maybe in next six months
everyone will shift to 1.8 so that's why
it is important for you to know it is
lambda expression in fact I have a
different very latest in my tutorial for
lambda expressions so you can just have
our look there now now the thing is if
you have only one block of statement we
don't require these curly brackets we
can remove this curly brackets even you
can remove the semicolon and we can
write everything in one line okay and
let me remove this extra part here
because so you can see we are defining a
whole interface let me just take it down
so that you can see in one page so we
are creating an interface we are
creating the instance of interface and
then we are calling the object or method
if we run this code now okay I into it
let me run this so you can see the
output is in show and that's the power
of a Java 8 which is functional
interfaces so I hope you got the idea so
that's how you need to use interfaces in
Java interface also extra interface so
let's say you have one my interface here
which is interface XYZ okay and this
interface we can extend it with
interface ABC so whenever you have class
to class we use extends we have class to
interface we use implements and
interface to interface we use X chains
if you have one more interface let's say
interface into phase yyy and you can
even say comma yyy so interface actually
supports multiple inheritance simple so
that's how we need to use interfaces in
Java so thanks for watching and do
