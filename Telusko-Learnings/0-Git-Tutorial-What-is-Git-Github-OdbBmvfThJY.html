programming all if we joined a company
recently you might have heard about this
temple is gate and in fact from last
three to four years everyone is talking
about this kit what exactly it is and
why people is using it and how can we
use it so I will try to answer all those
questions in this particular video so
welcome back
aliens my name is Ivan ready and let's
get started now git is created by Lena
star world you guessed it right is the
same guy who has created Linux kernel
now why he created another another
technology called as get so what happens
you know when you talk about Linux
kernel it's open source right and anyone
can contribute so if you are living in
any way in the world you can contribute
to the Linux kernel now what you can do
you can you can download the copy of
enough Cardinale
you can add your own features and you
can submit it there okay they will not
accept your request by default but you
have to provide some new features the
important thing is you can be a
contributor to Linux kernel okay
so in this world we have millions of
programmers right if everyone is trying
to work on one software how they can
manage it is it that easy to manage no
it's damn difficult trust me even if you
have five people working in a project it
will be difficult for you to manage that
project so what he came up with the
concept called as gate Anton Pinkett it
handles all those things of merging of
different
I mean merging of different source code
from different people and maintaining
versions so those those things are
provided by gate so let's try to
understand how it works and what is gay
now git is actually a distributed
version control system heavy words right
so let's try to understand those words
here now what happens is we have a
concept of SCM now it's not only forget
the positives there from a long time now
I'm not talking about supply chain
management here now SCM has lots of full
form now this the the full form which we
have to see here is called as software
configuration management or you can also
use one local form there which is called
as source code management now what
happens you know let's let's try to
understand this let's say if you are
working on a project right so if you are
alone working on a project now at this
point you will write some code right and
of course when you get a requirement
from someone you don't get the exact
requirement what you get is the what you
say a high level requirements what you
will do is you will try to make a
product a small product which is also
called as a minimum value a product
which is MVP now you will make a product
which is not which will not have all the
features and then you thought okay this
is working you've got your first body
what you say the first working software
after some time you after some days you
felt okay let's have some more features
now what you are doing you are changing
the same project and you're adding new
features now okay now after adding new
features you realize you know this new
features don't are not working properly
now what you will do you have to remove
all the features right or maybe you when
you when you should show this product to
your client your client says okay with
this new features are not that good for
us
so what you thought okay let's remove
the let's remove all those features so
from the first product you have added
some new features and now you have
removed the prod remove the features now
it's after some time your client says
hey you know those features which you
have showed on that day dielectric is
awesome now we want those features as
well now what he will do he will again
write the same code right but luckily if
you have a backup normally we use
Dropbox for the backup right so what you
will do you will go to the Dropbox they
will copy that code and you will push it
again but don't you think you are doing
lots of work and that too let's say you
are done with that after some days you
have added some more features you have
removed some features and after doing
all those things you realize you know
the last version was better so what we
normally do is to maintain all this
version system we have a concept of
version control example so let's say
when you released your first product
that will be a snapshot version after
some time you thought okay this is the
final version which you're going for so
that will be 1.0 then after some time
you will be saying 1.1 1.2 1.3 and it
say now you're working on 2.0 now what
if you want the older project which is
1.2 is it possible so what we now I do
is on Dropbox or maybe in your hard
drive we will create multiple folders
right which will have the backup of your
project so you will name this photo like
this it will be
having 1.1 1.2 1.3 then 2.0 just imagine
if you are if you are the you have to
handle all these projects and have to
remember bridge project has which
features right you have to cater file
there may be a readme file or text file
where you will write everything so why
you have to manage all those things you
have a powerful tool here on the system
which we do it for you and that is your
version control systems okay now we can
use any version control system right we
can use we can use subversion we can use
gate then why we're using gate when you
have subversion it's because earlier
people used to work with centralized
version systems and now they use
distributed version systems okay what it
means so if you talk about centralized
one you will be having multiple
computers or maybe you will be having
one computer and you will be having one
server so all your versions will be
stored on this server so this is your
machine you know your porn machine and
this is our so what you will do every
time you write a code here and if you
add new features the previous version
will be stored on on this server right
this is centralized system now what's
the topic of this so drawback is you
have a working copy that is perfectly
fine but the version are maintained here
right what if this server what if this
hour fails what if you lose all your
data from this server
it may happen right we are living in a
world of hiker side if anything is
possible
what if you are travelling somewhere and
you don't have internet connection maybe
you are on a flight or maybe you are
somewhere in a remote place where you
don't have an internet connection how
can you get this weather how can you get
the repository but that's a new term
right there positi is a place where you
will have all your codes or you can
imagine a folder and so right so if
there is no network connection there
will be an issue and there's a single
point of failure if you if this sort of
fails you will lose everything so what
if if you have multiple machines
normally what happens is you if you are
working for a company every computer
every project data will be stored on one
server what if everyone can have their
own copy right so we can create a copy
of itself so we can have
copy so we'll be having a working copy
and we will be having something called
as a local depository
so this is your local repository on the
server we'll be having a remote
repository now the advantage you have is
even if your server fails that's fine
you have a local copy right and you can
literally your local copy to the server
next time if your server fails now this
time what we are doing is every machine
or every developer has their own copy so
this is called as distributed so we are
distributing the repository so every
machine will they have their own local
repository now even if you're in flight
or maybe if you're in some remote place
if you don't have an internet connection
that's fine you can work on your project
and you can create different versions in
your local repository and when you look
at the interconnection just push it on
the server that will be awesome right
and that is your distributed version
control system so initially people used
to work with centralized and now okay
now does that mean we should only use
distributed we should not use
centralized see both have their merits
and demerits let's not talk about that
here but if you talk about get get is
actually a distributed version control
system okay so the first one distributed
which means everyone will have their own
copy which will have which will have a
local repository and version control
means it will do the version control for
you okay is get that super get is like a
Superman who will do everything for you
not exactly because you have to as a
programmer you have to control that okay
it will help you to do that but you have
to mention you have to use some commas
like commit or push so why are you doing
that it will maintain those versions
okay so that's how it works
but then what extra features it provides
now there's also a concept called as
trunk based development I don't know if
you have heard about this before but we
have a concept of trunk based
development what it means let's say if
you are working on a project or maybe if
I am working on a project maybe an
Android project and that project is
buried so it is it is it is in
development from a long time and the
current version which you are working is
let's say four point seven and four
point seven is a stable voyage and
everything is perfect or not
is perfect in this world we have we
don't have any software which is bug
plea right so there will be some all
other birds available in my system in my
software then that which is 104.7 and
now we are working in a very new feature
and that feature when it is added to the
project it will be 5.0 right that's a
major version now if you're working on
5.0 and let's say if some some of the
users say it is a bug in yours in your
current version which is 4.7 now what
you will do will you work on 5 I mean
you're working on 5.0 right you don't
have a whole project now can you work on
two projects simultaneously and it's
possible what we do is if you are
working on kid let's say if you have a
project here we feel working on gate and
let's say if you are doing some work by
default you will be having something
less branch and that branch will be
called as a master branch ok so let's
say this is your 4.7 version and you are
working here after some changes you have
done the commit that means you are
pushing your data to the look to the
repository maybe local or remote after
some changes again you are doing commit
after some changes you are doing some
commit now it is commit commit simply
means save again we'll talk about commit
in detail later this is a difference
between commit and save but just imagine
we have we are committing it now if you
are coming from SQL background you know
what is copied right so yeah so we have
we are saying a commit here but let's
say this is your 4.7 version and now if
you are working on 5.0 if you are
working on 5.0 on the same branch what
will happen is you lose the original
project ok so the best one would be
don't work on the same branch if you are
walking on 5.0 what you can do is you
can just create another branch that is
possible you can create another branch
which will which will name it as let's
say new branch ok so it's a new branch
and all this branch you can have your
5.0 so you are coding for 5.0 and after
some time if you feel everything is
perfect and by the time you're working
on 5.0 you can still continue what was
work worked with 4.7 now this is your
master this is the actual one this is
your new bra
and the moment you feel you know 5.0 is
perfectly working what you can do is you
can push or you can send you can merge
your you can merge your changes from
this branch to the master branch as very
easily possible right so that's how you
work with this system so we have we have
a point set of trunk base development
right we are creating branches to make
it work
now what else so this is your trunk
based development but in Cochella is how
will you implement all these things we
can get up a local copy right so we can
download get for free or it is free
first of all it is free and open source
or you can download the gate from the
internet if you are using Mac prominence
you already have get there but if you're
using Linux you can install git as you
as we normally install other software's
we're using package manager or if you're
using Windows we have gate patch again I
will show you those steps in the in the
coming videos but then kahshanna is how
we don't get the emote version can I
create my own remote repository that is
possible right you can buy our server
you can add your get service there but
do we have to really buy those services
we don't have to actually we have two
different webs in fact we have multiple
implementations one of them is get up or
we can use bitbucket we also have some
GUI tools to work with them like we have
so straight we have or we have different
softwares I will talk about that once we
start with the series so I'll be using
DITA for the implementation here but you
can also try your luck on get bitbucket
right so their difference offers I will
able oh yes so what else so this is the
basics of gate and we'll talk about the
lots of features in the coming videos so
I hope you enjoyed this session or more
videos along the way thanks for watching
