ready from tellus for learnings and in
this video we'll talk about Java
database connectivity so once we have
seen the theory of it now this time
we'll talk about the practical
implementation so if you have not seen
my three topics just search for Java
database connectivity Theory theory by
telesco okay that's my channel name so
if you search for this on YouTube you
will see my theory video so it's not
compulsory to see that video is just
once you see that with you you will you
will get a better understanding of how
to work with how to work with JDBC so
let's make a quick recap recap what we
have done so whenever you work with JDBC
you have to follow seven steps right if
you follow the seven steps it is very
easy for you to connect your java
application with database and you can
fetch whatever you want one use you want
you can insert values you can fetch
values you can modify values you can do
all those stuff right so the first step
here is to import the package the second
step will be to load and register
drivers so that is register the driver
right and the third step you have to do
is we have to create a connection so we
have to create a connection and then the
fourth step is you have to create let's
create a statement the fifth step will
be you have to execute the query okay
and then the sixth step will be you have
to process the results okay which is
this and the last step here is it's your
clothes okay this is not the exact seven
steps you can actually modify this for
your requirement so this is what we do
when we want to do connect with database
right we have to write these seven steps
now which state which package to input
so the package name is Java dot SQL
package next is whenever you work with
JDBC so we have four types of drivers
and JDBC okay and we need to want we
need to load one of the driver so let's
say if you are walking with
miss access so you have to work with je
a Java JDBC one driver or JDBC type one
driver which is JDBC ODBC bridge the
problem is with the advance of the new
new version of Java doesn't support or
DBC so now we cannot use ODBC feature
using Java 7 or Java 8 so we need to go
with the specific type of drivers for
the specific type of DBMS so let's say
if you are working with Oracle we need
to go with Oracle driver so if you're
working with mask you'll you have to go
with MySQL driver in this example we try
to connect our java application with
mask UL so for that we need to use mask
your driver now how to connect mask ula
was so first you have to load the driver
so the driver is comm dot mask ul
JDBC dot driver so we need to load this
class flash driver which belongs to a
package which is comm dot masculine EBC
but the problem is it is not dead in
your system by default ok you will not
find this in your Eclipse by default if
you are using NetBeans well then good we
have this driver inbuilt but if you are
using Eclipse you have it download this
this thing from the internet you had
just have to go to and you have to
search for mask you'll connect our jar
so you have to search for this statement
mask you'll connect a jar and the best
place to download anything is mavin
repository so if you don't know about
mavin mavin is just a global repository
where you have you will have all the
libraries available doesn't matter with
Java framework you walk with you have
library there ok so just go to mask UL
connector go to maven and search for
mysql connector you can select any
version which unselecting five point one
point three eight which is released in
december 2015 and that's ok for us if
you click on this version you can
actually use dependency if you if you're
familiar with Navin if you are not then
it's ok we can use mask you'll JDBC type
for driver ok and we can just click on
download here and you can see it is
getting downloaded so we have a file of
approx
a 1mb okay now let's go back to eclipse
so we need to load this driver okay so
we have to load a relational driver so
whenever you work with external Java
files we need to add that jar file here
okay so you can see I've already added
that let me show you how to disturb -
how to add that just right click on your
project and go to build path configure
build path here let me remove this and I
will show you how to add it once again
just click on add external jar and so I
have that file in my downloads folder
okay so that's downloads and you can
select this file here and click on open
so you can see we got our a jar file
here and click on OK so once you have
imported that file wait to load and
register how to do that we'll see then
we have to create connection objects so
we have to create the object of
connection interface and then we need to
create object of statement interface
then we have to execute the query and
then we have to process the results
again then we have to close the
connection so let's talk the first step
the first step is you have to import the
package right now which package to input
so this is let me write this the first
line itself so we write here the import
statement which is import Java dot SQL
dot star because we want all the
interfaces and classes so that is the
first step the second step would be you
have to load and race your driver
now when you say load and register what
we do here is we have to use something
called as class dot for name so class
dot for name so this for them is a
method which will help you to load the
class you just have to mention the class
name ok the class name here is driver ok
once you specify driver this class dot
for name is responsible to load the
driver for you you just need to make
sure that you are throwing the exception
you because this Ford name method will
itself it will throw the checked
exception so you have to do here those
exceptional you can either we can also
use to I catch now the problem is this
driver what we need to also specify the
packages for this because we to provide
the qualified name so we have to say
this is comm dot mask you are Gary B C
dot driver so we need to mention the
qualified name okay if you want to if
you want to understand exactly how this
class dot Fortnum works so I have a
video on that just search for class for
name telesco okay so make sure anyway
search funny topic just mentioned that
is for there okay so that you will get
my video oh it's very difficult to
explain each and every topic in one
video how that exactly was what's
important is whenever you work with a
jdbc you have to use fourth name ok time
to just remember that if you are so if
you are curious about that I searched
for this video you will understand how
class recording works not just for JDBC
betwee you can use class dirt for new
for multiple things ok but the next step
is you have to create the connection
object right so for that way to say
connection con right so going to also
import the package for this or we have
already done that we have say we have
said starred right but the problem is if
I go to connection it said interface you
can see it's an interface the problem is
you cannot create object of interface
directly right so we need to search for
a class which implements connection all
we need to search for a method which
will give you the instance of connection
ok let me repeat you need to search for
the method which will give you the
instance of connection and luckily we
have a method palace gate connection so
gate connection is a method in Java
which will give you the instance of
connection now this gate connection is a
method of a class College Java manager
okay so drama is the class in which you
have on
Methos get connection which is the
static method okay so if you go to
driver manager you can see it belongs
the same package which you are working
with with java or SQL and in this
package or in this class driver manager
we have lots of classes available right
and one of the classes which we want to
use here is get connection because this
get connection method is a static method
which returns the which returns the
instance of connection right that's what
we want here so to achieve that a way to
pass three parameters as you can see
here so we need to pass the URL we need
to pass the okay that's not the method
we want to work with we want to work
with the other type of get connections
yeah so this is the gate connection
method you want to walk with we have to
pass the URL we need to pass username
and password right so just go back to
our class here you have to mention three
things the first thing is the URL so
what we'll do in this main function
itself let me create a string and we'll
name that as URL so that's the first
thing we need to send the second thing
is the username so we'll say this is you
name okay and the third string main to
pass the password okay now what is the
username here so let me start with
username it is for my system it is root
and I have not specified any password
here okay so I will keep it blank and
the URL is so you need to mention a
thing which is your database name but
hold on we don't have database yet so
before creating a database let's mention
URL you name and we - pass pass okay
that's the password you can see there is
no problem now so it says draw manage or
gate connection but for that way to
first create a database so for database
we can use any type of DBMS you can work
with Oracle you can work with mask
you'll you can work with MS access you
can work with any type of DBMS you like
okay so for this example I am taking
mask you'll so first step you have to
install mask you'll just go to
again and search for masks you'll
download or mask you'll serve er it will
take you to the official website of
masks you'll just make sure you download
the mask you'll from here okay and the
problem is when you work with masks you
lits a command line interface you have
to execute everything using command line
that will be no that will not be that
flexible right so what you can do is you
can use a GUI for it which is mask
you'll mask you'll workbench so just go
to google and again search for MySQL
workbench ok workbench so this is a GUI
tool where you can work with database
creation table creation all those stuff
okay so I have already done that I have
installed mask ul in my system so if you
want to learn about a mask you'll our
SQL stuff just again go to my channel
search for okay search for MySQL
tutorial telesco okay so just to give
you a tool to my channel so just go to
youtube and search for telesco learnings
okay so that's my channel name so if you
go to my channel i have lots of
playlists okay so you can learn
everything here so he can learn about a
java tutorial you can learn about
android you can learn about java eight
new features you can learn about design
patterns c programming oops concept you
can also not about map in here and the
most important thing for this is you can
learn always wears masks oh it should be
somewhere here so let me search for it
yeah so you can see we have a mask
you'll to toriel here so you can just go
to this playlist and you can watch all
this video to understand how mask you'll
work okay and after this you can learn
lots of things here how to use eclipse
and you can learn about EJB GUI stuff
all the stuff here okay yeah so just
search for masks well tutorial and you
will understand how to use workbench
again let's get back to work bench now
and here we need to create a table
in fact I have already created table
here with student occasional wasting of
time abdicated a table with student so I
first if I say select star from student
I think I'll be already having some data
because I have taken this session for a
batch okay we have only one record which
is one Vani so it means that some values
here so we'll say insert into oh okay
what's the table name its student then
we say values so we to specify the first
thing let's say it is a user ID - and
we'll insert our name as Naveen okay
that's the first thing let's run this
code okay now we have the second record
let's enter one more so let's say three
which is Mahesh and if I run this code
we got three rows now so if I don't this
code okay so we have three rows what
we'll do in this code is will will will
give the value and we'll try to face the
name okay and the query for that will be
it is select we need to fetch the
username so user name from student where
user ID ok user ID is equal to three
right in file in this code regard Mahesh
right so that's what we want to do in
Java so oh so we first we have to
mention the database name the database
name here is alien so you can see we
have we are walking with a dub database
which is aliens here right and okay but
the problem is masculine ormally walks
with okay so when talk about the URL
patterns or URL we have to specify JDBC
: MySQL : aliens so that's the composite
things because it specifies that you are
walking with Jeri BC and the DBMS you
are walking with is masculine and inside
masculine have aliens but mask you'll is
a server level organ is a land land type
of DBMS where you can have the database
on other machine you can access with
other machine so wheat also specify the
IP address here since it is then in the
local machine I will say localhost
we need to also mention the port number
so I am using a port number which is 3 3
0 7 if you are installing masks you'll
for the first time the port number will
be getting is 3 3 0 6 ok so you might be
having a port number which is 3 3 0 6 ok
so make sure you you know the port
number now once we have done with the
creating creation of the connection now
let's go to the next step which is here
we need to create a statement which is
very easy now so you just have to say
statement ok we'll say st equals u now
in order to create object of statement
you just have to say con dot create
statement even this statement is an
interface also we have to use create
statement method because this create
statement returns the object of
statement right
and now if I done with the statement now
we have to actually execute the query
so before executing let's straight the
query here itself so in double quotes
we'll mention the query so let's copy
the query in the from the mask you'll
which we have already typed and let's
paste it here so that's the query we
have right so we want to fetch the name
of the user with roll number or with
user ID 3 now how to execute the query
it's very simple just say st dot execute
query and then you have to pass the
query here now whenever you execute this
query let's execute this query here in
mask you also you can say we are getting
a data so what data you are able to see
is it just Mahesh and there says no
right we are not just able to see Mahesh
we are also saying this user name as the
as the label right so this thing will
return you not just Mahesh it will give
you the whole table not exactly the
whole table but it will give you Mahesh
in the table structure so way to store
that thing in result set because result
set has the power to store chunk of data
and tabular structure okay so in this RS
you have your data now now how to fetch
the data it is very simple we can store
the data somewhere so we say string or
name this is where you want to store
data so we'll say RS dot get string and
you have to mention the column number
so let's say if you are fetching
multiple columns so you have to mention
the column number or you can also
mention the column name by in double
quotes just right username so we want a
data with the column name username okay
you can have multiple columns side so
you have to be very specific which data
you want that's why you have to mention
username there okay we can also mention
the number so let's say you can mention
one you can mention two or you can
mention the column number right so
that's it if I if I try to print this
value which is named okay it should work
now and it should print Mahesh if it
doesn't print Mahesh then there is some
problem with the code so let's try
before that let's do the last step which
is closing stuff right so we have done
with the processing let us close it how
to close very simple it's first you have
to close the statement so you have to
say st dot close and then we have to get
we have to close the connection also
we'll say connection dot close let us
run this code and boom they got the
error the error is before start of
result set it's because whenever you run
the query by default even see the
pointer here right like so this pointer
by default this pointer will be before
Mahesh okay so way to do you know in
order to fetch the value you have to say
are s dot next so RS dot next will take
your pointer to the next record and this
time you can actually fetch my edge
so before fetching the value we just
have to say our s dot next because this
is responsible to take you to the next
element okay so that's how you use JDBC
steps okay now we can do some more stuff
here we can insert the values in fact we
can also fetch the whole table not just
one record we can fetch the whole table
and we can also insert some values and
in the next video we'll talk about how
to insert values and how to fetch the
whole table so I hope you liked this
video so thanks so much for watching and
and and before going off let me ask you
a question it's just I have this habit
of asking questions
so the question
for this session is a who is the founder
of Apple
okay so Apple Inc so you have to tell me
the founder of Apple just use the
comment section to answer the question
so thank you so much for watching and do
