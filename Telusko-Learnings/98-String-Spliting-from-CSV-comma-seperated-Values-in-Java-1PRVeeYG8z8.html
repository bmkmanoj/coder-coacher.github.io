- in this tutorials we'll talk about
string splitting now now let's say we
have a main function in this I have a
CSV file CSV file means which is comma
separated values and those files will be
having lots of data and all those values
are submitted with commas so what I mean
is let's have a string called as STR and
the value for this STR us let's say
values are under beam then it's
separated with a comma then same Mahesh
a comma and then Rahul a comma and then
let's say Vijay I have these four values
and all those four values are separated
with commas now what I want I want to
bring those values but one value at a
time let's say I want to print Naveen
then I have to put into my age I have to
put in Rahul or Vijay I just have to
print Rahul then when this scenario
let's say I want to print if I print STR
it will print the whole string example
if I done this just roll down
now now if I run this you can see here
it's and the output will be it will
print the whole string which is now in
my age Rahul and Vijay what I want to
print I just want to print this part
which is Rahul so what we can do is we
can just simply go we can use a method
in string called a split now this plate
will do is it will ask you for other tax
which means are on which using which
which character you want to split I want
to specify the character be able to
split is using comma
okay now this split method will split
your string whether when you see a comma
it will it will create a new string that
means this now will be one string this
may actually be 2nd string this bow will
be the third string and visibly 4 string
that means we are getting an array of a
string you are here so what we can do we
can just create a can say names adding
okay so this this split will create an
array and then you can print it now how
to print or just go here and say I want
Rahul that means I want to print only
this second index
this is index number 0 and if some of
our index number 2 right now on this
code it will print only down that's the
advantage right so we can we can use
this method called as split to split
you're adding in fact if you want to put
into all the values we can again use
something called as enhanced for loop
where we can use string let's say Val in
names and then we can simply print here
your valve now it will print all the
names starting with Naveen Mahesh Rahul
and Vijay again you are getting some
space here is because we have mentioned
a space okay so what you do know to just
remove this comma it will play in the
remaining part and I saw you can split a
string again a point to be noted here
your string STR is immutable okay you
cannot you cannot change the values
again immutable does not means you
cannot specify a new value here I can
simply say it is STR equal to hello we
can say that
right but it will create a new set of
new value in your string pool okay
though
again if you know about mutability and
immutability mutability is achieved with
using string buffer immutability is your
string class okay so this is how we can
split a string that's for this video if
you do thank thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
