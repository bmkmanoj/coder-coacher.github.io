take input from or we'll take our value
which is I and we'll assign our digit to
this I so it may be from 0 to 9 so if
you assign a value 0 so we want the
output as so if I say if I try to print
the value of I so it should not be 0 in
numbers it should be 0 in words so it
will be a void 0 okay
so if I value is 0 it should be 0 if if
I type here 1 so it should print I need
a one more straight one more printf it
should it should print 1 if the value is
2 so it should print 2 and it goes on
right so you got the point what we need
to do here so what if my back I value is
5 so it should print 5 so for this what
we can do is we can write this statement
or we can write 10 statements timing
will focus only on 4 statements with
because it will waste our time by
writing those 10 statements so we talked
about from maybe from 0 to 5 or 0 to 4
so we'll count 5 numbers we'll take five
numbers so let's copy paste and paste so
this is 2 this is 3 and this is 4 so
let's take this number if my value is 4
it will print for this not this word for
but how to do that so to print 8 we need
to first check so how to check so we
have to say if if my value is equal to
equal to 0 if this is the case I want to
print 0 else if if my value is equal to
equal to 1 then I will print 1 I will
print 1 but you will say where is the
curly brackets there we need to mention
the curly brackets why so we will use
this open and closed brackets the
amazing thing is in if if you have only
one statement we don't require those
curly brackets if we have more than one
statement then we require those curly
brackets so even if you give those cuts
back at 0 it will work but if you don't
give it still it will work so why to
waste our line by writing those
cut the packets okay now for this will
again use as if and I equal to equal to
two and then this goes on right so we
have to write the four so instead of
that what we can do is now Java provides
you one more feature which seemed which
which is called as session of using if s
we can use switch now switch is you know
it works best when you have this type of
syntax when you want to print something
given up on the value so what we can
pass in the expression so this is the
syntax for spelling that sorry switch
and that's why I love Xcode just type
switch it will give you the basic syntax
this is not possible in turbo C++ or
most of the IDE s so if you're the Mac
users you should use Xcode for C
programming or maybe for learning people
don't recommend this type of ideas but I
believe you should be exposed to ideas I
did at the start only so that's how you
create a switch case so how to write
switch case will right from the start
will not take help of this so we say
switch and switch you have to pass the
variable you want to check and then you
have to define some cases so if your
case is zero that means if your case is
zero we'll print this statement here and
then if your case is one will print will
print one and if your case is two will
print two and then let me remove this
code just to make it simple and if your
case is three will go for max three
right you take four and then we'll say
this is three okay and we'll give a
printf here so if your values if your
values - and if I done this it should
print - right so let's see if I run this
and I won't / and after every line
so that it will show in the new line and
now if I run this it says to so it's not
printing 0 it's not printing 1 it's
printing - it's also printing 3y it's
printing 3 the thing is whenever you use
cases after every case we need to say
break so that it will break this which I
it will go to the next thing it will not
continue with the statement so after
every case we need to mention break so
what is break break is basically used to
break the current statement or current
block okay and here also we need to
mention break now if you mentioned break
here and if you run this code you will
be getting only 2 not 3 because as soon
as your case satisfies EO it will print
2 and it will break so it once you say
break it will comes out of this switch
statement clear so that's how you use
switch but let's say if you have the
value which is let's say 6 now 6 is not
a part of this cases right and if you
run this it will not execute the switch
block and so it will print a thing but I
want to bring something I want to print
not a valid number something in that way
so we can use something but it's default
so this is same like what you say else
in if-else default and will write printf
and we can write not a valid number and
you fire on this code it will print not
a valid number simple so that's how you
use switch statement in C programming so
