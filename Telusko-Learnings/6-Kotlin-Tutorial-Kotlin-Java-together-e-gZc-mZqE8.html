mentioned that Java and cart Lane is
interoperable which means you can call a
Java code from car cleaner you can call
codling code from Java but is it really
possible because we have never seen this
before right in fact I don't know if you
know about this concept but then you can
call a C functions using Java you have
to call you can call a job functions
using C programming but that can be done
with the help of some interface in
between you know we have to use j'ni if
you know if you don't know about it it
is called as Java native interface so
there are so we have to use some layer
in between if you are working with
different languages but what about
cotton and Java do we need to add
something in between what if I say you
don't have to do that it will directly
work with each other so just to explain
that what I will do is I will just
remove all this extra code from here
let's ignore that alien class for time
lien I will create another class in fact
I will delete this class from here
because I don't want this alien class
anymore so I will be making the same
class using Java code now so let me just
click this file here and did it so I'm
placing that agent class right now what
I will do is I will create a Java code
and I will say new and you can see that
this is a cotton lint project but we
have a Java option there so if I click
on Java plus let's create a class called
as alien ok click on OK
now if you if you know Java B what we do
is we create a class we got a class here
and inside this class let's see if I
want or variable again we'll go for only
one variable just for the example here
and the very one I want is private
private string name so this is a
variable I want right now once the god
this variable
I also need getters and setters because
that's how you work in Java so I will
write like this and I will say generate
where is that generate a it's here
generate get on setters for this
variable and we got that so you can see
we got generate or regard getters and
setters as well now the question arise
this is a codling code so on the
left-hand side which the file we have
here that's a part line code and this
file we have on the right-hand side
our code you can also see the exchange
and this is Java this is dot Katie
question arise can I create object of
alien here and the answer is yes
how in the same way the way you create
object of cuddling class you simply say
where you say let's go for different
alien now this time we'll go for a
Naveen I just have a nickname there
let's go let's go for the disco and we
say equal to we can simply say alien and
that's it you've got an object now it's
that easy to work with the Java and
coordinate but then can you assign the
values now we got the object can you
assign the values now if you remember in
Java if you want to assign the value for
this name the only way is to use getters
and setters right you have to use set
name to set the value and you have to
use get name to get the values same
example I would say telesco dot set name
equal to a set name indicate you can
mention Naveen and you can say that is
co dot get name it will give you Naveen
but in case of Kotlin what you have to
do is you just have to say it
telesco dot you don't have to say get
name or set name here you can simply say
name if you say name equal to that means
you're assigning the value it will call
set name by default let's try this I
know this is awesome right so you can
say Naveen and we have assigned the
value let's verify how do I verify I
will simply save print Ln and it will
spring the value of this now how do I
fetch a value I can simply say that is
co dot R is don't its dot and I will say
name so it will give me name and if I
let's verify by running this code and if
I run this code okay we can see we got
the output as Naveen that means we can
directly assign the values with the L
talk equal to symbol and we can fetch
the value you don't have to call setters
and you don't have to call a gator
because code line will do that for you
in the backend
okay so this is the awesome thing about
Kotlin now you might be wondering what
happens behind the scene because you are
combining this code right so yes all
this files will be compiled and it will
be there in your in your code but then
in Java we get a class file right what
about coddling
Partin also gives you just classify
because it runs on Java platform
okay so let's verify so you can see we
got a Santa folder here in exactly we
have agent Java which is your Java file
and we got first code Getti which is
your which is your cotton code and if
you see the output here if I go to demo
you can see required class files for
alien also we got class file and for
first code also we got a class file just
to mention that this is this was from
cotton we also got Katie there right so
everything at the end gets converted
into byte code and that's what runs on
JVM right so there's a full proof that
your code runs on JVM right
so yeah so that's how you can assign the
values using so that's how you can
combine Kotlin and Java together so
that's it from this video we have talked
about Kotlin and java working together
with the help of aden Saito's so that's
it in the next video we'll talk about
something else so do subscribe and like
