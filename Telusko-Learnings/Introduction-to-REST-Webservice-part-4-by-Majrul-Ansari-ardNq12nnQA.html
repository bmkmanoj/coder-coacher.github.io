of the things that we needed to talk
about with regards to the initial
introduction that we had to do on web
services and the representational style
of their looking the same I didn't do
much of comparison with other
technologies I just bulleted those
points that okay we have soap and we
have others which did fill the gap over
a period of time but the focus was just
that we need to remember HTTP is the
protocol that will be used for
developing and consuming hours so
restful Web Services we don't use any
other protocol beyond HTTP we use the
various methods of HTTP protocol for
example get post and there are many
others but commonly we have identified
get post put and delete out of which
only get and post is what we actually
use in life projects you will not find
an example on a restful web service so
regularly found where they are also
using put and delete for learning
purpose we might do it but practically
speaking just keep your focus only or
get in post whenever you're developing
web services get and post a sufficient
for everything so they're only rare
cases where you might end up using put
and delete so we'll use the various
methods of HTTP protocol to develop and
consumer web services that's it in Java
as a technology which we use there are
many options we have for the learning
machine the API is and all the common
things that we are interested in so one
of the official API is that we can use
for developing web services and
consuming it's called as jax-rs the
restful service api for java and we can
use many alternatives also I can use
Spring Framework and there are many
other names that we can talk about so
this are two popular options that you
will find today available for the Java
developers to learn and use the standard
API provided spring has its own API
which provides us we can say
comparatively is jax-rs api powerful or
is the spring api powerful that can be
debated spring has its own set of
features for which it is actually so
popular but it provides very good
support for web services when i do a
comparison between this two I won't say
there's much to worry about so as a
developer Jaxx
is one of the most popularly a used API
in Java for developing and consuming web
services spring also yes it has a good
share in the market today and at the
same time spring provides full support
for jax-rs so the support for jax-rs is
formed in spring also so spring is one
of the framework which has been designed
in such a way that it doesn't mandates
that if you want to use spring you
should use my features only no it's not
like that
well so it supports all the standards
which are in place so I can write a code
in spring which is not using the
annotations of spring but it is using
the jax-rs annotations and the code will
successfully work in spring framework so
spring is called as a non-invasive
framework and this non-invasive Ness
means it doesn't lets you do that tight
coupling with the framework your code
can be written in a very neutral way so
spring is a very good choice for
developing web services today but apart
from spring what other options we have
as our end time we can use GRC we can
use many other frameworks over your cxf
and there are not many other needs
you might hear about Jersey a lot this
is a very popularly used to run time as
an alternative to spring primarily for
web services I am talking about I am NOT
saying that we are completely replacing
spring so for developing web services
gel see runtime can also be used very
commonly it's a production ready and I
have seen in many applications people
are using this happily see except for
mapache
and many other names over here also net
but this is some of the ones which we
can remember for the time thing all
right so I would like to end my
discussion over here thank you so much I
hope you got something out of this
session hope to see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
