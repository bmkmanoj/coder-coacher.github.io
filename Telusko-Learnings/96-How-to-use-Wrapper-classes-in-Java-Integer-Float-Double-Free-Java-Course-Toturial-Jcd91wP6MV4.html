took in this tutorial we'll talk about
something called as rapper pluses now
what what exactly Weber classes are now
when we talk about a C language C is pop
right it's procedure oriented
programming C++ is partially oops and
Java is purely object oriented right so
when you say POV object-oriented it
should be 100% no when you talk about
java language java is 99.99% object
oriented now question arise when it does
0 0 0.01 percent and that's goes for
something called as primitive data type
now when you create any variables right
when you create a variable like think
variable so now if you talk about int
variable then we will talk about float
variable now all these primitive types
they are derived they are derived from C
language right so C is pop it will
follow pop in Java
what you need is everything should be an
object right so when you create a
variable also it should be object when
you create a int variable which should
be object when you create a create a
float variable it should be object but
unfortunately int when you create
variable as int I this is not an object
it's a variable or it's a primitive
variable we talk about dot F it will
again give you primitive primitive
values what we need we need to create
objects right so you should of writing
int we have a replacement of it and that
is called as pin teacher now this int is
primitive data type and integer is a
class so now when I create object of
integer in this way if I write if I like
int I equal to limit as n o p j io
bishop so we have integer i obj take way
too
it's new aunty Joe now in this this
thing is not a variable it's an object
right and what we need objects in if if
I want to store a value five so instead
of saving that value int I equal to five
what I can do is I can say I obj and we
can pass by here right so value of a
value in my obj will be fine
so this integer class is called as
wrapper classes okay so like integer we
have float class we have double class we
have tracked a glass we have pride class
we have class on all primitive types
okay so integer is a wrapper classes
over upper class so there is a concept
called as wrapping and unwrapping so
think about it let's suppose you have a
paint I variable is equal to five okay
so you need to convert you have to
convert this into I or that I which is a
variable to object so what I can do is I
can just pass are you so value of Phi
which is stored in I which will be pass
to I obj right so this then I am object
now this will come this will have a
value Phi right so this concept this
thing is called as wrapping so it is
traffic simple right then what is
unwrapping so taking a variable putting
it on in object it is first wrapping
taking out that variable from an object
is called as unwrapping simple right so
what I can do is I can say int J equal
to I want to take the value of J from
this object so what I can do is I can
say i obj so there is a method called as
in Val paint value in this plus so using
int value you can pick up that value now
J we have something called a spy I
simple right so this is how you can work
with wrapper classes so in the upper
classes we have
some classes may have integer classes we
have Fleur class double glass we have
white glass we have lots of classes
right
so all this class creates something
called a wrapper classes okay so
converting a variable into object
wrapping taking out the value from the
object unwrapping so this is called as
Bob classes you take you have the same
concept in C chakras boxing in an auto
boxing course with boxing unboxing right
so this is our this is what wrapper
classes are if you have any doubts
