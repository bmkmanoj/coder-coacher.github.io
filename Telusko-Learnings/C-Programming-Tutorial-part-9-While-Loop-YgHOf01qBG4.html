let me just remove all this code which
shall return the last tutorial to get CH
let me just remove this now what I will
do is let me just say I have I want to
print hello right a print hello we have
a function called a sprint F and this
will print hello and again it belongs to
header file a study IO dot H and before
printing hello I want to clear this
screen so it's a CLI C R and now let me
run this code and the output it's hello
right but let's say I want to print this
hello two times so what i will do i with
say slash and after hello and again a
printf and here it will be what will do
is will say hello again a slash in for a
new line and you can see we are further
on this code there is two hellos right
but let's say i want to put in this one
of five times I have to write this
statement for five times that means
again here printf printf and printf what
if I have to print this ten ten times so
output I have to play I have to type
this printf ten times that means if you
want to define this if you want to like
if you want to print any statement or if
you wanna execute a statement this
statement ten times you can use
something called as loop now the first
type of loop is while loop notice while
loop while loop says I will execute the
block till the condition is false that
means let's say if I let me define a
variable I and the initial value of this
I have to declare it here so int I equal
to one that means I'm shutting my value
from one I'm saying after every print
the value of I should increment so that
we can count the number of values and
this I should go till ten which means
the initial value of I will be one and
then it will check for the condition if
my I value is less than ten it will
execute the block
and then it will come out so initially
my value of I will be one and then here
it will become two then I get it will go
back from this from this curly braces it
will jump to this karla basis the
forceps for ten times and then it will
bring 10 hollow hellos let me on this
you can see we have ten Hallows no it
account it ten Hal with Stan Hallows now
let's let's run this in step-by-step
manner so you can press f7 so execution
starts from the main function then it
will jump to the declaration and
initialization then it will clear the
screen and then it will jump in a while
loop and the initial value of I will be
1 it will go to printf it will print
hello it will go to I plus plus the
value of I now becomes 2 it will go
again go up since the condition
satisfied it goes down up 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
now so once you cross 10 it will come
out and it will print the value for 10
times right and this is how are your
while loop works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
