ready and this is the start of a new
year and what we want is we want to
learn something new so enough of talking
about languages let's talk about
technologies now because if you know the
base technology you can build apps you
can solve different problems so let's
talk about those five top five
technologies you can learn in this year
so in no particular order let's start
with the first one and the first one is
i/o T which stands for intent of things
now the world is moving towards all the
devices should be Internet enabled
example your mobile phones your laptop's
your tablets they all are internet
enabled so they are communicating what
about your home household devices like
your AC your fridge your fan your tube
light all will be internet enabled in
future so they will be able to
communicate and nowadays we have this
smart fridge we have Smart TVs right so
those are part of IOT in future there
will be some more devices which will be
IOT now how it is helpful for developers
it's because if you are making a device
which is in debt enabled that means we
have to also build apps which can solve
user problems example if you have a
smart fridge and if you want to know
what are what are the things we which
are available in your fridge how will
you know let's say you are going to a
shop in mud and you don't know what
other things are there in your fridge
your fridge can communicate with you
through our mobile phone so on your
mobile phone you can see what are they
in the fridge right so that is your
internet enabled face so you have to
build the apps for your smart fridge the
second one I would go for is cloud
computing now cloud computing is there
for a long time right every company now
they are moving towards cloud so all the
software which we used to use on your
desktop machine now you can access the
same applications through cloud example
initially we used to work with these to
store data on the home drive and now vuv
store data on the Google Drive or be
stolen Dropbox not just storage it also
about the apps if you remember those
days innovators to be used to install MS
Office in the machine and now we don't
do that we either use Google Docs ODS we
use office 365 so everything is
happening on cloud now it's just it's
not just about consumer market it's also
about the enterprise market all
different companies they are moving to
cloud
in fact the their own solutions they are
moving towards cloud so the company well
I give to any given they are moving to
clouds and every employee of that
company is learning cloud so I am sure
if you want to be on top of this world
in this year you have to be good with
cloud service now that defense service
is available for cloud we have Google
service we have Amazon service so what
you can do is learn one technology learn
one web service and you will understand
everything else because they are not
that much different right if you know
how Amazon Web service work you can work
you can work on Google App Engine as
well with some new things if you know
Amazon Web Services you can learn open
shape you can also have Windows Azure or
Microsoft Azure because they have
renamed to Microsoft now and so those
all are awesome so learn first learn one
thing first and then you can you can
work on others as well now the third one
is Big Data
I just love Big Data you know I used to
always wonder how can I solve this
education problem because I feel
education should be should be
specialized or classified for different
people because what we have now is a
generalized education system where
everyone is learning our same way how
can I create a different solution for
different people and if I want to learn
about people I have to learn about data
right I want to know how they work and
if I collect all this data if I put it
somewhere that location will be called
as big data so big it is basically a
location where you have huge amount of
data and you don't know the company
which the apps which you are working
maybe if you are using some Google Apps
Facebook app Instagram app they all know
who you are and they all know about all
the billion users they have so they are
storing all this data somewhere right in
fact not just Facebook Google it's also
your bank's your colleges everyone being
tracking you so they know they know
about you and all this data is going in
somewhere now they will be analyzing
that data to generate some patterns so
that they can provide you good solutions
right and so that's why it is booming
nowadays and thanks to this amazing
computing power we are able to work with
big data we have these different
frameworks like Hadoop we have spark so
I would say Big Data is the another
another field you should be thinking
about
now next is one of my favorite which is
blockchain
in fact from from last three to four
months I'm deciding this thing which is
Bitcoin and blockchain and I started
researching about Bitcoin first and then
I realize it's not just Bitcoin what is
more interesting is blockchain because
big Bitcoin is just a hype nowadays you
know people are buying bitcoins and
that's why the price is going up but the
real technology is blockchain I am sure
in future every company will be using
blockchain for day use it's not just
only for the digital currency we have so
blockchain can be implemented for at
various look various location right so I
would say if you want to learn something
very new this year go for blockchain
last but not the least I can say this
the most important one in this year
which is AI which is artificial
intelligence the world is moving so fast
now everyone want to have their own a I
am right in fact even if you are using
mobile phone now doesn't matter is it
iOS is it Android or Windows they all
have that own AI assistance right
example for Apple we have Siri for
Google we have Google assistant and for
Windows we have partner right so we have
all this amazing app it's not just about
those assistants it's also about
software development
now what if I say in future so whatever
job we do example it as a tester b-baby
test as a developer we develop
application so everything will be done
by AI think about it the testing the
manual testing will be also done by AI
and it's quite possible so you just have
to train AI how to test an application
bypassing manual input and output that
AI will test the software development of
software can be also done by a I itself
so that's the future so don't don't stay
behind this market what if I say you can
learn AI and you can build AI solutions
which can build the software's right so
AI will be implemented everywhere in
fact nowadays we have we are using this
thing which is Google driverless cars
from Google same will be imprinted by
Tesla so they all are using AI and I
would say go for AI so again a I thanks
to this machine learning deep learning
concept AI get going on top now so I
would say start learning AI
now question eyes if you want to learn
all these technologies from where you
will learn and which one to select now
even I get confused sometimes you know
which one to select because I want to
learn everything the only problem is you
cannot be master of all because I
believe in one thing you should be jack
of all and math shock one now how can
you be jack of all you don't have to do
a particular course to understand them
completely what you can do is work so
let's say let's talk about IOT so what
you can do is you can spend one day
researching about IOT so go to Google go
to YouTube go to some online free
courses and learn about tech tech
technology and see if you it is more if
it motivates you go ahead with that what
if it doesn't motivate you that's fine
go be the next technology learn about
big data and spend one day and you will
understand the basics of it
I'm not saying one day you will
understand everything that's impossible
but then you'll understand something and
that something is important if you want
to go ahead so I would say go to Google
and search for the best resources get
the basics clear and then you can think
about the actual implementation or how
to spend your entire one year in that
technology so I hope you enjoyed this
video and learning about this these five
technologies so let me know in the
comments section and like the video if
you have liked it thanks so much for
watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
