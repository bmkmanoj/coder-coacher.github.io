I'm lovin the different face the
Lightning's and today we are going to
talk about a frequently asked question
and that question is why we create a
reference offer least or the interface
and the object of a class I mean think
about this the classic example is the
collection a collection rich interface
and Aldus plus right it's like we don't
use it much of any compared to other
other topics like in height and so all
those things but the moment you come to
collection this is this is frequently a
sign silly thing about this list is an
interface and adages a class right and a
Danish class it implements this
interface so whenever you create at
least we always do something like this
we sell list names equal to new list
right and I get this question why we
don't write analyst because it's work
the same way right you can create a list
or you can create an ArrayList why you
have to confuse people with this in text
when you can use this one even in this
one in this list you can add values and
this is you can add values right both
are exactly same then why people refer
this one now first of all this looks
cool right we have a list interface and
they're getting a list of that the other
one is simple class okay we are creating
an object of a class okay that's not the
main reason the reason is if you know we
have an interface right now this
interface list has two implementation in
fact there might be money but then we
know the two most famous the first one
is anodized and second one is linked
list right in fact I do have a video on
that on YouTube the difference between
linked lists and I used the thing is if
we talk about this additional it'sh
class it implements least there's one
more class which is called a linked list
right so we can also create a linked
list okay so we can also do this we can
say linked list names they quit a new
linked list right or we can say list
names equal to a new
linked list right so why do you sleep
stress interface now for a very specific
reason let's say let's say you have a
you you are calling a method okay so
let's say you have a names here and you
want to filter out this elements so you
might be having names with with at least
or you might be having a name
type list or link list so that say you
want to filter the elements you want to
filter those names which starts with n
let's say you don't like people whose
name starts with n ok that means I like
it doesn't matter so if you want to
filter all the names which starts with n
what you will do is we will say you will
create a function on a method called as
filter okay that is filter and this
filter will take a parameter as names
right so you are defining our function
called as filter so first of all you are
calling it here of course somebody want
to define it right so let's say this is
your main functions of from here to here
you have a main function or a main
method and then you are calling a filter
method again this is not a inbuilt
method okay I am getting I'm at one
method here so I will create I will
define that method will say filter which
takes okay so let me I'm defining that
method okay now question arise okay
whatever logic we have here that doesn't
matter okay we can have a logic where
you can obtain the values right out or
you can filter the values the important
thing is if you are passing names what
you will accept here see now if you pass
as it is let's say let's focus on this
one so this if this is the object you
are creating okay let's keep this first
first and last in the operating at least
names you have to pass the names all
right so you will accept or at least you
so you will say add a list and you will
say names because that's how you define
the variable right so if you are passing
or and it is you have to accept our
image right now if you are passing or
link trees let's I don't want to pass at
least now I want to pass link list I
have to replace this code with linked
list or I have to create another method
which is method overloading right so you
will be having two methods in the same
class filter and filter one will accept
at least one will accept linked list
okay so now we have two methods do the
same thing right
why to create two methods with the same
thing one you can do when you can do
that in one method so instead of
creating issue of passing and reduced
here you can pass at least because least
will accept add a list and list will
accept linked list both right so what we
always do is whenever you rev for so
anyway you'd have fault or variable
because this is a variable right we call
them as object but those are reference
variables so whenever you referred to
other I mean whenever you create a
reference variable it
should be of type of interface so you
should operating at least all linked
list we should be always writing list
again writing analyst and English will
not give you any ed up but then if you
follow the standards standard says you
should always create a reference of the
interface and object of a class so that
when you pass the value you can have you
have to only create one method which can
take all the classes so you can pass the
object of analyst you can pass the
object of linked list because everyone
takes the object or the least time right
that's one of the use you have okay so
that's why we have this concept of
abstraction right and so instead of
focusing on hey so this when you define
this filter you will say this filter
takes the list of values right so when
you define this filter we say it takes
list of names in shops saying it takes D
stuff at least it takes list of linked
list you can say it takes list of list
of names right so we should always
create other friends off the interface
and object upper class now this same
concept is applicable in lots of thing
in fact when you start with advanced
thing like Spring Framework or hibernate
framework we do the same thing right we
have lots of interfaces we create a
reference of interface and object of a
class so this is the main reason why we
follow this concept again there are lots
of reasons what happen the main one is
this one so I hope you got your columns
all I get I got lots of questions on
YouTube so I wanted to make a video on
this instead of commenting on that so
this is the video for those people who
have this confusion so if you already
know this that's great otherwise this I
mean I hope this was helpful so that's
it guys that is from this video if you
have any more questions something like
this you have a comment section coming
to your question I may not answer in the
comment section but I will surely make a
video on that in future so that's my
plan now so that's it thanks for
watching and if you want to see such
other videos again in your in this
channel so do subscribe and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
