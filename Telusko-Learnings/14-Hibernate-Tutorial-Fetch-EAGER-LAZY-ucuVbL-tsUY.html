whitey and in this video we'll talk
about the different type of fetch
techniques we have eager and lazy now
it's it's almost same as human behavior
right so let's say if you get a task
what you do you wait for the deadlines
that is that that means lazy but if you
are kind of person who the moment you
get a task you do it that is eager now
to explain this what I will do is you
know just we have some code changes here
we got a different class here so you can
see we have agent class so we all are
aliens by default right so alien will
have an ID or name and the alien will
have multiple laptops normally you know
you work with multiple laptops in one
machine you'll be having one one type of
task is running on the other machine you
have some other tasks running so let's
say one lap one alien will have multiple
laptops and so in alien we have a a ID a
name and laptop collection and in laptop
we basically have we basically have
Aryan it's not a different example right
which we are doing from from a long time
so and then what I want to do is I want
to fetch I can be have done this before
we have talked about one-to-many
relationship right so let's try to fetch
the value again now what I will do is I
will simply ask for alien because I
already have a database created so if
you can see I already have or alien
database here or not agent database but
test database in which I have alien and
laptop so if i say alien you can see we
call three indians we got Naveen Rahul
Eggman and if I say laptop so we have
five laptops and in a 91 has three
laptops that's creating an i3 has two
laptops and unfortunately da who doesn't
have any laptop a poor house right so so
let's go back here and let's try to
fetch the value so what I will do is I
will say alien
a1 and I want to fetch the data of alien
from the database so what I will do is I
miss a session
dot get and then you specify here I
wanted it about alien so you say in
inter class and then in this you
mentioned the ID let's see the ID is one
that's I'm talking about Naveen here
okay so if I simply festive and you what
do you think do you we didn't get all
the values and of course should you
should get the or you should get all the
values right now that means if I fire
the query of
you will get the SQL there let's run
this code and let's see what happens you
run this code and you got you can see we
got an SQL and okay we're I'm also
fitting hi here where okay that you
don't want hi anymore let's run this and
you can see we got the it is for adding
a query but then it is only fetching the
Illinois D alien name you can see know
where it is fetching the collection
instead it is not fetching the list of
our tops so if I try to fetch the list
of laptops I say let me print the value
of a1 and then or maybe I will not print
the value of a1 because if I okay let's
let's use only the Delap top part so I
will first print a1 dot get a name let's
fetch that one and then I will fetch the
least of the I will say collection of
laptops that's what I'm using right I'm
using collection here so I will say
connection of laptops and I will fetch
all the collections here and I will say
a1 dot get labs because it will give you
the guys Asian of laptop and then I will
iterate with with the help of although I
will say a laptop L :
Labs and it will train I will try to
print one by one laptop I just want to
know with it very far the query now
because you can see laptops on subject
table right why it is not fetching it
and I'm going to try to press the value
you can see we are filing the query for
laptop as well so when we when we were
saying that we want to fetch a lien it
was only filing the query for a lien but
not for other laptops it is filing the
query for laptops only when you want it
so if I again come in this section so if
I comment this section it will not file
the query for laptops that means even if
you are fetching the value of a lien you
are getting only the value of a lien not
laptops even if a lien has multiple
laptops that means it is lazy but I
don't want this he I want it to be eager
because see what what is happening is it
is fund equality two times I mean at two
different intervals so first you are
filing the query for alien the second
time you have ID inquiry for laptops so
a user will feel a bit delay here now if
you want to make it eat
that's your choice again that's the
choice of designing the way you design
yourself but if you want to make it Iger
it's very simple actually in your
collection you can specify hey I want to
specify the fetch type so in one two men
you can specify hey I want to specify
the fetch type and the fetch type I want
is so we say fetch type dot this option
of eager by default is lazy if they're
willing to make it eager and even if you
are not fetching the collection for I
mean even if you're not fetching the
laptops here and if you run this code
you can see it will fire this ql query
so you can see at least it is find SQL
query now this time it is fetching a ID
a name and also the laptop deed I can
see that in this electron it's just find
the it is filing the data for laptop as
well but then wait with one difference
it is not filing two different queries
it is finding only one query and it is
using something called as left outer
join is it yeah so it is using left auto
join to fetch the value so let me
remember this by default the fetching
type is lazy so when you say lazy it
means it will fetch the value only when
you need it otherwise it will not give
it to you it's something like let's say
your boss says hey hey I mean I want you
I want I want I want to complete a task
I want a these are a task you have to
complete now I will say okay that will
be done and I will not complete the task
and let's say one day my boss says hey
you have to us now and do me the task at
that point I will start because I'm
thinking maybe my boss will not ask me
for to complete the task why try to
waste my time and that's what happening
with hibernate maybe I user don't want
laptops then why to fetch the value
that's what happens I when it is
thinking so that's why it is lazy but
you can you can make it eager that's
very simple
let's go to that I meters go to aliens
and say fetch equal to fetch type eager
and it's that simple
yeah so there are two type of fetching
value fetching techniques we have eager
and easy and that's how you do it by
default just lazy you can make it eager
and it will work I hope you enjoyed this
video you're interested about fetch and
I mean eager and lazy see you in the
next video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
