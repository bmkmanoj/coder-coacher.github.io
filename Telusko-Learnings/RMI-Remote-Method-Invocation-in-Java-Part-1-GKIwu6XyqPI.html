today we will talk about something
called as our m.i which is which stands
for its remote OHP its remote method
invocation its invocation now in first
place we'll see why we require our mi
now say let's suppose if you have a
Class A so let's define a Class A and in
this class we'll be having lots of
members like variables and methods and
let's say we have two variables in I
comma J and you'll be having a method
called a shoe you will be no method like
display I will be having ad so you have
all these methods here and then you have
class B and this Class B you will be
having a main function and you can if
you want to use this variable C you
cannot call this variables or methods
from this class what you need is you
have to create an object right we have
to build an has a relationship you so
we'll say nu a which means this obj here
is your reference and this new a here is
your object right so this is this is
your object and this is your reference
or you can say we have this reference
obj to to go to this object a now how it
works is like let me show you a diagram
with this I'm not good painter but we
try and try let's imagine this is your
system and we'll be having 2000 memory
one is the earth this is your stack
memory and you will be having a heap
memory here now how it works you when
you create an object like when you when
you write this statement new a it will
create a object in your heap memory okay
this is your heap memory you will be
creating an object and this object will
have some address let us suppose this
address is 1 0 2 not a good painter say
to you let's say so let's suppose we
have we have 1 not 2 this is your
address now so this memory will have
this object we have address called as
one not 2
then in this section in your stack area
what you will be having is so what I can
say this will be your object name which
is obj and the address of obj will be
one not two so this is how it works
right so in your system will be having a
object with address one not two and then
in stack memory what will be having is
is the difference and the address
address location of that object
now here like when I say when we when
you create object of a so we have this
reference obj which is stored in heap
also in stack and the objects is stored
in heap memory so next time when I say
let's suppose if I say it's obj its obj
dot show like we have defined this
method here if I say okay I got show it
will go to their stack memory it will
search for this object named as obj it
will check the location which is 1 not 2
and will call the location now the
amazing part is both this type of memory
stack and hip belongs to the same JVM or
same machine what if we have two
different machines so this tag belongs
to machine one and this hey village
belongs to machine 2 so that means there
will be there will be two different JVM
now this time when you say obj1 not to
this will search for the same location
or same jb same hit memory in the JVM
but what we want we want to call this
one not to object of another JVM that is
not possible directly using this this
statement right it because it will
always search for the local memory so
what we have to create is we will be
having this implementation on another
machine and will be having this class
another another machine so that means we
have two different jaebeum's
so in this scenario you have to call our
method you have to invoke a method which
belongs to the mode machine and for that
we require a concept called as our Emma
so we'll see how to work with our am I
in my next part
so do subscribe for the further videos
and thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
