lighting so the in this example we have
seen how to override methods so this
class B extends Class A and so when you
create object of B and if when you call
show it will call B show not a show so
let's run this so that is in B show and
now if I just comment this method here
so I don't have show in B so if I run
this it will call in a show right
because we don't have we don't have in
show in B now of the main purpose of or
the main use of method overriding is to
work with dynamic method dispatch now
that's the main power of polymorphism so
when you say you're achieving runtime
polymorphism so we are actually behind
dynamic method dispatch now what exactly
it means is just demonstrate this let me
start an example let's say we have a obj
one okay and let's say this is a so I'm
creating object of a we have B so B obj
2 equal to nu B and let me create a
reference of a as a okay just a simple
reference and now can I say a dot show
of course not it's because I have not
created the instance for a so this a
doesn't points to any object it just our
normal reference which is initially null
so that's why it gives you an error how
about if I use obj one so you money when
I use obj one of course it will call
because since the reference is also of a
and object is also of a and when you
learn this code you will be getting in
show a but if I use obj to I will be
getting second part which is in B show
and show be because the references of B
and the object is of B but what happens
when I use when I use a statement like
this when it
have a equal to obj1 and let's call from
a now if I run this it says in show a
right because we are giving the object
of a and if I use obj to and if I run
this code it will call in be show even
if a is the reference of a a class it
was still call in show B because it
doesn't matter your reference work which
of which class your reference is what
matters is the instance is the object so
when you have object of a it will call a
show if you have object of B it will
call B show provided provided you have
we should have this inheritance
relationship here so that that's it that
is what dynamic method dispatch because
you're deciding which method to call in
runtime and that's what is also called
as what you say runtime polymorphism
okay because it is achieved with the
help of method overriding now that's a
dancer from this video which is dynamic
with a dispatch so thanks for watching
and do subscribe for other videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
