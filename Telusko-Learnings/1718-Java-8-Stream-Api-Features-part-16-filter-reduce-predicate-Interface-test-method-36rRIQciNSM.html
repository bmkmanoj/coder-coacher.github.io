use this filter method so in this filter
method you can filter out all the
elements which you are not required
example with this logic it says use only
those values which are which are
divisible by 5 so what this filter will
do is it will give only those values to
deduce which are divisible by divisible
by 5 in fact whenever you work with the
stream methods or this is also a
functional programming because you don't
have to focus on objects we are focusing
more on functions you can say this is a
function here again a function and a
function so no need to create the object
which we used to we have a habit of
doing in Java so stream says if you want
to make this code more look more
beautiful what you can do is after every
function give an inter and line it up so
that we can see it in a better way
it looks much better if you write one
after the other so this stream will
convert all the values then all the
values will go to filter and only those
value will come out which satisfy this
condition and those values will go to
reduce simple but let's say how exactly
this filter works by far they move this
code or let me just come in this part so
that you can understand what I am doing
here ok and let me comment all this
thing also I guess you have you know how
it works so let me remove this thing so
that our code will be more look it will
look more simpler now let me write the
thing once again so I will say s out
values dot it will convert into stream
now this stream will accept will say our
dot see a dot and will say a matter
which is filter now if it's if you check
this filter filter says I want an object
of predicate I can say there's something
else predicate here now it is predicate
now predicate is a functional interface
in Java which was introduced in Java 1.8
so filter needs an object or predicate
let's let's the object operating it will
be P
so that means I need to create object or
predicate so that's great so we say
predicate if I say this is C the
signature of predicate it accepts only
one value so it the the type is only 1
so you can see predicate is a function
interface which takes only one argument
and it returns a boolean value so what
we'll do is we'll say the type of all
the elements are integer well then this
object has P since the scienter phase we
cannot directly gate object using new
keyword we need to define it itself will
define it here and we'll give a
semicolon and we have to specify the
type which is integer now I'm going to
import the package
so we'll say control-shift I which will
import the package and you can say
predicate belongs to our package which
is Java dot util dot function okay and
we'll say okay now once you have done
with the import we need to say whenever
you provide a definition of interface
you have to define all the methods now
let's say let's go to this predicate
interface and we'll see which method we
need to define so predicate is a
functional interface that means it this
interface will support lambda expression
next the only method it has is the
method name is test which takes a
parameter it returns a boolean value
because it checks for the condition now
we will define that method here we'll
say public it returns a boolean value
and if the method name is test it
accepts a value so we'll say it is
integer I now it only returns a boolean
value and when I say I mod 5 is equal to
equal to zero
obviously it will return a boolean value
so if your number is 12 12 mod 5 is
which is not 0
it will return false now what is filter
will do is if it returns a false it will
remove that element from the stream
simple so this is how it works this is
this is your predicate here now we can
simply say since we're done with the
filter will apply our reduce function
we'll say reduce with the same logic
what we have done earlier will say 0
comma in bracket C comma E which takes
up value and
they use a lambda expression here and
will simply say c plus e again we have
we know how to use it we have seen in
the last video now so have read it up
educate here and I have passed that
object be here in this filter so once
again what is what is predicate Medicaid
is an interface which was introduced in
Java 1.8 it's a functional interface
which has only one method called as test
so in order to create the object of
predicate what you have to do is we have
to say predicate P new predicate when we
define that define the class and you
have to define the method which is test
and if I done this code now you can see
the answer is 185 simple can you make
this code more efficient and yes we can
make this code more efficient then
question as how that we'll see in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
