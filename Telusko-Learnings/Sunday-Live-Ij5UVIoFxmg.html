looks like I'm live there okay so let me
do the setting here okay so it says I'm
live from last six seconds that's great
okay so how many people are watching
this I am not getting any stats there
let me know if you are watching me
everyone okay so I can see four likes
but then those there's no view counter
hey hi a bonafide
so you are you are following Channel
four that's good that's good very good
chance and I do get happy when you are
there Siobhan that's great so I can see
my face here on this screen and the
voice is also proper so I can see
ninety-eight people are watching this 20
likes even though there is a cricket
match and everyone is going live with me
that's great thank you so much for
joining everyone and today as usual we
have Sunday live here talking about your
questions of let's unlit I will try to
answer all your questions but then I may
not able to complete all the questions
so please understand and let's start
with the question so there's no for the
topic today there is no topic to discuss
less straightforward go to the question
and surround I can the question answer
will be based on the first come first
serve so I will first your name and then
any questions so okay so first of all
Japan hi Mohit say hi no no say hi
Busey's hello okay everyone then say is
hi okay everyone says hello okay so the
first question from finish and the
question is which language to learn for
web development okay good question
finish so the answer is okay I will not
answer anything which which will take me
to look into what you say controversies
because in one of my I mean you know
some of my videos when I mentioned
something about something else
people do create issues on that you know
they are such there's so many follow
four different languages so let me be
unbiased here or maybe buyers may be
unbiased yeah so the answer is if you
want to go for web development the best
one now you can go for PHP you can go
for Python you can go for Ruby on Rails
so these are training tanks if you're
going for the enterprise world of course
you have to go for Java because more
of the enterprise technology they did
you use Java technology there so maybe a
spring framework may be spinning MVC
stores framework but if you are doing
what freelancing job if you are if
you're doing for startups they might
choose PHP they might choose Python so
it dip dip in I mean decide what you
want to do or which company you want to
join and based on that learn if you're
doing it for yourself PHP is the best
way to start with it has lots of things
works to work on so and you can do
everything on PHP as well okay so in
fact JavaScript is also there so you can
build anti backing down or in fact you
can build the entire website using
javascript the front end the back end
the database side so there's a mean
stack and now people are moving from
angular to react.js so it will be how do
you pronounce it's a mean is MongoDB so
M is Mongo e is Express radius a is
angularjs n is node.js or you can
replace that a with R which is reactive
jeaious so you can learn JavaScript as
well for that okay so next question from
finish as well but that one was it just
come up this is dinner saying I have
complete Android also develop some
project what should I learn next web
development I got me the good thing is
so if you've already done Android going
for web will be a good thing because in
future you can make a complete
application I mean the web and the
Android because when you get clients
sometimes clients need both right there
they want web and they want Android both
so it's better if you know both so you
can build the Android or the web so
first web and based on web you can build
the Android application so yeah so it
will be a good thing so go for web
development next if you really want to
jump new technologies as I mentioned the
earlier sessions you can also learn
about blockchain or machine learning AI
but then do you have those required
skill set that's important right so if
you if you want to go for that go ahead
okay
just to verify some more thing okay
so next is next question from K you tell
you how do you how to pronounce your
name and I have really bad with names by
the way I can see 133 people are
watching this and only 42 lights so let
me know if you're liking this type of
sessions guys that's why that's why I
mentioned I mean every size
so if you like my sessions do click on
the like button that's how I know okay I
have to go on live on Sunday as well
Oh first of all I've missed this part
belated happy Diwali and berated Happy
New Year I was busy this Diwali I was
supposed to go live just to wish you
happy Diwali but then you know things go
don't go right every time so I was busy
with some other stuff too busy with
Diwali with family so I was not able to
go live and now I am since is it so
Sunday I don't have a choice I have to
go like on Sunday because people do are
waiting for my sessions because of some
answers so yeah good so finally I'm here
and great so this next question is a I
was says IOT okay so a I I guess is
already implemented and IOT will be
implemented future but there are lots of
issues with IOT in terms of security in
terms of comfort will be really using a
internet on I mean D all the devices
will be in turn enabled that's one
question because the budget comes into
picture the networking network issue
comes into picture so there are so many
things when you talk about IOT but then
yes if you love embedded programming if
you want to do something of course you
have to go for IOT I mean that that's a
very good thing
otherwise ai is training everywhere so
you can talk about deep learning machine
learning go for AI it's it's a there's a
bright future because see the thing is
from last 10 years every company is not
just 10 years from a wave from way back
every company is collecting huge amount
of data and to process that data now
what now they are using big data concept
you know they are using Hadoop framework
and all those things now they want to
get I mean they want to get more stuff
from there from the data and that's why
they want to implement AI so that they
can decide they can create a best
solution for those for the next or next
2 years or 3 years so yeah AI will be
implemented by all the all the companies
in fact the mobile chips nowadays they
have AI processing unit so why not right
so if you have seen that they sent
Google Talk or Google launched
okay so Technol pumpkin says hi sir how
many times should have okay how much how
many times should I give to learn any
right okay how much time per day it's
all depend
one person to person I would say spend
how much you can I mean so when I was
learning programming initially I was
spending around five to six hours per
day like at the starting stage but then
later on I am just now I'm spending on
it two to three years or they are
learning new stuff
okay so depends how much you can spend I
would say if you're if you can spend ten
hours why not if you can spend 20 hours
why not
okay I got some message net for that
okay so but then okay so you decide how
much you spend so normally it takes 40
hours of 50 hours just to learn a
language
okay just to learn it just to understand
the syntax just to understand different
features it provides but then you cannot
be a master in 40 hours you have to
spend maybe three four months to get
actually get the gist of the language
just to give you a glimpse it took me
two years to understand Java properly
okay I mean I was knowing Java but then
you know there's always a thing do we
edit it to use this concept I'm going to
use this concept so all those things
will take around six months okay so it
took me two years because I was not
having a good trainer with me I mean I
was not good I was have not got any
professional training in these
technologies that's why it took some
time but if you have a good I mean if
you get some proper guidance some
internship I mentor mentorship okay some
mentors to guide you it will take around
six months okay so our next I must say
is high so a high bond now I am okay so
I guess you're free now okay so on our
collection essays hello everyone say is
hello okay so that lots of hellos today
okay Shiva Kumar says can I have to ask
you something she why if we could have
answer ask the question that's it I
could have read that okay so how are you
sir also olive says how are you sir I'm
good thank you sorry if good to go yeah
I'll be able to go take your take my
name and then sighs take my name a high
anion so IOT oh okay so I lost all my
questions this is very bad about Google
Chat you know the YouTube chat we have
so what the moment I scroll down it goes
way up so let's do that again
and okay onion ponder says so what did
you do I just had a tea okay
Emmett says USA what is this about
yeah this is about a life session so
every Sunday I make sure that I go live
just to help you people because I also
want to connect with you people because
you know having so many subscribers in
the channel there is no use of if you do
not interact with them right why we are
building this platform so that we can
interact I mean you can track with me I
can interact with you and that's how
thing goes right so yeah so this is
about discussion may not be I mean this
is not exactly to help you here I just
do I want to connect with you I feel
good you know I wait for every Sunday so
that I can connect to once in a week
just to know what is happening in from
my side from your side and the finally I
can talk to people you know I'm getting
bored by recording videos so okay okay
so high and I mean actually I'm waiting
for your session or thank you Venkatesh
I'm here okay a car says love your
tutorials thank you so much let us help
thank you
okay hi sir say my name okay so to say
son of a schmuck I must say you say my
name hi son of a Schmo gamma
okay so Boyd's a sub-item is good of
course matter is good in fact this is
the fastest growing language now so
python is the fastest growing language
good thing right
in fact I want to learn Python soon I
mean I know Python a bit but then not a
mastery of Python so yeah so Oscar says
how do you know Python language do you
know piyo do you know by the language no
I mean I mean I know the basics of
Python but then I'm not exactly into it
okay so please can you please explain
how to start local server a local server
now first of all when you say local
server there are different ourselves
available right we have Tomcat we have
Zam which local server you're talking
about so let me know which so local so
we're talking about then we can talk
about it
so go change let's say is we love
programming our interest is here okay
sheikha BC is high and pressure I need a
job in Java
oh okay so if you need a job in Java the
best way is seed Nadia people used to go
slow for the dafuk Asian but nowadays I
don't think people are going for you
for certification in fact companies are
looking for a vacation they are looking
for
okay I'm hitting so many messages today
yeah so they are looking for basically
your project so if you so if you really
want to get a job make sure that if
you're going for big companies they will
check your marks as well I feel fresher
but then they will also check your skill
set so make sure you you build some
projects in Java so that when you join a
company or when you go for the trees
they can show your damage so your skill
set because no one can no one can judge
your skill set based on 15 minutes
interview right because even if you're
good and maybe your interview is not
good that will be issue even if you're
bad of technology maybe you can you
might answer all the questions that
doesn't mean so you know everything so
make sure that you build some projects
and I'm sure if you keep looking for
jobs you will get one you will get
something don't get this don't get
depressed don't get disheartened life is
all about
it's a journey right so some people do
get the seat fast and some people have
to wait so okay everything will come to
you okay let me say is what is money e
SB I don't know something way new for me
okay so you want to say hi sir hi chin
may say this is to study data structures
algorithm okay I mean they're not sub
channels on YouTube which provided a
structure videos I'm not sure if they
are good or bad because I've never seen
those videos yet but then there are lots
of videos available on YouTube in fact
I'm lying to make videos on data
structure but not soon or maybe next
year in Feb
or March if I'm free at that time but
I'll be making videos on data structures
may not be the complete series but the
important topics at least otherwise you
can follow some books there are lots of
books available for literature so what
you can what I do is if I want to know
something is good go to YouTube sorry
going to go to amazon.com or any website
any ecommerce website and search for the
book name and check what the ratings if
the ratings check for the reviews and
see what they are saying alright that's
how we do it okay I can see 154 people
are watching this and okay so one not
four like so okay so do click the like
button if you liked the sessions and one
more thing I need your support here
because see I feel you know
people should know about this channel
because I want to spread the knowledge
as as far as possible to as many people
as possible because if more people are
watching the channel then I will get
motivated and that's how we'll make more
video so it's like step by step light so
if I get more views I will make more
videos more videos means more views so
do share this video with your friends
and you have a Facebook platform you
have a one step platform then why don't
you do it I know there are lots of
people they are sharing my videos and
that's why you got so many subscribers
but why not us I mean share with
everyone ok next question next question
from what is the best GUI that I can use
for Java best GUI for Java ok talking
about the technology you can use swing
or Java effects in that case go for Java
effects but there are lots of things
happening but if you want to improve
your GUI I would also say you show just
improving the UI also improve the UX so
there are lots of videos available how
to improve your UX which is user
experience but then if you want to
implement it user technology so that is
Java F Java FX that's a very good thing
ok oh ok
Fahim says tell me something about dark
web ok so yourself saying this way about
dark web just go to youtube and search
for dark dark dark web videos you know
there are so many videos which talk
about in detail how dark dark web works
ok but first of all don't get into dark
web ok just learn about it but don't get
into the dark web concepts ok don't
because there are lots of things are
illegal going on in dark web so stay
away from it go knowing about it is a
good thing so much about it but don't do
lots of research on that ok because you
might you know get into that it happened
with me so that that's what I'm saying
ok so next question from sorry I'm a
jaw-dropper can I use UNIX for AWS can I
use UNIX for AWS you can use a terminal
and you can use UNIX I'm not sure why it
will not work not sure ok Yogesh - says
i want to do or lack of certification
programming what should i do so if you
want to get into a reco certification
the best way would be buy a catty sara
book which is ocjp 8 or 7 book and try
to read the entire book
there are some problems given there try
to solve all the problems and that's how
you cook that's how we do it okay
but if you're going for that all the
best in fact I want to do certificate I
wanted to do certification long back and
I don't do it now but then if you're
doing it all the best
okay so this is Dutchman what are the
basics oh if you can hear that noise
that's the people are still celebrating
Diwali here okay great so one of the
basics for learning selenium so for
selenium you should know basic testing
concepts and Java so if you are good
with Co Java and basic concept of
testing unit testing then how to so this
is a different type of attitude when you
test something right because when you
develop something you have a different
attitude when you test something every
different attitude in fact I have this
experience of teaching Java testing
people and they they have a different
way of thinking towards the software
right and if something goes wrong with
my code you know there is point okay
this is something you are doing
something wrong you know and so they
have a good mindset so you need to have
a different mindset while testing and
that you will get once you start testing
so first make sure that you know poor
Java or you know the test unit testing
and that then learn selenium in fact if
you know poor Java start learning sunny
and selenium and you're good to go
okay muddly says I'm a trainer of C C++
how to get a job in C and C++
okay how do you the job in C and C++ I'm
not sure because in which reason you are
but search for the jobs if you are good
with C go for the introduce apply for
the jobs know how can you that's the
test of one thing right we die so you
can do it okay so how can I learn Java
spew says how can I learn JavaScript
it's easy actually JavaScript iFit is
one of the easiest language to learn so
like the way you learn C programming
which is easiest one you can also learn
JavaScript in fact the advantage of
learning javascript is you can see the
output as soon as possible because then
see what you learn is HelloWorld
addition of two numbers and you can see
the output on pencil and no one likes
pencil in JavaScript you get the output
on the page you know and we love those
HTML pages so I would say start with
JavaScript you can use any resources you
can use YouTube the lots of amazing
videos are available for JavaScript
YouTube just search without Java
tutorial skip tutorials and there will
be some playlists watch the playlist I
would save anybody watching a playlist
stick to the playlist you know did I
have seen one drawback with YouTube in
fact lots of youtubers will agree with
me there are so people do get distracted
when they watch videos on YouTube
because when you watch a video on the
right side you have so many videos to
click on right so you do get diverted so
don't do that so once you are watching a
playlist or whatever thing watch the
place in full screen and that's how are
you do it okay so next Stu says hello so
hello Ganesha is Hina be in hi Ganesh
can you make a project based on Java
with IOT no I'm not good with IOT so I
can't do it now okay so when Curtis says
no I mean what is C Raj can you o see
Raj is a person his name is Suraj Rahul
yeah I just seen his video two days back
his name is Siddharth Robin he's very
good with machine learning is very good
with AI concepts he also has his videos
on some I guess in on Udacity if I'm not
wrong he's very famous search for Suraj
Robin he is a trainer who will okay who
will help you with the UI concepts
okay next is how much Java is necessary
for Android I would say till and right
so once you start learning Java learn
about oops concept learn about for loops
and ask for loop a day's object passing
because in Android you do that from when
I to do second activity when you pass
objects you do that so you should know
how to pass an object and then how to
create instance how to use anonymous
class how to because in Android we do
that we use an anonymous class inner
class right threads what else
collections in fact or the entire code
Java so learn about Co Java and then you
can go for Android okay so debug say is
currently I mean for TL engineering in
Mumbai can I get an internship with
telescope
okay so you will get the internship with
that is Co a when we start with
internship again so I'm looking for
internship again because I do this from
I'm doing this from last two years now I
did it 2015 2016 and 2017 also I will be
going for internship but this time I'm
looking for not so anyone can be
internships the last time I was looking
only for Mumbai candidates and now I'm
looking for candidates all over the
world because I want to give that
freedom to you you can work from
anywhere the only thing is I don't know
how to manage it the poor difference
office to use one is gate of course to
commit to commit something I will be
using some communications website where
you can communicate about stuff maybe
I'm not a good manager in that case I'm
not able to manage all those things
properly I mean okay I cannot bad say
but I think about me but then I need oh
I also need some people who will manage
the project so let's see how it goes so
I'm looking for the internship but not
at this point maybe in March somewhere
in your summer vacation let's see okay
so then I say sir I love your teaching
methodologies oh thank you so much okay
what axe can I use Python for
development can I can be used button for
developing Android apps yes you can in
fact Python is a language which you can
use everywhere but the only question is
is it a good way of using Python for
Android programming you can you can do
that when what about performance what
about monitoring what about debugging is
it really efficient
I'm not sure because I'm not I have not
worked on Python yet but the review says
Python is not that up to the mark when
it comes to Android if you want to go
400 programming in future go forward
Portland Java JavaScript if you're going
for hybrid but then using Python for
Android I don't think it's a good good
is a good option but we can we can do it
so if you if you're a very good path
with Python in cheek and knives
everything go for it
okay okay so more--the Lama says is
MacBook is good for college see buying a
MacBook is all depend upon your budget
of course Mac MacBook is one of the best
machine available in the market for for
for several reasons I know people who
hate Apple okay but I feel if you start
using MacBook if you start using iPhone
trust me
three years back I used to hate iPhone
ok still I do it I don't hate I phone
now but then you know but once you start
using Apple devices you get a different
experience but this the second problem
can you afford it because MacBook is
damn costly ok you have to so yeah so if
you are addling if you are running a
good amount if you have a good amount
with you and if you really think if you
want to invest then go for it but if you
are a poly student you up if you are
pressurizing your parents to do it for
you then don't do it ok so I mean any
laptop will is good in fact even if you
buy a little machine of I three
configuration go for it okay there's no
machine which is best but then all the
power see all the mushrooms are good the
only thing is how much you can invest I
buy machines based on my budget ok
because the more you pay the best
machine you will get example Dell X px
awesome machine now they think is damn
costly right Alienware I mean get all
the gaming machines damn costly right
but then buying a laptop is all depend
up on your budget and that's why I also
made a video on based on that
okay so moco says please call my name
what is happening everyone so why you
are saying please call me a name okay so
I will still do it hi Pradeep okay so
python is best your patterns matched
hey sir I have seen your video it was
worthwhile oh thank you so much I can
see
lots of new subscribers journey life
sessions that's great and that's one of
the reason why I call so go live we know
there are new subscribers every week
cept oximetry I'm getting 10,000
subscribers per month now which is not a
good number not 10,000 maybe 8,000 9,000
that's not good number but then
welcoming everyone is a good thing right
everyone subscribe was important for me
so I guess so great how much time do you
use should I spend on learning or we had
talked about this question yeah so which
watch requirement for making what is the
requirement for making apps so if you
are making an apps in for Android code
Java is important so you should know
Java I would also say when you are
learning app development you should know
the UI path as well because in apps it's
also important how how good user is
feeling about why he's using your app
right
think about Flipkart think about Amazon
apps think about which whatsapp
application think Facebook application
they provide you good UI right so so
think about that as well so when you say
require requirements ok she was says
Android are wise which is matched of
course iOS because you will you will
I mean iOS is a good platform to earn to
learn right and it is also good but iOS
is awesome ok so I'm doing be a society
which other language oh but there's one
the problem with with iOS if you are
doing iOS development using swept you
have to buy a macbook so ok that's one
of the one of the thing which will come
up to you and then the the old one will
go with iOS is there not not not a lot
of resources available for iOS this is
we have four fourth row Android ok so
meant Maynard's not say is waiting for
junk in tutorials yeah I was I was
experiment I was supposed to make genkan
videos but then I'm damn busy with other
videos so I'm still here but I'm not
still not completed Java 9 videos yet I
was I was thinking it would I can
complete that in one month but the
problem is I know there's so many other
stuff which are coming on the way thanks
to Diwali thanks to other plans but I
will try to make that ok so I must say
so one you will upload more videos of
Java 9 years
more videos are coming on the way maybe
next week so next week I will try to
come try to make more videos on Java 9
ok so I'm so addicted say is I'm a BTech
CS a 3rd year student whether should I
prepare for gate or learn different
languages I mean given I get it's not a
bad idea right so prepare for gate and
learn one language don't learn all the
language you know it's not good to learn
all the languages why what you will do
with all the languages right will you
make the software using all the
languages of course not right so be a
master of at least one language
now maybe Java maybe Python maybe PHP
maybe dotnet choose a language and work
on it ok and there's one more thing
people ok there's one more thing but
people ask me can be used ever for next
10 years but think about this do we
really will be making the same thing in
for next 10 years
things are changing that fast maybe next
10 years we don't even have to use a
programming language maybe you will talk
to your computer and say hey I want to
just soften computer will give it to you
thanks for machine learning so a
software can make a software now so
don't depend up on one language don't
depend up on those things so ok
initially start one language go for gate
if that's what you love ok so science
says my question is to you that tomorrow
will be my interview I'm a fresher and
that post is George other purpose of my
question is what should I prepare for
too much meaning to you ok ok so I would
say prepare for data structure questions
data structure questions like algorithms
how can you implement that using Java
learn about which collections relations
questions are that that they you they
could they do aspiration questions
correction and these added east threads
I would say that's it so those are
things which you have to focus more on
and most important the group's concept
the polymorphism concept abstraction
concept all those things ok so ok so
next question we are live from last 27
minutes let's spend 15 more minutes and
let's try to answer as many questions as
possible next question is my name is
Ravi and I'm doing busy from ignore and
I want to be developing deep knowledge
good good
for you so what you can do is watch the
entire playlist of Java which I have on
my on my channel and the practice make
some project mix and Danny project and
okay that's the Diwali they are the only
enjoyment there so last week it was rain
and this time it is the body enjoy
enjoyment there's always some sort of
some noise coming in in these live
sessions right okay so yeah that's good
okay so what else okay so so next please
so it's my mom she wants something I
know you you must have seen my mom's
channel right that is ko kitchen I feel
don't know just search for there is a
kitchen on YouTube so lots of videos are
on the way okay okay so my mom is also a
youtuber great okay so I'm good ads oh
so Shawn say is nearly from you are
someone and half a year now and I'm
going to do a testing your what good
words I don't know what's that
I may be testing can I can I go for
testing course of course you can go for
testing course if you are very
interesting okay question question Oh
question question how to learn devops at
home okay this is a good question you
know because for day ups you have to so
this is first this is from Siobhan okay
so the question is how to learn DevOps
from home okay so what I would say is
create a dummy server you know when you
want to learn DevOps you have to get a
demo jihad dummy a Jenkins server on
another machine so let's say is what
what I would do use one more laptop
which in on which you will be having
Jenkins servers you will be having a
tomcat server maybe Abdullah may be any
any web server and imagine that server
as a dummy server which is a alw server
and anyway I just flipped for that
before it DevOps make sure that you do
it for them because it is actually it is
difficult to learn DevOps at home you
actually need a server to actually test
the strength of stuff yes
but I'll still try to make a video on
DevOps how can you do that okay next is
come - what about a mess in USA for
middle-class person I'm not sure about
MMS things enough oh okay next girl what
is scope of I do oh it's a very good
it's a still very there's a very good
scope for Hadoop so learn how do you but
the only thing is is see there are lots
of things which looks good because that
they are training but do you really have
time to invest on that and do you deal
do you really want to do that do you I
mean it is it your interest don't just
go for it because it is in fact an
example machine learning is fashion now
blockchain is in demand now but that
doesn't mean you should go for that so
do you really have interest in this and
if you really have an interest doesn't
matter what's the scope is right but at
anybody I do with a good scope ok pushed
from are they if what is the good
desktop application or web I don't know
okay so how to get a job abroad as
developer so ok so this is what I would
suggest you join any company in India
who has their offices on you and applaud
work for that company and they will send
it to up they will send you abroad
that's a good way to go there otherwise
do I mess in abroad and give a get a job
there
ok CS 27 says how to get a job in
production based company as a fresher to
win a job in production based companies
you have to be very good with data
structures algorithms database concept
IV 2 skills how can you solve a problem
because most of the companies they want
people who can solve problems so not
about a cannot run about aptitude skills
if they give you a problem statement
every problem statement will have 10
solutions you have to choose the best
one so and it takes time you have to
practice this at least for 3 to 4 months
and that's how you will be good at that
ok what do you say is our break and
engineering is that in easier to get a
job yes if you have a break in your
graduation
there will be issue when you go for big
companies especially the service based
companies but if you think about
mid-level companies if we talk about
startup they don't think that they don't
check about here
vacation what they check is your skill
set so go for this type of companies why
to get into big companies where they
only see your qualification no use right
okay I feel the company who is not
focusing in fact I feel the the entire
interview process for some companies is
messed up okay they are they are hiring
people who are only good with marks the
communication they are not even checking
the technical skills right in fact I
have been to some introduced way back
and horrible you know they only check
about your communication okay that's a
good thing a person should have a
communication thing but then it also
check that key technical skills how how
good how good are they are in the
problem-solving things while just
checking that why they're checking just
just checking their qualification the
marks right so that's a bad thing
okay table says I'm darn a dollar per
not want to move to call its asked loud
size cloud side which to chew okay not
the other part dot not to develop or not
want to move to the outside business
George okay so if you don't want to go
for cloud computing go forward block
change that good technology now machine
learning is good so these are things
which we are discussing from a long time
but then if you are done it a lot but
then why not you're going for a job it's
a very good thing right somebody says
should i / time you'll achievement five
extreme of course is team 5y you have to
learn HTML because there are they are
both same right it's just that s15 the
latest version then you will get more
tags more features okay I mean Hinduja
sales can we get some more with your
scholar videos from intermediate level
I'm trying to make scholar videos but
only things are lots of videos on the
line you know okay I am also planning to
keep all my work aside and focus on you
on YouTube in fact I'm I'm trying to
stop all the live sessions if you don't
know I am taking live batches right so
it's a paid course I'm trying I'm trying
to stop the life courses because that's
how I earn for all other stuff I'm
planning to stop that and I'm trying to
focus on your YouTube videos but the
only thing is I need some support right
there are some bills I have to pay guy
just have to buy some planning that I
will be
I will be opening my Petron patreon a
website I will be putting I mean there
is a patron website I will be requesting
you to support me there I don't know how
many of you how many of you will support
me do i do really deserve to get
supported by patreon so let's see how it
goes
once that get thanks I will stop all the
live sessions so this the current
starting batch which is starting from
November will be not remember October
last October and that will be last batch
so after that I'll be making only are
they only focusing on YouTube videos
provided I get do good support otherwise
it's not it should not happen that I
make - I'm just making videos and I
don't have money to pay my bills right
and if you are if you are thinking we
get lots of money from YouTube that's
not the case that the amount I mean
their YouTube is not a platform to earn
okay YouTube is a platform to share your
knowledge or to make to make to
broadcast yourself is not just letting
it's not a ugly platform it's a learning
platform I can say if you so I said as a
trained eye if I the only one to earn
your dime is a blackbelt best platform
udemy is there then lots of other
websites so let's see how many how much
support I get when I go for patreon I'm
also looking for donations let's see how
that goes once that once that support
comes into picture I can skip all my you
know life life matches
okay next today I have learned every see
swing hibernate now after that
which one should I learn in Java oh yeah
what I learnt done bit spring MVC swing
and hibernate I would I would say you go
for a spring boot spring batch and stay
string security best thing which okay
verification was a development which one
is good
personally I prefer wait I play for
development which is all depend upon
your requirement if you if you don't
like development if you like testing go
for that if you like testing if you
don't like testing if you like
development go for that it's all
personal choice both are good okay so do
you think Courtland will all come Java
in future for Android yes I would say it
will not replace dower because anyway if
you're writing code link code that is
getting getting converted into Java code
and people who know Java they will stick
with Java they will not go to Java and
personally I feel if I had no Java of
course I will choose Java the new
developers they might choose Cortland
because they find job it'd be difficult
to work with but then yeah people will
prefer Cortland over over Java in future
okay
but then you will you cannot learn court
in directly without Java okay even if
you learn coordinate syntax there's
something you know learning Java is not
just about syntax it's also about what
is happening behind the scene when you
create an object which memory it uses
right when you create a referenced
object when you create an anonymous
object what happens behind the scene
when GC comes into picture so there are
so many concepts you have to learn
anyway you are noting Java then even if
you are learning JVM got it you're
learning Java right how it works
although stuff okay how to crack any
okay we have talked about that which
language to learn no idea hacking I
don't have any idea but Python I think I
guess Python is useful for hacking can
you answer about C ah no it is a long
time I have worked on C language so I
don't want to talk about language double
is now
okay so Alan says party is most scalable
easy flexible and a lot of frame on
that's right matter is very flexible
okay a little Kumar says prepare okay
yeah okay that's a question that's a
question question question so last five
minutes so we have been live from large
38 minute let's go for seven more
minutes and let's see so it is let's see
how many questions we can answer so I
will try to answer those questions which
I know how to answer
okay predict wizard skills for AI I
would say in maths then much how unless
you have to understand how machine works
money language works then some of those
things so those are the prerequisite I
would say I would still suggest you to
search for Angie Angie and Suraj arrival
on YouTube
so Andrew N and so n you know it looks
like so it is it n because I can see a
middle view there
so ng and Suraj novel so that those are
the best people to learn AI concepts I'm
not the best one there even I feel
don't even watch about AI for for my
videos and all those youtuber who only
talks about AI you have to search for
the people who are there in know AI okay
so go for a suraj and angry of ng I
guess they're the best people they might
be other youtubers who are posting a
high videos I'm not sure but this to our
best okay so my question is how to learn
Java and how to develop project so
follow my place top code Java that's how
you will learn learn Java and make any
project so start with the project try to
break down your pleasure into small
small modules and build those stuff
that's I do it I just mean making your
first play in Java will take some time
it took me around five to six months to
build my first project here and that
soon as it was a small project but still
it took me six months okay I was not
spending the entire day on that maybe
one or two hours per day or maybe five
was a week but it still it took me six
years six months upload videos on
machine learning now I'm not related to
that as as as of now okay next next next
next
please giveaway you got okay you want me
to give away what you want so then okay
so the giveaway which I am giving you is
all the new videos right I feel this
channel is not a entertainment channel
this is basically a channel well I'm
giving you knowledge right and that's I
I guess that's a good best giveaway I
can give you right because giving you
mobile phones what you will do with
mobile phones right that's what I don't
I don't feel that's a good good give it
yeah if you are watching a channel which
do tech reviews that makes sense if
you're watching this channel you are
here to learn things right so that's of
it that's giveaway from my side but I
was to think about it what else I can
give you okay so please we need
tutorials in fact I'm looking for
sponsors as well
if I get sponsors let's say if I if I
get a sponsor who so let's say if you
got a sponsorship from Samson of course
I will give you a while phones I don't
have any problem right it's
okay I have this experience in tech
support now I'm planning to learn
software development and switch my
career okay I have some basic knowledge
of see which language to choose so if
you didn't just switch now I would say
go for go for Python okay is it too easy
to learn easy to switch and if you did
thinking about long term planning we're
going to enterprise world Python and
Java these are two options okay produces
is gate suitable for mtech in cloud
computing I'm not sure I'm not sure I
have not seen the gate gate so that was
in detail yet okay okay so hi so how are
you I'm good I'm a web I'm designing uh
but I don't know JavaScript well but can
I learn angularjs directly no I would
say first learn JavaScript you can learn
angular JS directly but then you may not
understand each and every concept so I
would say first learn JavaScript you'll
understand what is JavaScript I mean how
do you program in JavaScript and then go
for angularjs I'm good I'm good how to
get hired in a dream coming like Google
improve your skills and data structures
improve your skills in problem solving
and that's how you do it
I'm tired now it's been last three
minutes I'm getting tired now I know I'm
not able to answer all the questions but
trust me it is not easy to answer all
the questions day by day the number of
viwers of the live sessions I go going
up number of questions are going up okay
so question from re if it is Java SC or
Java EE which is best
we both are best because to learn Java
EE you have to learn Java SE you cannot
skip any one okay next next next item on
top of a big heat up of pressures I
would say advanced Java for freshers at
least to learn your ok so question for
money shot is it enough to learn your
videos from Java after seeing all ok yes
you will if you are watching all my
coach our videos we will because I have
180 to be
Oh Java I mean more than 180 so if you
watch everything of course you'll be
master in job why did you practice it's
lost two minutes okay but Robbie what is
your question I can't see your question
you're saying but I widow but Kappa Tau
let me tell me your question first Oh
finally I got your question
oh I've answered that question right so
if you want to learn Java and deep watch
my playlist start from start to end I
can see people are committing the same
question again and again and it's
difficult to track everything okay
should I go for TCS or go for select
Pony I don't know maybe see that would
be a good option okay David us David
Alsace I love Java can I switch from
Dartmouth to Java I just got a job I
would say stick with darknet for some
time and search for jobs don't just
leave your job for Java okay getting job
is difficult nowadays so stick to stick
to it also partly learn Java and search
for the jobs there okay so last one or
two questions okay I know I'm not able
to answer all the questions here but I'm
try my best to do that okay I think this
says what's the best way to learn a
spring framework to learn spring there
lots of modules if you want to learn
spring code you should know Co Java if
you want to learn spring MVC you should
know JSP and servlets or if you want to
learn spring JPA you should know
hibernate if you want to learn spring
rest you should know the rest so for
different modules there are some pretty
quiz that you have to go for so first on
all these things whatever you so depend
upon modules first learn all these
things and then go for the spring
framework okay o JSA is our ThinkPad
machines are good they're awesome
ThinkPad machines are awesome long
lasting I would say is best better than
all the machines available to market so
if you get ThinkPad go for it okay okay
okay that's it guys I guess we have come
came to an end so let me know your
thoughts about how can I promote this
channel more so help me with this how do
I promote my channel more how do I get
get good get some good good earning from
not just adding but then how can I
support the channel in a good way
how can you support let me know let's
see do you really can be really invest
in this channel more that's one of the
thing but then yes we juice will be
coming but how fast let's see so I'm
trying to make at least 3 to 4 videos
per week but the only thing is I'm damn
busy with other things so luck is the
best way to promote your channel is by
making a machine learning machine
learning videos ok let's see so that's
it
signing off everyone I hope a io a you
enjoyed the channel enjoy this session
