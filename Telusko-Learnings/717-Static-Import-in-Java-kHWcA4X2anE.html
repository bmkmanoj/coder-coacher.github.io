we'll talk about static import now when
you want to work with the let's say you
want to print something in in Java let's
so you want to play in hello
so when you want to print something we
always use system dot out dot println
and in bracket we mentioned the
parameters beyond two you want to Train
now this print Ln it's a method which
which belongs to print stream class and
in order to use a println we need to
create object of print stream which is
out and Java says don't worry I have
already created an object for you and it
below it resides in a class system now
this out object it's a it's a static
reference so you can see it's a static
reference and that's why we have
mentioned here static so whenever you
want to work or when you want to call
out we need to use system so it's a
qualified way of calling out right now
let's say you want to print hundred
statements to print those hundred
statements we want to use 100 system dot
out dot println now sure of doing that
what we can simply do is we can say
import Java dot lines in a system
belongs to line package and we say
system and we can give a semicolon but
hold on wait also if I remove this will
it work now we need to also mention
there is something called as out here so
we are importing what was the error now
I've made some mistake is it
there's a problem oh what's the problem
here now the problem is this out is not
a normal object is the static reference
ID so we have to mention a key word here
which is called as study so we have to
mention use import static space Java dot
Lang dot system dot out and the
advantage will be do not have to mention
this system class every time you want to
use this you can simply say out dot
println simple right that's how you use
static inputs so just to expand this
example I have a class created here
which is called as sample now you can
see in this sample class I have a method
called as show which is a static method
and in order to call this show we need
to use sample as a qualifier right so
you have to mention in order to call
show we have to mention sample dot show
so every time you want to call show V
dimensions sample there and that's why
we can print hello and hi right hi this
hi is printed using this show method but
instead of using that what we can simply
do is we can say we can import R which
is a package name triple a sample dot we
can mention show but again this show is
not a normal class as the method right
we are also starting method we have to
mention that as a with the above static
keyboard so when we mention static
keyboard we don't have to mention sample
we can simply use show and control ship
hi all right so now let's run this so if
I run this you can see again hello hi
simple right and that's how we use
static imports in Java so yeah thanks
