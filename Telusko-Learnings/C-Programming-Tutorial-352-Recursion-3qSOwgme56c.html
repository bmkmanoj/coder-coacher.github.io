find a factorial of a number but we need
to convert this into of the question way
right so we don't we want a factor of a
number using a requesting concept so
what we'll do is so basically when you
say the question it is function calling
itself right now when I say I want five
factorial so which which which also
means we can find 5 into 4 factorial
right and to give you 4 factorial we can
find 4 into 3 factorial right and then
go it goes on till 1 factorial and then
the output of 1 factorial will be given
to the 2 factorial so that 2 factor will
find it with the help of let's do it to
just make your concept clear we'll say 3
into 3 into 2 factorial and then we have
2 factorial which is 2 into 1 factorial
all right so if you can if you can get
this value which is 2 right so 1
everyone knows what is 1 factorial so
which means we'll say 2 into 1 factorial
you will get 2 so 2 factor is 2 then 3
into 2 since 2 factorial is 2 so it will
give you 2 and then you will get sexier
and then 4 into 6 you will get around
over 24 and then it will be 5 into 24
which is 120 right so we are calling the
function so this function will call this
function this function will call this
function and then it goes on so we are
calling the same function with different
parameter so initially you have to say
factorial of 5 then you have to serve
activate of 4 factorial of 3 so to do
that we don't require all this thing you
don't require a for loop here we'll
simply let's return 1 here just to just
to make sure it we are not getting any
error what we'll do is we'll check if my
value is or my n value is not equal to 1
okay if not equal to 1 we'll return a
value because if it if it is a it if it
is 1 will return 1 otherwise will return
otherwise it will
what will return n into fact of n minus
1 now see the advantage when you say I
want factorial of 5 so we'll say 5 into
4 factorial okay and when you have n
values for now we'll say 4 into 3
factorial and it goes on tilt about till
your value is 1 okay it's not value your
value is not one as soon as you get a
value which is 1 it will don't have one
value so in you indirectly you will be
getting since it follows tax so 1 will
give you 1 then 2 by 2 it will give you
2 - if I - it will give you 6 for Phi 2
will give you 24 and then eventually you
will get 21 24 5 factorial so let's make
it 5 again and let's run this similar
waiting what 120 and if I changed it to
6 you will be getting around 7 24 6
factorial cool so that's how if you have
to implement recursion so you can see we
are calling the same function so
function is calling itself simple so
that's how you find recursion in say
programming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
