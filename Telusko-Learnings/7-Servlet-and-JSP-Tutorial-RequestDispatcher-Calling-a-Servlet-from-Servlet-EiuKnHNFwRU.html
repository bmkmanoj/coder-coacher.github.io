beautiful methods which is do get and do
post in fact I just want to do one
change here let's continue this
discussion with get method and here also
I will say do get not do post and let's
verify this if it is working so I will
go back to my server as usual let's just
at the server and open your Firefox here
we go let's refresh and says submit it
works can see that it is a get request
it works perfectly now what I want is
let's say I want to add two numbers
which is happening in this case and I
also want to find a square of this
number now maybe I we have a scenario
where you want to add two numbers and
you want to find a square of that it's
very easy actually you connect you can
say k equal to K into K and then you can
find a square but this is a very simple
logic right let's say you want to build
a very complex logic and the logic which
is finding a square imagine this is a
very complex logic and then you are
already doing that in some other servlet
now in general what I'm talking about is
let's say if you have two servlet one is
a square circuit and one is ad servlet
can I call a solve it from a servlet it
may not make sense in this example why
do you call a sorry Thomas Abed but have
patience in the further videos we'll
discuss why do we call a search of a
servlet because we're also going to see
JSP and we'll see how all these three
works in the real life but time being
let's say your scenario where you want
to call a servlet from a servlet because
in this case what we are doing is we are
calling us of it from a page right what
I want is I want to get one more servlet
w do the way you do that is by simply
simple just waiting on your sources I'd
like that to be on your project and say
next I want to get a new class and I
want to put this class in comdata disco
I hope that's the same package we have
maybe the class name I want here is a
square servlet and this square servlet
will be extending a class which is HTTP
servlet okay let me H browse it and it's
here finish and you can see we got a
class which is equation explaining I
should be sublet instead of doing that
you can also do it here now in this I
want a method which is public void Duke
gate so that I can send out requests and
of course this do get need to exit two
things I will simply copy the
cold damage to type it so I will just do
that against that we got do get metal
now what I want is I want to find a
square of a number
okay first of all I want to call this
servlet later we'll try to find a square
how do you know that this survey is
getting call it's very simple just print
something I would say print writer out
equal to our e s dot getwriter this is
how you get the writer object so that I
can print you can write something on the
page once I got the right object and I
would say out dot println
and I would sprint hello to square
that's it I just want to print this
message now in this page index
traditional page I'm calling I'm setting
a submit request which we call ad this
ad will call ad salat but I want to see
the output which is hello to sq how do
you call that particular servlet it's
very simple actually just after this
line in fact you don't need to print
anything now because we are not going to
print this data here I want to print
that on the second servlet to call that
subject basically we have two options
one is request dispatcher and the second
one is redirect again I will talk about
this in detail in the theory video the
two difference between these two time
then let's focus only on dispatcher
request dispatcher so how do we use a
request dispatcher because we are
dispatching the request from one server
to the servlet the way you do that is by
creating an object of require dispatcher
you will say request dispatcher
and I would say Rd I can even use any
name but then how will you get the
instance of liquid dispatcher because
this is a interface unfortunately so the
way you do that is by saying our EQ
which is the quest object dot there's a
methyl colors get required dispatcher
this will give you the instance of
liquid dispatcher here you just have to
mention the subject name in this case
notice of it name basically you have to
mention the URL I would say I want to
find a square but the question arise how
will you use this square okay when you
send a square request how will you call
this one and we have one more thing we
have to also say RT dot forward by
passing those two beautiful objects
which is request and response so you
have to send a request object and a
response object and you can see there's
exception so I would simply say add or
throws there okay everything looks fine
and
it is to call this servlet but it will
not work why because if you remember if
you want to call any servlet we have to
make sure that in the web.xml file you
mentioned that solid mapping right so we
need to create this servlet and serve it
mapping for the sq servlet so the
request we are sending is for sq and we
have to change the name if you remember
it will say PQR here again it should be
a logical name but then just to show you
that it can be any name I'm using this
PQ l PQ l ABC ABC and this square
disabilities square servlet right so
when you send any question for s Q it
will call squared servlet so let's go
for the flow so when you click on submit
it will call add sublet from the adds of
it I'm dispatching the request to sq but
we don't know what is s Q is and for
that in the web.xml file you mentioned
when you wanna get an equation is Q you
have to call sq servlet and this is your
s Q servlet here now will this work
that's the question let's restart the
server or maybe I will just run this
here so I will still gonna answer on
server and let's enter some values I
will say 24 and this time it's a to
submit and you can see that we got hello
to sq so yes we are able to call a
servitor servlet now the next thing
would be I just don't want to print
hello to sq what I want to do is so this
servlet should be able to pass the data
the K value to the sq servlet how will
you do that because see we are this for
T the request right now there's one way
you can do that is by using a concept of
session management so normally when you
want to send data from one server to the
serve it or maybe you want to share data
between different servlets we use a
concept of session management now we'll
talk about session management later the
easiest way to send data from a servlet
from add server to sq servlet is think
about this this request dispatcher is
forwarding request object and response
object right and the same two objects
are being used here so don't you think
if you can put some data and the request
object anyway you are passing that
object right so can just put the value K
and request object something like this
can you say our EQ dot set attribute so
yes you can set an attribute by saying
hey
is a key value and the value itself is
key now what is to kzo this is a key and
this is a value so you're passing a key
value which is maybe whatever when
you're passing from the user and then
you are naming it case so that when you
want to refer this on the inner sublet
you can defer that with key so basically
we are able to send this key value from
ad survey to sq servlet but how do you
fetch it here now since you're setting
the attribute in the request object here
you will fetch it from the requester
object I would say int k equal to r eq
dot get attribute so we got to get
attribute and here you have to mention
case so we are passing the value from K
okay now it returns an object of an
object what you do is you have to
convert that into integer format so you
can simply type castrate so whenever you
have an object format you can type
Costra to int and that will perfectly
work and here I just want to point O
first of all we have to find a square of
a number
so it's a K equal to K into into K and
here I would say I don't want to print
the value I don't want to print hello to
sq and print result is K so now it will
so when you when you send a request now
it will first get added those two values
and then you will get this square as
well will this work let's verify let's
go to our index page or maybe I will
just simply start the server and then go
back to the browser
here I will say refresh and I will send
the value so that we can see if it is if
you're getting the square square of a
number 6 and 2 which is 8 addition and
then we do Square to find the square of
it is it should be 64 and because 64
right is that simple this is how you
call a sublet from a servlet so in the
add serve it you use the queries patcher
now another way we using which you can
do that that is redirect and we'll see
it right in the in the next video so I
hope you enjoyed this video let me know
