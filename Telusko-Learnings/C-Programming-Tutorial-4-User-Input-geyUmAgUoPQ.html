added two numbers now this value which
is for Antley you are defining this
values now let's say you want to take
this input from the user so you want you
will ask user to enter two values and
then user will give you two values which
is five and six then you have to add
those values and you will print so for
that what we'll do is we'll create this
variables and will not assign any value
right and instead of using two lines
here we can write only one line so we
can say int I comma J so we do not have
to write this line here so we can differ
we can declare all your variables in one
line of of submitter of similar types we
can even define we can even declare it k
here okay we don't have to declare it
again on this side simple and one more
thing what happens if I directly run
this code let me move all the comments
what happens if attacker is on this code
I have not assigned any value to I and J
so let's see what happens so if you run
this code it will still say build
succeed it will give you this input
value of I which is some a very big
number and the value of J is again a
very big number I returns a very big
number and why is the case because in C
when you have this variables it will
directly get if you if you are not
specifying the value it will take a
default value or what you say the
garbage value now when I talk about
garbage value it's a value so let's say
when you create a variable so from your
memory it will take a small location and
so on the in that location if you
already have a value it will fetch that
value there is a garbage value simple
knife along this again you will get the
same output let's use one more some
different variables so let's say we have
let's say a also and let's print the
value of C 1 a and let's say a and run
this you're getting a different value
for a which is 0 yeah maybe you might
in value which is for that say you say
be and you are printing be every time
you'll be getting a different value
fortunately we getting zero but we are
getting a garbage value Co now let's
assign a value now this time we'll take
values from user now how do i how to ask
user so we'll say printf so when you
want to show something to user so we
have to use printf and here we'll print
enter two values so this will prompt the
user to enter two values that means we
eight to accept the input also right now
to accept so to print something we use
printf and to take values we need to use
scanf so to print we use printf and to
take the value we use scanf now in this
scanner get to specify okay i want to
take the input I will take your input
but where to save the input so in to
specify I so you have to take the input
from user and save it in I but I is a
variable right and when you use a scanf
it will always ask you for the address
of i example whenever you shop online
you want you buy something you will
specify your name but you you want to
delivery at your home right so delivery
not will not be in your hand it will be
at your home so it is specify the
address in the same way to specify
address in scanf we have to use
ampersand sign so this ampersand sign
will give you the address of a variable
okay and we need to also define the type
of the value so the value type will be
of integer so we have to save specified
person d so whenever you say person d it
is n type so we are getting input for i4
j we can also use can F and then we can
specify a person D here and comma
ampersand J so we will take in to some
user now and we'll add those values let
us run this so it is asking for two
values one is let's say 4 and 5 the
output is 4 and 5 is o is either I am
using one more person D sorry sorry for
that
that's one again let's say 9 and
a to this time so you're getting 9 Plus
8 is 17 so we are taking input from user
simple and one more change I want to
print this this thing which is program
ended with execute exit code as zero I
want it to go on newline so anyway you
want to print something and you want to
go on newline we can simply say slash n
/n is a special symbol in C which will
take your it will take your cursor to a
new line because it me show you the
output so it says H and 5 it is 13 so
you can see it will take your cursor to
new line to print this we can also do
this for enter two values you can see I
am entering the value of the same line
and if you want to if you want it on new
line we can simply say /n and it says
okay I do values you can see the cursor
is here now it is 8 and 9 it is 17
simple so we have slash in for new line
we also have some other symbols we have
/b for backspace example if instead of
using slash and if I use slash I will do
that in next video
it will be better right so yeah so
that's that's how you you have you have
to take input from user using scanf so
that's it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
