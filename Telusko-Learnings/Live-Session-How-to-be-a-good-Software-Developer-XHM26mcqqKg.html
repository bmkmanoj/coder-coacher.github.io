topic we are talking about how to be a
good software developer now think about
this world you know in this world we
have to type of people people who know
programming and people who don't know
programming right and this is not a
field that we have to be very specific
example if you are doing if you want to
be a doctor that's a different very
that's a very different field wide if
you're talking about engineers or you
talk about chemical engineering so not
everyone should know about chemical not
everyone should know should know you
don't know they're not to be done to
have to be a doctor right and they can
be a programmer right example doesn't
matter from which feel you are if you
can be a doctor you can learn
programming you can be a programmer if
you are a chemical engineer you can you
know you can just you can learn
programming and you can you can be a
programmer right in fact as for survey
if you talk about the best I best
programmers they are actually from
different fields so what they have done
something else earlier and now they are
doing there they have learned
programming and then now there are
programmers there are lots of people who
have done this right so programming is
not just you have to complete a degree
and when you say you want to make a
software not a programmer you know you
didn't have to be a programmer to
yourself to make a software you have to
be a developer to be to make a software
so in case if you want to make a
software you have to be a developer not
a programmer in fact you can do a
programming you can do programming if
you are a programmer but to be to make a
software you have to be developer okay
so i think my streaming is good there's
no issue with the streaming is there any
of this Jimmy all right that's good I
have a call who's that
yeah so
alright that's that seems good yeah so I
was talking about it so you if you want
to make a soft you have to be a
developer now what it means to be a
developer you know when you join neit
cause it so you are doing computer
engineering or maybe you are doing maybe
you are doing a BS CIT or any of the
free any of this course what you do
initially you learn basic concepts way
to understand about you understand what
is computer then you try to understand
how to what are different different
devices in the computer like we have cpu
we have that cabinet is a cpu right but
fortunately that's not a CP rights apo
is just that small chip so you need to
understand what is the basic computer
hardware parts right once you have once
you have understood that what is the
basic computer hardware parts then you
have to understand how actually that
hardware works so to make any hardware
work we acquire something called as you
just just hold on a doubt i'm thought
about as much about much trimming I just
make sure you just go to the end I guess
you're starting from start is it life
yeah yeah so we to understand how yeah
the scene since this is my second live
streaming so I am bit concerned about
this trimming okay so there might be
some something I will be asking okay in
between okay so uh sure says I'm not
audible what about of those I'm audible
okay so i should say i have to adjust on
your microphone i guess yeah you have
maybe you have to unmute you it's a new
tube notice from our cydroid he has to
just on its yeah you have to yeah
exactly i should she have to on your
speaker yeah so
I was talking about so then you have to
understand how the hardware works right
and in order to make any hardware work
what you need is actually something else
programming right to make any hardware
work requires software right so in order
to make the in order to make the
hardware work you have to use softwares
so the whole idea of creating a software
was for hardware right think about seven
years back so let's say seven years back
you want to buy a phone which phone you
will buy of course nokia phone right so
seven years bag if you buy a nokia phone
and what will be the configuration of
that Nokia phone right a you know no one
no one checks which OS you work in that
Nokia phone so in that five to six years
back if you want to buy a phone you will
buy a phone which has a good camera out
it has it should have a good speaker and
all the stuff no one was knowing which
OS we use in nokia phones but nowadays
no one is concerned about the hard way
we only concerned about the software
right i want to buy an android phone and
depend upon your budget you will change
the configuration let's say you have a
good budget of course you will go for a
high-end phone right if you are running
out of a budget you will buy us a small
phone with low configuration right so
what we want is android phone doesn't
matter which hardware we use and
nowadays we have a craze of apple phones
right so now we want I OS doesn't matter
which iphone you buy maybe you are
buying iphone 4s or maybe iphone fires
right so nowadays more important party
software right so earlier if you say
which is more important so the answer is
hardware because what makes the thing
works is wave works then you need to
understand how to make a software or how
to write a code so that it will use your
hardware so you might be knowing about
the assembly programming right so using
assembly you can actually control your
CPU so you can write the ok just let me
just
I don't know people have people of
people are knowing this so what you can
do is people who are watching me you can
just share this link on facebook so that
your friends also can join this because
only 47 people are watching it out of
that two machines are mine yeah that's
bit embarrassing right people not be
people are not watching you you're
streaming that's weird yeah so you have
to understand how software and hardware
actually works now after that let's say
you want to be a developer so people
think okay let's learn a language let's
learn java let's learn a dot and in fact
I get lots of questions from on facebook
on youtube i want to be a programmer i
have never done a programming i'm from
different field in commerce now how can
i be a developer and then in that
question itself dimension if i learn
java can i mix office and I don't know
what answers i can give I I say okay you
can be a developer by learning Java but
that's not the actual thing right you if
you learn if you learn a programming
language you can code right but you
cannot make a software because making a
software require lots of thing the first
thing you have to solve your clients
problem right you have to see when you
weigh talk about this word everyone
makes software right so when you make a
software of course why we make a
software to solve this real world
problem so software is something which
is which works in virtual world and it
solves real world problem right let's
example I want it I want to chat with
with my friend so of course Jan com
who's the founder of whatsapp he build
what's up for me and not for me but for
everyone right but I have the
requirement right so I wanted us I
wanted some software using which I can
chat the people then I wanted to
broadcast myself so now we have YouTube
right so this is some real world this is
some virtual void solution for real
world problems right so as a developer
you have to understand what our client
needs right of course we have to if you
know about sdlc we have seven stages
right we go from requirement gathering
to or the last step which is
maintenance right so in that first you
have to take the requirements so first
you have to understand what your client
need now even if you have your own idea
let's say you want to make your own
software in that also you to understand
what you want because sometimes what we
want is what we don't know what we want
right we think we want this but actually
we want something else so you have to
understand what you want second you have
to select the best design and when I'm
saying design I'm talk not talking about
the UI part i'm talking about the
software design I mean the flow of your
software there's something else you x
which is a which is user experience so
you need to make sure that you are
providing the perfect user experience to
your user ok I'm not saying you have to
be you have to build an awesome user
interface you have to give a awesome
user experience you know when you go to
Facebook I don't like Facebook because
of there because of those those colors I
like Facebook because they provide a
better user experience right so you have
to make sure that you you understand the
you understand how to impress clients
right the next step is so that's your
requirement and you got to design the
word next to build a software you need
to understand how to solve how to solve
a given problem using some such
solutions so you know any are in your
curriculum you will be having a subject
called as a data structures now data
structure is one of the most important
subject for a developer now it doesn't
matter you want to be a programmer or
not doesn't matter in which failure you
want to go in IT you should know data
structures because let's say you want to
be into database you want to be a
maintenance person you want to interview
you want to get into tech support for
everything you need to understand data
structures right because if you don't
know how to store data into database how
would we know how would how would you
know that how to work with a database
right because you should know how it
actually works so in data structures you
learn lots of stuff you learn about how
your data are getting stored how to face
that data in which sequence you can
store data how
fast you can access data example if we
talk about the searching algorithms you
know we have lots of searching
algorithms we have a binary search we
have linear search we have we have lots
of search option we have lots of
searching algorithms right so what you
do you all you first you first
understand how to search something and
even if you let pleasure using lynners
linear search so what we do in linear
search is we start from the first
element we go to the last element let's
say you have ten elements and you want
to search something so what you do you
will start from the first element you
will go to the last element and you will
find the element in between right
instead of that you can go for money
search but you should know how money
such works right so once you understand
what is data structures you have this
are searching algorithm you understand
different algorithms like sorting
algorithms you should know about what is
stack what is heap memory because if we
don't know what is memory then how will
you how can you wake make variables
right example when I say in Java we have
added least and then we have linked list
of course the heap memory other stuff
right so you have to make sure that you
know this basic data structure you
should know example in Java we have a
concept of a linked list and then we
have additives so you should know what
is linked list for that you need to
understand what is data structures so if
you want to be a good programmer a good
developer the one subject which is very
important your life is data structures
now what next then you need to
understand what is database right
because when you are building a software
of course you require to you need to
store that data into database so you
require a data base there you need to
understand what is the concept of
database you should know SQL all the
stuff some people say they don't like
SQL but guys or don't have a choice if
you are walking in this field because
everything is for data right so you have
to use database so you should know SQL
and all the stuff okay
I'm not sure people if people are
trimming it here okay so you need to
understand why the database right and
now what next so now let's say you you
know data structures you know database
now the next step is yet now you have to
yeah they need to understand what is
programming right so normally we start
with c programming right so we learn c
programming then we go for c++ then we
go for java then we go for a dotnet
framework in which you have C sharp you
have vb you have a SP so you have you
have all these languages but the fact is
these are not the only languages you
have so approximately we have ten
thousand languages available in this
world right I'm talking about
programming language okay not the normal
language I'm talking about we have
10,000 programming languages right out
of which 300 programming languages have
been used in industry and out of which
25 programming language are normally of
frequently use of factly and the fact is
we don't know one of the languages right
so there are lots of people they hate
programming I don't know why but the hip
hate programming so you should be master
of one programming language so you
should be jack off all I mean you should
know at least 10 programming languages I
should mashup one when has a 10
programming languages you will think
okay who will learn 10 programming
languages that's okay we no see we know
c++ example how much how much
programming I know let's let's let's
test so i no see I know c++ i know c
sharp I know Java that's it for Jolla I
know bit of PHP I know bit off I know
bit of asp i know vb dotted framework I
know about what is android yeah but I
know it comes with Java right ah yeah I
also know about Swift right so seven
that's bad right I know only seven
languages but you need to make sure that
you should know that least 10
programming languages not now but in at
least three to four years so when you
join a company in that three to four
years you have to make sure you get down
but that's okay that's okay keep it
there keep it you're going to make sure
that you learn at least 10 / Grammy
languages are ya I also know about
JavaScript by token of our JavaScript so
you should know at least 10 programming
languages and you should be master one
example I know Java okay I'm good with
Java I cannot say best but I know Java
i'm good with java right so that is that
is that's what I know since you since I
know Java now I can learn new languages
right example when I when I was locked
life you know any of the languages it is
easier to learn the other language now
okay so you have to be master of one
programming language now let's say okay
you know now you know one programming
language thoroughly you know start to
end example you know Java from start to
end now what next now you have to know
how can you use Java to build software
now for that what we do is there are
lots of website where you can test
yourself which is there are competitive
programming websites example if you can
go for hiker earth you can go for hikers
rank so these are the websites where you
can test your skills so what we have
there is you have to go there you have
to I know you have to the you have to
compete you have to complete some
assignment so they will give you some
task and you have to solve those tasks
example usually they will give you some
simple code they will ask you to sort
these elements using your own algorithm
simple right we have to get your own
algorithm there then step by step
ultimately if you cross some levels you
will you will know the power of yourself
I mean you know we have lots of kaplan
we you know we are very very very much
capable but we don't test ourselves so
you have to test yourself by giving
those tests so you have to you have to
be very competitive you have to compete
with professionals right not just
beginners you know if you go to hacker
earth we have professional programmers
who who go there who solve those
problems and once you solve them you
will get that confidence right so that's
why that's very important so make sure
you go to a hacker rank or hacker earth
that's a mosquito I guess here so you
have to go to this website and you have
to
oh we have to compete now what next so
let's say you are competing now so
that's enough is it that you have to be
you have to learn new things every day I
mean how can you learn every day in fact
i have also done a video which is
already uploaded on youtube you have to
upgrade your knowledge every day I mean
when I say every day let's imagine your
your you are into IT or you want to
you're into dotnet so what you can do is
every day you have to learn one person
of something new so let us say dotnet is
very big you have to learn one percent
every day so if you learn one percent
every day in one week you will learn
seven percent of the concept what about
in one month it will be thirty percent
right let's imagine you are learning for
one year it will be three sixty-five
percent of that concept so just imagine
if you learn something for one of one
percent of that subject how much will
you will know in one year but there's a
catch here if you miss one day okay so
let's say you are doing for that you're
doing that for one week and then you are
taking a break on Sunday so if you miss
one day it will reduce my the five
percent of your time okay so so you will
go down five percent so that's the
drawback so you have to update your
knowledge every day then question is
from where to learn a programming
language right so that's a very
important question to answer so let's
say you have you now you know what is
hardware you know what is software you
know the data structure you know what is
database you know what is how to compete
on this web sites like hacker rank
Michael earth now what next now it's
time to build the software now if I if I
assume that you are still in college you
want to be a programmer what I will
suggest is in one week create one mini
project of course you when you go to
hackers rank you have to do that because
in on hacker rank people do that they
you know they normally they will give
you some task and you have to solve
those task right but let's say if you
are not doing that so you're what you
can do is create your own concept
normally we have lot
of ideas into a minima mind right so
what we do it in daily life is we we
when we go for a walk when you go for a
tea you get some new concept you know
this should this is the software i need
but no one has ever built that software
why don't you build itself i know you
can just build that software by yourself
by doing this you will learn lots of
different things because making software
is not just about programming it's also
about the domain knowledge example if
you are building an application for
facebook or for social network like
facebook then you know the domain of
social network so next time when you
build us off for social network you have
some idea about social network right so
you can build a software for e-commerce
now next time when you build a software
for e-commerce you've been knowing about
the domain called as e-commerce for
banking so before joining a company
create 1111 project for all different
domains so that when you join a company
it will be very easy easier for you to
add just with that environment so
example when you join a company there
what they are working with oil so they
are working with is oil manufacturing
company all refined company so you can
join them because you know how oil
factory works right because if you have
built a software for them of course you
will be knowing that okay so what I will
suggest let me do a quick recap what we
have discussed you should know
everything about the computer hardware
you should know how software works you
should know about data structures you
should know about database and you
should know about you should know 10
programming languages not in detail but
basics of those languages because once
you work with one programming language
you can use the advantages which you
have in that language in your in the
language you like example in JavaScript
we have closures right so can the
implement closures in JavaScript which
is there in Java I mean you can think in
that will write a few if you know
multiple languages then you have to
compete so go to the competitive
websites and you have to compete and
next you have to increase your knowledge
every day by one person and very very
can
you can go to youtube you can there are
lots of resources available for free in
a way to pay when you can get everything
for free so he can go to my channel
which is the iskele earnings and you can
just you know if you go to playlist to
try this go to my channel go to playlist
have a look on the number of videos that
have created you know if you follow at
least one playlist in a day you can
learn lots of things right so those are
not the they are very useful of course
so try that and you have to increase
your knowledge the second thing is I
also have a website visitors escort com
you can just go to telescope calm and
you can you can go to the playlist
section you can watch the videos they're
also write to that serve you can
increase your you can be a good software
developer okay so now we'll start with
the questions okay from way we got some
questions here an elective what okay so
we have we got the first question from
okay guys you can ask your questions now
if you want to ask any questions
okay sanket Giada are you take are you
thinking of doing a seminar on advanced
java envious IT I would love to it's my
college of course like a why don't I so
vs idea is my college if you want my
seminar there let me know okay I would
love to do that so you can ask your
teachers they can call me anytime in
fact I think they know me they have my
number so you can call you can talk to
settle so you can talk to us if sir and
i will be there okay shivam if you want
to ask him some questions go on
okay eleven people are watching no one
want to ask a question
so you have a thought you have a
question with you
okay streaming is good
ok
so next question is from dodge what do
you think is the easiest and most
proficient way to learn a language very
good question the thing is to learn a
language in easiest way is first
understand what is programming in fact
you know when you learn let me tell you
my experience how I learn c programming
you know in colleges the tea they will
teach you the c programming concept
right so in my first lecture I was not
knowing anything about programming you
know it was quicker a bit of surprise
for me to understand how that
programming is what is programming so we
were having a session of C programming
the first session and then one of the
best professor in mycology he took that
session you know so it came on stage and
he started teaching us what is C
programming and the first code he has
written of this on the board was had a
world and we were so happy you know it's
that simple just right main open the
brackets and then write hello world
that's it but the problem starts when he
started with addition of two numbers and
this think about this when you write a
code for addition of two numbers in c
programming you write ten lines right
and what the output you get is addition
of two numbers so let's say you want to
add 2 and 3 the output is five right so
what you do you write the code for five
to six line just to add two numbers so
that's very weird right so you know you
should understand why we require
programming because at that time I was
not knowing the importance of
programming so first you should
understand why we need to do programming
okay because you want to build software
then you to understand what that
programming will offer you so I was
talking about my experience so uh how i
learned c programming so i was i first
learned about the concepts of
programming what is variable what is if
condition what is loop and all the stuff
once you know that stuff you have to
practice which each and every concert
example when you learn if condition you
should understand where to use if
condition because we also have switch
right so it was easy to understand where
to use if and where do you switch
because there are two different things
look similar but they will be used in
two different situations example I will
never use switch for if and out for for
this even odd number but I will never
use if for if I pass a number and I want
the word format of dash because if I
have multiple once of once we have done
with for loop I have taken some examples
for patterns you know those star
patterns this the triangle stars and
then then diamond shaped diamond shape
stars the advantage of learning those
constitute concepts are you will
understand how to solve a given problem
right because I cannot ask you to build
a banking application at this time so
you can build that design you can build
those patterns of it so that you will
understand how to convert a basic
problem into into software the next
thing is you have to understand you need
to understand lots of syntax right you
should understand different keywords so
once you know all the keywords you
should wants to know all the syntax
start implementing it in a particular
assignment so great assignment and solve
it and trust me if you do this in one in
15 days you will learn the basic syntax
in the next 15 days you will understand
how to use that syntax and that's it you
have learned a new language and you can
do this for every language the
advantages if you learn c programming it
is very easy to learn C++ if you have
learn c plus way it is very easy to
understand java language so if you go in
sequence you can learn every thinking of
doing dotnet goes in two months holiday
will not be right or some new language
to learn you're asking the wrong
question to log person Rahul ok so
dotnet is good if you want to be into
Microsoft world because Microsoft have
they have their own environment so if
you want to work into Microsoft
environment of course you should learn
dotnet example if you want to work on
Windows platform if you want to work
with Windows Azure which is a cloud
server for Windows of course the only
option you have is window dot net right
but let's say I don't know what you want
to be in the in future if you want to be
into open source world don't go for
dotnet
if you want to be in Microsoft Word of
course go for dotnet but let's let's
choose if you want to go into open
source what options you have if you are
going for dotnet go for it okay don't
think about it but if you want to be
into other fields if you are thinking
about open source i would suggest go for
python initially if you know do if you
don't know python because that's a
trendy now it's not that you buy the
only language you should know is python
but the thing is you should know python
even if you are doing if your java
programmer you should know python if you
even if you are dotting program you
should know python because that becomes
a but you know the trend line train
language now so i will suggest go for
learn python first in 15 days then learn
you can go for PHP if you don't know all
i will suggest if you want to be into
mobile world web world everywhere learn
java in fact I'm you know I'm very
biased towards Java so if you're asking
me different new language I will always
say Java but I would also just go for
Python if you want okay that's a very
good language to learn in fact it is
easier to learn Python then compared to
java ok manohar your videos helped me a
lot in passing mics oh that's that's
awesome you you clear your exam because
of me that's awesome you can just send
some sweets to my office you know I love
sales that's awesome Thanks Manoa Manoa
for mentioning that because this is what
motivates me to create new videos so i
will do that for sure I so next is from
shivam I am graduating from BCA please
suggest me for future okay so if you
want to be too I to field average i
would suggest go for MC after BCA
because mca will give you that edge to
get into industry so i would suggest yes
go for mca you have to give first you
have to give your CT exam then go for
mca you will learn lots of things you
have to spend three more years three
more last year's right because you have
tired of getting education from 15 years
right so go for mca okay that will be
very helpful for you
and once you have computed IM see you
then during mca you can do certification
of the languages you like example if you
like java get java certified if you if
you like a.net get down to 35 but get
certified in your in your college itself
okay oh okay next from gordo sharma so
may I ask you a question what are the
main topic that you should know in
advance Java as per current industry
demand okay good question because if you
compare so question is if you want to be
if you are going to get into industry
what are the topics we should know in
advanced java okay so if you talk about
the college curriculum what we need in
colleges is we require sup with the
devil teach you sublet they will teach
you JSP in fact there are some colleges
they also teach this starts framework
but as my industry I would suggest you
should learn what launched towards so
start with sublet go for JSP then then
go for starts framework and go for
spring MVC in fact the complete spring
framework at least four modules of
spring you can go for spring then you
can go for spring MVC you can go for
spring aop those concepts and high but
net with with JP because if you know
hibernate you will you will understand
j.pierre they are almost same all right
so don't learn those things and that's
it that's in that I guess that's enough
also mavin mavin is a build tool all
right okay next we have a question from
Prashant ok can we use asp.net from
developing professional website or do
you have to use open source language you
can use you can use asp.net to make
professional website in fact there are
lots of websites which are actually
built using asp.net in fact if we talk
about my my bank website we just rambla
we tell bank it is belt you it is built
in asp.net so there are lots of websites
was actually built using asp.net but i
would suggest get into open source world
because
I feel dotnet is it will not be there
for a longer time now because we have
open source world everyone believes in
open source now in fact so i would
suggest easier is PHP learn PHP make
professional websites but if you want to
make it secure if you want to make it
stable go for ruby on rails right just
to make websites but if you want to also
get into enterprise world it is java so
first reference PHP Ruby on Rails and
then go for java okay next from so we
have 10 more minutes let's go answer two
more questions could you please post
videos on restful web services Avinash
okay okay let's let's let me try that ok
because it takes lots of time to build
videos on restful api ice okay what I
will do I will make just you know some
of the basics concept of vegetable API
okay I can try that shortly shivam is
his basic is is big in any programming
language is enough for getting job which
is all depend upon which company you
join let's say if you are joining a big
company then no need if you know the
basic concepts that's enough because
they will ask they will they will check
your basic knowledge right once you have
once you know the basic knowledge they
can train you on different programming
languages but if you are joining a
start-up then you should know complete
language at least one complete language
you should be much of one ok so manohar
Washburn's videos in youtube but they
confused me a new boss ranch and are
very helpful for big nose thank you okay
that's good bye now thank you following
your videos on android keep playing
after okay that's awesome say i guess
you are reading reading that book from
the outliers from i forgot the author
named Galman something i forgot the name
of the author okay can you suggest me
some reference to learn oracle and
spring okay you want to learn both so
for spring you can you can download the
official reference book of spring so you
can just go to spring dot IO website
okay that's the one of the best place to
learn spring so you can go to the
website like a spring dot IO you can
download the reference book in PDF
format in epub format you can also read
it in your mobile phone so that is what
I do when I learn spring for the eccles
you can learn basics of what I call from
my channel so in on my channel i have i
have some videos on oracle also okay so
you can do that and okay and then you
can know which book to which book to
refer for radical i guess you can just
go you do you you can just just use
youtube search for that like a website
you have reference then so you can also
go to a local official website to learn
oracle but for spring it is spring dot I
of for sure you will not find any any
good resources other than that prashant
if you if i go for mca from ignore with
job reference experience is that fine
yeah if you are experienced if you
already into industry having experience
of one or two ears go fall ignore okay
that will be helpful because they just
one certificate but if you if you're a
fresh shirt never go for part time if
you are official never go for fight part
time because you went full time people
they don't get job nowadays so como full
time as a fresher and then you can join
a company if you are if you already have
an experience of one or two years you
can do ignore will do okay I know her

think that's it when people are living
now
okay we have one more question
and get you Prashant is working based on
bites necessary and get your question
vasant
I mean like in programming do I have to
think about
what a talking passions okay the Sun
duquesne ok small bites about small
bites we're talking about the byte data
type in Java I'm not sure so we're
talking about bits one is one sign zeros
that's that is what my my colleagues are
suggesting here ok do one thing question
send me a mail about this and I will
surely the next framing soon so I will
let you know on Facebook or YouTube yeah
ok person are talking about a memory
west example when you build a software
you have to make sure that you are using
less memory because it will lead to two
things first it will not make your go it
will not make your this stuff the what
what we say so make sure when you will
build a software don't use much memory
