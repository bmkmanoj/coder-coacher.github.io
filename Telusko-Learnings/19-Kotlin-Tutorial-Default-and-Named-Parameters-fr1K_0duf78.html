different icicle earnings and in this
video we'll talk about default
parameters and name parameters again
this is something new in Cortland which
was not in Java so let's try to
understand what it what it means let's
imagine if you want to calculate a
interest again let's not go for this ad
or max method here so time in let's
let's minimize this I don't want to go
for that second column let's focus on
this one this window and let me just
remove this two methods from here or two
functions and this one also so what I
want to do is I want to create a one
more function here and I will call this
function as calculate amount now again
this calculation doesn't matter what
exactly what exactly the coefficient
would be let's focus on the concept so
let's say we have a calculate amount met
function which returns the amount with
the interest example if I if I if a
person says hey I want to know the final
amount so I will use fat where and I
will say hey give me a final amount what
will be the final cost now that will be
let's say if I call this final amount
example you when you pay something on
PayPal or when you when you send some
money to someone using a PayPal account
so people will charge for person extra
height so what do I do here is I want to
let them well I'd let people know that
when when you send me an amount let's
say if you are sending thousand one
hundred dollars to be you have to make
sure that you also add the transaction
fee which is four dollars how can we do
that so in that case or when you send an
amount let's say if you are sending an
amount which is maybe fifty dollars it
should return you the value in in
dollars again but let's say I want to
return in int again venues when you say
percentage it might be returning in
double value let's say I want to return
in int and this will accept the amount
so the amount would be accepted in
amount : and so this should return the
amount in after calculation so what I
will do is I would say hey return the
amount so return the amount so return
the amount by adding a interest so how
do you add interest here again if you
know the formula of interest it is you
know
amount into into interest divided by 100
but then what I will do here is I will
say amount plus into a point
I mean 0.04 so when I say 4 percent it
is 0.04 right and that's it when we got
this calculation but then this will
return this will result in double value
right so what I will do is say I don't
want to go for double value so I will
give a complete type complete bracket
here and say dot 2-inch now the way you
can convert a double value to int in in
Cortland is by using a method for us to
end so when we have a double value and
if you want to convert that into ain't
we say dot to int so this double value
here will be converted into Ainge and
that's what you are returning so the
final amount would be let's let's see
what I was the answer is I will say
print Ln print or what's happening so
print print Ln and I will print the
final amount here so let's try to
understand what is the output and if I
run this code rest like right like this
and say run first okay so there's one
solidness remove this because we got
some others in this file as well let me
remove this code from here okay that's
very bad let's go back to our coordinate
files so why it's not getting there now
yeah let's run this code now let's
right-click and say run first code first
check first code dot K T and you can see
the amount so it is 52 right and that's
part these total amount is after the
interest right so when you give the
total amount I mean the you when you
give them a normal amount plus the
interest rate you will get this value
which is 52 right so if you are sending
a $50 to me from PayPal you have to sign
52 because PayPal will cut my two
dollars there right so this is the what
this is what you do in on PayPal but
then let's say you are sending some big
amount and then we had a discussion hey
I see since I know you I will give you I
will not charge you four percent I will
charge you only three percent extra so
in this case how so I don't want to
change this value I don't want to change
this from four zero points
four to 0.03 because again changing the
source code is not a good thing every
time right so whatever you do he is I
will either give an option to a user to
also send the interest so I will say
comma and you can also send me the
interest so I will say interest and the
type of interest we double back because
because it would be 0.04 or 0.03 or 0.05
so let's say if I hate someone and still
you say say I want to send some money
then of course I will charge him five
percent right now you have to change you
have to always send this value so I have
to always send this 0.04 and here you
will multiply this with interest again I
forgot to tell you that in Courtland
when we use doubles we have to use
capital D unlike Java in Java we use
small D right in fact we use small I and
small D in Java but in case of
coordinate we have to use capital
letters for I mean capital for this for
the for the data types here and it's
like this re other okay these are this
this is your wrapper classes remember in
Java so let's run this code let's see
what happens now I'm not in this code
and as you can see we got the answer is
52 as well but let's say if I if I have
someone and say hey you can send me $3
not you can send me the interest I will
give you the interest of 3% in that case
you can you can see this will change to
51 again since I'm changing it to ain't
it is typecasting gate it is removing
that dot values but that's fine you can
send me $51 there right but then don't
think about this if you know that most
of the time we have zero zero zero point
zero four then by you have to specify
that it should be default right so what
we can also do is we can assign a
default value here so we can say zero
point zero four now the advantage would
be a user may choose not to send this
value because if you say if you are
going for the default values why to
specify zero point zero four you can
simply you can simply pass you can
simply pass 50 and your job is done
because when you're passing 50 this will
be assigned and if you are passing some
other value let's say okay let's run it
let's go with this one if I run this
code of course will be getting 52 now
because we are we have a default
interest which is of zero point zero
four but let's say if I if for if my
friend says hey I am sending you some
money so
I will charge in 0.03 in this case this
zero point zero point zero four which is
default value will be replaced by 0.03
and let's run this code and you can see
the guard 51 so this is called as
default parameters again you can have
multiple parameters here or you can have
one you can have two so just do not just
look at it look at this if you're coming
from JA background we know this concept
right we can have a method with the same
name but different parameters and that
concept is called as method overloading
gear now codling says don't worry if you
want to pass one parameter that's fine
with me it will be assigned to the
amount if you are passing two parameters
then that scenario this the default one
will be replaced right so if you have to
do the same thing in Java you might have
to create two methods right one only for
amount and one for amount and interest
both so you have to get two methods
there in Cortlandt you get an option of
default of default parameters where you
can assign the value by default right so
that's the advantage of using
quadrillenium
but then I just have one problem how can
you call this how can you call this in
Java so okay example if I say hey I want
to call because you cannot pass one
parameter in Java right because this is
a method which takes two parameters so
what I will do again is I will use a
first code code K T dot I will call this
method calc amount and if I say control
space here or not here in fact it is
giving me option there itself is it yes
so can you see that it is asking for two
values it is asking for amount it is
asking for interest as well if I specify
the amount and if I don't specify the
interest is giving me an error
it says you have to also mention the
interest so will give a comma and we'll
say 0.04 so it is compulsory in case of
Java when you're sending the value to
specify the interest rate as well
because this is all this is not optional
but then I want to achieve this right I
may want to send only one parameter I
don't want to send the okay I don't want
to send the interest I just want to send
the amount in this case your partner
should create two methods right one for
the amount and one for the amount and
interest both so you don't have to do
that you can simply use an annotation
here which is antedate JVM overloads now
what it will do as you're coddling code
will create two methods of this and it
will be done automatically right you
don't have to think about it just right
Adelaide JVM overloads it will create
two methods one with amount as a
parameter and one with amount and double
as a parameter and this is awesome right
example if I run this code now to run
Java code now I was so right click and
run mean okay okay I'm not printing the
value here I should I should do that
right so I will say plain okay I will do
that we in the system dot out dot it's
print and in itself just to save some
time okay now if I love this code once
again you could you can see the output
is 72 right which is working if I change
if I if I don't want to pass the
interest value as this I can
also also since eyes interest value are
0.08 let's say if I have someone who may
want to go for more interest or maybe
PayPal is charging more so you can see
we can change the value as well so you
can pass one parameters you can pass two
parameters you just have to use this one
annotation here which is JVM overloads
right or something right so this is
about default parameters but then okay
so once we have talked about default
parameters let's minimize this again and
let's come back to this one now cotton
also provides you one more feature which
is called as named parameters now why do
we use named parameters here it's
because let's say if you are passing
these two values now sometime you know
when you read your code it looks
difficult to understand what is the
first parameter what is a second
parameter I mean you can see the code
here itself but let's say if you have a
very big application and the method you
or your dimension the function you are
mentioned here is somewhere somewhere
else how would you know in which in
which sequence you have to pass the
parameters so in that case if you are
writing the name if you I think the name
of the parameters it will be easier for
you to remember right so you can say
amount : and you have to specify on both
the side you have to say interest : or
sorry not : how is it :
expecting a bracket where is that
bracket there okay so I guess it is
equal to avoid yeah so it is equal to
not :
my right yeah so we have to mention
amount is equal to 50 and interest is
equal to 0.03 right the advantage is it
is more readable and if you even if you
don't know the sequence that's fine
because you can interchange this
sequence okay example I can write
interest first I mean even if I'm
expecting that later in the in the
method which we are defined here but you
can send in any sequence because you are
mentioning the that you are mentioning
the name of the parameter itself so you
are mentioning the parameter name here
so interest would be 0.03 and amount is
50 so when you pass the value it will be
going in that particular format right so
this is the advantage of using named
parameters again this is not there in
Java so this code will not work when you
write in Java but then only in this code
it will it will surely work so these are
the two things which are there in which
are there in cognitive issues which is
not there in Java so that's it I hope
you enjoyed let's to the output let's
see the output and you can see it works
