telesco learnings and in this video
we'll talk about wrapper classes so
Weber classes is been there and from jar
one point Java the first version which
is one point zero and so the in this we
have two more concept introduced which
is auto boxing and auto endorsing in 1.5
now before we talk about Java Java is a
purely object-oriented right but in Java
also we use this primitive values which
is ain't float and double so this all
thing which comes from C programming and
C++ or C programming which is procedural
right so if you are using this thing
which is primitive data types so this is
not objects right this if you create int
I so this is not object this is values
right so we've got what we want now we
want to use objects so let's say if you
want to store a value 5
you have to use objects and so of
storing into a int value you have to use
in class of which obligating object so
for every primitive value we have a
class so for int we have integer for
float we have fluid for double we have
double so these are all classes right so
this is primitive datatypes and these
are classes for care we have character
right so for every specific for every
primitive datatype we have a class here
now so how can you store the values here
so we can simply say let's say we have
int i equal to 5 so the value of i here
is 5 let me create a integer object i
will say this as III so that's my
variable name so we have integer III and
we can say new integer and you can pass
the value 5 now both this I and 5 they
have the same value which is 5 right but
this this is an object here and this is
a simple value and Java says everything
should be an object right that's why
this is an object here so instead of
using int we should always use integer
right this is off passing 5 we can also
pass a also if I also pass I which is
the variable here so we are passing this
variable I here right so this concept of
putting your primitive value inside and
object is called as boxing okay and from
one point five we can also write integer
I I equal to or let's name it as JJ
equal to I right so we can directly
assign a primitive value to the integer
object and this is also boxing but this
boxing is called as since it is
automatically doing that stuff for you
the Java compiler it is called as Auto
boxing so this stuff here this is boxing
and this is auto boxing right so it's
that simple we can use it with anything
we can use it with float double and
character right now let's say we when we
are assigning a value of int to integer
this call is boxing right what if we
have a new variable which is Jake here
and the value of J will be coming from
JJ so we can say JJ dot so to fetch the
value we can simply say int value okay
so when you say int value it will fetch
the integer value or the int int value
of JJ right because this int returns the
value int here right so it returns the
datatype end sounds good so this concept
of getting the primitive value from the
object is called as unboxing so ensure
this we can also die a right let's say
we have int k equal to JJ so we are
assigning a value of an object which is
an integer object right to the value
which is K which is primitive and it
guess yes this is auto unboxing okay so
this is auto unboxing now question arise
well we will be using this concept of
boxing auto boxing primitive wrapper
classes so let's say you are walking
with a collection so if you have not
seen collection is very simple we have a
list of value so let's say I'm creating
a add a list of values so we'll say this
is values equal to new array analyst
right and then we can assign values to
this address we can just import the
package we can directly assign values to
this least we can say values dot add we
can add five
we can add let us say seven right so for
us this is int values I'd so five is int
value 7 is int value so this is in type
and we can also add we can say add let
us say Naveen now I do not want I do not
want this list of values should have
novena should only have the numbers so
far should be supported seven should be
supported but but it not sure it should
not support this string here for that we
have a concept of connect collection and
genrich's called as generate
specifically and we have to specify the
type of value you want to you want to
work with so let's see if I specify int
so I want both the end we have to
specify end
so this analyst will only supports int
values now but there is a syntactical
problem here it says it is a wrong
syntax it's because this added list only
works with integer class because if you
want talk about the latest frameworks
they only work with the classes not with
the primitive values so this array says
okay you can only it will only support
integer values that means this five is
integer value but hold on we are we are
not writing new integers right we are
not writing this way that means it is it
is boxing the value using auto boxing
concept okay and we can also fetch the
value with the help of auto unboxing so
wrapper classes are widely used whenever
you want to work with collection
framework or advanced frameworks okay so
if you are still the question is should
we use whopper classes yes whenever you
work with frameworks you should use
wrapper classes but hold on oh let's say
you want to only work with some variable
let's say beyond we want to use a for
loop right so let us say we want to use
a for loop so should I write integer a
counter equal to 0 or should I write int
here so what should be better and the
answer is int because the processing of
int work is much faster than processing
of integer because int is primitive and
integer is a class so when to use
integer when you work with frameworks
when to use int when you are working
with loops when you where you want
then the features so touches from the
upper classes so it is wrapper
unwrapping boxing unboxing and all the
stuff so thanks so much for watching and
