this code will work or not so before
continuing with the video just go to the
comments section and mention your answer
now with answer I mean will it work or
not also mention the description why you
think this will work or why you think
this will not work and then then we'll
continue with the video so I just hope
you have answered the video and now it's
time to understand the answer so this
code will not work and why diagonals see
in this video
so welcome back any assistance of energy
from toys for learnings and in this
video we'll talk about a question the
question is can we use a non static
variables inside a static methods the
answer is no of course but then why not
so if you look at this code we have a
class where you have a variable which is
int I and then we have a method which is
public void main and if you try to
increment the value of I there you can
see there is an error but then why to
understand this let's try to understand
different types of variables and methods
so variable can be of two types
not just variable but method also so you
can have a static or you can have a non
static members now when you say you have
a static member which means if you want
to call those members may be variable or
the method we need a class so we have to
mention a class name and then we can use
the members but then if you have a non
static members we have we need a object
error right so without the object you
cannot use the member so let's imagine
this class here so we have a class a and
in this class a we have two variables
now one which is non static and we have
num2 which is static so if you want to
use num2 we just have to use the class
name which is a dot num2 and your job is
done but then if you want to access num1
which is a non-static variable we have
to we have to create an object right so
I show up getting one object admitted
three objects here so when you have
three objects which is obj1 obj2 and
omega-3 and let's imagine obj one has a
value for noun 1 as 2 over it - as a
null value for now 1 as 3 and then obj 3
has enough value for num2 as 4 so we
have all this values right so every
object will have its own value for num -
but what about number one what about num
- so num - will have a value let's say
if I assign so for all the object will
be having the same value for num - so if
you specify the value for num - as 5 it
will be applicable for all the objects
because all the object which will share
the same value for num - because it is a
static variable right and we don't need
to actually use object then we can also
use the class name but then all the
object can use the same value for the
static variable but then every object
will have its old value for instance
variable right now so let's try to
answer
question can we use a static variable
inside a non-static member or non
sharing method yes we can't do that
because every object will have its own
methods right example if you have two
methods one is static and one is non
static let's say we have one whether we
just show which is non static now if I
try to access the static member in the
non static method is it is it will run
because the static variable will be
shared between all the methods so even
if you calling a show method which is a
non static member not sharing method it
will work right is because every object
can use the same strategy object or
stand state static variable but what
about if I try to use this all notional
non-static variable which is num1 inside
a static method now what will happen is
to call a static method we need a class
name right it is not comforting for us
to use the object and let's say if I
call this method which is increment so
if I call increment which is us which is
a static method and if I try to use num1
so question is if I say num1 plus plus
and if I call the increment method by
using class name which is a dot
increment now tell me which way they
will be incremented is it object wiring
variable or object to variable object
variable you're not sure right now since
every objects have its own value for
noun 1 we don't know that this method
will increment which value and that's a
confusion because we have two different
context here we have static and we have
non static so we can use a static
variable inside a non static method
because all the members all the non
static members share the same static
variables but what about can we use non
shellack variable inside static methods
no right so that's that's the answer
because every object will have its own
value and if you try to change the value
using static methods that's not possible
so in the answer at the end the answer
is you cannot use our non static
variables inside our static methods so I
