about classes and object so when you
talk about Java so java basically
follows this concept of oops
and in oops the most important part is
class and object now just imagine we
have of building your table now so far
this building to build this building we
require a plan why we require a
blueprint so even if you think you want
to build this the first question is how
to build that so if we require a
blueprint right so Billy's building we
required a blueprint now this building
is an object okay just imagine this is
an object to build any object your JVM
needs a structure or a blueprint and
that blueprint will be your class so
this plus class defines the structure of
an object it defines the working of an
object so if you can imagine an object
imagine object as a phone so every phone
will have two things a phone your phone
knows something and your phone does
something so when you when you say your
phone knows something the its the
structure of your phone the color of
your phone and then we have a logo
behind if it's an iPhone just imagine
that Apple over there so that is the
structure of a phone right though how
Java object looks then what object does
right even if you have an iPhone if you
cannot call someone will you use that
iPhone maybe for show off right but if
you have an object you have to use an
object so every object will have a
behavior so to define what object knows
and what object does we require a
blueprint so in this blueprint we can
define what is the behavior and what is
the values so you can see the class
structure there okay so just beyond the
blueprint so we have a class structure
so using that class we can create this
object so that is object and class in
Java thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
