for this let me get a new project and
we'll say this new project will say job
application and we'll call this new app
new or a new project answering demo and
okay now this is this is what you get by
default with god close this and let's
create our own code so we'll say new and
this will show some text at set we'll
take a GUI and in that GUI I will take a
place where they can I show our data
like hello world so this is what we need
to do whenever you want start with any
new thing so we have to plaint hello
world
so we'll say first GUI so we have this
package name called a swing demo and let
me remove all this struck out I think
that using font will work here so say
options this is how you have to reduce
the font so we'll make it 18 probably
which is a better so once you're done
with the font settings now let's do some
coding here now in order to create a GUI
what you need first we get a class and
we'll say this class is ABC you can have
any name as your class name now when you
say you want to show something or some
type of GUI on your screen you require
something called as frames so what you
see what you are able to see now this is
your NetBeans IDE and this is a minimize
maximize and this closing button so this
basically is a frame outside now in
spring all your components are called as
then they start with J now J represent
the component is made in Java and that's
why it is J something so so we have a
class in Billa class and in Java called
as Jeffrey nowadays jmj frame is a frame
which is very Java and bitch belongs to
a package called as swing package so J
flame is a class so since we need to
create a free
so we have to say my class which is ABC
it with exchange free now this package
or this class James name belongs to a
package called a swing so we have to
choice either we can just type here or
we can import with the help of clicks so
it's an ad import and this is the
package so all you're seeing packages
belongs to a Java dot Java X package now
now we'll create a constructor here
since I want whenever I create an object
it should initiate so you get a
constructor in this constructor
let me that's it if we have to define a
frame and then we have to say ABC let's
get a main function here to call that
constructor we'll go step by step the
first task is to show something so with
what we'll do is we create the object of
ABC we'll say ABC obj equal to new ABC
simple and that's it once you created
the object it will call this constructor
that means it will call this jeffrey so
we should be able to see something
that's on this code if you're on this
file you can see nothing it is compiled
and you got nothing since you are able
to your your writing here jframe no one
is calling jframe the problem is by
default
jfm has a property it says i'm by
default invisible that means you have to
make me visible so have to say obj dot
so to make it visible we can use a
method called a set visible so that
wisdom of the method and we can make it
as true now in earlier version of java
we used to say obj dot show so earlier
we used to walk with this method called
a show but now this method is deprecated
let me show you it how it is deprecated
if you say we're not sure you can see a
line here and this line means deprecated
so will not use this show instead of
show we'll be using set visible true if
you want to hide it you have to write
set visible false since we want to show
something so we will say set visible and
in packet we have to pass true if I run
this code now yeah you can see something
here so above on top
top left we can see some window here but
it's so small right it's we have to
expand it manually
what if you have to set this size
initially so what we can do is we can
use another method called s so there's
one more method called a set size the
set size will ask you for two parameters
the width in pixels and height in pixels
so your zero comma zero starts with the
top left here somewhere here this is
zero comma zero
since we want frame to be somewhere here
we'll give it as 400 pixels width and
400 pixels height so it will be a square
type frame not exactly square type but
you can see some sizes so we'll say I
run this code and you go so you got a
square shape
flamey-o simple so this is how you
should run your application now let me
close this by default not close oh so
now we know how to set designs and we
have we know how to how to make it
visible and how to synthesize in fact
when you you can also write this code
inside your constructor because
ultimately we need to call those methods
that's it either about in constructor or
you can explicitly call them so it's
always better to write your this to
write this methods inside a constructor
so we'll say set visible true and set
size is 400 comma 400 clear now we are
still remaining with the text there
right so to apply a text you need some
component now to show that text you need
your component called as we'll say here
we did a component called as jlabel
to show something we require J labels
will say J label L since we want to
import the package we'll say control
space okay you can see we have a jlabel
package here so J neighbor class belongs
to our package goes swing so it's a
jlabel l equal to DJ label and whenever
you create a jlabel you need to provide
a text so we will say this is
hello world simple so once you create a
jlabel next step is to add that label on
the frame it's something like creating a
canvas or a poster so you have a
cardboard and you need to cut some
pieces or some articles and you will
take those articles and you stick on
that canvas the same way you need to
create a frame and individual you need
to create some labels or some objects
and you will add those objects or to the
frame so we'll say it is add way to add
L here that's it
when you say add L now let's run this
code and the output you're getting is
hello world so we have started with the
code in which we are getting a GUI and
it is it says hello world clear in the
next part in the next tutorial we'll
talk about how to add to text so thanks
