of final keyword now so when you work
with final keyword let's start with the
first part basically when I talk about
final keyword we have a Cuba's final now
it can be used with a variable it can be
used with a method and we can use final
with the with the with a class so let's
see how it was the use of final variable
so let me make a publisher avoid main
function and let me define a variable
int a let's say it's st. I and the value
for I is 5 okay
and now if I say s out and if I print
the value of I the output you'll be
getting is obviously 5 right because we
are assigning a value and then that's it
we are signing after assignment I have
to I'm just renting it but let's say I
am doing a change here if I say I plus
plus so in this statement the value of I
will become sex and the output will be 6
right and 6 but what if I want to stop
someone by changing these values I would
not want to change the value of I so
what I can do is I can make this
variable as final so if you make a
variable final it means once it is
assigned it will not change even you can
see that we are getting a error here
which it says cannot assign our value to
our final variable simple but what if I
fail to assign the value here and then I
am assigning a value here instead of
doing increment if I say I equal to 6
again it will not laugh
because you cannot change the value
after assignment but let's say if I fail
to assign a value here if I fail to
assign a value at declaration I can
assign it later but once assigned we can
see we are not getting error here
if I run this the values the value will
be 6 but let's say once a sign I'm
changing the value next time if I say I
equal to 7 then it will give me the
error that means your final final
keyword with variable says you're
creating a constant or you're creating a
variable which the value which of will
not
so that's the importance of final
keyboard with variable let's say what is
a user final keyword with the help with
the method so let me remove this example
here and let me do find a class that say
Class A and I have a Class B I know it
Class A and Class B not a proper name
but for this example you will do so
let's say we have two methods one is
public void show or we have one method
only with this public void show and we
paint in show in a show okay and here
what I'm doing is I'm just saying Class
B exchange Class A which means if I
create object of be here be obj equal to
nu B and if I say obj dot show again in
D we don't have show method right again
with the help of inheritance it will
fetch this show down and then we can
call show if I run this it will say in a
show but what if I say we have a method
here which is public void show and in
this let me print in B show knife around
the code because of the because of the
because of polymorphism the output is in
B show it's because we are doing method
overriding right because this method
show as however I did this method show
but what if I want to stop someone I
don't want anyone to override this
method so what I can do is I can make
this method as final so you can see we
are getting an error here it says you
cannot override our method which is
final clear so that's the advantage of
using a or variable a final keyword a
final keyword with method but let's say
let's go with the last thing which is a
final keyword with a class let's say I
don't have a show method here and here
I'm saying I don't want anyone to
override or to in height a class which
is a I can make this class as
so if you make a class's final no other
class can extend that final class clear
and as the advantage of using the
advantage of using this final keyword
with class okay so this is final with
variable final with method and final
with class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
