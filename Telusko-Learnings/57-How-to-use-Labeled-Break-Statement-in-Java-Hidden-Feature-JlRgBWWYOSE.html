about laboring to break so when you talk
about a break statement in Java so you
know we have C programming C++ and Java
so we are using this statement break at
in every programming language right is
it maybe C or C++ or Java now whenever
you use a break statement we can use
break statement in switch we can use
break statement in any loop maybe for
loop or while loop or do-while loop so
whenever you have let's say two loops
you have two loops here let me go in
this way let me create a loop which
starts with one it will go till four and
I will say increment and let me use one
more loop here and say int J equal to 1
and J less than equal to 4 basically
we'll try to print a pattern here now so
how do you print pattern so we simply
say printer start here say space and
then here we'll print a new line so when
you when you write this code it will
basically print a square shape a square
stars or something in this way if I run
this if I run this this is your output
right but let's say so how it's working
so the number of those is counted by
this I the number of columns is defined
by this J right now let's say I don't
want to go beyond the value of I let's
save 3 so I want to check if my I value
is 3 so what we can simply do is we can
say break now this break is called as
this is your unlabeled big statement so
what it means whenever you use this
unlabeled break statement it will break
the inner loop since we have two loops
here this is your inner loop and this is
your outer loop so whenever you use a
break statement here it will only break
the inner loop okay so let me refer on
this the output will be so value of I
will be one so this loop will run four
times it will print
our 4-times once this loop is done it
will print it will go to a new line so
with four stars again it will print
those four stars since my I values two
and then when I value is three this will
say break which will break this loop
okay and once you break this loop it
will print a new line so it will print
two stars and a blank row and then again
it will continue with this because
whenever you use break it will only
break the inner loop so outer loop will
still walk and you will be getting two
fourth row
so if I run this now if I run this now
you can see it skipping the third line
but it's printing the fourth line so it
is breaking only the inner loop not the
outer loop now I want to break this
outer loop so what we can do is we can
just label it so we'll say I will use my
name to label it so I will say now in so
I am labeling this for loop here so how
to use label so we can define any
keyword or any identifier which is let's
say Naveen and a colon so colon defines
it's our label and then we can simply
say break Naveen so what it will do is
it will only break the outer loop so it
will break the outer loop so since outer
loop is break you cannot execute the
inner loop right and now I feel on this
it will print only two rules since
there's a break for the hole the outer
loop it will break the whole system and
then it will get by getting only two
rules and this type of break now will be
called as labeled break statement okay
so so we can also use label with break
statement in Java so that is one this
video so for further videos do subscribe
and thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
