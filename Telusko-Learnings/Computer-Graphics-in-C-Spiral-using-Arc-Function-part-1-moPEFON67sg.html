we'll talk about animations in C so we
see some of the hydro files in C so that
we can draw we can do some animations
part in C programming now to do
animation like where I have done here I
have made a chakra which is our spiral
here so what this spiral will have this
coding work is let me show you the
output first so in this code you can see
this is the animation you can make using
C programming again you can do lots of
things but this is the basic part this
is this is how see graphics works okay
so let me show you a code how it works
now now this is the code for that spiral
but again I did this might be this might
be some this might be difficult for you
to understand but if I start with the
start for you to start with the basics
it's damn easy so let me just save this
and we'll name this as an E
I mean mission name dot C now our to
work with this C graphics what you need
is you first you need some hydro files
so we have to say include stdio.h and
hash include co neo dot dot H and the
Quatermain function so public sorry void
main and then now now if I say printf
here printf hello so let's suppose if I
say printf hello and since we have to
hold the screen so we'll say get CH also
now I'm sure you might be knowing C
programming is because this video is for
those people who know C programming so
I'm not I will not explain what is how
this printf and get CH works here so if
I run this code now you can see this
hello on the screen but this screen you
are saying is a console screen this will
not go for any graphics to get the
graphics screen you have to use some
graphic driver you have to use a graphic
driver and you have to use a graphic
mode now what I mean is
you require two variables GD &amp;amp; GM
required two variables GD and GM and you
have to first detect the graph first you
have to detect the driver for your
graphics and then you have to initialize
it so for initialize we have to say init
graph in which you have to pass two
parameters first one is GD which is
graphic driver second is GM as graphic
mode and then this driver you have to
fetch from a folder called SB GI
now again I am using this dot dot is
because BG i folder is just beside your
bin folder so that's why you have to
come out of the bin folder
that's why dot dot and then to specify
the folder you have to give one slash
but the problem in c programming is one
slash in c is just a special character
so do you have to span you have to
cancel that special meaning of that
character so that's why you have to use
double slash and then semicolon now I
don't want to go for this printf what I
actually want is I want to draw that
spiral now to draw a spiral your C
programming or first lots of functions
there there are there are lots of
functions and all these graphical
functions belongs to a header file
called as graphics dot H so to do know
what are the header files or what are
the functions you have just right click
on this graphics you will see they have
we have lots of functions we have our we
have circle we have bar we have ellipse
so use it you can you could draw all
those things but now we have to focus on
our because we want to draw that spiral
now to work with this art we have you
have to go for some fine parameters
first you have to specify the center
point which is int X and int Y then the
starting angle ending angle because arc
has angle starting angle and ending
angle and then you have to mention the
radius to work with this what we need is
we have to go for arc function is arc
then I want a center point again I don't
know the center point of my screen right
but still I will try to guess
so we'll say 300 comma 300 and we'll say
starting angle is 0 ending angle is 90
and then we specify the radius and
radius will be 50 now this is just a
approximation I don't know what the
starting point of my screen or center
point of my screen so this is just a
random guess let me run this code I hope
you will see some graphical things here
so if I done this code yeah I got our
art which starts with 0 and the ending
angle is 90 so you can see the port the
below part is 0 and the upper part is 90
now I cannot use my mouse in this screen
because it's this this is a cc console I
cannot go forward I cannot go for the
mouse movement here so okay coming now
now what we have what we want here is I
want to put my arc in the center of the
screen now I cannot guess the center of
the screen like see we can go for this
trial other methods but I don't want to
go for that what I would simply do is I
will use a function called as get max X
this will give me the maximum pixels are
half on my X x axis then I have a
function call as get max Y get max Y
this will give me the maximum Y pixels I
have my on my Y axis
what if if I just say divide by 2 and
divide by 2 it will give me the center
point right so let's run this code and
yes we got an arc in the center of the
screen right so with the help of get X
get max X divide by 2 and get max Y
divided by 2 now what next we have to do
a is now now we have to we have to do
some movement now when I say we have to
do some movement obviously we have to
write lots of codes so that it will it
will look like it's moving see basically
nothing moves right in computer's world
in animation well nothing moves
it's just when we when we draw something
with a particular delay we will see
there is some animation right so what is
animation is just different frames
which are displayed in particular
intervals so we will see some video
there right so in this scenario what
we'll do is we'll just we'll just try to
we'll just try to move but that will
that will do where that we'll see in the
next part of the video because this is
the lengthy code so for till that do
subscribe for the further videos thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
