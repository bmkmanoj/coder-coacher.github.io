part of anonymous inner class and that
is lamp using lambda expression now
let's see what exactly lambda means so
before starting with lambda let's change
this code a bit now if you know in Java
we have something called as interface
now let's say if I make this be as
interface that means oh it should be
small I if I make these classes in this
be as interface that means I cannot
define method see I just have to declare
it okay so what I have done is in fact
all the methods in interface are public
abstract so how many interface is called
as B and here what let's say I want to
create instance of B okay so how do you
get instance of B is we have to say B
obj equal to nu B but unfortunately int
of interface cannot have a instance so
we cannot get great an instance of of an
interface directly for that we have to
create a class let us say class name is
XYZ and this class should implement B so
that when you create object of this XYZ
again you have to define a method here
which is public or it show again
there should be some logic in this code
here but let's say I have a class XYZ
which implements this show that means I
can create a instance of XYZ so that I
will get or instance of be clear that's
one way the another way of creating this
class is using inner class so what I
mean by inner class is the problem is
when you create on instance of B here we
will simply say I my interface and I
don't have any I don't have the
implementation so your this this part
will say okay you don't have an
implementation but hold on I can
implement B interface here okay so and B
interface has only one method called as
show so we can directly implement it is
public void show again we can simply say
it will print hello
so now if I call obj
daaad show it will go for go for this
implementation and it will give the
output as hello okay that's one way of
defining a interface now why we focus on
this code we have an interface which is
just a it just has one method and this
type of interface in Java is called as s
a.m. which means single abstract method
interface okay and this was this this
thing used to be called in one point
till one point seven but in Java
eight there is a concept of functional
interface which means interface which
has only one method can be called as
functional interface and to specify this
as a functional interface we can use an
annotation called as functional
interface okay which means you can have
only one method what if I define one
more method which is ABC here and you
can see it will give me an error it says
functional interface should have only
one method so that means ABC will not
support here either you need void show
on ABC now since you are working with
functional interface let's if I jump to
this first native ways it will specify
that this function interface concept was
launched in Java 1.8 but the advantage
of using functional interface is using
functional interface you can just remove
some boilerplate code now what it means
now see when you create our instance of
this be here so it's for sure that after
this line there should be our instance
of V and that means there should be a
they should be compensated it should be
new B and then there is obvious thing
that this interface only has only one
method which is show so that means this
line should be sure so why as a
programmer rewriting this code what if
if we ask our Java or JVM to implement
that thing for us what I mean is way to
say this
instance this our interface B which has
a difference called as obj has a method
called as some method you search it I
don't know which method but you search
it there is a method with the default
signature which is blank signature so
you can see we have a blank signature
and in this method I want to implement
something so I have to implement that
means I have to send something so we
have to use this arrow and we have to
give Calibos open-end close and a
semicolon we specify this it write it
here only okay so I can simply say a
bracket and then this semicolon that
means the implementation inside show
will be here so let me just give the
enter and we'll say the implementation
what I need is just had a simple right
so this is also an anonymous class okay
it's kind of anonymous class where you
are defining a lambda expression and if
you learn this code which still works
you can see its hello right and that's
the advantage of Java 8 of lambda
expression you can reduce the you can
remove the boilerplate code then you
will say ok that means we are just
removing the boilerplate code that's it
there's no performance improvement let's
focus on this class now if you if you
reference this page or if it's this file
you can see we have only two class one
is B and inner demo this B is the
interface class bytecode and this is
inner demo bytecode where is the inner
demo dollar one no it's not there it's
because JVM is so smart that it says for
lambda expression I know this is at kind
of anonymous class but I will not create
a anonymous class of it and it's that
efficient right and now what you can do
is if you know in your in your block you
have just one statement that's then you
don't require this curly braces you can
die agree specify the statement here and
you can write the whole statement in one
line so we can say it is system dot dot
println and here we can give the
semicolon so this is how you can use
lambda expression so a point to remember
we talked about this lambda expression
it only
works with functional interface okay so
there are lots of advantages of
functional interface there is something
called a stream API which works with
functional interface watch one stream
API what functional interface that might
be in my next video tutorials so that's
it from inner classes which are member
class ninja class anonymous and lambda
okay and that's it from the inner class
