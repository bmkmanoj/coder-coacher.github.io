not change the interface once it is once
it is published now what I mean by that
is let's say if I have an interface
which is actor now this actor interface
is in development state is not yet
published so what we can do is in the
development stage we can add method
accleration here so to declare methods
what we can do is we can simply define
we can declare methods like by default
all the methods are public abstracts so
we don't have to type that what we can
do is we can simply say it is void and I
need a method here so this interface is
active right so what we'll do is we'll
say this interface so first the
interface should say let's say actor
should act so we have an interface which
is act here so we cannot define so we
can only declare it so let's give a
semicolon here and let's say we have one
point of one more method here which says
our actors should speak okay because
they want maybe maybe a different way of
speech so every actors should speak yeah
that will go for this two method so in
this act interface we have two methods
one is act and speak okay so if we talk
about any dusty maybe Hollywood or
Bollywood we need to have this two which
is act and speak now what we can do is
let's say I want to be your hero or we
need the AB object of hero so obviously
every hero date to implements an
interface which is actor so that a hero
should know he to do at least two things
first he did to define to those two
methods first method is public void act
we say s out I can act
okay so first is he can act second
method he should be able to speak
because to the speed or to
to make a dialogue we need to speak
right so we can I can speak so now we
have two methods this two but all this
actor all these heroes they have one
more one more method which is let's say
comedy so all these actors they also do
comedy now all these heroes they do
comedy no
so we'll say s out I can make people
laugh so we are writing this three
method so what we have here is we have
this hero interface a hero class which
implements our acting to phase in which
two methods are compulsory because every
actor should act and every actor should
know how to speak but he know should be
able to do comedy also now let's talk
about we have one more class which is
villain now in this class if I say
implements and let's say we are say we
are saying okay let's let's implement
some actor because all these villains
are also actors right now since it's a
villain we have to also say public void
act so in this will print I can act we
need one more method which is public
void let's say this time it is one more
method which is speak because villain
dialogues are more powerful than hero's
dialogues will say I can I can speak so
now we have these two methods but let's
say villain has one more method which is
let's say public void a
lewdness all the heroes all the villains
are rude
so we'll say I I am rude so now we have
this three methods but let's say in
future hero says no I want every actor
or this day's a system it says every
actor should able to dance the problem
is after the definition of these three
methods what we have done is we have
added actor we have added hero we have
added a villain so once they are
published
case in future if you are making some
modifications let's say if you are
changing this act interface if you say
public void and every actor should be
able to dance now again he doesn't
matter is a hero or villain he should be
able to dance and obviously in normal
not go for dance will go for comedy say
comedy so every actor should know how to
how to make people laugh now he does say
is great I don't have to modify anything
is because I'm already implementing a
method call this comedy but what about
villain now villain class will give you
an error
just imagine after publishing this
interface if you are modifying any
public any interface it's a crime it's
because all the classes which are
implementing that interface will give
you an error and that's why you should
never never never modify your interfaces
but hold on you should never modify your
interfaces in case of Java 1.7 whatever
jar 1.8 the problem is we are declaring
this method and that's why Whelan says
error right but what if you can define
the method right if you can define the
method here this will Don will not be
you will not give you an error but
kojiro is can we define a matter
interface oh yeah that will answer in
the next video so but Delta 1.7 we know
that we should not modify your
interfaces 1 they are the one they are
published</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
