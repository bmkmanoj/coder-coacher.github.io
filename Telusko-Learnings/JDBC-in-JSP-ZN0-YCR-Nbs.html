ready from those colonics and in this
video we'll see how to connect a JSP
page with database with the help of JDBC
of course so let's say you want to
create a web application where you have
some pages and those pages need to fetch
the data from the database so what you
will do so we have multiple ways right
what we can do is you can create a web
project again you can create a normal
web project like this one or you can
create a mavin project so when you
create a maven project the advantage
what you get is you know you can add the
dependencies I mean you can add the jar
files by itself right so that is one way
the another way is you can create a web
project then you have to add the Java
files by yourself let's do it by web
project or if you know mavin you can go
with go with that as well okay so let's
give a project name as demo JSP and
we'll select our tomcat server again you
can use any server which you have
GlassFish or any of this everything will
work the click on next
nothing to specify here just click on
finish you can see we got our project
here and in this project first of all
let me create a J's page so we said new
JSP and we'll name this JSP as let's say
profile dot JSP so we just want to print
the profile of a student I will click on
finish and you can see we got our JSP
page here just to show you something
what I want here is to print the rule
number one zero one I want to print a
name and then I want to print the mask
that says 88 I want to print this
details and of course when you want to
print this you have to use a br tag in
between right and we'll say BR tag let's
run this let's see if it is working or
not so that we can go ahead let's click
on the Run button click on next and
finish and run this oh boy
I hope it will not show any weird stuff
on my screen ok so you can see we
coordinator which is one zero one Naveen
and eighty eight so this is what the
page we are getting right but I want to
press this data from the database now do
we have a database here so yes I am
using a post grist database
can use any deniability database see
which you want you can work with Oracle
you can work with MySQL you can work
with any anyone in fact su I mean later
I'm trying to explore more than post
play so I am using posters here but
that's fine you can use any DBMS which
you want so I already have a table here
which is student and in this student
table I have some data if I say view all
sources you can see we have this data
here so I won't fetch the last row so
which is row number 1 0 3 marks 50 and
name is the min so I want to fetch this
one how can you do that how can you
fetch the data from the database it's
very simple you can simply have you have
to use the JDBC steps now I'm assuming
that you know JDBC steps if you don't
know you can watch my video completely
dedicated for for JDBC ok where you have
to use seven steps still I will try to
go with the steps the first step of JDBC
is let me open my sub line where I was
well I will specify these steps so the
first step we have to do is import the
package or we'll say import package and
the package we show you two input here
is Java dot SQL dot star which which we
which has all the classes and interfaces
which we need so let's import that
package so normally when you want to
import something and JSP what we do is
we use this tag which is at the reach
and then we specify or not a trait but
percentage at the rate right and then we
say page then we say import that's the
attribute and then you have to mention
the package name which is Java dot SQL
dot star I want all the classes and
interfaces once we have done with that
the next step is you have to load and
race your driver so you have to load and
register the driver now when you say you
want to race to the driver which driver
I am talking about so since C we have a
different DBMS right and every DBMS has
its own driver
so when you say masculine side its own
driver force Grace has own driver
in fact Oracle has its own driver so if
I go here for post grace the driver name
which we use is this one which is o RG
dot post with SQL dot driver
in case if you are using MySQL you just
have to specify your drive one as this
comm dot masculine or digital driver
okay now since we are using Porsche
Chris here I will use a post Greece
driver now since I want to add a Java
code inside my JDBC or inside my JSP you
have to use we have to use a script like
tag in which you have to specify the
first one which is class which is class
dot for name and this you have to
mention the driver name which is orj dot
post girls SQL door drywall okay again
if you are using MySQL then you have to
use comm dot mask you'll notice about
driver which you have mentioned here you
see that or not here this one is for
Maskull is for Portuguese I just hope I
have entered the right text yes the next
step is Oh hold on we are missing
something when you say you want this
driver this will be so your machine will
try to get this driver right but
unfortunately this is a third-party
library and in your machine you don't
have that can you see that in your web
content you don't have that library you
have to make sure that you have your
library in this and this folder so let
me just do that let me just add that
here so again from where to get it you
just go to Google and search for my
haven't deposited that's my you know
this is the place I get all my
repository so you just search for pause
grace forced grace
I mean post in SQL pause quiz click on
search button then go to this thing and
you can select any version I am going
for the first version I don't know if it
will work with work or not but let's try
so you click on the download thing here
click on download it will it will
download the thing for you okay so let
me just add that in my folder just you
have to just try to paste it here okay
so have pasted that here can you see
that we got our post Chris driver here
and it should work now let's try then so
we have added that Java file the next
step you have to do is you have to go
for you have to create a connection so
we'll say connection
con equal to for connection we got the
package connection corn equal
- driver manager that's the next step
now it's a driver manager dot get
connection now in this gate connection
you have to specify three parameters the
first parameter is the URL so let's
create a string URL here with a string
string URL and in this double quotes you
have to mention the URL that's a
database URL I can which you want to go
for so if you are using Porsche Chris
this is the URL so it is your so what
you are saying here is you are
connecting with JDBC so your JSP code is
connecting with JDBC JDBC is connected
with the Porsche press and Porsche crew
s is connected to this database now
database can be on the network so you
have to specify the network address and
the database name for Postgres the
driver name and the the port number is
five four three two four mask your the
driver name and the the port number is
three three zero six and then this is
this is one change you have to do in
masks you'll have to mention MySQL okay
so it means copy this and we'll paste it
there paste now once we got this the
next thing you have to mention is the
user name so we'll say string user name
will say equal to four Porsche Chris for
my machine I'm using user name as
Postgres if you're using mask you'll you
will get the default username as root so
I will paste oh not this one I have to
put a post Chris okay and then you have
to mention the password now luckily I
don't have a password I do have a
password yeah I do have a password so
the password for me is zero okay again
depend upon what password you set for
your DBMS I have set it to password
which is which is zero so let me just
type those things here with a URL comma
username comma password you have to
mention these three things now once you
caught the connection let's try the
query right now - father query we need a
statement object so we say statement s T
equal to con dot create statement that's
this step you have to follow right place
statement then once we got this
statement the next thing which we need
here is we have to father the query so
for that we
the query here so we'll say string SQL
equal to that 0 a write SQL equal to
nothing now what want to fetch is the
complete data we'll say select star from
student where roll number is equal to 1
0 3 because we have a specific now we
want only one record now once we have
done that let's fire the query the data
will be going into result set will say
result set R as equal to it is st dot
execute query we have to mention the
query which is SQL now once you far the
query here you will get all your data in
result set what we have to do is we just
have to say add is dot next so that we
will try us between the records again to
get I mean to get more details about
this how all this thing's works you can
you can watch my video on JDBC if you
don't know JDBC my main agenda here is
not to teach you JDBC my main agenda is
how to connect JSP and JDBC ok it's not
that difficult it's just that some
people were having some issues so I'm
making this video okay so let's print
the then let's print all the values so
what we'll do is we'll say RS dots in
fact once we got Utah in artists what we
can do is we can go here and then we can
say roll number we can print the roll
number here we can use an expression tag
here we can say percentage equal to RS
dot catch string and that will be your
first string okay then we can use a br
tag here just to you know get the break
tag then we can say name colon we have
to use a percentage at the rate equal to
we'll say RS dog catch string again I
know that roll number I mean the the row
number will be an integer but we can
fetch that in a string format of you're
wise not working okay I forgot I
mentioned okay honest dot get string
what's that getting I can say to write
we can take this in one line and then we
can mention a br tag and then one more
which is your marks will say marks :
let's copy-paste this
the entire stuff copy and paste and in
here you can mention trees right we can
we got roll number we got name and we
got marks I think we are done let's run
this so this is this is the data which
we are printing here and after this
let's say if I want to have some break
tags so that everything will be coming
after two lines let's run this
let's see if it is working or not it
should work I guess and you can see we
got the data from the database it's that
simple right so you have to write all
your databases steps inside it Jacey
page so that's it from this video we
have talked about how do you connect a
database using JSP so that's a thank you
so much for watching and do subscribe
