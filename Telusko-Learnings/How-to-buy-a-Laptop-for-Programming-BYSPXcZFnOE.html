daughterly working on a project and now
you want to buy a new machine
specifically if you want to buy a laptop
which one to buy now I get this question
a lot of time on YouTube specially when
I go live on YouTube I know in the chat
window I get this question I want to buy
a new machine which one to buy now I'm
not a dead geek here you are not a kind
of person who will compare multiple
machines here because I'm not that good
with comparing the configuration here
I'm not I will not be checking the
benchmark of all the machines I don't
have multiple question to show you right
now but I will tell you when you buy a
machine what are the parameters you have
to consider now I'll be telling you all
these things based on my experience from
last 7 years I've used multiple machines
this is my I guess me this is my seventh
or sixth machine so I'll be talking
about what you have to check when you
buy a new machine especially for
programming so let's get started
welcome back aliens my name is Ivan
ready and let's get started now if you
already have a machine with you maybe a
desktop my laptop is completely enough
to write a code or two if you want to
learn a programming you can use any
machine now having a better machine will
not make you a better programmer okay
it's your skill set but then having a
good machine will of course will improve
your performance it will reduce your
what you say time to build a project
because when you build a project it
takes some time for building process why
compliation running and you want to see
the instant output that's well having a
good machine will always help now
question arise if you want to buy a
machine what to check was the first
thing is the most important part is your
budget right now it doesn't matter which
is the best version even if you talk
about the best machine I prefer macbook
you know I'm a big fan of apples so I
prefer MacBook this is the best machine
you can have for programming but I think
is can you afford it now I'm adding now
I'm not adding stage right I'm and
working somewhere I think so I can
invest in this in fact I spend
approximately of 14 hours with this
machine and that's okay with me right if
I offend spending my 14 hours a day with
this machine that's completely fine
because I can invest now but think about
this if you if you are in your polish if
you are started your career now this is
not a good option right this is damn
boss
then we have to look for the machines
which you can afford now when I was
learning programming for the first time
I was not having a good budget to buy a
machine so I bought a small netbook okay
it was it was around 20,000 rupees a
small machine which was having two Giga
which was having 1.6 gigahertz CPU that
was dual code it was having 2 GB of RAM
and took 2 GB of hard drive now
initially it was completely enough for
me but now since I working on multiple
shit but multiple projects since I am
doing everything as well
we need good machines right the second
thing is depend upon your budget which
cpu which machine you can afford now I
would prefer that increase your budget
up it may be around if we talk about
Indian currency let's go for 40,000 to
50,000 rupees that's a good that's a
good range to buy a machine now see
buying a laptop is actually an
investment and I will no I'm not saying
that if it if you don't have a budget
you know increase your budget but then
if you can't do it if it is possible for
you go for at least 40,000 50,000 if you
are buying a laptop because if you buy a
slower machine just think about it
especially if you buy three now it is
completely fine to use a three now right
but then you went to learning phase now
so let's say if you learn Java after
that you'll be learning maybe you'll be
learning advanced Java you'll be working
with servers you'll be working with
Android studio you'll be working with
will just to do if you're going for
Microsoft apart if you are going for it
may be big data in future you will need
huge listening power
I won't think about it it's a one time
investment byte and of course when you
buy a laptop now you have to use that
laptop for next two to three years right
so why don't you buy a good machine now
by paying 40 to 50,000 rupees but again
if you cannot afford it that's
completely fine go for a slow mo machine
now I start walking start earning and
you can buy a good machine data so if
you have a budget of 40 to 50 thousand
50 thousand now of course you should go
for i5 machine again if you talk about
Intel field we have AI 5 in i7 right we
also have a 3 but then I 3 is not for
naught for programmers ok now see when I
say not for programmers
when you go to Electronic Show there was
you know we have different sections
there we have sections we have laptops
for business
business professionals we have laptop
for gamers right if we talk about those
ultrabooks the slim slim laptop that is
for business people because they go in
here and there they travel so they did
that gamers they need high-end machine
like Alienware or maybe we have a so
strong series now we also have HP or
main series right all those machines are
awesome but then for programmers we
don't have any laptops right you will
not find hi this is this much is a
program or this machines are for
programmers we will not see that so we
have to choose best of the lot so first
thing is I don't go for ice i 5 or i 7
if you have a good budget go for i7 of
course but i probably something we just
need it now because if you are working
with android studio if you are working
with visual studio or if you if you are
a designer and if you want to work with
those Photoshop tools of course you need
it i 5 now there are some people they
say you know laptop is because index
table because laptop we can carry of
course that's a good thing but then in
if you talk about the i-5 odd of laptops
it will have dual-core CPUs and i-5 of
lack of desktop will be having quad-core
again in that we have we have to choice
but then if you're going for laptops
make sure that you search for quad-core
the price is big high but if you're not
able to get the quad code go for dual
code at least I five dual code
preferably go for six or seven
generation don't go for fifth generation
that's a very old now go for seventh why
for seven but it will be damp honestly
so go for I go fast acceleration that is
fine
so I five six or seven generation now
that's the first thing right the second
thing is you have to consider ram now
how much RAM you need a 2gb
no that is not enough specially if you
are using Windows right maybe 4gb yeah
you can work with 4gb in fact I have
another machine which has 4gb RAM and it
works okay it works but the problem is
when I use Windows on that the moment I
enjoy I run I open windows because
that's attached a dual boot machine so
open to work completely fine the moment
I go for Windows then I open my STS
which is spring tool suite for spring
applications the moment everything loads
up you know I can see my entire RAM is
full and the moment you open Chrome now
and you're gone
you know so 4gb is of course not enough
for you AGB dam is something we need now
maybe again there are some people they
will say ok we also have a partition but
trust me we talked about strap partition
it will be taking a memory of hard drive
and your hard drive is the slowest much
slowest part of your machine ok that's a
bottom like you can say so I would say I
5 8 GB RAM 16 GB will be awesome but at
least 8 GB with is required now the next
thing is the hardware configuration or
the hard drive now the hardware if we
talk about I would say don't go don't
think about hard drive see you will
think about 1 terabyte you will think
about to tell about but think about this
why do we need a 1 terabyte or 2
terabytes
we are programmers right we are not
buying a machine for games we are not
buying machines for watch movies right
why do you why do you need 1 or 2
terabyte hard drive I would say instead
of going for hard drive go for SSD
another thing is when you buy a machine
you will get hard drive for a by default
right so have extra budget for SSD it
will trust me it will improve your
performance by 2x or 4x right so if you
if you have Windows now loads in tens
again so maybe 15 seconds using SSD it
will load in 6 to 7 seconds it is that
fast right so replace your harddrive
with SSD if you are getting any hard
drive and you can use the same hard
drive as your external hard drive the
way I am doing now so I have made my
internal hard drive as my external hard
drive using using some cases I do have a
case so you have to buy extra in the
case for the internal hard drive ok you
can convert that into a external hard
drive it works fine so I 5 8 GB RAM and
SSD now minimum SSD will be 2 to 6 GB
that is something required now so 2 to 6
GB SSD if you cannot afford that that's
fine you can still go for hard web
that's fine ok
so hard drive SSD slash a sturdy gram
AGP and i-5 the next thing we need is
the screens the resolution you know when
you buy a laptop having a full HD screen
will be helpful that to a 15.6 inch
because if you buy a smaller machine
like 13 inch laptop or putting it 14
inch laptop the problem is when you as a
programmer when you work on your screen
you have to divide your spirit into two
parts right sometimes we write a code in
a dual-mode we have to light up coal
here we have to write up code here we
also want to see the output right so if
you can divide your screen into three
parts it will be awesome right you
cannot do that with we cannot do that
with small machines I would also
recommend if you are using your laptop
at home by a small monitor you don't
need a big monitor now because I do this
I need this because of editing purpose
you can buy a small motor and you can
connect your laptop with point on it
will be working fine if you're buying a
small machine but I would prefer go for
15.6 inch machines right and that to
full-hd the problem will be a cost
because full-hd machines are costly if
you cannot afford again you can go back
to HD screen which will be having around
1300 into 768 resolution that's
perfectly fine okay so that's that those
are things you have to consider now
question arise if you want up there is
one more thing now as a programmer I
stopped using Windows I would I would
recommend you to go for the next
machines right because if you buy a
windows-based machine they will charge
you three to four thousand extra example
if you buy a machine and that machine
cost you around forty five thousand
rupees just because it has Windows
pre-installed they will charge you forty
eight thousand for that I can you cannot
go there and say hey I just want to
remove that Windows just reduced my
three thousand that's not possible
so while you're searching for the laptop
search for in us-based machines I don't
know what will you get this machines in
in offline showrooms but you can get it
online right okay so let's go to lamp
let's go to amazon.com on which country
you're later you can go for amazon.com
is or not
Amazon dot and and let's go to category
and let's search for laptop so we have a
laptop here okay now how to filter you
can see if you search with laptops you
have thousands of laptops and trust me
the more options you have the more
confuse you will be a decently I bought
a laptop it took me around five days to
figure out which is the best machine for
me so let me just help you with this so
the first way to put it up okay we have
to filter the filter these things we
right so we'll remove I pipe as I will
check I five will do more make anything
else I can you think of why seven as
well you can go for I five and again
because I will not be showing any
specific machines here right so
technology will change in every three to
four months right so
we'll change the links in the
description area so we have cited I
five-year the next thing we to select is
a GB RAM and I would prefer other this
based machine so I will go here and I
will select Linux based machine and yeah
now you can see that reviews here we got
22 reviews and record 4.5 stars right
now I feel this is the best machine you
can get at this price range which is for
you to a thousand this is ASA
right this is the awesome machine it
clocks speed at 2.5 gigahertz and this
is a dual core machine I guess it has a
GB RAM that two ddr4 normally that's a
new thing if we have one terabyte hard
work that this is the only bottleneck
you can see we have one terabyte hard
drive that too with 5400 rpm which is
very less the new machines which you get
a seven eight hands 7200 RPM which is a
better machine but I would recommend you
to replace this thing with your SSD bias
HD and and the best thing is it has
Linux in it right it does have a good
review so you can go for this machine or
if I go back I guess that's the only
machine you have when they say if you
don't go for Windows if you go if you
want to go for if you don't want to go
for maybe Linux you know go for Windows
I would say this looks good this machine
looks good but this is the 6th
generation machine and that's fine you
know with this price range you can get
6th you you will get a sixth generation
that to HP again Brad is a matter
nowadays because everyone provides you
on-site support right that is one gene
one thing you have to consider now one
of the machine this is also good the
first row this this is slim in fact I
have used this machine in one of the
company I was event for the training
somewhere one of the company and them
and they have given me this machine to
use for one month and this is an awesome
machine I have I do I do have announcer
hands-on experience on this machine this
is good machine it has I five seven
seven generation a cheapy RAM everything
seems good in this machine as well I can
you can see we don't have any reviews
because this is a kind of business
machine you can get right this is a good
machine again and yeah so this is how
you have to filter elements and again if
you increase your budget you will get
better machines one of the
machine which I love that is MacBook Pro
okay if you have a good budget with you
you can go with MacBook Pro again it is
costly but trust me once you buy this
machine you will love it you will love
working on your machines the next
machine you have is Dell XPS again I
love this machine this is the second
best machine you can get Dell XPS but
again the cost is the issue you can see
the cost is very high and I guess in
India it is not readily available the 15
inch machine but again you can search
for this difficult go to showrooms and
if you can find this machine this is
this is one of the best machine you can
get it is based thing and for
programmers it is very fast because it
has embedded SSD right so yeah that's
how you use search for laptops on Amazon
you can also depend upon which ecommerce
site you use you can use any of anything
but that's how you filter so again we
don't have a specific machines for
programmers okay but then this is how
you have to put it I did my time in I
five a GB RAM and I would say SSD is
preferable right I can you can go for i7
if you sell it I seven here of course
you'll be having a better machines so
there are there are some awesome
machines you can buy even this one is
good this this one seems good
we have i7 7 generation and it has a GB
RAM you can you can you can you know we
can change the configuration this is one
of the machine which I bought recently
but I bought I five one with Windows of
course you know so that's that's my view
on laptops that's how I buy laptops I
hope it was helpful for you and if you
