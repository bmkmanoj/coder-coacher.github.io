of for loop now instead of printing hi
let me print the value from 1 to 5 so
since you already know the while loop
sorry the file for loop is going from 1
to 5 right so what if if I can print the
value of I so if I say in double quotes
if I say person D and then if I can
specify the value which is on the value
1 which is I and if I run this code you
can see it is printing 1 2 3 4 5 but I
also need a new lines of /n and if I run
this we have 1 2 3 4 5 simple so if you
specify I here it will print 1 2 3 4 5
now
let's not specify / under specify at
space and if you run this code you have
been getting 1 2 3 4 5 cool
now what we'll do is I don't want to
print the numbers I want to print all so
I will simply say star space and if I
run this code it will print 5 stars
simple and then after this I want to
print a new line so I will say /n for
the new line if I run this code you can
see we have 5 stars and on the new 9
printing program ended with executes 0
so that's how you print a stars and
that's how you print numbers simple now
what more we can do is we can also
specify what let's say I want to print
this pattern so I should off fitting
just 5 stars
I want to print slash star and then we
have stars laugh that's my comment or I
got our yeah I want to print a format in
this vessel star space star space what's
happening star star for stars and these
same four stars will be on the next line
then I get the same four stars
and again the four stars now how can you
print this block using for loop so for
sure when you execute one for loop it
will it will print the it will bring the
first row of stars so what if you can
just copy this code and paste it here
let's see what's the output so if you
run this you can see we have two blocks
instead of five let's make it four okay
and again run you can see we have four
stars so if I can copy this code and
again print it once you will be getting
three lines and again if I do the same
thing I will be getting the fourth block
so we got the blocks of star which we
wanted to print in this format but don't
you think we are doing the same thing
again again so we are printing same set
of statements two times
oh sorry four times so sure of that do
you have any solution yes do we do have
a solution and what's the solution we
see in the next video till then stay
tuned and do subscribe for for the
videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
