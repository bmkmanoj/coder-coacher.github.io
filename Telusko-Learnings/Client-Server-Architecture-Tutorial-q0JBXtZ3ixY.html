today we will talk about souls now if we
talk about a service over a simple
machine if we talk about a computer so
server is a computer which provides you
some services so let's suppose I have a
machine which provides some service are
you gonna so example if I have machine
bits which provides files so that
machine we call as fine
so if I have a machine and those that
machine provides you printing service
it will be called a spring server and
think about this you're in this world of
Internet we all talk about client and so
so let's suppose you have client and you
have so normally we have multiple Christ
and multiple clients get ready to
multiple servers but in this case let's
suppose you have one server and one
client if this client request something
from this soul and server gives the
response it means this machine will be
called as so so a computer which
provides two services it's called as so
so let's suppose you have requests and
you get response so I is something which
take requests and gives you response
depend upon the request example if this
machines provides you files or this
machine provides you files that means up
the line will request for a file and
this machine will provide the file to
declined
that means this machine's becomes a file
so ok that easy now let's suppose in to
talk about internet we all know this
amazing protocol as HTTP and we have
amazing world called as web servers so
let's suppose if we talk about Internet
it all works with web sites now we don't
create web sites we create web pages so
if we talk about a single page response
web page right if you have the
combination
multiple pages okay so that combination
or logical grouping of webpages we call
as website so we don't hate website we
create web pages and we group them to
form a website right and then suppose a
server which has multiple web pages so
this machine will provide you web pages
that's why this server will be called as
well so so a machine which provides you
web pages will be called as web server
right so any machine or any computer
which provides you some services will be
called as though that machine so so file
services file so web services web server
print services print server so this is
what we talked about so so alight
request to a server and server gives you
a response okay now let's let suppose
one servo has multiple services so let's
suppose we have this amazing server big
so big so so if you talk about this
server in this let's suppose it also
provides files it also provides web
pages it also provides you let's suppose
yeah prints ups right we have multiple
service fee we also have telnet service
so we have multiple service you have pay
service we have a paid service fire
service print service we have multiple
service so one server is working with
multiple service that means a hardware
if you talk about so much
there are huge hardware's so if you talk
about a hardware in which you have
you'll be having some voice so let's
suppose you have Windows 7 so one server
will with Windows 7 if that server will
have a software cause it's fun so verse
often that machine becomes a file server
if a computer
well so software that machine because
webserver
if that machine has print service
software that person we call as print
server so let's suppose if I have a
computer with all these servers I have
fine servers installed I have web server
installed I have print server installed
right now if a client requests my web
page it means in this you have something
else web server which will give you the
response but the question is how the
client will dispense ship between
multiple services and that's why we have
something called as port numbers so
every service have their own port
numbers and they have their own
protocols so if we talk about web pages
this follow a protocol called as HTTP
file Solly's it provides FTP so for
different different service what we have
different different servers different
different servers has different
different Sophos different software
provides different protocols and every
protocol have their own port numbers ok
so guys that's all about servers so if
you have any doubts commit me and please
subscribe for further videos thank you
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
