comparison gardening in this video we'll
talk about mantissa and exponent now
what exactly this means so if you just
go back to your school time when I guess
when you are secondary schools where we
talked about - an exponent for the first
time right so let's say to understand
legislating an example let's say we have
our number which is 6,000 here so how do
you represent 6,000 so there is one way
you can see it it's peak into 10 raised
to 3 right so this is called as a
normalized form where you have 6 into 10
0 3 right
then if you have a bigger military we
have 7 0 0 0 0 0
we have 5 zeroes there so it will be 7
into 10 raised to 5 right so that's not
how you represent that so it's all
saying 6 into 10 raised to 3 stop saying
Sarah Layton justify what we can say is
we can say this is 6 e 3 and this is 7 e
5 right so this is your main kissa and
this is your exponent so when you say 6
into 10 is 2 3 which is 6 e 3 so
whenever you get e you can replace that
with 10 into so next time if I say
there's something on this he9 what it
simply means it is 8 into 10 raised to 9
right but then we are not looking this
in our in decimal system we want to talk
about ballot system right how they
represent this another one is format so
before going for that I just want to let
you know something okay so let's let's
ignore that let's go for money system
how can you represent a number in binary
format so if you have a number which is
1 0 0 0 0 or let's say 1 1 triple 0 how
can you represent this in a binary
format it's very simple actually you can
say 1 1 then we say e then we have 4
zeros you can you can say 4 ok so we
have 1 1 and then we have e then we have
4 0 but hold on we are talking about
binary system right how can you have 4
here so we can look like so we have to
write 1 double 0 which is a which
represents 4 right so it is 1 1 e 1
triple 0 now 1 double zero right so we
can also represent the
number in this way so we can say e I
mean 11 a 1 1 into 2 raised to 1 2 / 0
right you will get this number but the
question is can you add these two
numbers let's say so in your exam so
basically by coming about the entrance
exam here right so let's say in your
exam if you are getting two numbers and
if you want to add those two numbers and
what are those two numbers are so let's
say we have 1 0 1 1 e 1 1 0 0 it will
give your first number the second number
is 1 1 0 1 then e-1101 now can you add
this two numbers it is not that easy to
add these two numbers because when you
say bill plus 1 I mean you can you can
simply add this right but then what how
to add it because this is my disease 20
star this is exponent can be added
directly or not exactly so just before
going for that this is a stock watch
this thing can we say 6 e 6 a 3 + 7 is 5
if you want to add these two values how
do you do it so can you simplistic
features 5 is 8 and sticker 6 + 7 15
know if that is the case what will what
it will give you it will give you e I
mean 8 and service which will give you
13 e 8 which is not actually right is
because when you see this number this is
7 4 of 5 zeros and this number is six
triple 0 so addition is 7:06 triple 0
right which is not like which which is
not same as this number so that means
whenever you want whenever you want to
add numbers which has been T sine
exponents we have to make sure that we
can add this number only when so we can
add these two numbers only when we have
7 into 10 raised to 5 or we can say we
can change this number to 700 into 10
raised to 3 and 6 into 10 raised to 3 so
we have to put this as a common right so
this will be coming here as it is when
you want to add it now this thing will
be added so this will be coming as it is
and this will
and so what we do is we have to make
sure so anyway you add two numbers you
have to make sure that your mantissa yes
so your exponential be same so when you
when you want to add this two numbers
your exponent should be seem to add it
and you have to change your mighty sir
right so in each range of number was
seven I mean it was 72 tends to 5 if you
want to make it 10 to 3 you have to
shift to zeros right so we have shifted
to 0 from this file because 700 make
sure saving insert saying 7 you can
justify their things there 100 into 10
just to see so that's how we do it there
right how can you do it here so this is
your exponent and this is your main
concern so if you want to add these two
numbers we have to make sure that you
make this as same now how can you make
this the same so I thought you have to
change this value all you have to change
this one so what we will do is we will
make a bigger number smaller so we have
a bigger number here let's make this
model so if you make this 0 now what
will change now first the politics
before changing this for sure see when
you change this value there will be an
effect on this number so whenever you
change the menti service but whenever
you change the exponent
it will affect your mind is not what
with how much tumble for that you have
to find a difference between this two so
1 1 0 0 which is 1 1 0 0 minus 1 I mean
it should be this 1 1 1 0 1 minus 1 1 so
1 1 0 1 minus double point of 0 it will
give you 0 0 0 1 which is decimal system
is much right now since we are changing
from 1 to 0 we have to make sure that we
shipped with the bit on this side so
when you make this 0 you have to ship
this bit this side so the initial number
was reasonable it must be 1 1 0 1 and
then we have to shake that 0 here and
then you have to say it's not so 1 1 0 1
was initial umber
now since you are shifting the bits on
this side you have to make you have to
add one extra 0 here and now you can
take this as it is but to seee
and you have to add this number so it is
1 0 1 and then 0 1 this is 0 &amp;amp; 1 so
there
actual value so if you want to add two
numbers you have to make sure that both
the meant both exponents are three okay
so just for the assignments let's see if
I give you this question a 1 0 1 and
then we have 1 0 1 1 e 1 1 1 now if you
want to add these two values you have to
make sure that your exponents are same
now if you can see this is 5 and this is
7 right in decimal format so the
difference is 2 so if you are making
this as 5 you have to shift to bit so do
that and let me know the answer in the
comment section what you think was the
answer there okay so yeah so you can
also subtract two numbers the same
concept applies for suppression as well
for suppression as well you have to make
sure that your exponents are same you
just have to perform the operation when
Tisa but when it comes to multiplication
so when it comes to multiplication
you don't actually make sure that your
exponents are same so in case of
multiplication they say we have equal 1
a 1 0 1 and 1 double 1 0 1 a 1 1 1 so
this is your exponent right so in case
of multiplication you add this value and
you multiply these values so this will
be multiplied and this will be added and
then you have to find the answer so do
it
and let me know in answer in the comment
section this is this is question 1 this
is question 2 thanks for watching and
let's wait for the next video and this
will talk about some boolean algebra
concepts so that's a side for watching
