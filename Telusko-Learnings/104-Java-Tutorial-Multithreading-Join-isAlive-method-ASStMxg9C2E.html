so now in this video we'll talk about
join and alive method to understand that
what we'll do here is let's say after
printing this thing after printing
everything I want to print by so we'll
say system dot out dot println here I
went to print by so I'm expecting that
did this by will be printed after hi and
I mean after printing all this stuff at
the end we wanted by so if I on this
code now something we had happened why
did we got by here itself now why we got
by there it's because when you say t1
dot start and t2 da start so we caught
two new threads right so t1 is one
thread which is executing this hi t2 is
another thread which is executing this
part what about the main thread by
default we do have a main thread right
so main thing is doing that thing
because this two things which is hi and
hello is printed by t1 and t2 so main
thread says okay I don't have any job so
I will do I will print the remaining
which is by so my job is to print by
there right and that's why when you say
t1 dot start it will print hi it is
going for a pause right by the time t2
starts but before you want t 2 goes here
and executes your main is printing this
what we need to do is we need to ask
main main thread just wait wait for this
two threads to complete their tasks once
t1 and t2 got done with their job then
only you go for your execution how can
this do that
so we have to say T 1 dot join so join
is a method which join will make your
main thread to wait for t1 and t2 to
join again so as you can see in this
image we have initially only 1 3 B's
main thread and from main thread we
caught two new threads we got t1 and t2
right so t1 and t2 the executing their
job and main thread is continuing there
right so as soon as t1 and t2 done with
their job they will combine with the
main thread and then meant to execute by
so that join will wait for that
particular point which is that you can
see in the circle there so that's it
will wait for that particular point but
the thing is it may throw an exception
so will handle will use throws exception
here so we'll use we are using closed
exception and now I feel on this code
you can see
I you'll be getting by at the end we can
see we got at the end so that's a that's
the use of join
so what join will do is join will wait
for t1 to join and t2 for join here now
what we'll do is this is one more method
which we can use is something was alive
so let's say before join if I'm saying
if I want to check if t1 is alive so we
can check if T 1 dot alive oh he's alive
and if I run this code you can see
somebody will be getting true because t1
is alive there but if you write the same
stuff if you check the same stuff of the
join because once your t1 joined with
the main method and you fall on this
code now waiting for that time and you
can see we got false so he's alive some
method using which you can actually
detect if you're ready is in a running
state or not okay so once your tread job
is done it will be dead so we can check
that with the help of is alive method
and so yeah that's about join and that's
about he's alive so that's about this
video in the next video we'll talk about
some new concepts in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
