and in this video we'll talk about
Amazon Web Services and how to get a
free account on it so for that we'll be
going to our website which is Amazon AWS
dot amazon.com and if you go to this
page you can see there are so many
things available here don't get confused
with all these things now first of all
we talked about different services
provided by Amazon and then we'll move
towards how to get a count you can see
that they give you an option of killing
off your account here but do we really
get a free service that's important
right so if you scroll down it provides
so many products as you can see it you
know it will take ten years to learn all
these services but we don't need alright
so if you simply want to work with one
type of services you can use that Amazon
provide different types of services for
mobile for a IOT for AI for database for
for the web application so the first one
is compute you can see we have easy to
hear easy to basically stands for an
elastic cloud computing and so it
provides you a virtual service instead
of having your own servers you know you
can have you can buy a server you can
you can you can install all the OS
servers and all those stuff instead of
doing that you can actually use a
virtual server right so that is easy too
but then on that easy to if you want to
run some services if you want to deploy
your web application you don't want to
do anything else you just want to deploy
web application so you can use elastic
beam stack stock use on this you can you
can actually deploy your application so
this is basically a server and this is
where you'll be deploying the
application so you can imagine Beanstalk
actually works on easy to write so these
are the services provide so there are so
many services which we don't need all
these services the videos which will be
coming on the way we'll be using ec2 and
Beanstalk okay let's see if you are
developers and if you want some special
service so you can if you explore
developer services we have this amazing
thing called as ADA based code star
which we are going to use a SS also have
their own github repository git
repository we can you can also say we we
have worked on github right so github
has its own web repositories and a tab
is provides you a kind of
ketta which is code commit then we have
code bill if you want to if you want to
compile use classes on on the server you
can deploy your application right so
there are so many services available
we'll talk about all these things which
we are not going to talk about is mobile
services we are not going to talk about
IOT we're not going to talk about all
these services but in case if you have
interest in this I would suggest explore
this if you want to thinking we have to
pay for it actually no you don't have to
pay for that because Amazon provides you
free services for one year right that's
amazing right so for one year you can
learn all these things you can implement
and then if you feel okay MSI is
something we should focus on you can
then pay for the services or you can get
certified by Amazon and it crushed me if
you are an Amazon certified you will get
a good a good job available in the
market so it does there's so many
frequencies for Amazon certified people
are not Amazon certified people but a
doubler certified people to be specific
it opposes Amazon Web Services okay so
if I lease them again we can we have
seen those products there right all you
can if you can lease down there so many
services provided by Amazon we don't
have to use everything you don't have to
learn everything
of course you you cannot be you cannot
be a marshal of master of all right so
we will be using one of those things
which we need as a developer okay now
comes to pricing this is very important
right so when you click on pricing first
of all we don't have to care about
rising it's it's been costly when you
work on servers but again when you
deploy a website or when you make our
enterprise application of course you are
generating some revenue to spend on the
services as well right so yeah those are
things here yeah
now the important part for us is this
this one free tier because we want free
tier for one year now if you go for here
twelve months free so you can see these
are the services you get for free for
twelve months you get API gateway for
twelve months you get cold front okay
these are all different services we are
concerned about ec2 so you get a 750
hours per month not even thinking okay
we only get 750 hours but don't worry if
you see a calculator and in one month
let's say if you have to do 30 days and
30 days into 24 hours if you are running
that for 24 hours
you can you can see we only have seven
20 hours in a month right and it is
giving you 750 okay even if you look
over the 31 into 24 you can see we have
only 7 24 hours in a year right so or
something - 24 hours in a month and that
would be enough right but then why they
are specifying 750 they could have said
3 right for a month the thing is you
might run multiple instance what is
instance might multiple servers so on
free account you can run only one server
you can run multiple server but if you
are running two servers then every
server will be counted as ok so if you
are running one two servers for one hour
it is 2 hours because you have two
servers if you're running 5 servers for
one art it is 5 hours right and again if
you are going beyond that it will charge
you then what are the service it
provides it provides your service so
what are the things we need we need
ideas again 77050 ours RT is a
physically a database thing relational
database service from Amazon right this
is here and it gives you option of mask
your posture as Mara DB and all
different services what else we are
going to use that's it we are going to
use these two services which are there
for 750 hours and there are some
services which are free forever just
become a member and then you will get
this world for free
so the things which we are going to use
which is a free version is this one code
commit code pipeline code build what
else code with code commit it's not here
yeah so these are the things which you
get for free for forever but the
question arise do we really use this
service individually of course not
so this are depend upon some of the
service which are paid so yeah this are
these are the services provides you and
so you can deploy your web application
you can deploy here on mobile
application you can you can use the
cloud so you can use the video service
from Amazon so you know cloud service is
awesome but then how to get account now
it's very simple just click on create
free account you can see this on the
home page itself
the moment you click on that it will ask
you for the certain things your name
your email address your password your
password and if you provide all these
details after that it will ask you for
your credit card information
oh that's we all right why
they are asking for credit card don't
worry the services are free they will
not charge you for one year provided
you're not crossing the limits maybe
they were up there providing you one
instance and for the experiment you are
running to instance or maybe you'll
actually learn in your production server
on Amazon for free that will not work
because when you don't when your
intelligence service it needs lots of
other services so they will charge you
if we are going beyond that but
otherwise if you are not going beyond
that stuff it they will not charge you
right so if I enter a name let's say
Naveen you find telling even address
which I'd say that is I guess I already
have an account here I cannot give that
name what are the I'm already have it so
I don't have a account here so I will
say at a general calm and then password
I will say any password will do ok so if
I click on continue it will ask you for
some other details as well positive that
is not much the requirement but that's
feared okay okay I don't even with the
possibility I don't ok it's a second on
Jake this so I have all my accounts on
Epson with all the old email ids but
here you can try with this it will work
so create an account it will ask you for
information just enter the verified
information they will not charge you for
that provided you are not crossing the
limits of that 750 hours and that's it
you will get your free account now in
the next video we'll talk about once
you've got an account and once you have
logged in what are the things you can do
so that's it from this video we have
talked only talked about the other how
to create account on Amazon and what l
service it provides so that's it from
this video thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
