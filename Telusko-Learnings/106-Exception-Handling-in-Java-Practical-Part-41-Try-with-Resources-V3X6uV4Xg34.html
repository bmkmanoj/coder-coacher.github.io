thrive with Drive with resources so the
concept name for today is drive with
resources okay now what drive with this
source is it was introduced in Java 1.7
okay so it is Java 1.7 so you can use
this feature only in Java 1.7 and data
in the in my machine I am using kanji
I'm using 1.8 so it will the function
will work here to demonstrate how to use
with how to use try with resources what
we will do is we'll take an example
where I will ask a user to enter a
string and we'll print the same string
by lightning hello so if user says its
name like Rahul so if I will print hello
Rahul that's it
so for that what I need is I need to use
buffer data right so whenever you want
to take input from user we have to add
buffered reader so we'll write buffered
reader BR equal to new buffered reader
so this is how you create object of
bufferedreader right okay so we'll say
new input stream reader and in bracket
we have to say it is system dot in okay
now since we have this bufferedreader BR
equal to new buffered reader now if I
will fetch the data from user so first I
will save the data in STR initially a
strap will be blank and here we'll say
str equal to BR dot readline and now i
can fetch data in this str right now
since i I want to you know let me write
those of you because it might throw an
exception so we will write exception
because this is checked exception now so
this is how you take input write again
in one of my video I have talked about
all I will be talking about
bufferedreader so you can just watch
that video if you're not comfortable
with this so this is how you take input
from user we have multiple ways we can
take when put from user in the with the
help of scanner or we can use
bufferedreader okay so if I write
buffered Widow here which is BR dot
readline now since buffer data takes in
from user storing that input in STR so
this buffer becomes a input/output
operation right so this see this the of
the package we are using here is IO so
it simply means this is input/output so
anything which comes inside Java from
outside world and which goes outside
will be part of i/o and when you have IO
exception or whenever you have eye
operation we all the objects becomes a
resource so whenever you work with
resources you have to make sure that you
close this resources so what we need to
do is we need to first create a resource
and then we need to close it right now
as we have seen in the last video
there's a challenge that if this line
which is red line gives you an error or
if it throws an exception that means it
will not execute BR dot closed that
means in case of exception BR dot closed
will not execute and your resource will
be leaking so what we need to do is we
should always use something called as
try catch so it should we should write
try and catch so we'll say this is
exception e and we have seen in the last
video that we can use something called
as finally so in this I will just print
to let me print here as E and when you
want to close the resource you have to
make sure that everything should be in
finally block which simply means even if
you are getting error or not let me just
increase the scope of operator because I
have declared before inside try so copy
and paste
now what you can what we can see here is
we are using bufferedreader let me just
use proper indentation okay so I'm
creating object above order here and we
are just saying close okay let me just
give none so even if you get error in
this line since we are writing this line
in finally it will execute in any sense
so you can see whenever you work with
try and when you create a resource you
have to make sure that you are using
you have to closing all the resources so
where is the best place to close this
sources it's your final block right
but now if the only reason of creating
this final block is just to close a
resource so this is how this is what we
should do in Java 1.6 right all in till
1.6 in 1.7 they have a new feature which
simply says if you are creating a final
block just to close resource don't
create it
instead of that create or the source
inside try-catch which simply means
right before Ito here in Y what I mean
by that is right bufferedreader here in
the Tri okay something him this way now
the advantage is you don't have to
create this buffer outside and it
finishes because when choice is about
the buffer heater inside our tribe box
so this is the parameter of dry so we
can pass we can create an object inside
a tri parameter now the advantage is
when you have a try in this scenario you
don't have you don't require any catch
block you don't require the final book
so it simply means you can write a try
block without catch and finally okay so
we are creating a try block with a
resource so this is a resource here and
the amazing thing is as soon as you're
done with your crab block this resource
will get Delocated and even if you get
an an error on this line this source
will be de-allocated
so doesn't you know you'd have to you
don't have to be worried about even ater
close the resource or not it's it's try
its drive work to close all the
resources once finish so this is how we
have to use try with resources which is
introduced in Java 1.7 cool we can use
this for many many many you know in
multiple ways we can use it for sockets
we can use it for files we can use it
for database we can use for anything
right any day sources you need you can
use dr8 resources so that is from this
