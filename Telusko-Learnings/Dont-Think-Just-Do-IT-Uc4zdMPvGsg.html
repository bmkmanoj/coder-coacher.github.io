welcome back aliens I am the wind ready
from Paris colonics and from a long time
I am trying to do lots of videos for
YouTube
fact I am doing that now so I talked
about this channel I mean I was thinking
about making videos somewhere maybe on
YouTube some other platform from 2011
you know when I was in my when I
completed my graduation or my masters so
from from that point I'm planning to
make videos but then you know we all are
lazy right because you know we all think
that ideas are more important than
implementation that's not the case okay
we don't even compare that but we always
think that ideas are very important in
our house I have seen people they always
complain about this thing they say we
don't have ideas we don't have ideas I
want some ideas
I mean ideas are everywhere right in
fact every person thinks about ten ideas
per day that's my research but then okay
we do lots of thinking right we do we
have lots of ideas in our mind the only
thing which is lacking nowadays is
implementation uglier days you know when
we used to talk about these great people
they think about one idea and they
implement one idea we are living in a
world of what you say Internet all we
all see we say gadgets so due to this
thing due to internet due to gadgets we
get lots of ideas nowadays and the
problem is since we get lots of ideas we
don't do it and it's not just about
image not just about it's not just about
professional life it's also about
personal life we all think about we want
to do something but we don't do it
because what we do we only think about
it we don't do it and that's why
personal experience you know when I
wanted to be a Android developer I was
too I know in from I gradually itself I
wanted to be a Android developer I was
just thinking about it okay I will be an
to developer one day but I have never
shown that implementation I would never
tried implementation till 2013 right so
it's been two years for me I mean from
that two years off to the 11 2013 I have
never walked an Android right so I was
only thinking about learning Android
same goes for this iOS now so from a
long time I'm thinking about I will be
iOS developer and what's happening now
I'm not doing anything right because we
all think what we don't do it okay I'm
not saying I'm not doing anything I'm
just I'm trying to work on different
technologies but then I'm not doing
everything which I'm thinking okay
that's maybe a good thing but then most
of the people what they are doing now is
they only think that
and do it the only thing which is now
one of the thing which is between you
and your success with you between you
and what you want to achieve is this
thing you have to do it don't think
about it okay
now again this is a slogan from lots of
I mean one of the company which is a
sports company Nike they always say
right just do it so why don't you do it
just do it right so now what happens is
let's say if you want to achieve
something what you want you can do is
don't think just start with it and maybe
you may be thinking okay if you want to
achieve something we need a plan right
exactly we need a plan for that but just
don't create a plan and then implement
it what you can do is first start with
it and while your stuff I mean the
moment you start then go for planning
because if you don't start maybe know
lots of things get the I mean big we get
diverted in the planning stage itself so
what I will do is start with it and then
plan for it and that's what I'm doing
now if you can see I am working on
different technologies what I do is I
start with the technology and then I
plan for it and then I I work on those
technologies that's what that's my plan
now again I'm not saying this is holid
percent foolproof but then it is working
for me it might do work it might be
helpful for you as well right so that
said that's on this video guys see you
in the next video so make sure you are
