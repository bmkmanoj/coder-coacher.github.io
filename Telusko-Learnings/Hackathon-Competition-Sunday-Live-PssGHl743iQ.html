it's inter ha ho GAE in tazaki okay
that's great
okay so I can see people are watching
this and I got the notification as well
so Oh
okay so on my laptop as well I can hear
my own voice okay that's perfect we got
four people watching this okay so I'm
doing a not without at setup now so I'm
using my mic I don't know how good this
mic is now because I'm not even doing
this for my from a long time so yes
people are watching this and the topic
is interesting today so I will talk
about that topic but let others join so
if you are watching this after this
session if you are watching this
recording video you can just skip two
minutes and then you can start with it
because I've seen people they complain
about this okay so yes let's let's let
everyone join because it takes some time
for you to send a notification it takes
some people to join later so till that
point I can see some questions everyone
says oh I can see hi that's great okay
good good okay so hi chinma here yeah hi
hi chin my head watching Meetup yes I
can
how can I forgot you that's great so
people are watching this I can see it's
it the brightness is a lot I don't know
why it's going that much can I control
this lights this is good this is good
I guess that enhancing is done okay
anyway oh so people are watching this oh
okay perfect perfect yeah so let's get
started so I can see okay so 1:06 up at
people watching this 37 likes come on
guys let's get started now oh so what is
so basically I don't know how many of
you know this thing about hackathons
about competitive programming or any
other events you know one of the
questions which I get a lot is how to
get a job this second next question
which I get is how do we improve
programming logic so that different
stuff like that different questions one
how do you because ultimately when you
really do any engineering or any degree
watching you want you
job right you you are you want to get a
job or maybe you want to open your own
startup maybe you aren't you so those
are things the next question is how to
what is hackathons how to participate in
that what is what is community
programming how can you compete on
hacker
earth hackers rank and all those stuff
and how do we improve your logic so
let's talk to the first one how do we
improve our logic now this isn't a
subjective question for different people
at different way of improving logic
because not everyone will be on same
level right everyone have their own
level of logic in fact I have seen this
if you are good with Matt's it will help
you in logic in programming you know so
by default this is a stuff if a bit with
Matt's by default you are good with
programming okay you cannot say by
default but it will help you in being a
good programmer
now that doesn't means that if you know
are not good match you cannot be a good
programmer right I have seen people they
hate Matz but still they love
programming you know they love logic
building and all those things so yes
logic building is all depend upon you so
though so I believe in this concept the
more you work on this the more you write
project the more you write code the more
you spend time with programming the more
you spend time analyzing the problem
that's where you will improve your logic
again there such a steps to it example
start learning any programming and by
the learning programming you know you
will solve those basic questions how to
find even-odd than factorial then some
finding prime numbers and strong numbers
those are baby steps towards improving
your logic and not think those are the
only things but if you don't do that
it's of no use right so first start with
the basic step like finding even all a
factorial prime number all the basic
codes then you can jump on the complex
problem like data structures if you will
learn data structures there are so many
algorithms right like we have sorting
algorithm searching algorithm and all
those things so try to try all those
things it will help you to improve your
logical skills the next thing would be
build a project now here's the thing you
know when you build a project it's not
just about coding ok I have seen a lot
of people you know they just think about
coding they're just thinking about how
can we use
how can you use that thing it's not just
about coding I believe I think is more
about problem-solving it's not about
it's not about programming
I mean programming is just a small thing
inside in if you talk about your left
mind if you people get excited about all
these things learning Python learning in
job JavaScript those are the tools like
you should knowing that I'm not saying
it should be you should ignore
programming I mean Chavez the bite that
those are very important in fact Java
all those languages are very important
but don't just miss that most important
thing which is logic it's all about
problem solving
yeah so that's one thing the next thing
I talk about is how did a job now what
of the way quit a job is of course you
have to compete a degree you have to
give a lot of interviews right that's
one thing that we do didn't have a
choice but nowadays you know companies
they don't want anyone they want people
who can actually work right it's not
just about working on a project yes
there are some support projects which
can work on if you if a company needs
someone who can build projects who can
work on a project they don't want anyone
right they want people who can actually
work and just by knowing stuff is not
enough it's actually you have to work on
a thing example let's say companies
hiring you to work on a project they're
not concerned about how much you know
they're concerned about how much you can
do right they are waiting for output so
they want the output right so if they if
they're paying if you're paying is
something they want output from you
right so you have to so they need people
who can actually work is not just about
getting a salary and being there in the
office now how do you build a project
how do we have that habit of building
projects and that's where this
hackathons competitions comes to come to
the picture in fact when I was in my
bachelor's when I was doing my BSC ITN
MS Society I wish to participate in lot
of competitions in fact I was skipping
my lectures and I'm not think that's a
good thing but I was just skip my
lectures I used to visit different
colleges for competitions I I loved it
you know I worked very hard to win this
competition because in some of the event
when I visited I lost those if I lost
those events you know I visited
Vivekanand College I lost
there I mean a lot of colleges where I
lost in the first round itself I
practiced hard and next year I was able
to make to the second round you know the
more you practice they will cross more
rounds so he showed I was I used to go
out in the first round itself in the
coding competition I Tico is all those
things so first round I was going out
but then I practiced hard I was going to
second round and then at one point I was
winning all the all the events you know
yeah I so continuously I won around five
to six events back back that's that's
what it will give you you know so it has
given me that power or you can say an
attitude of winning those things so the
more I've worked I'm the mole event I
was winning and that's where my logical
my programming my more programming skill
increased but now we have this new thing
you know in Mumbai especially we don't
do that much but in Bank below I have
seen everything most of the colleges
they organise this thing called as
hackathons now just hackathon basically
so let's talk about this competition
which I used to go for so when I was on
my college we used to have a programming
contest where they will give you up they
will give you a question and you have to
solve that question and they will give
you one all in one now what we can do so
let's say if I complete the entire stuff
so they let's say they give you one hour
and if I if I can do that in its I won't
write because if so let's say if I say I
am done I am filling it so the one they
are concerned about is the input and the
output they are not concerned about how
you build it so that's called
programming competitions and I used to
win those things because I was knowing
out of different stuff and I so there
was one when I fly computer God has been
old I don't know if we did we know this
is watching this also chit I know some
of them so they used to we used to
compete with each other and they
sometimes they used to win sometime I
strove in so that's it goes but
hackathons is different hackathon is
about they will give you a problem
statement and everyone will get the same
time it's not that if you complete first
you will win so they will give you a set
of set of time let's say that time may
vary from one complete day to one week
now this thing is done by lot of
companies for internal employees example
it's a Facebook Google all this big
company they arranged a hackathon
where every I mean they employee so
let's say for so they will have a lot of
employees and they will create some
chunks let's say four to five employees
a group and then they will ask them to
build a product so they will give you a
problem statement and you have to build
a product now it may not be a complete
product because you cannot expect in 24
hours they can build everything but then
if you if they can build their or by
their own whatever they want you in that
24 hours or maybe in one week
so that's hackathon it's not about who
is completing it first it's about who is
building the right product in a right
way it's also about the implementation
it's about your thoughts right how do
you break down a problem into a solution
right as I'm as I mentioned it's not
about IT is not about programming is IT
is about program problem solving it's
they also see your problem-solving
skills so let's say if they give you
problem statement you have to they have
to you have to first analyze the problem
statement you have to come up with a
solution in on a paper not as a code so
first you have to find a solution on a
paper and then you have to convert that
solution from a paper to a computer
that's what you do in a project so in
that hackathon you do that it's not
about who is committing first it's about
who is building the right product in the
right way all right so that's hackathons
now so this is done by big companies and
now colleges also organize hackathons I
would I would love you to go to cry
kittens and so be a part of hackathon
and you will learn a lot of things so
hackathons normally taught in colleges
they do it for 24 hours straight
now when I say 24 hours straight it
means so let's say it is to this is
let's say 1:00 p.m. now and they will
give you a problem statement now a joke
1:00 p.m. and then 2 more than 1:00 p.m.
you have to complete the entire stuff so
24 hours the whole night ok so it's 24
hours ok there's no you can take a nap
there you can just you know if you're
coding something and then let's say you
up your team of four and there's a three
people putting UK a can at all one art
come back to coding someone else we go
back and they will take a nap by the
time you can type you can code right so
you have to code for straight 2d for us
is it good yes it is very efficient it
is very effective for developers and
it's
I mean I'm not saying everyone will win
the event or you can you can do that in
24 hours but give it a try
you know I have seen a lot of people
they don't even try this so I would I
would love to I would love if you go
there and be a part of it why I am doing
this today because today I went to I
went for a hackathon I was not a part
participant because okay so for
different reasons but I was a mentor or
a judge so I was I just rented to see
how they are organizing hackathons in
Mumbai because I have not seen multiple
lot of hackathons available in Mumbai
hardly one of two colleges they arranged
and I went to one of the college today
so I was a as a mentor or a judge
Commission of both and I have not got a
lot of opportunity to help them because
I went there late and almost they were
completing the project the thing which
have in is amazing you know I have
talked to some of the participant and
they said the problem statement is they
got in the event they were not knowing
anything about it example some people
were working on space exploration some
people that were working on agriculture
some people are working on different
domains so they were not knowing about
those domains first and then in that 24
hours they learned about a domain they
learned about different technology they
have to use example some people were
working on this thing which is IBM works
and some people were working on Google
App Engine and you know trust me if as a
developer if you as a as a Polish
student if you want to be a developer
and if you're working on all those tools
in your college just imagine your future
the moment you get an industry know all
these tools right so those people were
working when IBM Watson and some people
they have learned all those things in
three to four hours not the entire stuff
but the things which are required for
the project now is it really possible to
learn those things in two hours it's
impossible right if you do it on your
desk it is impossible for you to
complete that into us but they were in
the competition and when you have anyone
in the competition you can do impossible
things and that's what they did it and I
was amazed looking at their projects so
that's what you know so be a part of
competition and you will know the real
power of it so whenever you get very
well get chance just go there and be a
part of hackathon so again let me repeat
hackathon is basically a competition
where you have to code straight for 24
hours or one week okay when you say one
week they think they will be a gap okay
you can go home and come back so that's
how that's what hackathons are in Mumbai
we don't have much hackathons but in
Bangalore if you're in India in us there
a lot of Haqqanis available there in
India we have certain places like
Bangalore Hyderabad there there is lot
of hackathons so you can be a part of
that and the most important thing is in
that event some of the companies the
game for people who they can hire
interns so let's say if you are in your
college and then if this if you are part
of hackathon this company they come
forth come to the hackathon just to hire
people just to get debate best interns
and I mean just imagine you're winning
the event plus you're also getting the
job or the internship right what you can
ask more so that's one thing so that's
amazing so be a part also try to be a
part of hackathons all if you cannot do
that physically you can often do
hackathons online so the request cycle
earth or hacker grind just go there and
be a part of hackathons in the first way
you may not win it but if you try it if
you do it you know multiple times you
may win one of the hackathons and trust
me if you win one its you will get
amazed and you may win multiples but
that's what I did right when I was in my
first year I lost a lot of events and
then second year I I win I want a lot of
events there so try that that's about
hackathons so I can see 115 people are
watching this and 94 likes come on guys
if you enjoy this session let me know
let me know by clicking like button that
and I hope all this properly because I'm
I don't use this mic much I was lazy to
do all the setup because I'm tired you
know so all the things are messed up
here so I'm using this mic here so let
me know by clicking on like button if
you enjoyed this okay now it's time for
some questions in fact I will pick up
the question for mobile phone because
it's my laptop is very bulky today so
let's use it so let's see the questions
here okay so audio is okay that's great
to participate in hackathons it's
necessary to learn all the language no
you have to be good with one language
example if you are good with Python
that's great if you could with Java
that's great so learn any one line
good to even Java said if you know the
entire stack the mean stack that's good
you're good to go
you don't have to learn all these things
because see I believe we should be jack
off all it's not that you should know
only one language you should know all
the languages like Java Python
JavaScript basics of everything but you
should be master of one so be a master
of Python be a master of Java be a
master of JavaScript good to go and one
more thing that a lot of API is
available try to expose ApS as well ap
are basically example Google API we have
Google Maps you can integrate Google
Maps you can use Google's each google
images and service is available right
right now try those things oh okay a
code ship that's what I have never tried
code shape yet so I cannot comment on
that but that's good okay so once
c-sharp tutorials are in your channel
okay I was thinking about c-sharp but
then there's so many things lined up so
I know C shop it's not a big deal for me
to teach you see show up on this channel
I will try okay
how to practice code for a Catan just be
a participant of hackathon you know
that's how you learn because sometimes
you think you learn things by you know
by be a be a participant of it or you
can say bye-bye experience you know be a
part of hackathons and you're good to go
you will learn a lot of things okay so
can you upload videos on react native
I'm not much into JavaScript so not
react native on this channel
okay so aditya say smart india hi katana
18 is it no idea i just need to check
for it do you think code shape is good
oh that's one I don't have any idea
witness says then just go hackathon okay
I will think about it that's a good idea
actually having a virtual hackathon very
physical as well so next time if I go
for a meet-up I can try that I can have
a or we can have a hackathon write off
one day so I just need to arrange a good
place for that let's see maybe in this
end of the year we can try that okay
when you will come to Surat nothing
planned yet because I don't have
training there I don't
you know work maybe if I ever come there
for a visit okay Dina says new glasses
are looking awesome all thank you so
much even I love this I know why I love
this when I went to buy this I thought
okay it's not magic when I face but
after wearing it I liked it so great so
blocking tutorials okay so first of all
I don't know block change from start to
end I know beta fetch surely I will I
will teach you whatever I know about
blockchain okay I'm excited to learn
blockchain income in detail let's see
okay so Jon Snow says how do you how you
participated in hackathon Jon Snow you
know nothing I have not participate in
hackathons I was a mentor there so I got
a call from one of the I got a call from
that college to be a mentor I so I went
there to help them but no no one wanted
my help did because they were already
using it so no I've never have not
helped anyone anyway okay I subscribed
subscribe a long time ago you're
speaking studies more better oh thank
you so much okay the whole say is thank
you for the Java tutorials okay welcome
o audiobook app you use most audio I
tried audible but then it is bit costly
so I so other apps which I am using so I
tried audible
I tried blinka store sometime and I want
to try mentor box let's see how that
works
I used audible for quite a number of
time so it's good or evil is good the
only thing is the cost issue because
nowadays I'm not getting much time to
listen to audiobooks and spending just
because it's a subscription-based widely
even if I don't you think it you have to
pay for it so I stopped the subscription
for time being okay so can you upload
Watson api's I don't know what's and
much maybe I will I will take help from
someone else because I when I visited I
quantitate some people and they know
this thing so I can call them on this
channel to talk about Watson's that will
be a good option so where are you now
some days days without you now I know
and I'm on by now so we can have one
more meetup in Mumbai in weekends
maybe coming coming Sunday we can have a
meet up so let's see Hyderabad meet up
so yes I talked about it right so I'll
be doing that in me so in May I'm coming
to Hyderabad we'll do that a job at
Google through code jam yes that's
possible but if you if you win Koh Chang
again it would enact a billion code Jam
there a lot of things you have to go
through okay how many years of
experience of you so in total I got area
like eight years of experience in the
industry now working for different
companies big companies okay
please make a video on bjs as I
mentioned that I'm not in a JavaScript
match okay talked about Hyderabad okay
what else what else what else I want to
win a contest on heckard rang oh that's
great be prepared for the head work hard
you can do that okay can you can we have
tutorials on spring and hibernate
framework we do we do have a video and
hibernate you just search for the
playlist and there's a entire page for
hibernate the new videos for spring are
on the way it will be uploaded in May of
course so me is a big month for me
everything will be there on in a month
you can find out of things there okay
come coming say is I love your teaching
styles oh thank you so much okay okay so
I can see questions are going up john
snow says the watch remembers that's
right so fortunate members okay are you
telling donna yes i'm in my region is
from Telangana but I live in Mumbai
I'm more than bottom in Mumbai so today
I'm on break up okay let me just take up
some more questions here because I can
see all the questions just went up how
many people people are watching this I
can see 129 people are watching this
come on guys you can take a session
click on like button there okay some
more pushing some more questions in
spring which is a good choice for small
projects why not
spring is a good framework to work on
doesn't matter as a big project or small
project it's a good platform to go with
where are you working so I'm basically a
part of a trainer I work for multiple
companies not specific to one company so
so our for multiple companies not one
okay can you please focus on NBC as well
yes spring MVC videos are on the way but
we'll take some time okay
Jango of flex I don't work on Python but
then I heard Jango is better than flex I
don't know why but I heard about it I
cannot be very specific with that how to
get into product based companies
employee or the algorithm skills data
structures algorithms and problem
solving skills hackathons is one of the
best way to get into company this
progress companies okay is habit better
to use then SQL see how about anyway
generate SQL for you so even if you're
using hibernate behind the scenes is
generating SQL so you cannot run away
from SQL anyway so but yes it will it
will make your work easy when you work
hibernate because it gives you a
position to API so it's coach oh okay
how about our PA not much idea what RT
about it stands for robotic process
automation so people so let's say if you
have a project when you need 10 10
manual testers but now you not need only
one manual district or other things will
be done by your automation software okay
is it possible to is it is that possible
with a rank better than thousand in code
Jam and not much idea if you try that on
Google search for it okay when you will
come in Gandhian ways that no idea okay
how to apply for Google Facebook okay
how do they apply there be about a
hackathon go to hacker trying to make
sure that you've got good ranking that's
where maybe Google will hire you Google
will because they host their event we
can participate
do you know course on deep learning
there should be some courses available
on YouTube search for deep learning on
YouTube you will find some or just go to
you know Udacity or a Coursera so go
there is a good platform to learn in
fact alike just pull back camera up
bitch yeah you can search for poser
that's good good platform to learn all
these things you know I'm very tired
today I just need some support behind my
back
ok do Java has lost its popularity due
to new language the market know that
Java is not losing it's just that other
languages are coming to market so let's
say initially Java was having X projects
now still they have X projects but then
other languages they are going up so
Java is no way going down it's dead you
know for the for the financial companies
Java is still the de-facto language so
that will be there for a long time don't
worry about it okay so we need a video
that you and sera travel both our
teachers OC dodge novel it's a great guy
okay you noticed there are certain
youtubers which I had really proud of
example one of them is Raja will fit in
a good job because he didn't eat I mean
they say that - thanks here there are
youtubers who talked and there are
youtubers who teach you know so Suraj is
one who can teach who actually teach on
YouTube so I've seen some of the like
coding coding train or that's one of the
platform makers where you can learn so
don't just I know I have seen someone
some people they talk about stuff they
don't teach okay
okay collab with Soloff sir again we'll
do that so I'm getting free in May or
June so I'm going to visit to Papa to
his place and we'll have a collab that
last time he came here this time I will
go there yeah so we'll do a collab again
don't worry okay so next 5 minutes or 10
minutes we'll go offline because I have
to do some other stuff it hurt a zone
after a long time say so any new
technology to learn or you would
recommend I would say go for blockchain
blockchain is very new and it will give
you a good head start
okay so Abdul says is Spring Framework
good for financing web projects
okay so for freelancing I would say
because your client don't care which
technology you use a JavaScript Python
doesn't matter what they use but I would
say if you love Java why not Spring
Framework but then if you are working
for big companies they don't have a
choice they are always go for spring
female body Forge
okay so serving we had same phone and
cover - is it a my max you have in my
max with same cover that's great this is
a my max - I use this book for reading
books I use this phone for eating books
okay what is blockchain I want to make a
video and blocks it from a long time I
okay so okay I'm I'm I'm guilty here I
promised that I will upload a video on
blockchain I'm not doing it yet I will
do that es mi max - that's great what is
Spring Framework I do have a video on
spring training work right just go to my
playlist and social Spring Framework you
will get a good idea okay your lectures
know what questions went up
is it late to start up programming at 30
years not at all you know I have seen
you know I used to get some calls from
some okay I got three to four calls some
people had experience of 1560s in the
industry so maybe the age is around 45
what are your five and they are moving
from the other role to programming roles
and they were learning programming
I don't know how efficient or
the I don't like they have learned the
language but they tried it and I know
some people who have learned programming
at the age of maybe fourteen forty five
and they asked you to working on our
projects okay I'm not saying it is very
easy but it's possible okay
can you displease discuss your coding
journey a little bit yes I started
coding in 2010 okay in fact I started
coding in my courses as well so I
started my graduation in 2007 at that
point from that point 2008 I started
coding I worked on different project and
I was mainly focusing on Java that's
what that was my default technology so I
built a lot of projects on Java then I
started teaching Java so everything was
on Java I worked on when I'm doing one
or two project on PHP or on Python 11
tried but yeah so I've used PHP and Java
a lot PHP a bit and Java a lot so that's
that's my coding journey and so every
day I do practice on coding so it's not
just as a trainer we have to so we have
to evolve right we have to learn
different stuff we have to teach
different stuff that's what I do so not
much to talk about what those questions
are just going up now I should have
slowly it you know we have an option of
slowing the chat down next time I will
do that I try to at one but I forgot
into that today how much time you ready
spent on coding every day when he was in
college okay so first of all it doesn't
matter how much time I spent on my
coding skills it's important how much do
you want to spend because for me
everyone are different right so if I
spend two hours maybe that's enough for
me but maybe not enough for you maybe
you wonder is enough for you such all
depend upon you how much time we can
invest so I was not investing every day
but I I was making sure that whenever I
work on a project or anything I was
spending around three to four hours
because once you sit there don't get out
you know till your company the what else
clouds I'm putting any advice clouds I'm
putting is basically cloud using cloud
services now there are so many Krause's
available we have
AWS we have Google App Engine just try
to use those things you can get good
idea about it
okay is your place enough to be a good
job developer yes I would say just love
those playlists and work on a project
see watching things will not teach you
that stuff you know it will not make you
a good developer watching those and
actually working on something will make
you a good developer okay example you
know when you watch any sports later
football cricket you know I'm watching
cricket from last I mean I'm watching TV
from last 15 years now and that doesn't
make me a good batsman right so that's
things so if you want to learn cricket
you have to play cricket if you want to
be a footballer you have to play
football you cannot simply sit on the
front of TV and say hey I know how to
play football nah so don't just watch my
videos also practice that's how you will
learn what we should learn ai okay start
with start with a I've start with basics
of AI then you will know what to learn
next
okay okay which one which one I guess
again I lost my questions do you follow
the least started by I wanted to read
that book I wanted to read a Denis data
but every time I I get something new you
know so this guy had a new book which is
this marked the start of way I started
you think reading that book so second
book of this guy so first book is three
started second book is this database so
I started reading that book okay
okay again again I lost the question
every time I go I put my phone down it
all I look I just lose all the questions
oh okay where's the question where's the
question okay so how to start putting
signs I would say go to youtube and
search for one or two videos and
redesigns and then then go to Coursera
and watch the entire thing so that's how
you learned it of science because Costa
has a lot of videos available for you
know science okay how can I teach
someone what I have learned make a
youtube channel right that's what you do
make a youtube channel and teach
everyone that's what you do don't expect
subscribers don't expect views because
that's what I do now
I don't expect views I don't expect
subscribers okay that's a number game
that just a number game now so try to
teach people that's what you do
in fact I have seen this I don't know I
really got this question of last week I
guess so
they were talking about diverse class
subscribers I got number of views I'm
getting and having the number of views
I'm getting per day because that's
important number of views but subscriber
count is just a number it's all depend
upon how you are able to connect with
your people and what type of content you
are uploading so the content which you
upload on this channel is Java content
right and we don't have a lot of people
who learn Java but when it comes to
Python which come to JavaScript when it
comes to machine learning we have so
many people they want to learn these
things right so that's why some people
do get high subscribers example we got
New Boston right New Boston has
tutorials on each and every language a
great person write was created so many
content so people from all this domain D
ours is driving so subscribing
subscribers is all depend upon whatever
content you're creating so the more
general your content are you will get
more subscribers more specific your
content s you will get less as less as
drivers but that's one way if you want
to teach something just go to youtube
and make up that make a video don't care
how many subscribers you get what's
important is you are teaching or
something real to people right that's
what you do that's all you say go for it
okay and I lost a question again so nice
to see you every time so thank you so
much Prakash nice to see nice to see you
as well on this channel okay okay so
Akshay say cell you always ignore my
question I don't I don't whatever
question I see I just talk about that
question even if I don't know the answer
right okay my question is what which
topic is important hi when it has
Springs both how can I say which is
better how many times playing both are
equally important but yes some projects
most of the project are you working on
spraying some project in that needs
database persistence so at that point
you can use hibernate I would sit as a
sequence learn hibernate first is easy
to learn if you know database and then
go for spring okay can we get full
knowledge in your Java to the yes you
well so that's one of the place which
are making you will get complete go Java
in fact the core Java you say which I am
uploading now those are DP
so before uploading that on YouTube I
was selling those videos on some other
platform so those are paid videos and
people were paying for those videos okay
not a small amount it was around three
thousand four thousand rupees for that
course and now you're getting that goes
for free or this channel so that's what
it is okay now the question well done
sir okay well done for watch so for the
channel okay I will take that okay okay
big it I using Java yes we do we use big
area using Java I didn't get you a
question cool deep I guess there were
two questions one went up and one is
down maybe a meet-up in Chandigarh okay
not planned it
I'm visiting Chandigarh in April but
very for very short time it will be from
I'll be there for some work and then I
will come in back so I'm not staying in
Chandigarh for a long time so let's see
okay so so is it going to learn
blockchain now or still in the
development stage is it good it's always
good you know it yes it is in Telepan
stage other I mean companies are finding
since there's a concept of proof of
concept you know if if company is
accepting a technology they have to
understand how scalable it is how secure
it is so for some companies it is it is
still in POC state which is proof of
concept one they know it is useful for
them they will implement it but it is
useful so yes they will they will be
implementing it's a good time to learn
blockchain okay do you watch Silicon
Valley sir yes I have completed the
entire series I'm waiting for Apple so
that they will have a Silicon Valley
five is it yeah in April I'm waiting for
that date okay so next five minutes and
that's it
I just have some other work to do so
let's do that that's next five minutes
Akshay says it was night meeting here in
Pune oh you were there actually oh hi
that's great I'm very bad with names in
how it normally forgot names I don't
know why I just I did that Google
glasses I know Google glasses
which will remember the moment I see
someone I can get so there will be a
text there who is this guy and why when
I met him okay so which language better
for coding competition I would say
python is better Java is also good but
then some people don't like Java so they
don't do it I would say Python Java both
so all over I would say sir you are
ignoring me no I don't ignore it okay so
you have to understand this guys I don't
ignore any question that the moment I
look at this thing if I see a question I
just talk about it yes I do ignore highs
hellos I do ignored one void thing
because I don't understand that means
example some people says Python now I
don't know what is it answer for
something or something but I don't think
no questions why would I do that okay so
the next question is is it there any
scope for testers yes why not I would
say manual testing also has some scope
but then I would say go for automation
that's that's one thing you can do
okay difference between spring MVC in
spring but-- so spring MVC is a
framework and spring boot is a it's just
you just make your spring development
bit easier because when you work on
spring framework you have good lot of
conjugation right to avoid the
connotation you can go for you can go
for a spring boot nominative channel
again live now sir is it live no I'm not
going to live on this channel now
because I have some other work as I
mentioned I will do live on things on
have already soon maybe tomorrow ok
machine learning videos you will see
that ok any meat a plan in Mumbai
Western I wanted to meet up today
because it is Sunday and I was in I was
in western line today I went to I went
to a collagen inversion I itself so I
wanted to do it with a meter but then I
was busy so project I just came back ok
ok
besides I'd say sir I asked you more
than 50 times they can you make under
tutorials I do have added tutorials by 2
total so I'd those are basic videos I
don't have advanced videos because I'm
busy
that stuff but yeah I'll do that
okay is Python takeover a market of Java
not completely but here there are some
some places where Python is doing good
so that's it everyone oh okay I'll show
you power says what is Silicon Valley
okay Silicon Valley is the area in u.s.
California and it's also a TV series
okay which is so Silicon Valley TV
series and you will get it so that's it
last one question that me should pick up
one now
Oh what is the future of C odd well you
see our syrupy no idea so that's it
