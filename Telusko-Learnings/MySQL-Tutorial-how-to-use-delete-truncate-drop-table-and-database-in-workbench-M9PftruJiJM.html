have seen how to use TCL we have seen
how to create tables also into insert
values and this video we'll see how to
use delete command how to use truncate
how to use drop table and drop database
so let's start with the first one which
is delayed so before that let me first
check weather data whenever you know a
database if it's it's the next star from
student and when I say execute this you
can see I have this record here which is
Naveen Rahul and we have all this detail
now in order to delete the data we can
simply say in it so we have to use
Clause which is deletloss here and then
you have to mention the table name which
is from student where so let's say I
want to insert all the I want to delete
all the student where their all numbers
greater than 2 cool and then we can
simply say control enter to execute you
can see there is something follow us to
those affected okay and then we'll say
again we'll say select star okay I guess
I kept it is as Auto comment let me just
go buy a roll back I hope it falls ok um
it was true so so I deleted my mentor
right but time and let me remove this
auto commit and now let's delete the
role number of two so if I remove this
rule number two which is Rahul and if I
say control enter
so it says one way affected and now if I
say select star so it says only one
record but if I say roll back now and if
I sense a big star so I can see you get
you've got a data back so to delete we
have to say delete from there student
where there will number equal to 2 now
what if I say delete from student so if
you say delete from student and if you
say enter so it says to defector it will
delete all the interpoma database or
table so now if Isis an extra from
student you can see we we are getting
only the table structure not the data so
when you say delete from
it will delete all the data from your
table and when you want to delete only
to put some particular those we can use
weight loss but there's also something
for a strong Kate so truncate what's in
this way so we have to say first make a
let me go back what do you roll back so
if I said hold back and if I say select
star now you can see data is back now
there's something else trunk it's out to
use trunk and we can say truncate and
the name of the table which is student
now all the difference if I say delete
from student it will delete all the data
if I say trunk and student again it will
delete all the data where difference is
once you say delete and you can simply
say rollback so delete statement after
this statement you can actually roll
back the whole data but once you say
truncate so if I say a truncate you can
see zero-two affected and if Isis the
next star if I say start now so it is
you have the blank data and now if I say
rollback
let's see if I can tear it up back and
if I say enter data is still not there
so does the difference between ordinator
a truncate when you delete it again you
can roll back when you drunk a to card
so that's why did it comes under DML and
a truncate comes under DDL okay so
delicious DML and truncate is DDL well
so this is how we have to use a delayed
laws now what we'll do is let's try to
use some other clause now what you found
to drop the table so in order to drop
table we have to say drop table because
drop table is a DDL so if you have to
use a key witches
table there and then you have to mention
the data table name which is student and
if you say enter so I can say drove is
dropped and if I say show tables now to
the Pascal query it says no table
available which is blank and now let's
say show databases so it will show all
the available databases so you can see
there's a list of databases what I'm
concerned is I have a database which is
ABC I want to drop this database now you
know what a drop database
drop database ABC and a semicolon now if
you say in tow
so you can see it has dropped the table
let's say show database this and if I
say enter so you can see this is not
that simple
so this is how we have to walk with my
SQL commands which are tell it truncate
drop table and drop database so that is
from this video so for more videos do
