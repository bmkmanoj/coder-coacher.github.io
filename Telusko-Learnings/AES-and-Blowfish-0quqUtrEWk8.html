video about the es the next we have is a
es and lo fish now if you if you know
the structure of des des endless no fish
are very simple it's so simple that just
we have to change this des to make it a
es that's it
though the pie deal will be done but
before going for that what we'll do is
we'll just take in from user because in
your exams there might be chances that
you have to take in from user right so
what we'll do to take input from user we
have to use bufferedreader BR equal to
new bufferedreader it will take new
inputstreamreader
this will take system dot in okay once
you do that then directly we can say
it's instead of Naveen ready we'll say
BR dot readline and before this we'll
say we'll ask user to enter enter enter
plate text so we say enter plain text
okay
now this will work in the same way as we
done in previous tutorial but this time
we are going for user input so let me
run this it's nothing about plain text
Oh what was that
okay so my plain text will be say my
name is not being ready okay so this is
the plain cipher text of my of this
plain text and this is my green text
rocket now Oh what we'll do is we'll
convert this code into a years now to
convert this code into eight years it's
very simple you just have to mention you
just have to change the change your key
right everything is same just have to do
instead of des you have to mention AES
and this time it is again yes that's it
if we do the same code if we run this
code then text will say no we are over
the same thing it's my
name is Naveen ready and 200 there is
some problem with this I missed
something yeah okay this time again it
just should be e is because the key
value see if you can see the error it
says this invalid key exceptions okay
which means AES and des have different
keys so let me run this again oh that's
my name is I mean ready okay so this is
the ciphertext and this is the plaintext
now how to get Blowfish it's again very
simple wherever you find a es just
mention Blowfish here it should be again
Blowfish again you can do those
find/replace thing and again it will be
Blowfish I've done this code if you
enter detail like we said I can have in
20 this time and this is the ciphertext
and this is the plaintext right simple
so this was if you if you know the
structure of one algorithm you will know
the structure of all T that is des AES
and Blowfish so let's make liquor vision
so you require two strings with CT and
PT you require a key which is a
interface secret key to create object of
that secret key you require a key
generated or get instance dot get
generate key it will give you the key
you have to mention the algorithm name
here then you have to go for the
encryption using dual method this is the
user-defined method which means you have
to define it and we have defining that
method here then you have to take a
cipher cipher block for us to specify
the algorithm you are working for its
Blowfish your cipher block will go for
two modes when his encryption mode
second indication mode so when this you
have to mention encryption mode and you
have to pass the key because for one
cipher block works only for one mode and
one key and for different type of
plaintext
then you have to convert your plain text
into byte format then you have to
actually do the encryption and then you
will get the encoded cipher you have to
convert that into the cipher from
a cipher which is encoded into a normal
string and that is possible with the
help of base64 encode er so this is how
we do encryption and for decryption you
have this code okay simple right so this
was your des AES and Blowfish thank you
so much and do subscribe for forth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
