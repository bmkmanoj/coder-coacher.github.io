about three methods we have talked about
push pop and peek in fact we have also
used one more function which is a show
which will print all the elements of the
stack now with this we need two more
methods the first one is sighs now size
will give you the size of the stack and
we also need a method called s is empty
now is empty will be useful to check if
the stack is empty now why do we need
that that we'll see in in some time but
then let's implement these two methods
first now to implement this let's go
back here and I would say in fact before
after this peak the first implement the
method which is size so look at the size
of the stack so it's a public int the
Metheny would be size and here let's do
it on top because top will give the size
right okay we have we have a top
variable there so when I do it on top
Willie what do you think weight work
let's try so I would say go back and run
inside grande so let me just not pop any
element here so you can see we are
pushing three elements and then at the
end I want to print the size of this
stack I would say num start size now it
should print the size for you let's run
this code and okay it is printing three
here but you know you should also print
the message I would say size is and I
will say size is this one let's run this
code and you can see it's a size three
that's right we we we have three
elements let me just add one more and I
would say the value is let's say seven
and if I don't this code it should say
size is four or that's working you can
see that it is working and after that if
I if I remove any element let me just
say pop I would say num start pop of
course it will print seven the pop value
but what's the size size becomes three
so it works right when you push the
element it will increase the size when
you pop the rim it will decrease the
size that makes sense let I want to
implement one more witches is empty so I
would say public now is empty is a
method which returns a boolean value so
many would you whenever the method
starts with ease it's always returns a
boolean value I would say is empty so
let's return if the top is or less than
equal to zero then we have to say it is
empty right so it is not zero which is
more than zero it's not empty right so
let's go back to Rana and let's or we
have to checked which is empty
so I will check it here after
everything's I will say so I would say
empty state is someone to check if it is
empty will say true or false and the
moment you does it so we have said you
have to say num start is empty right and
of course it is not empty so it should
print false and you can see the code
Falls if I did the same thing before
pushing any value and he fired on this
code now you can see it says true and
maybe if I push one element here and
after that if I if I pop and I get if I
print is empty it will it will say true
right because it is empty so that's how
we can implement these two methods but
was the use of this implemented to these
two methods do we have any advantage and
the answer is yes so what I will do is
let me just do some experiment and let
me remove all the extra stuff from here
I don't want to peek I just want to push
multiple elements and I don't want to do
any of this stuff let's let's keep it
simple
say I'm I'm only pushing elements and
then while I'm pushing I will push four
elements and if I add on this code so
yes we got four elements what if I try
to push five elements will it work let's
try I would say seventeen and if I don't
this code and yes it does work what if I
try to push one more and let's say the
value is maybe seventy seven in this
case if I done this code you can see we
got an exception which is array index
out of bounds exception it is full right
because this tag is full that means
whenever your stack is full you should
not be adding the value it should print
the message to the user hey this tag is
full how would you do that how would you
check if these if the stack is full and
the way you do that so every time you
say push so before pushing you need to
check is it full how do you check if it
is full the stack value is five right
the maximum size is five so I would say
if top it is equal to only four that
means your stack is full right so if it
is four I would say stack is full so I
would say system dot out dot println
stack is full and this part will be
executed in else part okay
let's go back here and after every push
I will try to print show so that will
know what is happening so I would say
nums dot show and let's run this code
now and you can see at this point it is
saying stack of stack is full oh my bad
okay I guess I'm missing one more thing
here after printing the stuff I just
want to print a new line
so that every output I will get on your
line okay so you can see this it is
saying stack is fully oh it's here
itself because I just made a mistake it
should not before it should be more than
four why more than four is because every
time you say post you can see we are
incrementing the value here so it is not
four it is five let's go back there and
let's run this code and you can see that
after this point it's a stack is full so
it will not allow to push the element
after this point so that you can save
yourself from the exceptions right so
that's how you can check if it is full
now what I will do is I will try to pop
so I'm pushing all these elements and
after pushing this if I try to pop the
elements and I would say system dot out
dot print and I would say num start pop
it will print it will pop all the
elements and not all it will it will pop
only one at one point so I will run this
code you can see at the end you got only
one element which is 17 that's great
in fact I will not add all this element
I just want to add three elements so
that we can save our job so I'm adding
only three elements now
and if I say pop of course you will get
it last time in which is 10 right this
is the last time at which you have
entered I would say pop two more times
and you can see it will try to pop all
the elements so if I say print the size
I would say num start size it will print
ero because we don't have any element
right so you can see we got 0 what if if
your stack is empty now and if you try
to pop now if we try to pop it will give
you exception right because you don't
have that value before that so you don't
have any value in minus 1 so that means
you need to stop it before going before
popping the element how do you check so
will say if so we have to do this only
when if your if your stack is empty then
you will not do all these things you
will simply print a message which is
stack is empty otherwise we'll say else
and you got the point right so if I say
tab and if I don't this code now okay I
hope it will work this and there's a
problem here or data we have to ensure
something I would say data is by default
0 that's a local variable right so
before returning it we have to assign
some value and let's run this code now
and it works you can see that it's a
stack is empty so it will not give you
exception so we have to handle we have
to take care of all this element as well
right so that's it
hope you you understood what we have
done so we have implemented two things
one is size and second is MPs empty
method so using these two methods we can
puff we can check if the stack is full
or the stack is empty before performing
any operation so I hope you like this
