these exceptions we have two perspective
one to handle the exception and second
just to suppress the error if you know
that for sure you are not getting any
error for sure
something let's go with this operation
what if I say it is K equal to I plus J
so it doesn't matter if my J value is
zero or four it will give me an output
it will not show this as a for sure
right but there are chances that it will
throw this i/o exception and we are
trying to handle it for the name sake we
are trying to handle this but what if
you are lazy enough to not to handle the
exception you don't want to handle the
exception write something in this way
you don't want to write this catch block
final block you're damn lazy right now
in this scenario still you are getting
this error and you know as a user you
will always enter some value you are not
dumb right but still Java says hold on
you it might throw an error so you have
to handle in this scenario you can say
Oh JVM listen I don't want to handle the
error but what I will do is I will
suppress the error I know it will throw
an error so I will suppress it and how
to suppress the error with the help of
throws so throws is a keyword in Java
which which is used to suppress the
arrows all exceptions so we can simply
say it is closed exception now you can
see it has suppressed the error we are
not handling the error we are just
suppressing the error again if you are
if you if you want to be efficient
program will always go for try catch but
if you know you will not get any error
is just to suppress those errors we can
use this closed exception you can also
specify specific specific type of
exceptions you can directly say IO
exception what if you have more
exception like SQL so you can cease
comma SQL exception so doesn't matter
how many type of exception you want to
handle you can just write using comma
comma comma but mind you this is this
will not handle the error it will just
suppress the error okay so this is one
type of
exception one type of one keyword in
Java now what next
so you know you got the idea of those
right and those should be always right
after the method let us come back to the
example of trycatch we'll use the undo
function of edit oh okay now we have
this error right simple now what if the
opposition previously we have we were
using is I divided by Z I divide by J in
which if you're J value is 0 it should
it will print an exception right but
it's at is plus and in this scenario if
I want to check if my K value is less
than 10 that means the output of this
turn should this case should always be
greater than 10 or equal to 10 if this
is less than 10 I want to print an error
either should be something in this way
it should not be I cannot divide by zero
but the exception should be minimum
value for the output is 10 this should
be the error and I don't want to print
any other type here so I can simply do
is in this scenario it will not call
that either so we have to forcefully
throw an error and to force me throw an
error we have to use the keyboard which
type of error on to print I want to say
new I want to print automatic exception
error so what it will do if my output is
the value of K is less than 10 it will
throw this error let me run this and
initially the value of I is 8 and if I
say if the value of J is 6 the output is
14 right but what if if I run this code
with a value of J as 1 the output the
minimum value for the output is 0 right
that means we are throwing error it
might you might think that a hold on we
are throwing an error that means we are
forcing to call the other
sometimes we have to do this because
there might be chances that you want to
check for the value which should be
greater than 10 oh and you are doing all
the codes in your catch so you have to
throw the exception right so this is
this is the next key this is the keyword
we have to use for throwing your own
exception it's like you can create an
exception you can you can create a new
class and you can extend with exception
we'll we'll do that part in the next
tutorial and I hope you got the idea of
try block catch block those and throw
and do this curve for the further videos
and thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
