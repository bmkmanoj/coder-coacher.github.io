collection framework and this let's
explore something more in this
collection interface now now Chris
collection interface provides use many
more features one of the feature is you
can use some people as iterator to
iterate from the list or you can use
size to get this size now this all this
a function which is strain for each
these are or these functions are
introduced in Java 1.8 or which is the
weighted 8 version we'll talk about this
in the subsequent tutorials
and then you can convert your collection
into a diol so that means if you want an
array from up from the collection you
can use to add a function that's it
let's say I want to add a element after
- that was before 5 even if I say let's
let me just come in to remove this part
I want to add a element which is let's
say 3 and if I if I run this the output
will be it's 1 2 5 3 but what I want
that this 3 should be added after 2 that
means I want to add this 3 after 2 but
unfortunately in collection interface we
don't have any function to specify this
to specify the location or the index
number and that's why we have a new
interface called as least the least
offers you a feature where you can add
an element to a specific location like
example if I say C dot ad now I'm
getting one more option which is int
index that means I can specify it should
it should come after 2 which means this
index number for this one is 0 for this
- it's 1 and the index number for this
should be 2 and the value we want to
assign here is 3 that means it will come
after 2 now it's not because of this -
is this - it's just the index number
okay let me run this now I can see three
comes after two so list offers you a
feature of adding
values to any location okay now what
we'll do we'll add some random values to
list now how to add random values let's
say I have a kulluk I have a list or
list of I have a list elephants of least
let me add some random values now how to
add random values we can use a class in
Java which is class random it's a are
equal to new random okay and we can use
a for loop to add elements we'll add
let's say 100 elements will say int I
equal to 1 and I less than equal to 100
and I plus plus okay and to add these
elements we can simply say Z dot add and
we'll say r dot next int so and in next
change we can specify the values should
not be get it in let's say 1000 so all
the values will be less than 10,000 now
so let's run this the output you are
getting is all these values and these
are 100 values so you can see we have
all these hundred values which are less
than thousand now what we can do now is
we can simply we are printing this all
this values right but what if I want to
I want 100 elements in a sorted order
that means now once I got all these
elements I have to use one more for loop
and then in that folder by have to use
either bubble sort or quicksort some
sort some certain sort of sorting
techniques right instead of that in
collection framework we have a class
called as collections now this
collection class is very helpful if I do
some extra tasks like sorting so this
collection class has a method called
sort in which you have to pass a object
you can see we have to pass an object of
list and the object of list here is C ok
9 file on this code you will see you are
getting all the elements in a sorted
order so we don't have to sorted your
Java or your this this class this method
sort will sort all
elements now what if instead of least if
I had our collection if I had a
collection it will not work is because
okay it's because this sort method needs
a least int of least reference not
collection reference so it will not work
and as the other difference of using
least interface so instead of collection
we can use least which offers which
gives you this feature okay so you can
sort it also okay so now we have now we
know how to use collection interface and
how to use leash interface we have seen
one more thing called as vandamm class
Twyla means and to print elements now
further we will talk about this in the
subsequent tutorials
thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
