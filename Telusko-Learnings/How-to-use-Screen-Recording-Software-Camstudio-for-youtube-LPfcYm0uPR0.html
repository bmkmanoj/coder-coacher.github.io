record your desktop screen or laptop
screen so in order to record your laptop
screen what we can simply what we simply
need is we need a software which will
record your screen now it is done using
frame by frame concept so we can use
multiple software so there's something
called a scam studio or Camtasia so
there are lots of software available if
you simply search on Google if you go to
google and say free screen recorders so
you can you will get lots of options
there you know you there are lots of
software's one of the best software you
can go for is camstudio so I'm not
saying it has all the advanced features
I'm just saying it has all the basic
features you know because when you
record your screen you just want to
record your screen maybe for uploading
videos on YouTube maybe for sharing your
your work with someone or
troubleshooting something and you want
to know what we have done and for that
we record our students ID so we don't
want any fancy work here so if you need
a fancy work or some editing things we
can choose here Camtasia or we can also
use there's something called as s re
recorder there are lots of sophos
available now which one I use so for
this thin recording I have used a cam
studio so in order to can download
camstudio we can simply go to camstudio
dot Haji and once you reach here you can
you know just scroll down to get the
download link and you can see there's a
lot download link here so once you could
say download camps to do desktop screen
recorder so it will ya so it will get
downloaded on your desktop ok so it's
around off 1mb no not more than that so
what we can simply do is you can just
download it and you have to install it
now once you install your camps to do so
it will you can see camstudio in this
format here so it looks something in
this way okay so this is your camstudio
so this is how it works i have opened it
and
the recording is going on so it says the
current frame rate is a bit low where is
the frame rate ok so that's my current
file size it's been two minutes and 26
seconds i am recording my system and you
can change all the settings going from
here so since i'm in telling position i
cannot click here but there's option of
region region will specify a vision you
have to go for you want to go for full
screen auto fix screen or a particular
portion on your desktop this options has
multiple options like audio recording
video recording so let's say if you want
to record a video with a particular
resolution or a particular frame rate
you can go there and you can change it
you know once i start my gramps to do it
automatically get minimized and that's
option is also there once you start the
recording this software cam should you
will automatically get in a minimized so
there are lots of option available
through those camstudio now thence once
you're done with the recording or you
can simply do is you can just click here
you can click on stop here and once you
say stop now once you say stop here what
it will do is it will open a window
where you can store your file restore
the file you have to specify a file type
which is by default ABI here and you can
upload your avi type of videos on
youtube so the type of videos I upload
is actually avi I know it's bulky but
you too will do all the required
conversions ok and that's it so once you
stop again you can do some you can not
sure you can assign some shortcuts you
know when you assign shortcuts you can
simply close your or you can stop your
recording by pressing some combinations
cool so this is why we have to record
your screen and you can upload these
videos on YouTube and you can get famous
right so yeah that's how we have to use
camstudio so thanks for watching and do
