about starch - so we'll see an example
of storage to so prerequisite for this
is you need you need to have some idea
about servlets JSP and some theory about
starts you can learn those theory by
visiting on go just go to google and
search for stoats example of stores
theory and using any website you can
learn the theory part and if the monster
the example you can view this video now
in this video we'll we'll create an
application in which user will enter a
name and depend up on that name will
show the greetings example if I enter a
name like Naveen so I will show the
greeting as hey Donovan that's it that's
what we want to do here but instead of
doing this with the help of servlet
architecture or which is or you can
either use MVC there but in starch 2 we
have to use starch 2 framework in which
instead of using a normal soft light we
have to use something else now what
exactly that as is for that let's let's
let's create a project so we'll say that
new project and in this will select Java
web web application and we'll say next
we'll give a project name as say demo
starts ok in case in fact we have two
versions of stores when he starts one
and starch two and there's a lot of
different between stores 1 and storage 2
if you have a store if you know starts
one so if you are thinking that stores 2
will be easy for you then it's no
because there are lots of changes and
because of this problem lots of people
they have moved from storage to or they
have left starts framework and they move
towards spring MVC now but still there
are some companies there still be
working on stores framework so we'll see
starts here ok so here in this server we
have two option either we can use tomcat
or we can use GlassFish so you can
choose any one I'm going for class
physio and Java EE version
anything about five will do here and
then we'll click on next now once you
click on next it will show you some
framework much time so it will show lots
of frameworks I don't know in your
machine what are the frameworks
available because I am using NetBeans
here you can do the same code using
eclipse in Eclipse it will not show
these all these frameworks you have to
configure those framework manually in
fact in NetBeans also by default you
will get option of spring MVC you will
get JSF you will get starts one and
hibernate you will not get starts - this
is ma this is this is the framework
which I have defined since in your
application or in unit means by default
it will not be configured I will not go
for any framework here we can't figure
that manually then click on finish now
once you click on finish you can see our
project is ready here and I got a HTML
page I don't want a sh t ml here I want
a JSP so I will close this let me get a
JSP you so we will say new JSP and we'll
name this as index and click on finish I
got a JSP page here now till now
everything is simple right
you you are you have created a project a
web project and then you have created
our index dot JSP page there's nothing
called as starts element here everything
is normal java web project now what's
the advantage of using stores here now
let's say if I want to if I if I want my
user to enter his name what I want is a
text box I want a text box which will
enter his name and then it will he will
click on a button and depend upon the
request or the action map it will call
the particular action right or a
particular servlet you can say now oh we
have to use all the inbuilt elements
which are provided by HTML but what if
you want some extra elements or
customized elements
sgml says i will provide you some
limited number of tags then you can use
something else touch tags now in order
to use those studs tag and those studs
features we need to add some libraries
now what exactly those libraries are
that we'll see in the next part of the
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
