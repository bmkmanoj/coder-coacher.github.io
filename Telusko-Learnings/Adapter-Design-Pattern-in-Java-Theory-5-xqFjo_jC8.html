being ready from 30 squat lodgings and
in this video we'll talk about adapter
design pattern now this is this is the
one of the design pattern we have use in
Java so we have always seen a a video on
design pattern site so approximately we
have 23 design patterns and there's one
of them now this is a part of structural
design pattern now Bissell how it works
so let's imagine so let's imagine
adapter what is it up there now so let's
say you have a iPhone 6 ok you have
let's imagine you have an iPhone 6 here
and in this i phone 6 you have you want
to charge this phone now so you went to
your friend's place and now you want to
charge your phone of course your equal
to charge all right and unfortunately
your property of charge at your home now
you will all your asking your friends to
give you the charger of iPhone 6 now he
is using iPhone 4s right
so now he will be having a charger for
iPhone 4s which is that now how can you
charge with iPhone 6 with the help of
iPhone 4s charger because iPhone 4s
charge as a bigger charger they have a
bigger slot whatever iPhone 6 we have a
small slot now how to charge this so
what we need we need to adapter here so
what if you can just use this an up
adapter to combine or to charge your
iPhone 6 with a charger is it possible
of course if that if that adapter works
it will charge your phone right so that
is what adapter is right so that's your
adapter design pattern but how to
include this in Java right because we
are talking about software world this is
hardware how can you include that in a
software world so now let us imagine for
that we will go for different example
will not take the phone example in the
practical will take a what you say
assignment example in this so let's
imagine you have a school okay of course
you are going to school or college right
so in your school you will be getting
lots of assignments right and you need
to complete the assignment and to
complete the assignment we have to do
our assignment right you have to correct
to write your assignments so that is a
work for you and to like an assignment
what we need 10 right so your pen will
be a property for the assignment work so
let's imagine you are doing assignment
you are writing your assignment at some
method so I write assignment is a method
and to do that we require a pen right so
in this example we have school and
inside school so that we have a main
method so you have to ID assignment and
we have a class which is assignment work
in which we'll be having a method which
is write assignment but to write the
assignment we require a pen right so
what is pen here so pen is the interface
okay so pen is an interface here which
is pen P and also we have a pen there
and that you will be having a method so
in order to ID assignment we require a
pen right so let's imagine we have a pen
property here now the problem is once
when you want to write the assignment
you have to set the properties also so
you have a method you have a setter
there you will set the pen but we also
need the implementation of pen right so
V as I as a developer we have to create
the implementation for pen but hold on I
don't have the pen implementation but I
already have a pilot plant pen
implementation so we have a pilot pen so
I have the implementation of pilot pen
okay that's there now how can you
combine how can you work with pilot pen
here because here you are mentioning pen
right and we have a pen interface we
have a pilot pin class so can be
combined this two can we use pilot pen
dip in the place of pen directly you
cannot do that now here we need to use
something called as adapter which will
combine so will be having a pen adapter
which will take pilot pen object and it
will provide pen object I know how to do
that I will say in the Black team
practical implementation got the point
right so that's how you walk with
adapted design patterns provide the
adapter between two different interfaces
or two different classes so to exactly
do it that will say in the practical so
