Wendy and in this video we'll talk about
Jael
now as we know that we got Java 9 in
which you got latest features like Jay
shell now Jay shell is actually a rapist
for Java now label is there for
different languages like Python so what
exactly ripple is it is read eval print
loop which means you can write a
statement and you will get the output
instantly you can also call it as
interactive console now first of all how
do you open Jay shell so it's very
simple first of all you have to install
JDK nine and once you have installed
that once you have set it set all the
path you have to open CMD now you can
set the path in two ways you can use
your environment variables or you can
set the path from here but that's fine
if you have done that what you can do is
you can simply type J shell now this is
how this is how you open gesture open
your CMD make sure your path is set and
type J shell now after typing J shell
just say enter and you can see it will
open J shell for you now it is also so
we have entered into J shell now okay so
the first command you will see so
remember this whenever you want to file
any command injection we have to use a
slash there okay you can execute Java
statements or you can execute some
commands but for commands you have to
use slash now one of the awesome
commands we can use here is help as you
can see we got help now the moment you
do that you can see we got all the
commands which we can use he okay so
there are lists of commands we can use
so that is one thing so what is second
command we'll see I can before going for
any of the commands let's first of all
understand how to go out so let's say
you want to shell now and you want to go
out
now there's the easiest way you can
click on this cross button this will
work but that's not a good way right so
what you will do is you will simply say
slash and you can you will type exit now
the moment you say exit it says goodbye
and you will you are coming out okay
once again J shell might not work in
your system if you have to J decays in
your system so first you have to make
verify which version of Java you are
currently working with so I can see you
can see I'm using Java 9 so just verify
once before continuing with this so
again so let's go back to J shell and
that's how you open J shell just typed
racial there and let's try to execute
something here now doesn't my
which programming language you start
with right you when you stop and talk
about C language or C++ or Java you
always start with hello world right
button normally what we do is when you
write up when you write programming when
you write Java code we have to get a
class or to get a method and then we can
do something but here we can simply type
system dot out dot println and here you
can actually type a statement so you
will say welcome to the disco now you
can type anything you want right I'm
just typing this and this semicolon at
the end is not compulsory because your
gel will do it for you and the moment
you say enter you can see record the
output as welcome to the telescope so no
way to define a method that annoyed to
write a class and that's the that's the
best thing about Jay shell now what if
you want to perform some operation let's
say you want to add two numbers is it
possible it's very easy actually so you
can simply say two and three if I say
enter will it work okay let's try and
you can see the moment I do that you
caught the answer okay so you can see
when I say two plus three is five but
what is this dollar two now dollar two
is basically an ID so why do we need an
ID here because ie will be useful for
you to use it later example let's say if
I want to add a number six to the
existing output we have so the output
here is five I want to add six to that
output I can use an ID here so I can say
dollar two dollar two will give me an i
if I said all it - you can see total it
is five so again if I type dollar two
plus six so what will happen is it will
add five and six so five is the output
right there fourth for the ID - and you
can see we got okay so five and six we
got eleven it's that awesome right and
we got 90 which is dollar for right so
we can use dollar for to do something
else right so I can simply say system
dot out dot println and you can actually
use dollar for here to print right you
can see we got lemon so you can use that
I'd ID anywhere you want so you can
reuse the ID later so that's how we can
perform addition can we do something
else can I can I perform a logical
operation here let's say if I say true
or true
you can see we got true so if is it true
or false it will work so let's let's
perform something so I'm gonna say 8 is
greater than 9 which is false of course
if I say 8 is greater than 9 odd all I
will say 6 is greater than 5 and you can
see we got true so we can perform all
those operations which we normally do in
in Java so when you when you learn Java
for the first time this is what you do
right you perform addition you print
something you go for the logical
operators and you do all those stuff so
we can do everything here it's possible
and it's not easy to work with
now do we have some extra thing you do
we didn't we do something else now we
can also declare variables right we can
do that so if I say int I equal to 9 and
the moment I say enter you can see it
works it says I is 9 now what if you
want to use this I later can we reuse
the variables is it possible let's try
so if I say system dot out dot print in
and instead of typing it I will simply
use the existing code and I will say I
you can you get you can get the last
command by typing by pressing up button
or up arrow right normally we do that
with any CMD or terminal so if I enters
into this you can see we got 9 so yes we
can reuse the variables as well now can
i define one more variable if i say int
j and if i don't assign the value that's
fine by default the value will be
assigned 0 now in java is in J shell we
can also get the verbose output I mean
when you when you will perform some
commands you can get a verbose output
now how do we do that so you can say
slash again we are performing some
commands right if you are sending some
commands you have to use slash I will
say slash set feedback because I want a
feedback whenever I type a command I
want to see what what is happening so
you can set feedback the default
feedback is normal so at the moment I do
that you can see the default feedback is
normal right what I want is were bows so
what we can do is we can say set
feedback and you can say this is verbose
and now you got a feedback verbose now
you might be thinking what's the
advantage of this the advantage is if I
say int K is equal to 9 or maybe int k
equal to 1 now it says you've got the
value which is
k equal to 1 right but it also gives you
a feedback that created a variable cave
of type int right and it makes more
sense when you write this code now if i
say k plus plus and if i say enter you
can see we got the value which is 1
because this is post increment and again
if i try to print the value of k you can
see case 2 now but here look at this it
says created scratch scratch medieval
which is ID which start with 13 way of
type paint because we are performing an
operation right and we are not we are
changing value but then we are not we
are performing an operation but we are
not storing it so just store in dollar
13 so that we can reuse it now if I say
plus plus K it will give you 3 and you
got a new ID so every time you perform
an operation it gives you a new ID and
that makes sense right so yes you can
perform all the operation which we do in
normal Java now can I have multi line
comments normally also the multi-line
statements example when you perform one
line of code you don't need to put
single in there because Jason will do it
for you but money for you what if you
want to define a method what if you want
to find that class is it possible let's
try that so if I say public void show
I'm defining a method now so I'm
defining a method like show and you have
to open the curly brackets yeah when you
the moment you say enter now can I say
enter because normally whatever we have
done till now it has one and one line of
code right but this time I want to
perform multiple lines of code do we to
do something extra to do that actually
no we don't have to we simply have to
say enter and you can see this is a new
type of line record it says dot dots
arrow and it is it is waiting for you to
enter something else what I will say
here is I will say int val or int num is
equal to 9 or maybe 8 why all this 9 I
will go semicolon here and I will say
enter now it is still waiting for me so
I will say system dot out dot print Ln
and I will say a hello world and I also
okay so and then at the end I will say
semicolon enter and we'll say cut abacus
closed and done we have defined the
method which called a show it's that
easy we can define the methods method
methods as well now can I can I call
this method that's important right so
let's type show and
they enter and you can see it works we
got we got hello world perfect right
okay now I want to make some changes and
this is it possible to make the changes
now first of all before making the
changes let me just show you one more
command and the command here is list now
if I said list you can see we got all
the statements which are performed till
now right you can you can see the first
statement was this one so that's why the
ID is one this for this the ID is 2 then
the ID is 3 so we have performed all
this operation till this point and we
got 16 here what I want to do is I want
to edit this thing I just I want to I
would know I want to print hello world
with a value here how can I do that
let's try so to edit we have to type a
command called as edit right so we have
to say slash edit and have to mention
the ID the ID in this case is 16 so I
will say dollar 16 and it's if I say
enter or there's no code snippet for 16
is it 16 yeah so you have to you don't
have to mention a dollar symbol you have
to mention the you have to mention the
idea that's it now the moment I do that
you can see if we got a edit pad this is
a Java swing panel if you have ever what
you've worked on swing this is how it
looks like right now if you have worked
it on a long time in a way back you know
how this looks like okay so what I will
do is here I will make some changes so
how do they change here so we'll say
hello world and I will say plus num so I
want to print num as well now just
simply say accept because you have made
the changes and say exit okay now it
says it has updated the method let's try
to execute that once again let's call
show and can you see that we got hello
void 8 and it's that awesome right I
just love this type of things okay now
what else we can do can we just do that
once again let's do it
do the Edit once again now imagine this
is a method and you already have an
instance variable and the instance
variable okay now since we're editing 16
so it is going back to previous version
I want to print or variable called as
age now of course we don't have a
variable called as age till now right we
have not done that yet it will what what
do you think will it work now that's a
good question right so before continuing
I will give you two seconds to think
about it will this work because I am
using a variable which is not yet
declared because I am is I mean
imagining that this is this must be a
instance variable right it is defined
somewhere else so let's say except there
is no error I will sex it there is no
error
let's call show now and I'm going to do
that oh it's not working
it says accept it to Paul method show
which cannot be invoked until variable
age is declared and that's the beauty it
is not giving you any error pre hand but
it says hey if you want to use so here
itself you can see that it says however
so the method is modified however it
cannot be invoked until variable age
declared that means if I declare the age
if I declare a variable called as age
now and if I assign the aged maybe let's
say or 28 and if I say enter now you can
see we got the age variable and now it
is also updated in this show now can I
call show yes you can call show right
the value is 28 so this is called this
is something called as future reference
or forward reference not future
reference forward reference so even if
you don't have something which our
method needs a method will be created so
that you can do the next thing later
right so that's that's the beauty about
J shell right we can do that with
methods as well again let me go back to
I will say I did this time I will say I
will say first of all I will sell least
I want to know where I have done the
edit so it is not this time it is 20 now
as you can see so I will say slash edit
20 and I want to make some changes so
from here I want to call a different
method and that method name is display
again we don't have this method yet so
it's still I will say display I want to
call a method called a display right and
I will say except I will say exit now
you can see again the same thing
happening here with the very the way we
have done with age variable we have not
created to display method yet so if I
try to call show without defining the
display method it will not work so this
is a forward reference so that you can
you can
create a method later so I can say
public void display and here you can say
whatever you want to do say system dot
out dot println and I will print
something I will print something with
this spelling mistake of course that
doesn't matter right I will say enter
and here we go okay something is missing
the semicolon is missing there okay so
what I will do is I will say again I
will say list can we change that is it
possible and no it is not getting
recorded so we have to do that once
again okay so let's say public bracket
so we have to put the semicolon here
because it doesn't work that way so I
were to give curly brackets and it
worked now if you call show okay so that
it worked
so it says hello world 20 and something
with that two wrong spelling that's fine
we're not here to correct the spelling
right but it's working right so that's
how you can use the least command so
remember that we have talked about we
have so we have different commands we
can use here let me just use that
command here so the first one we have
used is list okay the space is not so
space is not needed then in fact if we
give space it will give you error you
can use edit and you can mention the ID
which want which which thing you want to
edit so that's it from this video thank
you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
