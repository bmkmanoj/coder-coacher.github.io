ready from that is called learnings and
in this video we talk about XML
introduction so as we have seen in the
theory why we require XML so let me just
recap what we have done so when we talk
about XML so we use this terminology XML
basically stands for extensible so it is
extensible markup language okay so
that's the full form of Excel XML so
when I talk about XML why we require XML
word so let's say we want to send some
data from server to client so anyway you
have a website so let's say we have a
client machine here and then we have a
server machine okay so we have two
machines when you want to send data from
this server to client what we use so
basically we use HTML page right so what
you see on the browser you get is you
what you get is an HTML page so this
thing here clients answer the question
server server it turns our estimate page
so this HTML page will be passed by your
browser right so you can see some text
so example if I go to a website let's
say if I go to maybe a website like
Wikipedia so if I go to Wikipedia ok so
I'm getting this page so I am so I am
getting this page here and if I right
click and if I go to view source so does
the source code which I am getting from
the server to the client machine right
and then this is converted in the format
of a page so we have all these types
which get which gets converted into the
page right so oh so this is an HTML page
the other way of sending data is let us
say you don't want to show the whole
page because this HTML page will have
two things they layout comma data right
so we have two things in HTML the layout
how it should look like and the actual
data but let's I do not want to send the
layout I just want to send it data so we
can use something well as XML to send
that data so XML will be used to send
data from server
client okay so we can also send data
from client to server that's not the
issue so a server can send HTML or XML
in fact we now we have a new format
where you where we we used to send data
is Jason right Jason stands for JSP
object JavaScript object notation so
here we have multiple ways of is having
data right so XML is one of the way you
can send data from server to client so
does the one that's one use of XML so we
use XML to transfer data now the second
use of XML is to configure this server
the configure the software example in in
Java or if in any n for that matter if
if we talk about any language to
configure your to configure your server
to configure your framework we use XML
in fact in Android to design the page we
use XML in Spring Framework to specify
the object dependencies we use XML so
XML is used to configure the framework
and it also used to transfer data so it
is important to know about XML maybe
you're not the master of XML but you
should know the basics of XML so in this
video we'll talk about the basics so to
understand a basics let's create an XML
file so we'll go for go to others
and we'll search for XML file here we'll
click on next and we'll name this file
as let's say alien because this file
will maintain all the names of alien so
we'll say aliens dot XML so that is the
XML name here so any way you write XML
file this is the first thing you have to
write on the top we have question mark
XML which specifies that the file you
are working with is a is of XML this is
the version which is 1.0 version of XML
and the encoding format because this XML
will be passed by XML parser so we have
a concept of something called as XML XML
parser which converts your which
understand the XML format you have
written here ok now what next so when
will you work with XML parser we have to
mention to create the example let's say
I want to send a data or was that let's
say I want to send a data from server to
client ok so the data is let's say 3000
but what is this 3000 it may be points
it may be salary it may be some it can
be anything right it can be a rank so
this theta isn't gave me anything so if
we have to be very specific what this
thatõs actually means so we'll say this
3000 is points ok we can say may not be
points but this let's say this 3000
salary so we have sorry opened and
salary closed so just to mention what
type of data you are walking with we
specify tags right so this 3000 is a
salary but what our salary of whom then
we can mention this is a salary of an
alien so that's these so this alien
becomes a parent child to the child to
the parent not child is a parent so this
alien is a parent for a child salary so
this is an element alien element and
this is your salary element okay so now
salary is a part of aliens but how many
aliens we can have so we can have
multiple aliens right and every alien
will have a unique name so let's say
this is we'll specify one more tag here
as name and we'll say this is Naveen so
that's my name we can get one more alien
here with the same attribute so we can
say name equal to let's say Manoj and we
can specify the salary here as salary I
will say this is 5000 okay so we have
Naveen 3000 Manoj 5000 and you can see
we got an error nothing the thing is
whenever you work with XML we have to
follow some rules so if so there are
certain rules too for to follows in XML
so we have the first role as whenever
you work with XML so in in every XML
there should be one load
tag ok there should be specifically one
root tag second XML is
sensitive it is case sensitive and every
opening tag needs a closing tag okay so
these are the rules we have to follow
follow in XML okay so now so if I go
here and if I say so what are those we
are missing first is one load tag so we
don't have one root tag here so we have
aliens alien aliens we have two two tags
here but not a little type so we'll say
all this alien belongs to one aliens
so this aliens becomes your root tag now
okay we can also format this so we say
source format so you can see it looks in
a proper format now so that's the format
of XML so now you can see we have two
XML if I right-click and if I say
validate so there is no problem this is
a warning but no problem so it's okay so
we got the XML so that's how your XML
should look like so if I open this XML
with the external browser so let's say
if I open this with a passer so every
browser has an inbuilt parser will say
okay we'll say open with' oh not default
editor but open with others we will open
this with chrome why should it should
work with chrome oh there is no option
of chrome so it lets me open let me open
with Firefox Chrome is here cool chrome
if I open
okay so does the XML format we have so
we you know it detects which tag is
inside which tags so you can say inside
alien we have name so it it means it is
able to pass it example if I remove this
alien so we are we are breaking some
rules right and if i refresh now so you
can see it shows some other here it is
not able to render okay so that is why
we have to provide this aliens tag there
and if I refer so it is able to render
it now question arise how to so let's
say I want to specify some rules because
we have not specified any rule right
here what the difference between this
two elements may be this two elements
have the same same data so it's say if
you
this data is also Naveen so if I make it
Naveen here so we can have two person
with the same name right and
coincidentally if they have the same
salary so is it both are same no right
both are different so they say this is
not being ready and this is Naveen bun
cell so we have two different of inside
so just to differentiate between these
two we have to use an ID so we'll say
this is alien ID and we can specify this
alien ideas as for my for my ID I'm
mentioning it as a one that is alien one
and for this second ID which is now in
one cell we have alien - okay so we have
we have two aliens we have two different
ideas right so yep so now so we can have
this so we can have something unique so
this is called as attribute so this is
element and this thing here is an
attribute even this is an attribute okay
and every attribute needs a value and
this value should be in double quotes
example if I remove this double quotes
and if I so you can see we got we got an
error so that is one rule against you
can specify here that every value every
attribute value should be inside double
quotes so we can say every attribute
value should be inside a double coach or
not double quote maybe but you can also
have a single query when that will do so
it can maybe double quote or single
quotes so we can mention here single
quote even that will work okay
now let's say for every so for every xml
we have two things so whenever you work
with XML - to work with parser we have
to specify something but is grammar now
this grammar can be of two types the
first type of grammar it can be
structure grammar and it can be a
Content grammar so structure grammar
deals with the layout of the XML example
inside aliens we have alien inside alien
we have name
so that's your structure grammar the
second one is content grammar which
deals with the data example we have
Naveen here we have three thousand so
this is your data right so let me just
go back to novel and let us say this is
Manoj so
that's menage and let's specify jazz
5000 okay so we have this value a 1 and
a 2 so we have to first specify the
structure now how to configure this
structure that we'll see in the next
video because to format this structure
we have to use something called ET and
to format the content we have to use
schema so we'll be working with 3 videos
here so these in this first video we
have talked about the introduction in
the next video we'll talk about how to
configure DTD to create a structure and
then later we'll talk about schema so
that's it from this video if you have
any questions do comment and thanks so
