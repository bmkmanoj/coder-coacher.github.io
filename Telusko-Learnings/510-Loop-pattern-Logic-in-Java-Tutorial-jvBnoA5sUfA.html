part of the video tutorials now in this
part we'll see some demonstration of for
loop now to demonstrate for look let's
just print the let's just wind up
pattern in this way so we'll print a
pattern in this way ok so we need to
print 5 stars now bring this 5 stars
what we need is again we'll start with
for loop from start so we say for
syntaxes first you have to give
initialization variable so we'll say I
12:01 and then we require condition so
we'll start with 1 it will go till 5 and
then we will say I plus plus now in this
what I need to print is I need to say s
out and at a height up four at a time of
point I had to print only one star like
a simple right when I say one star and
now if I run this I am getting an output
as star star star but what I need is it
should be in horizontal weight not what
you can do it since we are writing here
print Ln it's printing in vertical or
vertical way right so I need to I need
to print in a same line so I will remove
that Ln print will print in the same
line so now if I run this now if I run
this you can see the output is it's in
the same line okay but what I need I had
to play I need to go out of the lobe and
to say Ln it's because if you can see
the output after the output and getting
this brain successfully line so I need a
line so Anglicization order quintal
entry it will print the blank line like
what I'm this so we have we are getting
the output and we are getting successful
simple right and let's just give a space
here so that
it should look with yeah so we have we
have five stars now my next task is to
print star in this way so it should be
star star star we remove this group
stuff we'll go with four stars now and I
need something in this way okay so I
need this 16 stars but in a box format
so what we can do is now as we know this
star this loop will print will print one
loop this will print only one loop so
what I need is if I if I copy this loop
if I copy this loop and if I print it
here again if I print it here if I paint
it here if I printed here not last time
so what we have is we have four four
lows we are doing the same thing so
after every photo what we can do is we
can say new line after every photo we
can see a new line after family for that
we can say a new line so what it will do
is first it will print that four stars
then it will print a new line then it
will print the four stars then it will
print the new line then it will print
the four stars new line four stars right
so if you say the output
and this is what we want is this is what
we want again a a neat force so we'll
say for for knife I done this so this is
what the expected output was right so we
wanted a box with four stars totally in
total it will be sixteen stars but if
you can cause you can see here we we are
writing the same code liquid deadly
right so it's once we have toys and we
have price and we are adding it for the
for time so what we can do is since you
are doing the same task repeatedly we
can enclose this thing in a for loop we
can close this thing in a for loop right
and this time will say J equal to 1 and
J less than equal to 4 because we are
doing the same task for four times and J
plus plus and will enclose this for loop
in this way right so so since we are
doing the same thing for x we can
enclose this this thing in a for loop
which will do the same task for four
times and now if you see the output we
are getting is the amount put right so
this is the use of nested for loops or
this concept
this concept is called as nested for
loop okay simple now we'll do some more
experiment we'll do
let me change something now this J and
this I are called as a loop variable so
normally whenever you go with this
nested loop it's better to keep your
outer loop as I and inner loop as J just
for the conventions or just for the ease
of use it will not make any changes it
will not do any harm but it's always
better to have this this way your outer
loop will be I and your inter internal
loop will be J now let's change the
pattern what pattern I need is I need
this pattern so it should be in this way
to those Pistons in this way it should
be in first row it should be one star
second row to start third rows booster
and for four stars for this what we can
do is see if we need four rules so
whenever you talk about number of those
this I this I variable acts like a
number of rows and J column works as a
number of columns so what we can do is
since we are using number of rows as for
this will not change but the number of
columns is changing depend upon row
right so the first row should have only
one column so what we can do is we say
one second row will have second column
we can say two third row we have third
column fourth row we have four columns
so instead of writing all this number we
can say I so I will represent a number
of column right so if you're low is
first will be getting the first one
column if row is 2 so I will be 2 right
so in this case J will go till 2 if your
eye is 3 J will
gödel three if your eye is for J will
bottle for so if I plan this again in
Jasper
simple right this is what we can't
demonstrate mode about for loop will
we'll see one more output will see one
more odd Furnari ensure this point will
printing star will bring this values 1 2
3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp; 1 2 2 3 4 now what
we can see here is these are printing
star we are printing numbers so for this
instead of printing start the instead of
painting star we can print now in every
row what changing is it's changing the
value J value of J is changing so what
we can do is if your I value is 1 it
will go into this loop your J value will
be 1 ok it will execute this loop till
your J values go till the value of I and
we again make it ask for first it
eventually will it pick it up or now if
I plan this loop when Phi if I go with
this loop the output will be it's 1 2 3
4 1 2 3 4 right
so my getting the same we are getting
the output what we expect okay if I
print value of I it will print those
number okay let's see if it will put in
those number so first row all 1 second
row all 2/3 or 3/4 row all four right
simple
now what if I wanna go for this pattern
let's change the pattern and we'll go in
this way
three four five not five it's one and
two and four one two three now in if you
want this format now lost lots of people
say we have to use different four notes
or this or that
but the concept is base input see what
we need is first we know we need one two
three four that means is dependent is
depend upon the value of J so if I pray
in J let's see the output if I print
value of J is getting giving me this
output but what I need is from second oh
it should be it should start with two
right so if I if I write here this maybe
if I plus J let me see what will be out
it if I blend this okay
so almost what we want see it should be
1 it should be 2 it should be 3 it
should be 4
it should we do it should be 3 right so
what do you if I do minus 1 if I print
it minus 1 C is getting right one two
three four two three four
but what we expect here is one if you
can see we have we want one so now
question arise how to get the value that
is one okay so for this demonstration
we'll use we'll use some variable gives
us K and we'll say K equal to I plus J
minus 1 okay and let me remove this if I
make sure waiting all this expression I
will print k because this value is
stored in K but before printing K value
what I can do is I can check if my K
values goes above 4 okay if it is above
for what I will print is I will print k
minus 4 if else part if else part is I
will pray in K it's almost same
just concentrate we have we are just
saving this value in K and they are
checking that value of K should not be
more than 4 so it is more than 4 it will
say K minus 4 so if we have K value is 5
so it will do K 5 minus 4 which will be
1 and by doing this the output becomes
greater than some mistake it is not
elements
okay so this is your right so this is
what we want so this is this is the fun
part with quad NURBS so if you have any
doubts please comment and do subscribe
