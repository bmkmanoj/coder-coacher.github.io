figure it out
so welcome back aliens I'm Devin Wendy
and let's continue the topic does
Facebook still uses PHP now why this why
this topic is so important is because
few days back I've made a video which is
which is the best programming language
in 2017 and then while in this in that
video I have talked about PHP and I said
it is not secure it is not stable it is
not scalable and then I got some
comments and they were concerned about
this because they love PHP and they
think if Facebook still uses PHP then
how can you say that Facebook is not
secure and that's why I'm making this
video and let's try to understand what
is the I mean what other technologies
Facebook actually uses does it only use
PHP and the answer is no Facebook is
currently not using PHP so what happened
is in year 2004 when Facebook was
created it was created with the help of
PHP so when Mark Zuckerberg created that
code which is Facebook
so they he used PHP and then after three
to four years when when they got lots of
people joining Facebook so currently if
we talk about the stats of Facebook we
got approximately 1.8 6 billion people
using Facebook every month it's a very
big number white is approximately one
third of the population then 1.2 3
billion people use Facebook every day I
mean just imagine how many people are
using Facebook and can you manage the
entire server using PHP the answer is no
right
the second problem is Facebook is not
just about posting date I know posting
your status about your break ups about
your patch ups about your laptop buying
a new laptop all those things Facebook
is also about messaging Facebook it's
also about ads now if you see on
Facebook you see lots of ass right on
the right-hand side or in the newsfeed
itself
what you get is the sedation's right and
those are ads you can see there is
something a sponsored in all the on
those post now this ads are not
normalized if you're thinking that
everyone see the same ad not exactly
those ads are personalized ads so if you
go to Amazon if you go to Google if you
search some data the same ad you'll be
seeing on Facebook example let's go to
Amazon and let's say you want to buy a
new phone and let's say
you want to buy a HTC phone and if you
search for HTC on Amazon when you next
time when you go to Facebook you can see
the same ad right so they know what you
want what you're looking for
coach analyze how they process all this
data is not just you right it is
approximately we have one point eight
six billion people using Facebook every
month how does it works how does this
process all this data with PHP and not
exactly so because the first problem is
how to manage all these people second
how to generate ads how to do messaging
things so Facebook is using lots of
different technologies to work with this
so let's call the first one so when so
when they felt you know PHP is not
enough because PHP is not stable not
secure not not scalable they created
their own language from PHP called as
hack so hack is a supervised but obvious
a super version of PHP so it has all the
features of PHP plus extra features when
I say plus extra I'm talking about
security so hacked language is is based
on PHP but it is secure which is
scalable and it is stable but you will
say but hack is PHP right not exactly so
it is PHP it's a flavor of PHP but it
works on a different VM so it works it
works on h h vm which is the virtual
machine from facebook right so the
facebook india is investing lots of
money in this hack and h sv m to to make
it work so if you feel that facebook is
stable it is because of hat
not because of PHP now you must be
wondering that Facebook is so fast right
is it because it is it fast because of
PHP and not exactly because Facebook is
fast you know you can see all those
pages they are so fast because Facebook
is using some technology called has big
pipe so it is what you say it's a
streaming of pages you know it makes
your web browsing experience much better
so they use something else big pipe for
that big pipe here it is for the which
for the web pages so they use hack for
the so anybody if anyone is send any
requests to facebook.com let's say if
you go to facebook.com and enter the
first request goes to hack sir or not
PHP ok it's just that at the end they
have PHP but just for you know
you are using peace before long if you
are using facebook from a long time
initially we used to see PHP so still
they have kept it as PHP but then they
are using hack which is the flavor of
PHP so they are using hack they are also
using big pipe for the data syncing or
for the for the page for the fast X of
the pages then you know when you talk
about this ads let's again go back to
the and concepts so when you talk about
this ads if you are seeing all those ads
your data okay so when you use phase
when you use Facebook so in fact I'm on
Facebook from last 6 years now I guess I
have joined in 2011 so from 6 years I'm
using Facebook and then from 6 years I
am posting lots of stuff right some
status was I'm sharing my videos I am
talking to lots of people if I go to my
old feeds you know if you if you see the
new messages and you post you can see it
very fast but the moment you search for
the oil you post try it once you know go
to Facebook and search for the post of
2013 when you search for 2013 post it
will take some time you can see it says
loading loading loading no that's not
your internet problem ok if you think
that because of that internet your
internet is slow no it's not because of
your internet what happens is Facebook
is using something called as data
warehouse so every time and I mean when
you book when you post a data and if you
don't use that data from a long time
what it does is it save your data into
data warehouse so Facebook have their
own data warehouse called as up it's
called as high H IV e ok so high is a
data warehouse of Facebook where they
stole all this old post so the moment
you you search for the 2013 post you
know we have timeline timeline now on
Facebook just go to 2013 time timeline
it will take some time so what Facebook
is doing it is fetching all your data
from hive not from the local database ok
and for that they are not using that not
use they're not you they're not even
using hat language for that they have
some other language to work with
Facebook has also some repetitive tasks
so to do that trippity to task they are
using Python ok so they are using Python
for the apt tasks they are using hive
for the old data they are using this
concept of they are using hat for giving
you these points they are also using
react dot J's for giving the giving you
data on the page
so it's not just PHP okay nobody you can
see in this entire framework we are
using PHP so we have hack we have
JavaScript we have Python we have hive
but then question arise how does high
works do we really say theta into hive
and not exactly we store data into
Hadoop framework so you can imagine now
as a client when you send a request that
request goes to hat hat says okay this
is a new data you can you can search
from the local database but hold out if
you have old data you have to go to hive
but hive is just a framework whether
whether it will give you data because I
work with SQL SQL but then the actual
data will be stored in Hadoop framework
and to work with Hadoop Facebook uses
Java so Java is used to fetch your old
data and I mean all not just your old
data but also for add process things so
Facebook knows about you if you think
Facebook don't don't don't know about
you Facebook knows everything what you
like who want to you I mean which friend
you want what pages you should like so
all this processing is done by Hadoop
framework so we have Hadoop then we have
hive then we have Python then we have we
have hat and then we have JavaScript
nowhere in this industry you can see PHP
because it is impious not it is not
flexible to make such a big website
using using PHP I mean when this started
Facebook it was a small website so PHP
was good but the moment you you are
expanding your thing PHP is not enough
and that's what I wanted to convey in
this video ok so don't don't don't don't
file comments on me just because I say
something about PHP I'm just talking
about the truth so if you want to go for
the small websites of course I would
recommend it to go for PHP but the
moment you think you have a career in in
big companies where you want to create
some big software's PHP is not the thing
you have to learn because that's the oh
that's the only thing I'm trying to say
that's it this is about the PHP a
facebook technology stack so let me just
repeat JavaScript hack Python then Java
then we have big data which is Hadoop
and then they also have Apache hive so
that's it from this video thank you so
much for watching and do subscribe for
