use this map method and reduce method so
map method takes the value and it finds
it Maps it with any operation you want
and then this radios what it will do is
it will read it will try to aggregate or
sum up all it will find it will try to
find only one answer so if you have a
stream of values from that stream of
values you can find one answer may be
our aggregation may be average maybe
addition maybe some other operation
right so this time what we have done is
we have added two elements but when you
add two elements instead of using
instead of adding by yourself you can
use a sum method of interface class this
integer class so integer class in Java
which is a wrapper class it has a method
of a sum so we can simply say it is
integer or we can say it is take two
values C comma E and for every value
apply a function which is integer dot
sum and we can pass C dot e C comma E so
it will take this two values it will
send into some and that this sum will
return your value so if we run this code
now you can see output is still 42 so
either using either writing C plus e you
can dress impolite integer at some C
comma E the sum is the in dual in build
method of integer class so if I go to
some you can see it's a starting method
which ones are integer value but hold on
which is better writing C plus E others
of course C plus E right which it looks
good but what if I say whenever you walk
with a method of a class you can either
you can also use something called as
method reference so he reckons we
execute we can simply define integer
colon colon sum so we can skip that two
variables so it will ultimately fetch
two values and it will apply a sum
operation
all right so we can say run you can say
it is 42 simple so this is how way to
use our pre-built methods with the help
of various method in stream API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
