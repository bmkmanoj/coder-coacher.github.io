development voice you might have heard
about REST API right it doesn't matter
which technology are working with maybe
you're working on Java asp.net maybe a
PHP Ruby you must have heard this term
Palace restful api so what exactly this
rest means right is it very different
from the web voice all oh is it very
magical things so we discuss about that
in this video and if you want to
implement that we have the entire C's on
that so let's let's get started welcome
back
aliens I'm the vendredi from Titusville
learnings and let's get started with
REST API so when I was when I was
loading Android for the first time so
now this example makes sense with
Android so what I was learning I wrote
for the first time you know I was
thinking about making some applications
because learning something is different
right you can learn syntax of Android
you can learn basic programs but then if
you want to be efficient in that you
should make at least one app now that
one app maybe you can mimic some other
app example you can mimic a calculator
you can mimic a Facebook app so I
thought about licks mimic apps so I
opened my mobile phone and I saw
different apps available in my mobile
phone so one was calculator
I thought everyone can do that let's do
something else I'm scrolled down
I thought about Facebook but that will
be a very big thing for me so I went for
something but less weather he put app
now if you ever open up whether he put
apps um it looks something like this
when you have a different region you can
select and you can you will get the
weather report of that the temperature
the humidity and all those things so I
thought about let's mimic this app but
then okay so if you talk about this app
you have lots of data right and this
data will be coming from hold on from
where you will get this data so you can
give static data right you can just
assign the data there and it will never
change example the temperature in Mumbai
is 28 degrees Celsius you can set it
that way the temperature in Delhi maybe
20 or 31 degrees Celsius you can set it
that way so I just powered Android but
then whether keep changes changing right
according to the time so let's say it is
6 p.m. now so again the time the weather
will change the climate or the
temperature will change if it is too
well known after the temperatures will
be different so how can you change this
data now of course right your mobile
phone doesn't have a cent
so even if you have a sensor you can
sense the current climate right if I'm
sitting in AC room so of course I will
get a current temperature I will not get
temperature outside of my house
odd I will not get the temptation of
Delhi so how can i how can I get all
these details so the idea is what you
have to do is if you want all those
reports what you have to do is all over
the Mumbai you have to put sensor so
just allow about the building just put
sensors or weather sensor about the
around the globe everywhere you have to
put sensor because whenever you don't
have a sense of course you will not have
a data so if you want data about Delhi
you have to put Delhi Delhi in Delhi you
have to put a sensor you have to go to
us you have to go to you new you have to
get the New York climate and you have to
put your sensors everywhere and that
will cost you billions of dollars of
course right you will not do that so
that means you need these data from
somewhere but question arise from there
so what happens is luckily we are so
fortunate that we already have some web
services available on the internet when
I say web services it simply means that
there is some servers or some cloud
somewhere in the world and what you are
doing you are trying to access that
cloud right
imagine how mobile phone here and that's
my app that's like not like actually my
abbot is already app in my iPhone and on
this side you have a server right now
this server will give you a data but
then question arise how can you generate
this data in which technology you will
use here so basically this is a normal
web server you can take any dynamic web
server not a static servers dynamic
servers where you can generate data so
this is a dynamic server and that's your
mobile phone so what you will do is you
will require a server now this server
belongs to some company maybe maybe
there are different differents different
providers of weather reports right so
what you can do is they these people who
has all these sensors or they have the
data they are ready to give you the data
right and what you have to do is you
just have to call them so there is a API
Sony's API now so API is something which
will connect you and that server right
so how do you know that how many
services that server provide and how a
server will know who are you right so if
you want to access that data we have to
use somewhere API somewhere
between but if you keep that API part
aside let's talk about server what do
you think how will you generate data now
on some Java boils I will take a Java
example here so you have to create a
servlet right that's how we do that's
how we generate data right so you have
to get a servlet applied will send you a
request and then this circuit will give
you the data but then question arise
what sublet returns now if you think of
a normal boy okay now if you're not
familiar with Java that's fine you can
imagine a PS PHP application you can
imagine a Ruby application on ASP
application all these applications that
return something normally that something
is web page
now when I say web page it will be a
HTML page now we do the question from a
browser so when let's if you have a
browser that makes sense right because
browser is a blank thing and you will
get the entire web page but hold out if
we talk about my application I already
have a design right I don't want design
I just want data so when I request with
the servlet now servlet should not
return HTML page because I don't want
HTML page right and even if I get HTML
page how will I pass it so what I will
ask is hey hey sublet I don't want a
dieter I mean I don't want a page I want
data some that will say okay you want
data I will give you data in maybe two
formats you will get data either the
JSON format all XML format now you might
be thinking why Jason why XML it's
because whenever you would return some
data data should have some structure
right
you cannot just randomly send any data
so when you send data it will be a
complex data you have to follow a
particular structure now if you follow
XML in XML we have this hierarchical
structure right so in XML we have this
hierarchical structure where you can
have a city as a country name inside the
country will be having city name inside
city you will be having different
different values right we have humidity
level we have temperatures will be
having all these values right so you can
fit an XML format but the problem is
there are lots of people they don't like
XML especially I don't like XML but
Jason is something you can even you can
actually work well because if you know
JavaScript in JavaScript we create
adding objects so those are basically
your JSON objects right so what we can
do is we can instead of using
XML we can also use Jason now again you
can use XML you can use Jason right so
your sublet returns you XML all just in
format and your job is done right you
are getting data but the only thing is
when we talk about this data we've
talked about this servlet it's it
creates lots of overhead right right we
have a server technology where you have
to create a post request I mean you have
T right do we do get do post a request
object sponsor object a bulky thing
right so to replace this we have a
simple solution and that simple solution
is using REST API in a technology maybe
Java PHP so this says if you want to
return some data what if you can simply
create an object of that on the server
side and just return the object itself
not object but the values of the object
right so you have a object you want to
send the state of an object why do you
don't want to send the object but a
state of an object imagine if I want to
send a weather report something like
this you have a city name then you have
a temperature then you have humidity
level so you will send all this data to
the client side right so if you can
create an object of this you can simply
send an object in JSON format or XML
format right so that will be converting
an object into a state right so that is
called as representational state you are
transferring this state right so you are
sending the state of an object that's
why I call it rest which is
representational state transfer so what
you are sending is not object but the
state of an object now that state of an
object can be sent using JSON or XML so
that's the first thing then what if so I
mean thinking about this web world right
what we do doesn't matter which website
you're working with technische with what
requirement you have we do one simple
thing we do code operations right we
create and we create the resource we
read the resource we update the resource
and we delete the resource now okay now
if you observed I said resource right
now why this source is because in this
world of technology we want something
from this server right so we the example
if I want to add two numbers whatever so
hit what you say hey so we'll just add
these two numbers for me 2 plus 2 it
will give me 4 so when you
and adequate so if you send a normal
HTTP request it looks something like
this right
we have HTTP colon double slash oqw
spectrum list let's say for my website
and then dot-com if you want to add two
numbers you will say add and then you
will give a question mark which will
give it will send the values so you will
say question mark and then two I mean
the query parameters right you have to
send question mark and then values
instead of that what you can send the
what if you can send the value something
like this okay you shall going for add
what will make more sense is you are
fetching some data example if you go to
my website we have this awesome feature
you can get your you can get questions
right so if I say I actually P I mean
the website name slash questions slash
Java now this will make more sense in
stop saying questions question mark
subject equal to Java right it looks
more like a resource so what you're
fetching is actually a resource right so
it's you're fetching shop in shop
thinking that or you have a server where
you are doing some processing in stop
thinking like that what you can think
about is you are fetching data as it is
as a client you don't even know what is
happening on the server what you know is
you are getting your resource back and
to get to do this to do that see our UD
which is create read update and delete
we can actually use rest
I mean HTTP methods right initially P we
have post method we have put method we
have what we have is we have get method
and we have delete right so using this
four methods of HTTP we can achieve our
code operation and that's how your REST
API works again before this we were also
having soap request which is which is so
soap web services but nowadays everyone
uses restful api is in fact all the
companies they are moving from soap to
rest but in question arise how can you
implement rest so we have two choice I
mean we have multiple choice our most
one of the famous implementation for the
rest is Jersey and the second one which
I love is spreading implementation of
Jersey a spinning implementation of
restful api so in this course will be
will be focusing on both will see some
examples on Jersey and most of the
examples will see on
dressed so I hope you like this video
you've got something about the list API
again we will talk about the complement
implementation in the subsequent videos
so if you liked this video that click on
the like button and what you are waiting
for also subscribe the channel so that's
it thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
