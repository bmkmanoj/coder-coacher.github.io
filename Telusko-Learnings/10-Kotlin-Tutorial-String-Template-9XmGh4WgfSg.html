this value so I want to replace this
number one and number two with the
actual values right so I don't want now
one num2 anymore I want four and seven
there now how can we do this in fact in
result also I want eleven so what we can
do is we can simply add a dollar symbol
there the moment you put dollar you can
see that the color has changed now there
is no more green it is it's black I know
I'm not good with colors anyway so you
can see the different colors right so
you can put dollar symbol just before
the variable name so inside the string
if you put a dollar symbol it will make
it will treat it as a variable right
what if you put dollar symbol before off
and of course it will give you some
error because we don't have any variable
colors off right so normal string will
be the normal normal format and the
moment you have some variables you can
put dollar symbol there and if we run
this code you can see we got the output
okay string taking some time and you can
see we got the output the addition of
four and seven is 11 it's that simple
so instead of going for can
concatenation if you if you remember in
Java we used to work with quantitation
operators right so ensure that we can
use a dollar symbol here now if you have
a normal variable then dollar symbol
makes sense directly right but what if
you are creating an object here let's
let's let's go just beyond just after
that let's create our object of alien
eyes remember we already have a class
here called as alien so I would say
where I will use my name Naveen : I'm an
alien right I would simply say equal Xu
and alien right so we got a agent object
here now we don't have the default
values for this service I'd specify some
name so we'll say Naveen dot name I will
assign a name here we'll just say okay I
will assign my name as Parris CO and
then I will I want to print this value
service not system cut out you know I
love Java so much I can write Java code
anywhere in Cortland as well so yeah so
I want to print this okay so I will say
the okay we'll say alien not aliens
alien name is : and if I want to print
my name's I would say Naveen dot name
now this will not work right this will
print Naveen dot name as it is now can
be you
dollar symbol here the moment use use
dollar symbol you can see the color of
naveen is black which means that this is
treated as a variable but what about
this one this name is treated as name
itself example if I run this code so you
can see we got the output or first of
all we got it is treating this Naveen as
an object and when you try to print the
object will print the hash code right
and then use spending name is ID as it
is I want to specify here this two are
together how can you do that so we have
to use a curly brackets so if you are
using or normal variables we can
directly go with a name we can go
directly with the dollar symbol but the
moment you have an object in which you
have some properties to mention both
together we have to use curly brackets
and also doing this if it on this code
you can see we got the output as alien
name is telescope that means you can use
this curly package to fetch the value of
the object values so that's how you can
work with strings when you want to print
a string and if you've anyone to print
the variable as well you can use this
dollar symbol so you can use dollar here
and we can use dollar and cut the
package when it comes to objects so
that's it from this video in the next
video we'll try to we'll try to work
with if-else condition so that's it
