as you can see foresman is a tool here
which is a app of google chrome again
for firefox also we do have this type of
tools so I'm using postman here Watch
for Chrome now you might be thinking
what's the advantage of this so what I
will do is I will just copy this link
and let me just post
I mean paste that in postman and as you
can see if I say okay where is that oh
they already got the fist I've copied
the wrong link or what are going to say
copy and let's say this part and paste
as you can see I'm copying the list in a
moment I say click on send you got your
response right so the same response
which you got on the client on the
browser you got the same response here
now you might be thinking what's new in
this we can do that on browser as well
right why you have to install a separate
app it's because if you expand this list
you can see we can send multiple
requests we can send a get request we
can send a post request we can send put
requests patch delayed copy so we can
use all these options of HTTP which is
not possible in browser in browser we
normally use get and post only right
otherwise if you want to use extra top
features like put and delete which we
are going to in this course of course we
need some client right again we can
create our own client if you if you want
to explore that we can create our own
Java client but then we don't want to do
that as of now we are focusing on
inbuilt tool so we got a postman where
you can send the request if you want to
send a post request so simply click on
post and say send you don't even change
you don't have to touch to your URL if
you want to do that you can but then not
required so you can you can fetch data
in JSON format you can fetch data in XML
format the way you want right but then
how do we how do you find this tool and
way to Doc's on background or does so
download this what if does you have to
go to chrome and you have to open a new
window and whatever you do here is in
this chrome you can see when you open a
new tab there is an option of apps so if
you click on this apps and okay so I'm
dad if you don't find postman here you
have to create a new you have to click
on this web resource
and in this web resource you have to
search for which app you want again if
you simply search for a rest client
there are multiple apps available as you
can see if I search for this I don't
know how many are many options we'll be
getting now you can see we have lots of
rest client available we have just yet
another rich client ok we can you can
try this all these things which is
available but then we'll be using
postman's I will say search for postman
search for this and okay so this is
default or not this one this one so this
is the app so we don't have to focus on
exchange in react focus on apps
so in this apps this is the postman this
is how it looks like so I have already
added into the Chrome so you have to
click on this add to Chrome where you
will get the option and you have to
click on that and you can see how many
reviews we have for this its 8286
reviews it is a very very very famous a
client is not just which I prefer the
lots of people they do prefer this type
of this client here so if I click on
this there lots of descriptions
available you can read it out if you
want and you can also read it on certain
conditions if you want but then once you
install this your postman will be up and
running I guess you have to restart your
you have to restart your browser if you
after installing this it will it to
notify that but then after doing that
when you open you when you open your
postman is how it looks like and how to
use this so you will understand how to
use this in the entire course but then
if you just to go to go for a quick
glimpse you have to click on this get
request paste your URL here and click on
send it will send a get request if you
want to send a post request just click
on this post and then when you click on
this send you will it will send a post
request but then when you send a post
request you have to also send the detail
right how do you send a data here to the
server and that's an idea we ask we have
to specify the body now inside this body
you can enter your key value pair
whatever you want to send all you can
type your own XML or you can you can you
can type it XML or JSON format you can
if you want if you are sending XML click
on XML and type XML if you are sending
Jason type Jason and you can cite it so
this is how we can use postman and so it
once we understood how to use postman
how to install postman the next video
we'll see how do we send that data
to the server so that this this method
will be called okay so that's it on this
video guys I hope you understood about
the postman and we'll talk about this
thing in the next video that's it thank
you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
