Jamis now now we'll create a project so
that we can do some tasks here so go to
your project window and right click and
click on new project so this time we
have to go for Java EE it's because when
you only work want to work with
enterprise application or Egypt you need
to select Java EE we'll say next and
we'll provide a name we'll say this is
demo message or demo m DB which is
message and DB which is message even
been well click on next so the only
option we have here is GlassFish is
because otherwise you can go with JBoss
or you can go with there are lots of
application servers so one of the best
or not you cannot say best right one of
the so which I use is GlassFish you can
either use JBoss it's your choice and
then simply click on finish
so if you click on finish it will give
you it will create three project so
instead of creating only one it will
create three of them came here
let's wait first one seconds okay so you
can see we are getting three projects
here one is your m DB which is your
actual project then when we is your
h-e-b so all your bits will be here and
this is your VAD so this will act like a
web line or a client but like you can
say a app client which will access this
EJB so let's create our message driven
bean so I click on your EJB you can see
by default we don't have any beans here
so I click on your ajb and say new
select masses g1 bean so once you click
on message do you want bean it will ask
you for a name and will say this is my
bean okay and we'll put out create a
package colors comm dot Naveen and then
we'll be having there so one important
things choosier is
you have to select this server
destination and so what destination is
this one so enough rated this one last
time so in this example I will go for
GMS demo slash Naveen test which is my
destination click on next it will ask
you for some configuration so initially
since we are in starting phase will not
select anything here I will keep it in
the same way will click on finish now I
can see we are getting a beam here which
is my beam and in this my beam this is
not our normal being here this beam
implements messagelistener so I hope you
remember we talked about a theory in
which we have seen we have two types we
have synchronous and earth synchronous
and asynchronous we need to use a
message listener so this message
listener has a method called as on
message which accepts a parameter which
is message now what we will do is so
this my beam will be a listener which
will continuously wait for a message in
the queue so once you got the message in
a queue it will print I should I need to
print that message so this is a beam
which will wait for the message in the
queue once a message receives in the
queue it will fetch so somebody need to
put that message there how to how to
send a message into queue that we see
later but let's say you got a message in
the queue so when to print it now so how
to paint so first thing is let's create
a message called as text message and
we'll name this as let's say MSG message
now this message will come from this
message object which is message okay the
problem is a way to Costas is because we
have two different types so we can go
straight to import a package let's
import the package you can see the
package is belongs to Java MGM s package
and then we'll cost it so cost it with
text message
now once the casting is done what we can
do is we can simply print msg taught by
default this is not checked me to fetch
the content so we can simply say get
text so get text will give you this
string type okay and there might be some
other here so we'll apply a try/catch
since it's a round block sunblock with
trycatch and i guess that's it
okay so fainting normally what we'll do
is we'll ask our name from a user and
once I use a until his name or her name
what we'll do is we'll give this a
location which is mr. Thomas I am
assuming that the user will be mr. for
time being you can also check for gender
you can do all those things what I need
is if I know my name knowing it should
bring me to a novel simple this is what
I want to do here that's it nothing else
okay
so let's see what next so once you've
got the message you can just print it
with this so things to remember to
create a EJB or message even beam you
have to right click on your project or I
click on your window select Java EE
project and then give a project name
provide your stage and then you will get
this three files you have to create a
message even beam in which you have to
say you have to implement a message
listener so you can see we also have set
the properties here
what is destination lookup you have to
use this jndi so this is a gif format
which is Java naming and IT services and
the type of distinction I'm using here
is Q so if you are using a topic it will
be topic Java X start JMS dot topic
since we are using Q it will be Q here
simple so once we have done with this
gem or this bean now what we need to
create is we need to create a servlet we
need to create a client page so the
client page will send a data to a
servlet servlet will send that data to
JMS and this file here will face that
data now how to achieve those things
that we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
