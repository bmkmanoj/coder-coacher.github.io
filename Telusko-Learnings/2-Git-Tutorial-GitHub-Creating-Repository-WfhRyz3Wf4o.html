account this is what you will see not
the exact stuff example and you can see
we have two popular repositories now if
your account is new you will not get the
option now I'm using this account from a
forum some time so I got this to
repositories here we separated and if
you can see there is a green symbol
there that is my activeness on github
how many how many contributions I have
done and you can see some fancy stuff
here let's not let's not go there now if
you want to work with github yo the
first thing you need is a deposit free
now of course you will not have any
deposits place by default so you have to
pay down your repository if you can
imagine it positive we have a place
where you can put your project so let's
get a repository here and just here you
will say ok test now I will name my
repository as stubs because I love this
board dusk and okay he's going to add
your optional description they're not
required in this case
now which option to choose public or
private of course we will go for public
because to go for private repositories
you have to you have to go for a page
plan example if I click on private you
can pick is asking for your critical
information I don't want to share that
let's go for public and initialize the
suppository with readme that means we
will get a readme file here now in this
witness file you can enter some data
about your project about the commits
which you are doing all those stuff and
okay we talked about this later in some
time so let's click on this create
depository and you will get your
repository called as stuff here okay so
guys we got your repository task and we
also have one one file here which is
weight me dot MD now this is a special
special extension which is get dot MD
which which stands for mouth down we
talked about mouth down of in one of the
video so as you can see we have some
awesome thing here now if you are new to
github you will not I mean you will get
confused with all these options
trust me when I started working on Gator
my god will always to get confused
between these tabs so once this gets on
experience you will get to know what
each tab means
okay so if you see we have a code tab
here in which you it will show you your
code the number of comments
now what if this comments behalf waited
as files number readme file that is one
commit we talked about that will talk
about branch later we'll talk about
contributors later what I want to do now
is I want to create a new file now every
time you change something on a
repository you are doing some comments
let's create a new file so when you when
you click on new files now personalize
what new file I will create now of
course we are programmers right so we
will be creating a file depend upon
which language you like example you can
write a Java file you can write a cs5 is
official files you can write a PHP files
you can create a C file doesn't matter
get supports all the files now kosher I
switch which language I will be using
now I don't want to confuse you so if
you do if you don't if you're not
comfortable the job I don't want to show
your Java code as of now right we'll do
that later time being let's say if
you're working with a normal file and
normal file create here is called as
recipes dot txt now the CP is widest it
is because we have one more channel is
vegetarian schoo kitchen where we will
normally create lots of recipes so let's
create a listing a file here so here I
will maintain all the recipes which we
are which we have already done and we
are going to do in future so I will say
welcome to the new school kitchen it so
much so we got welcome to things for
kitchen and let's go down and here will
mention what we are doing so we are
simply grating or five years versatility
h3 in this I have added a text again you
can add some restrictive zero I will
enter my first recipe as okay what
recipe I will create maybe okay so I
will say this is keys okay so this is
key okay I will say next one is pasta so
I got to I got this two recipes here and
let's say what the cities file created
so that's my first commit and you can
see that we have one more option which
is create a new branch we'll talk about
that in some time
let's click on commit new file I know
I'm talking about lots of saying which
we'll talk later
trust me it will make more sense once we
talk talk about those things later if I
open the mind so we can change that we
got our cities dot txt here if I open
that file we can have something called
as welcome to the result kitchen and
Kira and pasta like if you've got your
file imagine you're working on a project
and when your project is your current
state you are uh providing this services
now maybe in future you want to update
some data of course that's what we do
right when you build a project you don't
build the entire project in one day it
takes time so it takes it takes time
right so initially you will write
something then after some days you will
write something after some time you will
buy something and after doing all those
things you will get the entire big
project now after every work what you
will do is you will say commit write so
that you're saving your data that's what
we did here now if I open recipes once
again this is my current files right now
what if I change something so I will
edit here and I will say ok I want to
add some new dishes so I will say this
is chicken fry so I will add a new
tissue in sequence right here and once
you have added this again I will do the
same thing I would say she can add it
and this down I will come it on the same
branch and done so I'm coming the
changes here my job is done you can see
the got three recipes here now the thing
is what happens you know ok we will just
let me go one more thing because we
forgot to do one thing at the end there
should be a thank you like so I would
say thank you
ok and I will say regards comment now
there should be a good message enough
anyway you commit there should be a good
message which should make sense right
don't just say the way I am doing now so
you can see we got this data here now
after some time you felt you know this
is this two things we don't need
actually maybe our we was doing do don't
like knowledge so maybe we can remove
this part now how do I remit this remove
this part so what we have to do is
we have to again click on edit and then
we have to remove remove thank you we
have to remove this kitchen fly right
but not kitchen flights you can play
like we have to remove that stuff or
what we can't do is we can just go back
to the initial state now what I'm saying
is if you can click on code you can see
this option of permits it's not full
commit and if you click here it will
maintain all the versions now this was
your first version when you created this
file
it was adding only read me and in that
read me you had nothing right then out
of some time you have committed one more
one more thing which is okay let's just
go to focus and here we have these got
recipes file period this is your comment
if I click here you can see we have
added this for this three things we have
added welcome to the disco kitchen we
have added this plus and then I am
anticipating the enter and then key and
pasta this plus means we have added
those files right and you can see this
green means they have added those files
you can say six addition and zero
deletion so six is I mean six addition
this is what you have added in your file
okay so we want this this stage now now
how do you go back to this particular
state and you caught this straight right
so if I click on view this is your state
so you can so when you're working on a
project and after let's say you've got a
project and after some time you have
added some features and those features
are giving some issues now you want to
go back what you can do is you can just
search for the version which we have
done and you can go back there this is
the awesomeness about any gate to gate
management system you can use a big
bucket everywhere you've got the same
procedure because this provided by kit
it maintains all your versions right so
this is awesome thing so why so this is
how you can use github so we have talked
about very simple stuff we have catered
to the file utilities txt we have added
some content and we have we said we can
go back to the previous commits and
that's the thing you can do in the next
video we'll talk about some most of how
we can create a branch and why do we
need a fine way to create a branch
so that's wrong this video guys thank
you so much for watching and do like if
you liked this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
