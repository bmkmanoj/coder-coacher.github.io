this will be in this video we'll talk
about packages so what exactly packages
are so let's say we have we have six or
seven classes here so we have we have
acc controller we have account Dow we
have a current service we have call
controller we have tau which is called
out and we have called service so let's
say you're making a very big project you
know we are working one way something
very big now in this case when you when
you are making a big application you'll
be working with multiple classes of
course right so in this example I have
taken only six classes so let's say
you're working with maybe around 70 to
80 classes in this scenario if you have
all the classes in the same package it
will be difficult to manage now to make
it more manageable if you want to make
it more structured what we can do is we
can create certain packages or the
folders in which we'll be having all
these classes example if we talk about
this class which is ACC Dao and this
called AO both are down layer classes
again what is doubt it doesn't matter
but both this classes will deal with
databases so you want this classes
should be in one one pack one folder
example when you list when you have
let's say when you want to listen to
music and when you have lots of songs in
your computer you will be having
multiple folders right so let's say four
new songs will be having one folder for
old songs will be having one fold-up
word for rock songs will be having
different folder in the same way for
different different classes we have
different different folders so now how
to put this all into packages what you
can simply do is you can create multiple
package again doesn't matter which IDE
you work with maybe eclipse or NetBeans
you will be getting option of new and we
can mention Java package or will name
this package as let's say Dao package
now this package Dao which is here you
can see this package will have two
classes one is ASIS it au and call now
so you can select both using ctrl and
click just drag it to this package and
you are now your shifting you have to
just refactor it now you are shifting
this two classes into this package
sounds great right
let's say we have one more thing let's
say we have we want to create one more
package so we'll say like new and this
package will be will be for controllers
so you have this two classes here which
is ACC controller and call controller
not as that doesn't matter what those
classes do but by name they are doing
the same task right they are doing
similar tasks so account controller
works with accounts all controller works
with call right something they will
bring some tasks and then we require one
more package which will be lets say
service and we can send these two
classes in this service package so you
can see we are providing a structured
way of all structure of all the packages
so you can we can have a folder which is
back example in that folder we have back
example or controller and then
controller we have this two classes so
we have this structured way so let's say
now if you want to use a particular
class let's say I want to create object
of accounts Dao so I can say account Dao
ok and then we can say obj equal to new
account Dao right we can create the
object but you can see we are getting
error it simply says we are not able to
find where is that class so we need to
import the package how to import the
package we can simply say what we can
simply say input back example dot dot
dot account down so we are importing
this way and how that class is created
so we can see a countdown and at the top
we are rewriting package package example
back example dot tau so we got a folder
which is pack example in that folder we
have Dao folder in the Darr folder we
have account Dow as a class or a file
sounds perfect another this one when my
advantage of creating this classes or
training packages so let's say we have
one more package or let's say we have
one more class let me get a class here
and the class name of course then
coincidentally the class name is also a
city controller but this is a controller
is not account controller this is your
access controller so we have to file
with the same name and you can see we
are getting others right we cannot
create two files with the same name if
they are into same package what we can
do is we can say this is for axis this
is for permission so we can say this
axis package and you can create the same
class name provided they belong to such
different package sounds great right so
what will those we'll see how this
structure is created in a folder now
this is how this is of folder here so
which is which we have created as a
package here so this is your folder
which is pack example in this pack
example we have two things we have in
fact we have four folders one is x one
is controller second is Dao and then we
have service as we have defined here and
when I go to Dao we have two files here
and as the advantage of reading packages
you can you can you can separate or you
can you know create the classification
of all your classes so it will be
helpful for your project it will be
helpful to maintain your project so
that's it that's how you create packages
that's all your input packages and
that's it from the video so thanks for
