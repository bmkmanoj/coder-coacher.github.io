a frequently asked question from lots of
students in fact on my youtube channel
if you search for some comments you will
find this question for sure how to get a
job and it is a valid question right in
fact when I was doing my degree even I
was not sure how to get a job luckily I
got a job but then there are lots of
people they are unfortunate that they
don't they don't get job now even if
there are people who get a job they feel
you know they are they don't belong to
bear what they are doing they want to do
something else so in this video I will
try to answer all those questions how to
get a job how to be employable and what
you can do so that you will get a job ok
so that the judge knee or the path now
you know when I go but as a part so I am
a part patron advice so when I go to
different companies for training I can
see people I mean I can see companies
who hire people you know every company
they have a different strategy to hire
people in fact I have been to different
companies for training and I have
observed that their way of hiring people
is very different from the other
companies and so that'sthat's the
corporate perspective the second
perspective is the advantage what I have
is I am also a Polish I used to go to
colleges as a guest lecturer before I
don't get time now but then nearly
earlier I used to go there and I've seen
how college works how student learn how
teachers other teachers teach so I have
observed everything that I have observe
ever in the corporate world I can
actually relate what is happening in the
college life and in the in the corporate
life so what I so my my aim is to make
sure that everyone is at least
employable or at least they need to get
a job right and of course everyone we're
going to drop down the thing is will you
get a job which you want now how do you
get a job there are two ways of getting
a good job now first of all when you
when you talk about companies they want
people who are good at programming or
who are good at technology now not
programming exactly they are different
views right we have testing fields we
have a tech support field so they want
people who are good with analytical
skills who are good with problem-solving
skills in fact I have made a video on
that right so if you if you can check
when I have a video which is 5/2
required to be to get into IT world so I
have that video so they will check for
all those skills now the thing is if we
talk about your college-y
we'll give you only 40% of knowledge max
- max they will give you 40% of
knowledge and this company people they
want experts okay okay now you must have
seen this right as a pleasure they want
special but they also want experience
and that's a very very big confusion
right company always wants experienced
people you could go to jobs if
significant ok.com if you go to any job
portal they will ask you for experience
people they will say here you have a
vacancy for Java developer you need at
least three to four years of experience
and that's all starts you know you don't
have experience of course your
refreshers right so if you don't get a
job how will you get the experience and
if you don't have okay I mean if you
want the experience you want a job first
right company want people who can work
on a project but unfortunately when you
go to college you go to college so that
you will learn and you will get a job
the problem is company want people who
knows at least 80% of the things which
they want to work on again company is
way to train you but they can claim you
only when you know something right
example it is my job to train people on
Java it is my job to train people on
different technologies maybe a different
framework in Java provided you know C
and C++ so what in you you know
programming we don't teach ok when you
join a company we will not teach you
Java if you donate any programming
language right it will be like you have
to learn Java in seven days you will die
you will suffer right I need to have
those basics now if you're thinking
College will give you everything
that's not possible it doesn't matter
which field you're talking about maybe
you're talking about medical field if
you're talking about log fields may be
talking about IT field everywhere
when you when you go to your college and
even if you are topper you get our
knowledge of Anzhi or 40% right so if we
talk about that 40 percent thing if you
if you only know if you only learn 40
percent how will get a job then you have
to also cover so I can assure you to be
at 80 percent right so you have to learn
that 20 percent by yourself now there
are two ways of doing that the first one
is as a freelancer working a freelancer
because see so if you're joining if
you're joining a web or if you're
joining RIT boys and of course you have
to work on projects wide it doesn't
matter which version you're talking
about you have to work on a project you
need to get a real time experience
because if you don't know how to build a
project or how to support a project how
can you go to a company and work on a
project right so first of all you need
that real time experience so for that
you have
- you can go for financing projects
again financing project you can also
earn but then I think the other thing
should not be the main moto here the
main motor should be you want to work on
a project you have do you want to learn
different things because I believe in
this in this what you say a line which
is which says initially you have to work
to learn and later you can remove that
else which is fun right so in addition
you should only focus on learning now
question arise how will you get
financing projects because first of all
you have to understand what you want to
build if you want to build something
build that otherwise talk to your
friends talk to your parents if they
want to build something bill - oh you
can go to NGO of different NGOs Church
medical I mean all these places and ask
them do you want to project if no it's
nobody you are getting the project the
best way is so just go to Google and
search for freelancing okay let's go to
freelancer calm now this is a place
where you can where you can get deposit
you can see that we have website and I T
so depend upon what skills you have if
you are no C++ if you know Java
beforehand or you can opt HP just search
for the project here right example if
you let's say if you know Drupal so just
go to Drupal and based on Drupal there
will be some project you have to work on
ok so they're different project of a
label you can just go here and you will
get to you will get the requirements
that you can apply for this again you
have to bid for this again you will not
get a job are you not getting you will
not get the project as soon as possible
you it will take it will take some time
like you have to you have to improve
your programming skills you have to
improve your portfolio for that that's
one day okay so this is one of the
website the another website is up work
which you can go to up from calm and
here you will get lots of skill let's
say if you want to go for web
development project just go here and you
can be build up a web project there
right so there are multiple websites
where you can be a freelancer and these
are top fill answers available in this
field you can see we have they're not so
people there okay so this is two
websites freelancer nap work which which
I know there are other sites as well
okay so this the first way is to work as
a freelancer
at least when you are doing your
graduation the second way is to do
internship I mean this is what this is
the most important thing okay
better than freelancing I would say make
sure that while you're doing your
graduation all you are twilit while
you're doing your degree you have to get
the internship and now if you have seen
if you have heard the new that it so if
you don't have an intention there is no
degree at least in India now so if you
want to if you want to computer
engineering you have to make sure that
you get a little internship awesome
right now two advantages the first one
is while making this compulsory it will
help students because they will work on
real projects the second advantage is
company will get people a fresh
challenge you know company always look
for fresh talent and for sure now
company will get good talents right so
this is the news which came into today's
bag or la came on 26 July to this 28 so
three internship two mandatory for
engineering students okay this is
minimum okay you can go for five
internship you can go for ten internship
if you have time of course for every
student there will be three three
internships in their 40 years of degree
now of course after first year you
cannot be getting two internship I'm
talking about the pequeno so when you go
to a second year you have to make sure
that you get you get internship time now
again your college will help you now
because it is compulsory for your
college to help you with the internship
let's take apart is not able to provide
you with the good internship opportunity
what you will do now so what you have to
do is you have to assert the internship
by yourself now you will say okay from
where you will get it now first of all
try with contacting your senior you know
that's the best way
talk to your seniors check where they
are working now and ask them do we have
any internship available there that's
the best way the second way is if you're
not able to find that then go to a
website which is called as admission
India are not about I'm not sure about
the US scenario but if you even need to
search for internship for programmers or
maybe any any internship which you want
there should be different websites here
we have LinkedIn ok forward linkage we
have Linda July then we have lodged or
organ in specific to India I guess
there is one more website which in turn
shala is on the website where you can
get the internship specifically for
indian you can search for your country
which whichever into whichever website
you there is available inside a last two
years
whenever I get when I got sometimes on
something from the training I made sure
that I will hire some interns and I will
I will make them to work on a project so
I did the last last year I did this this
year I mean I did I did last year and
this year as well
maybe next time in next year as well I
will try to do that so this is how you
will get a job so once you do a
financing project once you do that
internship you will make sure that you
are completing forty percent from your
college and forty percent while doing
this thing and for sure once you do this
you will get a job your dream job okay
trust me I have seen lots of talented
people they have that the same thing
they got a job in a good company but
they were not just sitting there in your
college and then saying hey I got 80 out
of 80 out in Java that's not how it work
it doesn't matter how much you school
what matters is are you building are the
all time projects right that's important
so so think about it that's how you get
a job so do financing and do internship
while you are doing your degree and
