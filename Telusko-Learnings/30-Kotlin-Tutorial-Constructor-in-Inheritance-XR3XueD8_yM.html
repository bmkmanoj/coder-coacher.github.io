inheritance in Cortland it's time to see
how constructor behaves in inheritance
now if you remember in case of Java of
anybody create object of subclass it
also called a construct of superclass if
you remember now let's see what happens
here so first of all I'm using a primary
consider anyway right so we have a
primary consider here and so let me just
define that constructor will say let me
just define a primary character here and
we'll also use a unique method where
where I can define that okay so this is
the so this is when you say in it it
means it is the primary constructor
block right so what do we do here is I
will say println
and in this printing I will print in
human right and then in here as well so
I will say agent also has a primary
constructor which has a init method and
okay what's the that is extra now and
here as well I will be printing print Ln
and I will be printing in alien now
what happens you know when you call this
code I mean okay let's let's not paint a
thing here let's ignore think if I
create object of alien what it should
call non logically when you say when you
create object of a class it will call
the constructor of that glass first
right so it should print in alien so
that's what we are expecting here but if
you are coming from Java background you
know that it also calls a constructor of
superclass not the concept there is
using the super method every constructor
is in in Java has a super method in that
if you don't know about that I do have a
video on super keyword in my youtube
channel which is which I mean job list
you can just search that but if you know
that concept is very simple it will call
the superclass consider with the help of
super method or super keyword now here
if I run this code logical it should
print in aliens why do we have a super
concept here let's run this code let's
see what happened you found this code
you can see we are getting in human and
in alien both notice the same output
you'll be reading in Java
of course right I mean when you convert
your when you compile your code in file
it gets converted in
a Java into a bytecode so it will be
here like Java code right but what is
happening here is it working with super
keyword here not exactly I mean do we do
have super mega super keyword in
Cortland but then what is happening here
is when you call when you create object
of alien it first it first calls the
constructor of alien itself but then it
says okay when you call the consists of
alien first you should be calling a
constructor of human that's what you are
doing here right you are saying human
and you're giving a round bracket which
means you will be calling a primary
consider of superclass here right and
then it will first it will print in
human once the execution is over here
then it will continue with its own
execution and that's why it is planting
in human and in alien now what if you
have a parameter here let's say if you
have age colon int now your human memory
class I mean your your superclass
constructor are in the primary consider
it takes a parameter and you can see we
are getting error here now your
superclass consists of takes a parameter
so of course you have to pass a
parameter here okay we can pass any
parameter we can pass 20 your job is
done now what will happen is whatever
value when you call the constructor here
when you by passing a I mean alien it
will call this concept of first and this
human will get that value of age we can
also paint the age value here we can say
in I mean you can print age and that
that's fine let's run this code let's
see what happens now it should work and
you can see it is pending in human 20
and in alien and that's how it works
okay now what if you have this default
character here and now you want to you
want to accept this values from here
let's see if I pass the age from here
itself now of course we don't have any
concept of it takes it takes a it takes
20 right so what can be done here is we
have to accept that value we have to say
int I mean age paint and then we have to
pass that age here so what we are doing
is whenever value whenever you're pass a
value 20 it goes to your parameter sort
of alien and then it sends the primary
consider of human right and that's why
we can achieve super method in Courtland
again when you convert this into Java
code that's what we get right but then
here this is how you pass you
pass the parameter here that goes into
human construct and that's that's how it
is assigned let's run this code just to
verify and I'm expecting the same output
now and yes we got inhuman twenty and an
alien so that's how you can use
constructors and in inheritance so
remember this part whenever you create
object of subclass it caused the
construct of superclass as well so yeah
that's it that's it from this video and
in the next video we'll see something
more about oops concept in coddling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
