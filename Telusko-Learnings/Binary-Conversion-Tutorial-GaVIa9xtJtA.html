interactive from Toys for learnings and
in this video we talk about binary
conversions now why why do we need money
conversion so first of all when I talk
about computer it and it's not only one
language right which is body language so
either 1 or 0 so you cannot communicate
with a computer using using normal
numbers using using English you have to
use binary numbers right when I'm 0 so
even if you want to say 5 to a computer
now company will not understand 5 right
so you have to convert that number 5
into a binary format which is the answer
is 1 0 1 right but kahshanna is how do
we find I mean let's say if I give you
any number how will you convert that
number into body format so it's very
simple actually what you have to do is
well let's say we have a number here so
let's take maybe 9 so let's take this
number 9 okay so let's find the Bionic
language of 9 so the steps are vey
simple
whatever you do is you have to create I
mean you have to divide this number 9 by
2 okay so we have to say 2 into 2 ok now
not 22 but 2 into 4 will give you 8
write the remainder is 1 then 2 into 2
will be getting for the remainder is 0
then 2 1 2 into 1 is 2 and the remainder
is 0 and then we have 2 into 0 will get
will give you C will give you 0 the
Dementor is 1 right and you have to go
upwards so the output so the money
conversion is 1 so it is 1 0 0 1 does
the output Y oh god ok so yeah so you
have to divide the number by 2 and the
remainder will be coming on the right
side and you have to go upwards and you
have to read it upwards so it just 1
double 0 1 right so that's the
biological ways of knowing let's take
another number let's say we don't have 9
let's say we have let's say 11 so the
next number is let's say 11 we have so
we have so we have to divide that number
11 by 2 okay so we have to say 2 into 5
give you ten so remainder is 1/2 into a
holder that's what what is that so 2
into 2 will give you 4 remainder is 1 2
into 1 will give you 2 then when 2 is 0
2 into 0 will give you 0 the mean is 1
and you have to leave upwards out so the
answer is 1 so here's 1 0 1 1 that's the
output you part ok so you've got 1 0 1 1
so that's how you do that's how you find
a number from decimal system the money
system so when you say decimal system so
basically when I talk about normal
numbers we always work with decimal
system right example when you say 58 so
this is a decimal system so we have a
base of 10 in binary system we have we
have to use a number okay we have to use
a number whose base it will be 2 and to
find that number we have to use we have
to use this technique which we have done
here okay we divide that number by 2 and
you have to find all the windows and you
have to read upwards ok and you can try
it by yourself also I will give you some
numbers to practice and let me know the
answers in the comment section so let's
say number is again we'll go for 58
first so that's your first number then
12 then 16 and then 25 and then 31 so
find the Bionic bunny conversion of this
number okay so we have to convert a
number from decimal to binary we have to
use this we have to use this format here
okay now let's say once we got the
number which is in which is in binary
format I want the decimal format of it
okay so what we'll do is let's take one
other one more example where we'll
convert a particular number from from
binary to decimal and we'll go from so
if I'm decimal to binary and then we'll
go for it from binary to decimal okay so
let's take a number which is okay which
number 24 so let's go for 24 it will be
very easier right let me go for 26 which
will be difficult
not difficult exactly by 26 so what
we'll do now is let's convert this
number so again we have to divide this
number by 2 right so the guys will be
getting 13 and the remainder is 0 then 2
so it is 6 remainder is 1 then 2 into 3
will be getting them into 0 then 2 into
1 will give you 2 remainder is 1 then 2
into 0 will give you 0 demeter is 1 okay
and you have to read upwards so which is
1 1 0 1 0 so that's your number which is
in which is in binary format right so we
got did a simple number from decimal
system to binary system so the system
says when you have a number in when you
have a number in decimal system you have
to convert that number into binary
system you have to divide by 2 right you
have to divide the number by 2 that is
division sign it doesn't look like a
Division sign right what does the
division shine ok and now we have to
find the decimal format from binary
system so when you say you have to find
it is similar system for my 9 system you
have to have to use the power of 2 so
from decimal to binary up divided by 2
and from binary to decimal you have to
use power of to know what exactly it
means so have to start from the left
right all right hand side to left hand
side so you have to come you have to
come this way ok so you have to use this
0 so 0 will be 2 raised to 0 then it
will be 2 raised to 1 then this will be
2 raised to 2 this would be 2 raised to
3 and this is 2 raise to 4
ok so you have to for every point of a
number you have to give the power
so today's 2 so ignore all 0 so ignore
all zeros only focus on one so we have
one here right which is 2 so 2 raised to
1 is 2 and we have 1 so 2 into also 2
and then we have to say plus then focus
on this one because this is this is 1
right so the value is 1 2 s 2 3 is 8
plus 2 raise to 4 is 16 so when it says
16 plus 8 plus 2 which gives it 26 so we
got the same number right so when you
want to find the binary conversion so
divide the number by 2 and when you want
to find the decimal from binary you have
to use the power of 2 so that's it from
this video let me know if you want some
more videos on on binary conversion this
is just a test video so that's it thank
you so much for watching and makes us
just have a channel for more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
