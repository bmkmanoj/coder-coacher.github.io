company I want to build this car okay
maybe what does it become so I want to
build this car so in this car I have
lots of parts right so I will be having
a bio engine and so people if you have
you got so far co now to build this car
what we need is we have to first build a
tire we have to build a engine right so
as a company owner or as a manufacturer
I have to build all this objects right
so to build a car we have to build those
objects so if you imagine this is a java
world so in order to create an instance
of a car first time to create a class
right that class will define the car in
the class when we define some properties
that will be engine properties will be
having a higher property so we have to
create those objects right so those
objects are dependencies for this car so
tile is a dependency for this car
what about engine depends it for this
car so what we can do is we can ask
someone else to give you those objects
why you should create those objects so
you can ask Spring Framework to give you
those objects and those object will be
injected in your application using pin
factory or the application context and
that concept of injecting object into
your application this is called as
dependency injection and that's what you
have a spring core</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
