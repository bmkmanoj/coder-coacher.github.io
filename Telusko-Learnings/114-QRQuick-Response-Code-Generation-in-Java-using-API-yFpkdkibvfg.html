QR code where Q R stands for it is quick
response so QR code is quick response
code so if y'all used any Android phone
or Blackberry or iPhone you might be
knowing about this concept so in this
video what we'll do is we'll create a QR
code from a text so before creating QR
code let me create a string variable of
which I want to create a QR code and the
string variable will have as let's say
details okay details about my webs about
my channel so my name is Neven ready and
my channel name is say channel name is
telesco
learning's okay so we have this string
here and that's it so when I when you
when you create a QR code of it and if
you scan that QR code with your mobile
phone using a QR code app you will see
this text written there now question
arise how to create a QR code now QR
creating a QR code is not that easy by
writing Java codes right because it
needs some functionality which you have
to use from some libraries so on github
or on Google you will find lots of
libraries of which you can you can use
those libraries to create QR codes now
those libraries are so I have all the
way down to this library so you can use
something called as this Z thing and
that zinc j2se now this two files are
from zebra crossing so they have created
this jar files and then we have one more
which is QR generator so QR generator is
depending on this to library 0 now what
wait to do is we need to include those
rabbits in our project so let me go to
this area in this code generator so I
click on your library in your project
area and then you can click on Add jar
files and you can just navigate to your
folder so I have
stored in my live folder here and my II
drive and let me select all these jar
files and say open now once I say open
in my jar file I have already added
those elements now in order to use it
first we need to create a object of byte
array output stream which is a Java so
Java class which belongs to a package
Java dot IO because of this class we can
we can create those image here and we'll
name this as out equal to now in order
to use that class which is belong to
this keyword the library we are using
the class name is QR code and in this
key our QR code we can mention the text
we want to create so the text name is
this which is from in this form you can
pass your string with details so it will
cont create a a QR code which is stream
format of this details so in order to
convert that into a stream format we
have to say from and then we have to
specify the image type so to specify the
image type we have to say dot and again
we have to use two so image type can be
of anything it can be of jpg or it can
be a PNG so we'll go for jpg this time
and then we'll say convert this data
into stream format because this object
here which is out object only takes
stream because it is object of byte
array output stream okay now what next
now once you got this out stream we need
a file where you can where we can write
this code so we have made a file object
will say file F equal to new file and in
this we can mention the file name and
the file name let's say we have in each
rive in the same folder so let me just
copy the copy the path here so let's say
copy and I will use the same path okay
so let me just paste it here and
this I was I had to mention the file
name and will say this is my channel dot
jpg so this is my file name here and
yeah that's it
and let's import the package so you know
how to import your package to just say
control shift I in NetBeans it will
import the package for the file now once
you got the file object we need
objective file output stream which will
help us to write the update I into the
file so we say file output stream and
we'll name it as a force equal to new
file output stream so if you don't know
how to use file you can watch my videos
on file handling now let's import the
package so packaging pod done but it
says they'll meet there there might be a
chance that we'll throw an exception so
you have to handle it so we can use
try-catch but I'm lazy so we'll just
suppress the arrow
so we'll say those exceptions so it will
handle all the errors or even suppress
all the errors now once you've got the
object of course we can simply say right
because to in order to write the data
into the file we have to say right but
this side function here will only take
so if you see the signature of right it
takes the adding of bytes so in order to
take the array of bytes
if you pass here out out is the object
of white as a right so we need to use a
method called as two byte array which
will convert your bytes into adding now
once you're done with that it will wait
for the buffer to be full we don't want
to it to a way to begin simply say flush
and then that's it so once you say flush
it it's done using this code now so if I
run this code it will first create this
string which is now in 1120 channel name
tells Corning's will use a hyphen here
and then we can create a byte output
stream object using QR code dot from dot
two so this is from these details to
this image type and then we need to
specify the location where you want to
store and the location is this and then
we need to create this object of fos to
store into the file and then we have to
say out dot to byte array which will
convert your
a byte array object into a byte byte add
a byte array output stream object into a
byte added so now let's run this so
right click and say it 1 once you run
this code you can see it says build
successful and the output will be
getting is in this folder so you can see
there is a image here quite as my
channel and if I open this and here we
go so this is your QR code so after
running this what you can do is you can
just go to your you can take your mobile
phone download a app any app will do
which will which can scan the QR code
and you can just verify if you can just
scan those code it will say MA 11:29
tell squirrel earnings simple right so
this is how way to create a QR code
using Java provided you are using this
three these three libraries you know you
will say was a big big deal when you
when you are using this libraries of
course when you when you are working on
any project you have to use some inbuilt
libraries so this is how way to create
image using this libraries so does run
