tutorial will talk about inner classes
so there is a concept called as inner
classes in Java now we talk about inner
classes in Java we have we have first in
your class as member class
so first is member class the second
inner class is your nested in a glass
the third one is anonymous inner class
and the fourth one is with a lambda
expression now we start with the first
one which is member class so basically
what is inner class class inside a class
is in a class right now let's start with
the member in a class so when you talk
about member in Java so maybe we talked
about member variables we talked about
member methods in the same way we can
have member member classes also so how
to use member classes so let's create a
file let's say we'll say this file as
inner demo and we'll go for a package as
this is Feb 13 the extra set of codes
yeah okay now what I will do here is I
will just say this is my main function
and let me create a class here and we'll
say the class here is a again we are
going for some absurd class name it's
always a preferred way to give a proper
name to your class but just for the
example we are going for this thing so
we have class a and in this class a let
it have a variable called as a roll
number and a variable called as name
name I will say roll number and a string
type called as s name now these two
variables here or this two properties
here are your class members right this
is these are your members member
variables you can see now what if if I
go here and if I define a method which
is public void show now this method is
called as member method and if I make
this
as static so this become a static method
earlier it was a non studying method
right and to call a non static method we
required a object let's say move this
show and let's move towards something
always in a glass so let's say I have a
Class A and said this lastly I have one
more class called SB so what I'm doing
now is I'm creating glass inside a class
now earlier what we can do is we can
just say a Klaus B resides outside Class
A let me just format the code moment
okay so Class B that stays outside the
Class A and in this class we can define
a function for the public void show and
now in order to call this show what we
can do is we can just let me print
something here let's say hello now in
order to call this show we have to go to
me our main class will define a main
function and then we have to get object
of obj or B and we'll say obj and now
using this obj we can call show right
now this is this is the way you can call
this show but what if this class is not
there inside outside of a this class
belongs inside your class called as a so
thing is when you when you say it is
inside a class a that means when you
call this function I think I'm missing
something here okay I'm missing a
bracket so let me just again refactor
the code for my T code okay now you can
see we have Class B inside class a now
in order to create object of B you can
see we are getting some error again if
you are going for import also it will
not work is because what your inner demo
knows is about only about a be a it only
knows about a doesn't knows about B
still let me just remove this code you
can see there is no error here if I run
this file obviously you will not get any
output is because in main function we
are not writing anything but let's see
what are the class files it creates if
you go to this file here and if you go
to web 13 we can see we have the classes
one is in a demo which is your class
with main function then we have a class
a which is his next class and then we
have class a dollar B which means this B
class is bonded with Class A right and
that's why when you go to this inner
class and if I create object of be here
something in this way it will not
support so what it says in order to call
B first thing when you when you use this
reference so this is the class B and
you're creating a reference for this you
can simply go here and say import a dot
B that means you will get this B from
this a so this is one way on what you
can do is you can simply say it is a dot
B which means a a B class belongs to
class a now now since when you create an
instance here you cannot directly create
instance of V it's because to create
instance of B first you require instance
of a it's because class B here is a
member we are not writing any static
keyword here that means this become a
non-static member and to access non on
setting member required object so what
we'll do we create object of a as a and
new a so that we can create this
instance by saying a dot new B ok so we
are using an instance of a class and
then we are saying yo B so this is how
you can create object off in your class
and knife it on this code this hello
right so this is one way of creating a
inner class and the next type of inner
class which is Nestor class and this
we'll see in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
