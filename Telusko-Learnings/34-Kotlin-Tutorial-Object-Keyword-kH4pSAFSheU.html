ready from fiscal earnings and in this
video we'll talk about Oh again it's a
suspense so let's let's imagine let's
imagine scenario where you have a
detectives already so let's say let me
get a data clause and you know about
data class right now we have that we
have done that in the last video so if
we created a class name and we'll be
late I will leave this book and we'll go
for two things here we'll go for a bad
name which will be of course of type
string okay it will be of type string
and then we will go for price as well
again for book and for laptops I this
month's why this matters right so again
the books are damn costing nowadays you
know when you want to buy a good book of
course it will cost more so we got a
data class here called as book and it is
giving me another because I already have
that class in this file in demo I guess
let me just do it that I did it that
extra file there we don't need that it
didn't need it anymore okay so we got
this we got this book class right and in
this book class we can we don't need
anything else so let me just not put
that curly brackets okay so we got I did
a class here again in this class we do
have get as it does we do have also not
get answers but we do have equals method
we have to string that way we have copy
method right so we don't have we don't
have to worry about all those things now
what I want here here is I have this
main function right instead of having
one book I want to go for multiple books
maybe list of books and I knew I and
okay we are not talking about idly store
if you don't try to guess what the topic
is
okay so we have we have a concept where
you have a function I mean the main
function I want to get multiple objects
now if you if you have multiple books of
course you will put all those books in
one bookshelf slides I will be having a
shelf in which will be having all your
books so you'll be having multiple books
but in total we have only one shelf so
it is in my home I just have one shelf
and I have multiple books around I have
maybe 50 to 70 books in my house so all
these books belongs to one shelf now
let's say if my better say say give me a
book now I'm confused which book is
talking about because I have lots of
books but if he says hey get a book get
a job book from the shelf
now John book is one book which
maybe I have multiple books but let's
say he's very specific now he's saying
Java book Java computer friends which is
ninth edition from this shelf now in
total at my house I have only one shelf
right so there's no much of confusion
right so that means in total we want the
object of shelf is only one so what I
will do here is if I create a class
called as bookshelves which will have
lots of books so say this is bookshelf
and this will have lots of books right
so I will say where books and we'll
create as is so we'll say arrays array
least off so this a deduced off method
is actually returns you the I least
object and we'll say this is a list of
books so we got a list of books now and
we can add elements the way we want
again you can add an image here or you
can add an image from somewhere else
now what I want is I just want to make
sure that in total we just have one
object of this bookshelf now I know you
know I think you've got the point the
point is we are trying to create a
singleton object see for book I can
create multiple objects right because I
because I we have multiple books but
then bookshelf is only one so I want to
create only one object for bookshelf the
way the way you can implement singleton
isn't patent or maybe you want to you
want to make sure that you have only one
object just make this class as object
now what is this object key what it will
do is it will make sure that you have
only one object and that to the object
name would be bookshelf so you don't
have to even create the object now if
you know in Java we have to create a
class in that class you have to make a
constructor private and in that class
itself you have to get a get instance
method which will give you the object
you know we have we have you do lots of
thing and quietly just make the class as
object in your job is done because this
book sells now itself is an object so if
you want to refer this book somewhere
you can simply refer that as bookshelf
dot book so there is no need to create
object of this object of bookshelf to
get books with bookshelf itself itself
is an object what I do now is I want to
add some books on that so I will say add
and I will create a first book of mine I
would say the first book is of Java and
applies for Java book is let's
a $50 right and let split-screen let's
create three more books I mean two more
books and this book is of SQL and the
price for SQL book is 40 and the last
book is Kotlin now again coeur d'alene
is a new language right and we don't
have much resources available on the
internet so of course the book price
would be very costly so let's say this
is 80 I was not okay so we got a book
part languages which has a $80.00 and
now so this is how you can you can use
the bookshelf now this is a singleton
object so in total we have only one
instance of bookshelf right so we can do
that with the help of object laws again
you can create object class I mean the
object keyword as a normal class itself
so this books shelves you can treat it
as a normal class the only thing is you
this bookshelf is a singleton class okay
now what I do here is I want to print
all these objects so what I want to
print all these books the way you can do
that is by creating a function I will
say hey brain show me all the books so
we say show books it will it should
print all the books here so if I open
this it should print all the books now
that way you can do that is using a for
loop
and we can say I n books and then will
print one one book so we say print Ln
and we'll plaint I now you might be
thinking it will print the hash code not
exactly I was smart enough to make it as
data because it will print the data and
it will print the object data itself
right now how do you call that matter
it's very easy just say bookshelf
bookshelf dot show books you don't have
to get ugly object again because
bookshelf is itself is an object let's
run this code and waiting for the output
yeah can you see that we got the output
which is bookshelf and we go we got all
the books here right so that's the
advantage of using this concept called
as object so remember whenever you say
object it simply means that this is an
object itself okay I mean this is a
class which represents an object so it's
also a object name again in the incoming
videos will also talk about companion
object okay so this the concept is
almost so when you know about object you
can also understand about companion
check but till then this is object and
remember when you write instead of class
when you write object you can directly
use the class name as an object name so
that's it from this video waves you have
talked about object class or object
thing what do you say object in in
Kotlin so that's the thank you so much
for watching and do subscribe for for
the videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
