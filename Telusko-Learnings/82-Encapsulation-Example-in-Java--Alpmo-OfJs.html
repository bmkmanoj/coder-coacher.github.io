let's say the practical implementation
of it let's say I have a class called a
student and this class student knows
about two variables I already have a
student class let's go with employ okay
so let's say I have a class Prez employ
this employee has two variables one is
employ will say EMP ID and second think
it has is EMP name so name an ID right
and let me create some employee zero so
let's say my first employ is EMP II 1
equal to nu nu EMP which is new employee
and let me create some more objects so
let me get these three objects
so we'll say MP to any mp3 now I have
the objects here now let's say I want to
assign a value of EMP one employee ID so
I will say e 1 dot employee ID equal to
let's say three O of three we'll go for
two just two values the work will say e
1 dot a name is equal to let's say the
name of the employee is let's say nubbin
and for second employee what will be can
do the same thing we can say e 2 dot
employee ID as that says 5 and e 2 dot
employee name will say is 1 so now we
have this two objects now now the way
I'm assigning the values is undirected
using II 1 dot am PID that means from
from this place I am assigning a value
to this variable that means anyone can
access your variables with the help of
object right but your values should be
private so all your data members should
be private now you can see we are
getting some error 0 it says your
variables are private you cannot access
from another class because private
variables can be accessed from the same
class for this what we can do is we can
use some methods which which are
responsible to assign the values and
which are responsible to fetch the
values and this method will say they are
ghettos and settle so how to use ghetto
setters we can just right click with the
insert code we need cater setters for
both the variables and say generate so
you can see we got the Gator setters for
both the variables it is get name or set
so we get a employee ID and set employee
ID get employee name and said employ
name and this this members are this
methods are public which are accessing
our private variables so you can access
those private order from the same class
now what I can do is I can simply say it
says instead of using diagram variable
you can say emp1 dot set employee ID as
3 and EMP p1 dot set employee named as
Naveen alright so this is how you can
assign the values instead of assigning
value in this way because variables are
private you can use methods how to fetch
it let's say I want to print so I will
say e 1 dot get employee name since this
will not work because we are getting an
error we made our variables private
so we'll comment this part and let's run
this code and the output will be getting
is no bin right is because we are using
a method called as get employee name
simple and yeah that is the example of
encapsulation that is we are binding our
variables with methods clear and in fact
this thing this EMP is also called as
bin now is because we are we are making
sure all your variables are private so
that's that's it with the encapsulation
