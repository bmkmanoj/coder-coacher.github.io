ready from telesco learnings and in this
video we'll we'll try to understand how
to use webview in android so why exactly
we need webview
so you can you can see we have a web
page here which is which is my web page
with the disco calm and if I just open
all the stuff so it is now it is now
opened in web browser what we want to do
is we want to open this web page or
website inside a you know in a app
itself so let's say you want to build
your own app in which in which you have
lots of activities and one of the
activity you need is a activity in which
will be you can open a website right you
can open up a google calm you can open
my website you can open YouTube again
any way you can open any website right
so what we need for that so to achieve
that we need to we need to use something
else web view so which is web view is a
tool inside your Android studio so you
can see we have a web view here we just
have to drag where be here because it's
up it someplace where you can actually
you know open up a page so first thing
we require is we have to set the VIP app
with as matched patent and we have to
set the height as match patent so we got
two things here with which match parent
so you can see how a web view here and I
want to show a web I'm into I want to
show a view here right I want to show a
web page right for that we just need to
link this a Java file so this is your
job file here right you just I have to
create object of web view as we have to
do for the text text field all the stuff
so we'll say we'll name this as my our
brow which is our browser and we have to
also provide the object space right so
you have to say the browser equal to or
my our browser equal to we'll say this
this will be giving us a web view and
we'll say fine view by ID which is our
dot what ID dot web view that's the ID
name right and the last thing we require
here is we have to just load up a page
right so we have to save a browser equal
to not equal to dot
loadurl and this you have to mention in
double quotes a telescope dot-com
alright that's it that's the only thing
you require here right and if you're on
this code or it will take some time to
load in the emulator as again I'm using
a you know it's still loading as I'm
using Android 2.1 which has the
instrument option installed one it
doesn't take much time compared to the
earlier versions and you can see it is
trying to open up a page here as it
successful mmm nothing so it is taking
lots of time it should not take much
time as it let's start walking what
should be the issue here the first
problem is whenever you open a web page
you have to make sure that you are using
www dot in fact with HTTP so you have to
say HTTP colon double slash that's the
thing you require here and if I run this
again and one more thing before that you
just have to give the permission for the
Internet in the manifest which I have
already done for my project okay and you
can see the domain is not available
because I made a mistake here okay and
since we are doing install and so you
can see it is not taking much time and
we got our page here so you can see that
they got a web page which is telesco
calm and the in the bra in the app
itself this is not external browser this
is an app okay let me just move proved
my point
let me just minimize this okay and okay
just get minimized this is like you know
when you buy a very bad phone which are
low configuration that's weird
so this is the app here which is project
for YouTube if I click on this app and
this is the app which is actually
opening of a page right if I open this
oh it's not working
the thing is I have used actual website
has been different right where you can
see the whole page but in mobile view we
get some this type of slider here which
is if you click on this it will give you
certain options but the problem is this
certain options they work with
JavaScript and by default webview
doesn't suppose our slip I mean
individual it will not allow you to work
with JavaScript here so what we need to
do is before opening up page we just
have to set the JavaScript that means we
want to allow JavaScript here so for
that will say get settings excuse me and
then here we can say set JavaScript
enable and we have to say yes we want to
enable JavaScript here and if you want
this code now hopefully we'll be getting
a JavaScript option that okay let me
just expand this now so you can see now
it's working because we have just said I
want to work with JavaScript and it
works which I was skipped here okay
now what next let me open another page
here so if I click on videos page in
which you can actually learn something
rightly let's say you want to lunch see
if you can just go to my video page you
can click on see tutorials for big-nose
and here you can actually see all the
videos in sequence because if you go to
youtube you cannot find everything in
sequence so I going to have a plate is
there but maybe people are find it
difficult to watch my video there so you
can actually open my website and you can
watch everything in in sequence you can
actually watch Android videos in
sequence right that's much better right
so what next now say since you can see
this web page is not opened in an app it
is opened in a web browser so you can
see here we are getting the address so
this is not opened in an application it
is opened in a web browser what we want
to do is we want to say everything
should be open inside a web page for
that we just need to create one more
class okay for that actually what we
need is with this object we have to set
one more setting we have to say my our
browser dot these are there's a method
or a set web view client and in this you
have to pass an object of you client
right for that we need to create the
object we need to create a class which
will override we say we say greater
class we'll say this this class name as
my browser and we need to extend it with
web view client ok so we just have to
pass this object here so I have to say
new my browser it's that simple right
but hold on
ock now the answer is no because we have
to we have to tell that we need to use
our application to view all the pages
right and for that we just need to order
lower right one method here with a
generate I need to override a method
here which is this one should override
you while loading you have to say yes we
just need to overload that we just have
to return true because we don't have a
choice there because it returns a
boolean right but we can do one thing we
can just say view dot load all the URL
in this web view itself okay don't go
into another external web browser just
use the internal web View client right
and if you can just run this now
everything is good to go let's let's see
is it reflecting here it will take some
time to load as we have discussed okay
since we are using a new class it will
reload the everything because we just
compile it and if you can just click on
the videos page now and here we go
it is not opened in a new browser it is
opening in the same web view okay that's
that's the awesome thing about
overloading that overwriting that method
right so this is how you have to use web
view in your application it's quite
simple right you just have to create the
object of web view we just specify that
we want a Java Script here we want to
load the URL but the only thing is if
you provide a navigation everything
should be happen inside the webview
client and before that we have to say
this okay so that's it that's how you do
for this stuff so that's it from this

you click on the thumbs up button there
