let's start the session so do not to
learn java so we all are here to learn
java right so we have seen the power of
java is a creative video to various
views and all the things okay he is
saying still can't hear us okay
okay so sort of the soft words which we
need here is to software wise one is
dedicated and the another one is
equipped so first of all let's discuss
why do we need all the software can we
do without this and the answer is yes
and the answer is no what I'm saying or
other is not so we all want to be
durable right so we are not users we are
doing opposed so when you say you want
doing up something you want to go down
up a software and that software will be
used someone else so we have also talked
about the power of Java that Java is
platform for this platform independent
Royd independent so yeah so Java is
platform independent there there is one
more feature Java is secure right the
main concern I I mean the main concern
what am I mean I mean here is the
platform independence thing inside
security is something which is which is
very subjective but let's talk about
platform independent let me just ask
this question to you Heyman and before
that you saying any years now okay
perfect so you are havens what do you
think when i say platform independence
what it means in general
okay okay so what you're saying is when
you have when you like us offer for one
machine the same software can be run to
the same topic can be done on this and
not enjoy okay perfect so what's this
platform independence means is you can
write this software so you can write
this software 1 so that is right one and
you can run it anywhere so Java star
dollar goes with this concept of right
one and run anywhere and that constant
is also called as water so that's what
or concept where so what are simply
stands for write once run anywhere so
you can write the software once and then
you can run that software anywhere does
that mean it's like if I use another
language will we cannot achieve this and
the answer is no if you change your
language you cannot you cannot achieve
this because what happens you know
whenever you want to learn a new
language we all learn differently we all
learn something called as keywords about
that language let's let go in this way
so how do you feel here understand
Telugu okay so foods are the spam
that'll go great and Heyman okay so you
have some others all right okay great
what about you are this clear no of
course which tight and it's very easy to
learn other languages compare if you
have to learn Hindi if you want to learn
a variety it's very easy to learn the
moment you want to learn any any
thousand language it's a big pain right
but you saying you are there in high
suppose I from a long time so you might
be knowing you might be hearing about
some 1000 words there anyway you don't
have a choice we have to hear those
words so let's say if you want to learn
that language you say in or maybe added
clearly both so let's say if you want to
learn a Telugu language so how do you
start what's your left launch what will
be our approach
okay so you will okay you dagli he was
on this you will learn this clip okay so
let me tell you my my thing I'm born and
brought up in mumbai so I don't
understand that if I mean I understand
Telugu i can i can i can understand all
the words in Telugu but the moment you
know I want to talk so that's where I
find it difficult to communicate so I'm
not that low indian telugu even being a
South engine even beams from higher bars
but yeah so I don't know how to write to
tell you go but III can't speak I can
talk a bit so let's say if you want to
learn a bit irritable language how will
you start you will not start by writing
right i mean i know but i will not start
on writing what i will do is i will talk
to some person who knows telugu and i
will learn some specific words so
normally when you want to learn a new
language we always starts with how to
say had your lunch and had your dinner
so what do you say so you have the basic
words right to normal in day-to-day life
which we use so which we learn all those
things example if you have crushed in
south indian if your crush instead of
course you have to learn valuable
language wise so you will say how to how
to say i love you how to say and other
things like so so let's say if I in fine
say some something here so you other
days I'm saying something to you so
humans and foods are just control the
emotions because I know you know these
things but let's edit your answer this
question so this year when I say enough
in the onion peel noir what it mean
that's what I want here okay so let me
just answer the way we can take help of
payment here so on a Mac what was that
ok so that's perfect so did you have
your dream of Venus right so when I say
under which means watch Alice here under
miss food till nawa is simply means how
do you hate in your or something like
that so how do you had your dinner
something in that way so dinner is you
can say uh no man that had as cineva
okay so next time when I said it to your
next time and I
the underbar gondola unknown bhagwan
dinner okay what about you livin hell
without you know how is poised put that
means whenever I say under it means for
joy or the dear so whenever I say
whenever I send them it means foot but
very well in my sentence whatever I say
under McMinn foot right so you have
learned that one word now so whenever
you learn any language we all we always
learn about foot okay it's a lot of
saying not food which we talk we love
you'll be learning about keyboards of
who's on your mic is on if a state exam
yeah so you can do it yourself there you
can you can do to your mic if you if
you're not saying something if anybody
want to say you can just undo it
yourself and you can fight again because
there is also both I go noise coming
from your side okay you can find an
option of milk there okay thank you so
yeah so what I'm saying is so yeah
forward when I was i I was talking about
yeah so anyway you want to learn in any
language we all first learn the
keyboards like so I'm important keyboard
and then once you are done with your
keywords what we go for is big drama so
nothing is loving just keep what doesn't
make any sense why do you have to also
know where to save what in the same way
whenever you learn any language you have
to first learn the keyboard and then you
have to learn about the drama now let's
say if you want learning of C language
or if you may if you're making a
software a free language what we do is
we write a code so in C language of the
or C++ with first write the code then we
compile the code now what it means let's
say if I want to talk to others he and I
if I don't know how to how to speak
English what will do is I will talk in
Telugu language with with
payment and humans will translate that
for you are this year right so that
translation is done with the help of
compiler so human visitor compiler here
so unready of code and humans will
compile that and what what humans will
give you is the obj file which which is
your object file or maybe you can see
directly Exe so when you whenever
whenever you work with C or C++ we have
to first write the code then we have to
compile the code and what you get is exe
now attack exe is very specific to that
particular hardware example let's say in
this much independent machine which i am
using if in this machine if I write a
call if I compile the code if I see if I
create a exe file this will work only on
my machine the moment I change my
machine this will not work okay it's
because when you when you create an exe
file it is very dependent on the
hardware as the hardware changes you
have to change you have to again you
have to again take that code let's say
if you have a second machine now you
have to take the code you have to
compile the code and what you will get
is exe every time you change your
machine you have to compile your code
for that particular machine now that
doesn't make sense right example if you
want to get a new sauce and let's say if
you want to buy a new game let's say if
you want to buy a NFS game so that NFS
company will come to your home they will
they will take your desktop and they
will run the they will type the entire
source for them they will compile the
code that that doesn't make any sense
right so what we should do is we should
write the code only one and that same
port should be able to run anywhere now
since this EFC runs on on hardware
that's what make it make it make it of
platform independent language so
whenever you run a exe on the hardware
it makes a platform dependent what if I
want to run by exe not on hardware but
on what a loss
software now that software so initially
it was a machine but what if you create
a virtual machine so instead of running
it on a physical machine if you can run
that code on the virtual machine what my
job is done right now how it will be
done is because all the all the hardware
all the OS will use the same virtual
machine in the entire world is everyone
is using the same virtual machine of
course your food will run anywheres
right everyone I'm trying to save
everyone okay so that's where the
concept of virtual machine came into
picture now this virtual machine which
is which which is of salt i basically
washing machine is not a husband for
software which will act like a hardware
so it's a salsa which behaves like a
soft behaves like a hardware now this
software which is your virtual machine
is specifically build for java and
that's why it is called as java virtual
machine which means if you want to run
java code if you want to run your java
software you need java virtual machine
so if you build a software use it using
java you can run it every anywhere
provided that machine has JVM if you
do--if you however if you have a
hardware if you have a system where you
don't have a JVM your yourself i will
not work example let's say if i write a
code for this machine in the current
machine and if i change my oil to let's
say windows or linux it will work right
but my question is okay so that means
july / moment is independent Roy differ
at the code once we can run it anywhere
but the question is if I if I night of
code for this machine and if I want to
run that code on my android phone with
it
look at this question for everyone will
it work now why not because Java says
done I mean why did once run anywhere
right exactly so we don't have JDM on
android phone if you can get the JVM
android phone then you can go in our
software on android phones as well right
so whenever you have JVM only on those
machines we can run java code now when I
say java I'm not talking about simply
shower I'm talking about j2se which
stands for java to standard edition so
if you want to run this code then only
you need jbm what if i say your android
OS is also built using java but we don't
have a JVM this right how can you run
how can you run a Java software in fact
when you whenever you make a android
application it's basically a java
language itself in fact when I work on
Android we write Java for only I will
show you that once if I will open my
android studio to show how Android code
looks like even if you see that
everything is Java then question arise
why do we I mean even if you don't have
a JVM how can you run that Java code
there what do you think but pooja
anything from the other side what just
what do you think if you don't have a
JVM in android phones how can you run a
hundred application which which which is
built on java
who taught you there okay no idea so
that's very simple actually the thing is
it's not a good thing but it's difficult
the thing is in Android we don't have
JVM but we have something called as DVM
which stands for dalvik virtual machine
so daljik washer machine is like a mini
JVM so it's not exactly JVM but it
supports some code of of Java the dash
quote is specific to Android okay you
cannot do one normal jolla put on on
android but as I hydrants own own java
code or java flow so your android apps
actually work on DPM because a mini dbm
so it's a mini JVM be to java virtual
machine okay now what's next so your
java simply says you can write the
software once and you can run anywhere
so why did that machine has JBL now
luckily all the OS all desktop OS and
sour OS they had JVM even if we talk
about Windows Windows has JVM in Belgium
max max as JVM in world ubuntu has JVM
and burl I mean all linux flavors hey
what's that they will open this yeah so
open to has JVM in bed then we have
solaris which is from sun microsystems
solaris has JVM in bed so all these
machines has JVM n bill put the moment
you install windows the moment you
install Ubuntu you get JVM by default
which means you can download the java
software from the internet and you can
run it but that those are those things
are for users right for normal users we
are developers now since we are
developers we are responsible to the ID
code we are responsible to compile
and we we are responsible to run the
cone seat to run the code we have JVM
but how do you type the code and how do
you compile the code so when you want to
try the code we need a editor right and
normally we can use any editor we can
use notepad i am using sublime here for
this thing we can also use notepad plus
plus that different type different kind
of software voice so if you want to
write java software or java code what
you need is an editor that is ur can be
not bad it can be supplying but then say
you want to compile it so the first step
is very easy you want to type the code
so we got editor you want to run the
code you have jbm how do you compare the
polls that's a tricky part here how do
you compile a cold now we can use
compile the code inside notepad roids
not part is already laying software so
we need a we need a compiler who can
compile Java when it gets what's with
vision software which is required here
exactly so we need something called as
jay dee kay Jerrica stands for java
development kit so development kit has
something called a switch we actually
need here which is your compiler and the
name of the compiler is the off your
compiler is Java C so Java Sea is a
compiler which can compile your Java
pole make sense everyone
ok
so yes so we have dedicated a java
development kit we have compiler which
is Java Sea naughty question lies where
do you when you run Java C so Java Sea
basically is a console based tool which
means if you want to run Java see if you
want to run Java see what you need is
CMD so normally we run Java Sea command
on CMD now CMD if you are using windows
for linux or mac we have to use terminal
so that means to learn java you need a
software which is ready case so you need
a notepad you need Jay Riecke to compile
it and you need CMD where you can run
your Java Sea now you might have heard
of some people that Java I mean why they
are not learning java for a very simple
reason it's difficult to understand if
equals remember and difficult too
difficult to work with right the reason
why they find it difficult is this start
learning java and when it was I mean Lee
does not matter which trainer they
follow or which wich tutorials they
watch everyone starts with command soft
right the first phone you have to write
is on tomorrow and that's where people
find it difficult to work with because
we have to type the code in the notepad
you have to compile the code using Java
Sea and you have to run the code using
using JVM that's a big headache so we
need editor to type the code we need
compiler to compile the code and we need
some place we need a console where you
can run you very can show the aware you
can see the output so I stopped using
two different softwares what if you can
use one simple software which is your
IDE so is it till I do you stand for
okay also so anyone I da stands for
watch okay perfect so I de stands for it
is integrated development environment so
dedicated stands for integrated
development environment which simply
means that you can run I mean you can
have editor compiler and console in one
single software now which is the best
ide to work with there are lots of ids
available for java not one so that's one
of the problem you know you since you
don't have one software to work with
which we get confused which one to work
for so anything you have worked on OVO
guys pooja Hussein human cause it's here
okay so one ide is IntelliJ IDEA then
one is eclipse so pooja and I just hear
they have worked on Eclipse that perfect
okay so we have some more we have a net
beam then we have one now we have the
three popular voice in fact we have some
mold we have geographer we have blue jay
we have edit plus we have we know we
have lots of IDEs available now which
one is best now when it comes to
academic so let's say colleges or
universities they normally use netbeans
because it is promoted by oracle all the
I mean these two are very famous Eclipse
and IntelliJ let this is also famous
only problem is only it is famous in
academic not in industry an industry
this to our famous one is eclipse and
one is IntelliJ
now it is more popular in terms of three
if in terms of money if you want to use
an ID in for free we can use eclipse in
fact I present one of the best ide
available in the market which is for
free so most of the people in fact I
would say 70 to 75 percent all the
developers they use Eclipse does that
mean explicit better than ID IntelliJ
not exactly one of the best ide
available is infinity okay then hold on
i'm saying best for both one of the best
ide available is IntelliJ but one of the
best ide 3d available is a clutch so
eclipse is free and IntelliJ is not
three in fact in Tunisia has two
versions one is community version which
is free and the another one is the
enterprise version which is not free you
have to pay around a very less amount
only you have to pay seven hundred
dollars for one year that's it who then
don't tell me you bought it how you are
using a community version yeah that's
actually very expensive that is very
very very expensive then kosher eyes who
would pay for that I mean I would never
pay for that you know if somebody was
try to sell that product to me I would I
would never buy it in EG then who buys
IntelliJ and the answer is industries
company's employees don't own employees
it owned by companies buy it so example
if I am working for let's say if I work
for maybe JPMorgan so JP Morgan would
buy the license for minty DJ and they
don't buy one license they buy some
bunch of license warming from
intelligent and they give this license
to all the developers because it
increases the productivity of the
developer it gives you some employee
tools to work with see no one wants to
write a software
on notepal and run it on the compiler
right so they want something using which
they can they can get the output as as
possible so they invest on this offer as
well okay but the free one is equipped
so Atlas is free it is very powerful it
is very flexible when I say flexible
what I mean by that is let's say in
future if you want to work with us let
me show you how a kiss looks like so
first of all let me show you in tillage
a house or change my laptop so I don't
have any DJ here okay let me show you
how it will subside so this is the logo
for eclipse so let me use eclipse 6.04
point 6.0 so the latest version of
eclipse is neon in fact we also got
oxygen now but that's into a testing
phase so i always used the second-last
versions because the latest version is
always it will always have some bugs now
whenever you open a club this is what
you get you get a they will ask you for
a place
yes but also it will ask you for so it
will ask you for the location where you
want to throw the audio project so I
would create one more one more folder
here colors do so that's our current the
batch name ok I give the font is very
small why's it just change the font size
okays it pop it with font size now ok so
let me just say ok so if we create it
will launch eclipse with that particular
folder so all of projects will be will
belong to one putting a folder which
will be easier to track in future
ok so now this is he liked how eclipses
look like so if i go to x less than if i
say about eclipse you can see that's a
logo right now excellency is it the only
idea available we have in to DJ we have
netbeans ide but we also have sts can
see that there is a proverb honesty is
best if i click on HTS and if i open
next year if i go to about sts which is
spring to switch which one is also built
on eclipse that means in future let's
say if you don't want to use eclipse if
you want to use as here you are not
using any new software you are using a
Eclipse flavored software so sts is a
flavor a peclet the advantages if you
want to work on spring framework and
future so there is something which we
need h-sphere in fact i also have a
software palace jboss developer and
jboss developer is also built on a clip
so if you learn eclipse you can you get
you can run you can use any other
software just tricking okay okay now
what's next so this is how your eclipse
looks like now in a flip the point to
remember is you can see razor there's a
button here can see vice open
perspective everyone
behind on it yeah your mic is on there's
some bag of noise coming from your side
oh thank you but I'm a nice DP on it ok
so what I'm saying is yeah so you can
sit in today's option here for less
opens for open perspective nowadays
perfect you mean now since we are
working with core java I mean j2se we
need to work with Java perspective this
one but let's say any future select the
infuser if you want to work with
advanced java then you have to select
java ee perspective the moment you
change your perspective the options will
change the example by default we are in
Java EE perspective thus I can see
default the right now since we are in
Java EE perspective you are getting all
these options you're getting properties
window you are getting servals so do
something which you only get in Java EE
perspective now since we don't need in
server here we can change the
perspective to java click on OK as you
can see this will change now and regards
only javadoc and declaration there is no
server now so since we are working with
core java we don't need any new Java EE
perspective so that your that your
eclipse looks like after you looks like
ok perfect now let's say if I want to do
a first code any guess what is our first
code
so it does not matter which language you
learn the first code we always write is
hello world probably so what were you
saying why we why we learn LOL first
okay yeah okay so that's perfect it's
easy so first of all it's easy I think
they're saying that's what the first
code was returned maybe but that's not
this is why we use and avoid that is it
is okay so yeah so in your perspective
the theory it was the networking so when
then the network was built for the first
time between two servers they they sent
a message Colin hello world next one day
cause they're going for the world but
why we have to learn this code is
because if this code works you will get
a confidence okay because when he was a
new language on your thing that is the
first code should run right it doesn't
matter what about the future but the
current code should befall squad should
work second is that what you can verify
okay my system is working in future is
anything goes wrong that your mistake
all yeah that's one of the perspective
getting introduced with Java by saying
hello so yes you can say hello to Java
but can I write the code directly here
the problem is since we are working with
ide whenever you work with ide you have
to create a project and it doesn't
matter which technology or working with
maybe dotnet Java PHP any PHP framework
you need to create a project now what is
the project so basically project is a
logical grouping of Java code where you
have where you'll be having your Java
code then you'll be having your
configuration where you will be having
your dependencies all the stuff again
we'll talk about that later but yes so
we have we need a project here so i
click on your ex back and explore this
option of new and you can see we're
getting option of java project just
click on that is our project now it will
ask you for a project name and you can
give any project name because that's
okay but it should be logical i will use
demo because this we are doing at the
first code let's name it demo or we can
also say furthermore since which is our
first tool now the latest version of
Java is
our 1.8 now let's say the current
version of Java is da 1.8 what if you
only learn 1.7 is that enough do we
really need to learn 1.8 what I think no
need do you need do you really really
need Java 1.8 or 1.7 would be enough
ok
well that's perfect if you are using 1.7
opposed will not be able to use 1.8
features but if it that a major update
because see when wenzhou 1.7 was
introduced people took lots of time to
move 1.7 they were happy with 1.6 and
that was okay at that time even if you
are using 1.7 and you I mean industry is
working on 1.7 are you are walking on
1.6 that's fine but the problem with
Java 8 is it has changed as the thing in
fact not everything but most of the
thing is Java now it is changed so let's
say if you have learned 1.7 and suddenly
someone says hey 91.8 and if you think
okay that's that's easy you know 1.7 you
can learn 1.8 now that's not the case
1.8 is very different from 1.7 so
knowing 1.8 now will be an added
advantage in fact 1.8 was introduced in
year 2014 it took almost three years for
everyone to understand the true power of
Java 8 but we are learning java 1.8 here
and you so don't worry so that was the
end of end of the course topic what the
1.8 feature but you will be amazed so if
you have any friends if you have any of
your partner who is working on java and
then i do they might be working at 1.7
just so the 1.8 features there will be
amazed as well anyway so 1.8 is very
very very different from 1.7 now why
they why they went for 1.8 the reason
was the current generation you know we
are living in information age which
simply means that we are generating huge
amount of data when I say huge actually
it is very very huge we are generating
TVs of data per day the problem is not
we are generating the data the problem
is we are generating it is so fast and
in a variety of way it is very difficult
to process it
so to process that data we need some
language wise so initially people used
to work with Java but Java was having
some shortcomings you know it was having
some drawbacks no you cannot say drop by
if it was having some limitations so
there was an alternative for java
collects column I don't know if you have
heard about scholar anyone what about
further here so here the alternative for
java is color so if you see have huge
amounts of data and if you want to
process that data instead of using java
we can use color in fact Twitter use
about Twitter's voice which our website
so in which language it is very like
Facebook was built on PHP Twitter was
built on wats which language exactly it
was bridged on Ruby
so Twitter was built on Ruby language
but let us say first you know ruby is
good but since we are getting lots of
tweets per day we are not able to manage
it so the back end part of Twitter now
they moved from ruby tues color Special
Op shifting from Ruby to Java they moved
from the beetle scholar the reasons
Scala is very powerful in terms of
processing data so all java developers
they were moving to color in fact i was
moving to color so when I when I want to
know about to Java that everyone is
moving to scholars even I tried to move
to color and then this java community
they felt you know since everyone is
moving to its color that means we need
to add some pieces in Java as well so
what they did they copied the concepts
from color and they have introduced in
Java in Java one point each and that's
why I 1.8 is very very important because
this is in the world of big data in the
world of head you we need javed concepts
ok everyone
yes a month
okay perfect let me select java SE 1.8
version here then click on next nothing
much here click on finish okay now this
is your first project yet before
continuing I would just want to ask
everyone at the sphere haymond hussein
puja and on it you have done programming
before right at least one programming c
c++ any of that any of one which one you
have seen on it feel please doctor okay
Lakshmi see a note
okay so basically of which I see your
name is Lakshmi of puja or foo the human
has done see no need to c and c++ okay
so when you have when your friends fall
called the other day when they therefore
your name what they say is just saying
okay hey call you visualize have your
perfect and what about you saying how do
you pronounce your name it's the same
right okay perfect so yeah so since we
have learned the languages before the
CNC I'm in CLT pursues language okay
let's go ahead now so now let's try it
before school or before I think let's
get an expanded jay aruh system library
now what is gianni we have talked about
jdk we have talked about JVM what is
this on GRE so what if ddk is judika
stands for java development kit jb m
stands for java virtual machine and j.r
e stands for Java Runtime environment
for that's perfect future but why do we
need a JRE when you have this too
so the answer is very simple let's say
if you want to okay the dedica you need
to that you can compile the code but JVM
you need to run the cool but while
running the code you may need some extra
files you need an environment where you
can actually run the code so jbm is a
machine when you can run the code that
code will need some extra files from
system in these classes or some
resources that resources will be coming
from JRE insect GBM is a part of GRE so
jared is a big software in that you have
a small JVM
okay perfect now let's go back there so
you can see the god Gianni here and the
version of GRE is 1.8 let's go for the
SRC so if you want to write any code
this is the folder where you can where
you can create a jar file so i click
that click on you and you have to create
your first class i can we'll talk about
class afterwards but whenever you want
to create a new file in java you have to
get a new class we will name this class
as demo or you can say our Greek and the
click on let's just take this thing
which is published at avoid mean why do
we need the dead will see later but
let's say we are writing the school okay
the font is very small knowledge pneus
change the font size now this is tricky
in eclipse you know we have to just to
change your font size we have to do lots
of circles click click on eclipse here
then go to prison once you go to prison
just go to your generals in that go to
appearance go to color and form then in
this click on basic then we have text
font click on it and you can see the you
can set these font size and study in
here and different okay close and okay
if you are wondering how is remember all
these things that finds all these
sections are getting recorded it will be
available for you for offline because
all these for this session for the
offline watch now this is be placed so
this is the place where you like to
actually type your code when we talk
about this later but time business
remember this is the place where you
have to actually write your tub where we
applied the opcode now what we want to
do here is we just need to print hello
world why so all I do is I would simply
say system dot out dot println again I
will talk about this later why we need
that and this will change
hello world let's see if everything is
working or not to have written the code
we have not seen the code yet why we
have Y where X put it this way but just
imagine we have that code there let's
right-click and we say is run as we
consider the option of an ass as java
application you can see in the console
window we got the output as on a world
so Congress yeah this is the first and
this is our first output someone be
excited ok now human you are the only
one remaining there ok so this is a this
is our first code here right but let's
try to understand what we have done so
just to understand this one will do is
will can select all and delete let's
type that code once again from scratch
now let's think about it what we want to
do here is we want you we just want to
print hello world right so simply type
hello world that's it this is what we
wanted anyways right we wanted hello
world so just say hello and world our
job is done but not exactly the thing is
we got the output in the editor because
this is me or it is editor area right
because the regards the output on the
editor was there we want the output is
this this place which is console first
of all let me just clear the console you
right click and clear so I want to I
want to shift this output in this
console if I underscored you can also
run by clicking here you can see it will
give you error so what you do is when we
use any string so this is a normal
centers voice or strength so when you
have a normal sentence a character
strengths you can simply use double
forces to specify that we are using our
strengths
shrink basically means normal sentence
so whenever you want to use strength we
need to use our code now what I want to
do with is the book what I want to do
with this olive oil I want to print this
right to print this we have to use a
method called a splint now why do we
need a method now since we are working
on java platform how java exactly works
is java uses of concepts of
object-oriented programming system in
short it is called as oak now what is ok
so oops is basically a concept which is
very famous with synthesis if you want
to build something always focus on
object so whatever you want to do you
have to do with the help of object
example if you want to call someone we
need a fold right and your fool because
an object let's say if you want to send
a mail you need a laptop where you can
send wicca very excite your meals right
so that that that laptop because an
object if you want to eat something you
need ice cream right so for that again
you need object so your ice cream is an
object here so is it the wrong time of
talking about i sent my my bad so yeah
so whenever you want something basically
you need an object right now every
object needs our every object has two
things one what object those and second
what objects does it just 10 steps here
before that it will connect my charger
my patch will die soon
okay so we have to focus on something
called as objects now objects know
something and object does something now
when I say object knows something what
it means let's talk about human we are
all objects right so we know something
and we do something right examples since
i am going something that's why i'm
saying something here right so we know
something and we do something in the
same way object know something an object
ugh something now when I say object know
something and talking about these
variables so object knows something with
the help of variables and the object
does something so if you are coming from
sweeps of citizens and rounds you might
have heard about function so object
knows with the help of variables and
object does with the help of function so
variable defines what you know and
function defined what you do example I'm
talking that's why function I know Java
because in my brain I have this concept
I know about what's my name I know about
when I say I know about who is my
favorite actor I know about I know
today's date other thing is stored in my
variables in my brain variable but I can
talk that my function I can think that
my function I can I can play a game that
night function so whenever I'm doing
something I am doing something to death
of function now that functions or those
functions in Java or those functions in
Java are called as methods so instead of
fusing
so stop using functions will be using
method okay everyone
now I trust me this is the only thing
which will be which well which is very
important in Java you just have to think
in object-oriented way now since you
already know c programming in c++ the
best way to learn java is think about
think everything is object and start
your work okay so when you say object
know something is know something with
your variables when you say object does
something it does something with the
help of methods now here if I go back to
my clip for sure if you want to perform
some operations we have to do something
right and that do something needs you
have to use a method so we have a in
binge method in Java caller sprint so
print is a method which can change hello
world but hold on method belongs to what
method belongs to objects right that
means whenever you want to use any
methods we need to use the object name
as well so whenever you want to use our
method we need an object example of you
know need if I say I am calling someone
what is there with me what you have
assumed there is no object in my hands
right what is that object
exactly right in the same way if you
want to print something that's a method
which it belongs to an object now that
the object is free bill is out object so
in case if you want to use a method we
need to use an object and how do you
specify ization fit between an object
and method by using this dot operator
this dot specifies that this place
belongs to out objects so out is an
object which is n build you don't have
to create out object make sense
okay so the problem is when I say this
object is created somewhere very just
created so we have one more concept or
something on a class right okay before
going for class let me just tell you
something whenever you want to bend a
building let's say if you want to build
a tower of 25 flows the first thing you
will create is a blueprint right I mean
you might know about this architect this
will be what is a constructor
construction architect what they do what
they have is the blueprint Roy so
anybody there is a new sawa you need a
when you need a blueprint for that right
so without blueprint you cannot build
any building or any-any tower in the
same way if you want to create an object
you need a blueprint for that and that
blueprint is your class so if you want
to put it objects you need a plan ok so
let's just uh get a one more once again
here let me just target you Hussein
which one you use
okay you're using iphone 6s that's
perfect what about you is it here don't
tell me we have all iphone users here
okay sounds like which one okay sounds
samsung 66 s6 edge so you know when you
when you have all this company brand
they all get manufactured in China right
so let's say if you have a friend who is
not using this high-end phones are you
let's say if using a low-end phone and
of course all the low end phones are
also built in China so we normally there
for those items as Chinese items right
but then these people say you know even
iphone is is made in china right as you
seem so bad you know after paying so
much money we still they still say our
phone is chinese food but a police much
apple is very very smart in fact when
you say when you talk about samson spoon
even those phones are bears a china i
won what about the other phone the
motorola phones they are you one village
it there even built in china what about
you your phone put in pooja which phone
you use okay using iphone 7 okay so all
are using high-end phones here and there
so I'm the only poor guy here I'm using
moto g 3 okay so yeah so we have so we
talk about moto g 3 I know if you're
also using me Jean moto that's perfect
it's an awesome phone right so when you
talk about moto g phone even those are
built in China but do you think they are
designed in China the actual designing
is done in this in that particular
country right example if you talk about
apple or iphone they are designed in
california and they only get assembled
in china they get what you say they
create those parts in china but the
actual designing is done in their own
country think about it to think about no
see our phones which was designed in
Korea and miss korea korea right and it
is assembled in china or Finland ya know
ki spending and Samsung his career so
all this all these foods are designed in
their particular country in the same way
but all they write is made in china
right but I phone on Apple people are
smart when you see the back cover of
apples they say designed in California
and assembled in china so that the users
will not feel bad you can check your
back panel so it says design in
California and assembled in china now
isn't for this and designing is
something which is important than making
it if making is more important than
China would have been our technical
technology power super power compared to
us right so designing is very important
so us does all the designing things and
China they just build it so that means
if you want to create an object you have
to first design it and the class is
something valuable design stuff so in
class we will design it and in up and
object is something which you can reach
me normally use so when we use an iphone
or when we use a samsung phone we have
an object in our hand now that object is
created because there was a design
oh is it the brain and muscles are you
can say that you can see that yeah so
you're your class is a blueprint for the
object so if you want to understand the
behavior of the object you have to talk
about a class so class defines the
behavior of an object so what an object
nose is defined by the class what object
does is defined by the club so when I
say this object is in build it must be
it must be stored somewhere right so
this out object is stored somewhere and
that term well is your system class the
system is a class where you have your
out objects stored so print is a method
which belongs to out object and out
object belongs to system makes sense
everyone
okay perfect now what we need here is
let's say if I want to type 5 lines if I
have five lines here or by the way we
have to put a certified the end because
in Java you have to end your statements
with semicolons now it may happen that
you have multiple statements here so if
you have multiple statement what is the
point of execution where they come where
the exhibition will start now you
remember C and C++ language we always
start the execution from the main
function right so main is the function
where you start your execution
okay stop it now in this mean what you
have to define us okay so you have to
use our main function the main function
act like a starting point are we done
here okay not exactly the problem is
whenever you use a main function we have
to follow a specific thing tag now why
we need that part of us in Texas because
let's say let me just target you payment
payment if I ask you let's say we are
sitting in a classroom all video we are
sitting in an office and if I need a pen
so I need a pen from you hey Mark so
unimaginable office we don't have any
pens you have to buy that what you will
do if I asked you here hit with tiny
depends what you will do okay so you
will get it to from the outside right
you will go out you will buy the pen
okay but let's be selfish you're a month
you need money for that right of course
you will not spend from your pocket you
will ask me the money you will say here
that we can give me the money i will i
will get i will get up and for you so
when is also like that person main say
hey I will do your work but give me some
fine amical right give me some
parameters if you want to make it make
me work you need to pass some parameters
now that parameter let's say that
parameters or arguments are stored
inside of a RGS now in Java whenever you
want to use any variables first you have
to declare the variable now the
different ways of declaring it whatever
you do is I will simply say string Arg
is again I will explain this later why
this squash racket there and why we have
string there that will discuss later but
remove the signature many days I will do
your work but give me the argument if
you give me the arguments I will work
for you but in return Heyman's what of
what I will expect from you
so or you are not clear what's going on
is it sound is making somewhere
okay they might be something show on
your side done it
okay okay perfect yeah so we have a so
yeah so Haman who with you if I give you
a money what I can expect from you what
I want from you yes a lot should be done
and in return I want so yeah what should
be done plus I want a pen also right so
you have to go out you have to buy a pen
and give it to me so if I'm expecting
something from you you have to return
that so you and some method are you as a
main method hey Monty not return a pen
so if I ask you for this when you have
to eat understand if I ask you for a
phase you don't see if I ask you for a
number your eternal number but if I
don't want anything in return I just
want to make the work done i would say
void wise mean i don't i'm not expecting
anything on you just completely of work
and that's it so what they're saying is
hey mean just win this thing for me i am
not expecting anything from you in
return just just complete that work what
the idea we won
okay so this is your main function I
mean main method this is the return type
are not expecting anything here and this
is your argument so if you want to pass
any value this is where you can pass the
value now even this will not work now
why it will not work it because men is a
method right everyone that means to use
a method or to call or method what we
need is the object so whenever you want
to use our method we need an object
for example to work with this print we
wanted an object which is out okay
that's perfect so to use this print we
wanted object which is out but the
problem is this is means right to work
with means we need an object we need an
object using which you can call means so
that means in order to fall main video
object that everyone in order to work
with main which is object and to create
an object we have to start the execution
so this is a confusion here the
container is execution start from Maine
to call me we need objects and to create
object we need to start the execution ok
don't you think we are into a deadlock
now we cannot start the execution before
calling means we cannot call a main
method before creating the objects we
cannot change an object before you want
starting the execution there is that log
right everyone
now how do you solve this deadlock the
only way to solve this deadlock is by
using a keyword here called as paddock
again we will talk about static in
detail later but time is remember when
he was right static before your method
it means you don't need an object to
call that if you make your method of
static you don't need an object to call
that next okay that's it that's perfect
that's everything is working here but
still we got an error now Java is purely
object-oriented programming language
which means if you want to do anything
in Java it should be a part of a clash
it should itself should be a design if
you want to do something in Java you
have to design it and by default we all
are artists so developers are artists
because we design stuff
okay the designer clothes now disclose
how to design a class use the keyword
class and then you have to mention the
name of the club the name of the class
will be your file name which is great
that's it you have to make sure that
this foot is a part of your class and
now lets in to take control and give a
stab to that it will be a pro find
dentist and that's it there is no errors
now let's run this and we got and ll not
be adult so every time you get an error
del it's a point where you can learn
something new so don't be sad about
heroes you know it is a part of your
life now okay so you can see it says
whenever you want to use made this is
the sympathy of the photos and we are
missing something here we are missing
public that means we have to write
public here now why do we need public
death the reason you want to access this
code from anywhere and if you make it
public you can access it you can access
it from anywhere again we'll talk about
we will talk about in detail about this
keyword public but time bins we want to
be we want to call it from anywhere
that's why you have to use public and
now let's run and you can see regards
the output as in a world simples
everyone
okay so first first two to three
lectures will be going bit slow just two
just so that everyone will be on the
same page after one week will be getting
a good pace so that you know so try to
get the pace as well guys I know you're
you're not on the same level in terms of
programming by trying to practice you
have to make sure that you come on the
same level so that we can go in a good
pace so let me just go for a quick recap
what we have done today okay so Java is
not some independent right so we have so
okay so dollar follow the concept of
water which is right once and run
anywhere now janian belongs jvm is there
on every OS Windows Mac ubuntu and
solaris so when you want to write a Java
code you need editor you need jdk you
need a console to run your output which
you can you can use command prompt
otherwise instead of using all these
different softwares we can use one
particular software which is your IDE
now you can use any ID you can use
integer you can use eclipse you can use
netbeans right so the best one which we
are going for is eclipsed the only
problem with IntelliJ is we have to pay
for that and it's not that difficult
once you know one ID each is very easy
to learn other other one
so we got this thing let's go back to
our code in order to bring your pulse
school in such an order page anything
you need a method using which you can
explain so paint is a method which
belongs to out object and out of it
belongs two systems love to run this we
need a main method there's a pass the
string argument it will not return
anything the message method should be
static is because we are not reading any
object to call mean it should be public
so any questions anyone from today's
session
it is he right right in fact our is very
easy it's just that you should know the
proper flow how to learn that so let me
know your feedback so you can mail me
your feedback about this session what's
going good what going what's not going
good so that we can customize it and
feed my feedbacks are always helpful so
let me feed back or you can use the new
squad training I tell you for training
or you can also send me a personal on my
email ID which is never 30 20 but due
centi feedback by tomorrow i will be
sending you the theory video for the
next session was a beauty video and then
we will see on thursday
okay then that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
