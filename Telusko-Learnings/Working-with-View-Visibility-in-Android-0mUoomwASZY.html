we'll talk about visibility invisibility
and gone features so for that what we'll
do is we'll try to take three buttons
here okay and before that let me change
this layout to linear layout so how to
change the layout go back to text and
we'll say this is instead of relative
layout let's let's use linear layout
here and we don't require any padding
here you can remove all the padding and
the type of orientation we need is
orientation we'll say this is vertical
because we want the objects one below
the other
let's drag some more object some more
buttons so we say the second button and
that's our third wooden right so in
total we have three buttons now this can
be any any view you can be can have text
we can have a layout itself we can have
an image view we can have a progress bar
but just for the example I am showing
you the button layout here or the button
of button component so let me set a text
as well say this is big button one and
we'll say this is BT and 1 this is
button - so this is button - oh I forgot
to mention the I do services BT on - and
this is your button 3 and we'll said
this is BTN 3 right so we have to set
all this we have set at all this IDs and
the text now what I want here I want we
will say - we talked about some layouts
here which is not layout but the
features of a component so this there is
a feature called as invisible visible
and gone now it actually means so let us
say if I set the visibility so let us
say for button not button 1 let us say
for button 2 if I set the visibility so
we'll set visibility and if I mentioned
this as by default is visible right so
you can see that on the preview section
here we are we are able to say it right
but if I make it invisible okay it's
invisible so you can see the button is
gone right so you cannot see button now
but still a logical is not visible but
physically it is their right it is there
that is why you're getting this gap so
that's why you have but
one and button three so you have a gap
here which is for button - so that's
invisible so what is gone then if you
mentioned gone so this component will be
actually gone so you cannot you do not
have anything call this button - there
we just have button one and button three
right so let me just write it once again
if I write it in it for write invisible
so the button will be there but it will
not be visible right Oh physically it is
there but it is not visible right so
that's invisible and by default it will
be visible if you even if you do not
mention that it is visible right so this
is button one it is visible but in to is
visible and button three is visible so
simple right so let me make it visible
all let me just remove this thing so
let's let us not see this using XML let
us try to do some coding so what I want
here as I click on this button button -
it should get invisible if I press
button three it should it should make
button to visible and button three
should be invisible how to do that first
we require this three buttons here a
service a button B T or button BT was a
b1 comma b2 comma b3 so we got this
three buttons let's import the package
for button that's done now let's assign
the memory for that so we have to assign
the memory inside oncreate right so what
will does will say b1 equal to the type
of object will be getting is button so
we say this is button and then we can
say find V by D then we'll say this is r
dot ID dot what be t + 1 so that's the
one then we can just reuse the code okay
that's paste paste paste oh that's only
we have any three buttons wide so this
is B 2 this is B 3
this is B T on 2 and V 2 &amp;amp; 3 so once we
caught this objects now I want to assign
the listener right so I hope you
remember every time you work with a
button you have to address now so we
have multiple ways of doing that or one
of the way is using this feature of
buttons we can say what it is on click
so it is let us say this is
so this is be one clicked because does
the method you have to define here so we
can just copy this code for every for
every button so this is BTN where is
that on click on click on click it's
here that's BT to suggest should be BT
or B to clicked and for button three
will say this is B 3 click sounds cut
now let's go back to the code and here
when those three methods so we say this
is public void it was b1 clicked so that
was the method name writes about b1
clicked and we have to pass an object of
view it adds compulsory right because we
have to mention that which of where we
have we are performing the action so
that is via there and then we can say I
whenever you click b1 so it should make
b1 invisible so I will say set
visibility so that is the feature now we
have to pass a constant here so you can
see it is asking for the int value so it
needs a constant so we'll say make it
invisible right so it will be B 1 will
be invisible at the same time the other
two will be visible I don't know if they
are visible or not but we'll make it
visible so with the sieve is say view
dot visible so that's visible and then
the same thing for B 3 so say this is B
3 it should be visible right and you can
do the same thing for 3 or 3 different
method we have three different methods
right so we'll say copy paste and copy
paste so this should be B 2 this should
be B 3 right so dance okay so in this
scenario B 2 should be invisible and B 1
should be visible here B 3 should be
invisible and B 1 or B 2 should be no
it's B 1 and B 2 right and that's it now
let's let us try to run this I don't
know what output all you be getting so
if I run this code in the emulator which
I have already have here so it will take
some time to load
now we have three buttons here so if I
click on this button one so you can see
it is invisible right and if I click on
button to sew one button two becomes
invisible and we got button 1 and button
3 fact lakorn button 3 so it becomes
invisible and we got other 2 visible
right so that's how it is possible here
but I do not want to use visible or
invisible I want to make it gone so the
advantage of bond is it will be actually
gone so there will not be any traces so
not even it it will not even occupy any
space in this screen and if I run this
code now just to see what's what output
we get this running come up come up come
up it's taking some time ok so now if I
click on this button - so you can see
it's gone right button - gone if I click
on button one so but in one gone we got
button 2 and 3 if I click on button 3 so
what and 3 gone right so it will save
some space of your screen now it's not
just you are you'll be able to use
invisibility feature with buttons you
can use it with anything you can use it
with what you can say a layout you can
use it with image view you can use it
with anything you want cool so that's
how we work with what we will work with
invisibility in Android so thanks so
