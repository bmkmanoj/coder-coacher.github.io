reading some political happenings and
Cincy has completed almost starting
videos and that means you want to learn
Java you like my videos now how to best
how to get the best use of this series
right since you are investing so much of
your time how to learn it better okay so
this video is just about the solutions
how to use the complete playlist and how
to learn Java now efficient way for the
start with it so learning something
takes time okay and nothing something
takes lots of commitment right so now
since there's nothing jawbone of the
best language in the industry
three you know spending some time on it
and you know doing and committing
something needs its work right
so what I would suggest you have to
watch each and every video from the
playlist okay don't keep any video okay
every video is important doesn't matter
what that media video means is it there
in the book doesn't matter every video
is important because if I'm making a
video on a particular topic and I'm
investing my time on making that video
of course a sum was not everything but
it has something to do with the job
alright so I will suggest watch each and
every video next you know when you when
you watch the video you have to also
know panel you have to practice it
because by watching our video you cannot
learn a language why do you have to
practice maybe you can learn it but you
it will not be there inside your mind
for a long time so if you are loving
gauged why not do it better so family
type it so if you have a phone inside
your phone you can watch the video and
on the laptop you can type it right
otherwise if you want a bigger screen
you can buy a tablet or you can have two
machines in one machine you can watch
the video second machine you can type it
wise I don't know how you do it but make
sure you finally also type it okay just
to make sure that what I am saying is
making sense to you by typing it now
next you know you can also give so let's
say if you are watching the if you are
watching all the tutorials and then you
want some extra stuff so I have my
website you can just go to the website
you will get extra stuff the example you
can also watch all the videos instead of
watching on YouTube you can go to my
website and you can watch everything in
you know I get lots of complaints in the
comment section that all the videos are
not in sequence so you know if you go to
the website you can actually get every
video in sequence right so I'm shooting
this video on today's 27th I guess 27th
May 2016 and this is how my website
looks like at this day maybe if you are
watching this video after one year after
six months there might be some changes
in the website of course because we are
always the zone for the improvement
right so we have so we have this website
in which you have lots of tabs so you
can see we have Home tab we have video
tab we have code tab and we also have
test tabs right so if you are watching
the videos and if you want to if you
want to watch everything in sequence you
can go to this video type video tag tab
to say to the matter so you can go to
that video section and you can click on
the particular playlist and you can
watch the video right after that what
you can do is so let's say you've worn
some code so there are some example
there are some codes available on the
website you can go to the code section
and click on the topic you want and you
can get the code we can started doing
that we can also test the thing right so
let's say you feel nothing something you
have to also check how much you know
about this thing right so once you have
learned something you can also test it
how to test yourself you can actually go
to the test tab for that you have to say
show yourself and all those stuff give
the test and so this thing if you don't
want to use the website you can also use
the app so you can download the app it
is periscope you can just go to the Play
Store download the app disk where you
will find the link in its description
area right so this is how my app look
like and in this you have working the
same thing you have a video you have
tests you have you have code section if
you are if you if you are introduce us
then we have this app available on Play
Store if you are an iPhone user so on
this date we don't have iOS app it is
under development now but it's also have
registered for the end Apple's developer
what is the Apple Developer website and
then I've got a I got my account oh it
will be uploaded soon in one month or so
one week or two weeks does let's see how
fast we can do that and for Windows
users on
we don't have any app for Windows they
have to use website okay so that's how
you can use the resources I've been able
to learn Java and what next after
learning Java there are lots of stream
available right so so if you want to
know about something I do lots of live
sessions so everything normally every
Sunday I do a live session if you have
any questions you can ask me on life ok
so that's it that's how you can use the
resources make sure you watch each and
every video there's a comment section
comment your question if you have so
that other people if I'm not available
other people who are my members they
will answer your question so that's it
from this video make sure you you know
you watch all the videos and all the
best I want you to be a great Java
developer that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
