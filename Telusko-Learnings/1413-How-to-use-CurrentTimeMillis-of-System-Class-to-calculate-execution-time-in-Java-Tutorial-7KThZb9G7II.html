video we'll talk about a method which is
current time Milly's which belongs to
our class for a system just demonstrate
this example what I will do is I will
use a a list just to save some values in
that so let's take an early Smith name a
equal to new other list okay and in this
what I will do is I will add some
elements I will say int I equal to let's
say 1 and let me add some 10,000
elements in this and let's say I press +
now in order to add the elements we can
simply say a dot add and we can pass the
value which is I so after this running
this loop this adding this added H will
have 10,000 elements and the elements
will be from 1 to 10,000 ok so it will
be tough it will be time-consuming right
it will take some time so if you run
this application so it it says been
successfully since we are not printing
so yeah but the values are stored but I
want to know how much time it took to
store the values so what we can do is to
know the total time taken by your method
what we can do is at the start of the
method we can we can check the timing
and at the end of the method we can
check the timing somewhere here we'll
check the time which is long it's a
start time and after completion will
again use along with the end ok
now to get this time what we can do is
we can simply start at start now how to
fetch the current time so you can use
system dot so there's a method called as
current time Milly's ok
and at the end also we can simply say it
as system dot current time Milly's and
after that we can simply print we can
say here we can specify end minus start
so which will specify the total time
taken by a code and now for on this
it says zero okay so let me add some
more elements because it's not in a
system so fast and I fell under so it
says 47 milliseconds and I fire again to
run this so anytime you have you can see
here these are in milliseconds so how to
calculate the total time taken by your
code is you have to at the start you can
specify the timing which is current time
millions at the end you can specify
current time millions and then you can
print the subtraction cool so this is
how you have to find the total time
right but let's try to find the actual
use of end time minutes so if I remove
this and let me again use long we'll say
value equal to and now if I say system
dot current time Milly's and let us try
to print the value here so what do you
think what will be the output
somewhere between some numbers right and
if you run this oh we are getting a very
big number now what is number is what
this number specifies so this number
here it is the millisecond so this is
the number of milliseconds from Jan so
it is number of millisecond so it will
print the Milly's from jan 1st 1970 ok
so anyway whenever say a current time -
it will calculate the total number of
milliseconds which are spent from Jan
1st 1970 ok of course you will not
believe me right so if you put a
documentation of current time Millie's
so I can see it specifies it will find
the difference measured in milliseconds
between the current time and the
midnight jan 1st 1970 ok why this is
because maybe the first software or
before 1970 we are not using any
software so maybe from 1970 they are
going for this now you will say ok so it
is calculating from 1970 just only this
number of milliseconds has been spent
from last 45 years
only this number of milliseconds let me
prove it so we just open the calculator
here say calc and here let's place if
value so they have this big value right
now just to check the number of seconds
spend here we can divide by thousands so
this these are the number of seconds
which has been from that time or to find
the number of minutes we'll divide by 60
these are the number of minutes to find
a number of hours we'll divide by 24 so
I made a mistake
let's try pleasure to it again so this
is the number so to find this second
divide by a thousand to find minutes
divided by 60 to find hours divided by
60 and to find the number of days is
divided by 24 I'm doing made a machine
so again divided by a thousand divided
by 60 divided by 60 divided by 24 okay
so these are number of days are less
divided by 365 and this is number of
years so 45 V has been spent from that
time and yes it is right so these are
the number of milliseconds we have spent
from 1970 because it has the use of this
current time release method which
belongs to a class which is system so
that's it from this video so do
subscribe for the further videos thank
you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
