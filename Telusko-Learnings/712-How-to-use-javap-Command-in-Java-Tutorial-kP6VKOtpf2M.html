is the use of Java P tool so if you have
ever used a CMD prompt to compile Java
files so in order to compile a Java file
what we do is we use Java C right so
what is this Java C Java C is the Java
compiler which will convert your Java
code into our bytecode so let's say if I
have a file called as a biscuit Java
just to verify this file I have you okay
so I already have a file which is a B so
Java here and now if I say Java C ABC
dot Java and enter it will create a file
oh there's a problem here okay let me
create a new file just to demonstrate
this so let me say notepad ok notepad
here and let me get a class called as
let's say PQR I in this pick your class
let me define a constructor so it's a
public PQR okay and then we'll say
nothing just a blank thing or just will
print something so say system dot out
dot println and here let me print hello
let me define some variables also we say
int I and a a blank method will say
public void show nothing will be defined
here just empty basis so have this class
and let me save this class in again a
drive in Java codes and let me name this
as PQ r dot Java okay
and just to make it make it public save
now so I got this class within which I
have a constructor and our method which
is show that's it nothing else
and in this PQ R what I'm doing is I'm
just printing a statement which is hello
it has a variable now so once you say
this let me say dir so you can see we
have file which is PQ R here okay
PQ r dot Java now in order to compile it
so we'll say PQ r dot
Java so Java see space PQR Java when I
say enter so it is compiled right so
once you compile this file it will
create a dot Java file as dot class file
so in order to convert from dot Java dot
class file we use Java C okay so that
means we can fetch the class file from
Java file using Java C can we get a Java
code from dot class file now they have
been they've been her lot lot of debate
that some people say you can't because
you cannot convert a byte code into a
Java code that is a security we get but
some people says no we can get a the
bytecode or the Java code from byte code
they say it is possible with the help of
Java B command now questions what is
Java P so Java P is basically used to
get the structure of your class it will
not give you the exact code it will just
give the structure okay so when you say
you can't retrieve the Java code from
the class files you are right but if you
say you can get the the cloud the Java
file from the class file again you are
right is because you are not getting the
exact data but you are getting the
structure what I mean by that is if I
say Java P space the file name which is
PQR and if I say enter so you can see it
is giving me the structure I have a
class public class vqr it has a variable
int I it has a constructor and a method
no definition just the structure again
that's the advantage of this Java B
command so do we only get the
user-defined classes we can also get the
structure of pre-built classes like we
have object class so object class
belongs to this Java dot Lang package so
we'll say Java dot lying dot object and
if I say enter it will give you
everything all the structure of your
object class so it has all this methods
so you can see we have public class Java
dot language object it has a constructor
here because a method get class hash
code equal so it has lots of methods
okay so you can deeper
you can get the structure of any class
you want with the help of Java P command
simple so we use Java C to compile from
Java file to class file and we use Java
P to get the structure of your code from
the dot class file so that is from this
video so I hope you got the idea about
Java of P thanks for watching and do
