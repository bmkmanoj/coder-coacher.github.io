the last video so we have created this
glass tire in which we have we are using
a tile constructor for construction
constructor injection what we'll do is
we'll remove this constructor injection
and we'll die we'll go back to the
property
in fact we can skip this property part
also we just do not we do not want to
assign any value we're just going for
the object of tire let's run this just
to verify the we are getting the output
so we've got an arrow says construct or
not found so once we are making some
changes so we don't want constructor oh
so now it's printing browned as null
okay when you get browned as knowledge
because I am printing these parts so I
will just print i okay that's it I want
to print the brand name is just tire so
now if I run I'm getting a tire that's
it now what we'll do is every car needs
a tire right so what we'll do is here
let's create a object of tire now to
create or difference of tire so we'll
say excuse me so it is private
we'll say tayo tayo and for this
reference we required a getter and
setter so we'll say right like a sews
and with my cater Saito so it's here so
let's select a tire and click on okay so
you caught a tire get up and set up now
once you've got the Gator and setter
Oh so let's verify so for this tire I
have a component so so basically we are
using annotation bitch quantification
here but for tire we are still going
forward what you say oh we have
xml-based configuration so will it work
let's see the thing is when you whenever
you mix a annotation based configuration
and XML based configuration we can do
that is called as mixed
figuration so we can use both at the
same time okay so in this example we are
using both so let's try to run this so
we are using tayo okay let's let's print
so in this dryer if I sprint drive so
let's not print God let's say it's car
plus and let's also print the tayo
okay let's print let's print tayo so
whenever I try to print tire it will
call the two string with of this and we
sprint it's walking okay and let's run
this now so if I run this it says it's
walking because we are we are superior
to change this so in app let's come back
to let's create object of card again so
let's not make it vehicle let's make it
car this is what we have done in the
first video if you remember let's make
it car and we asking for a car let's not
use tayo okay just say obj dot drive
simple knife we're on this oh it says
God and it prints null so somewhere we
are not getting this object we are not
getting this tire so it's because
whenever you want to use this tire here
so this fourth for this class car the
tire here is a property right so we have
to go here in XML file and then we have
to define this eigen value define this
car here and then we have to assign the
property so will not do all those things
will try to use annotations here so for
this we have to use an annotation which
is called as Auto biote so when you use
a wire cutter while annotation and if
you run this so you can see it says Carl
it's working so what this auto why
hydration will do is it will check okay
we need a car so if we need to tire so
it will
go to the XML file and we say okay so if
you need a tire you will get instance of
this tire simple so that's how
annotation annotation work but can I can
I remove this I don't want to use XML
based quantification now so will it work
of course not because god is the
component so I'm not using XML based
configuration so that let's come in this
bar just to show you so I'm not using
XML based quantification I am using
annotation based configuration and this
tire is not of component so we have to
mention component here also so we have
to use add component and now if I done
this you're getting the same output
which is car it's working so what are
the changes we have made so we have we
have a class car in which I am using
Auto while annotation and then we have
our tire win on which I am using add
component annotation so you can see we
are not using any XML configuration
everything is annotation based
configuration so this is auto wire
annotation I'm also using component and
then this is component annotation so
that is from this video for further
videos do subscribe and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
