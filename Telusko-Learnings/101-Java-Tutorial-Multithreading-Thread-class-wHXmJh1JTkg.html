so once we have seen the theory of
treads let's see the practical
implementation of it now as you know
that in by default in your code you have
one thread based main thread right so we
we do have a main thread by default so
all this execution is done by main
thread right so if you write any
statement here so if you light system
dot out dot println and if you print
good so even this will be printed by
your main thread so everything you do in
your code all the execution is done by
main thread okay that's your one through
it right and let's say if you have a
class and then class is calculator if
you create the object of a calculator if
we try to call all the functions all the
methods that methods will be called by
DAC main thread so by default we just
have one thread now what we'll do in
this code is I want to plant five five
times and I want to print hello five
times and that's my typical example
which I take every time so let's say we
have this hi here we have we have high
class and we also have hello class okay
so we have two classes here we have
class high and class hello in this class
hi we have a method which is public void
show and this show I will use a for loop
because I want to print high five times
okay so I will says for loop and I equal
to 1 I less than equal to 5 and I plus
class and here I will print I will print
hi and let me copy the same code in
hello and here will print five times
hello so we are printing five times I
and five times hello here and to call
those methods we have to create object
why that's the only way to call methods
he also will say new hi will say hello
Oh Bridget to equal to new hello so we
got this two objects so we have we have
show better here we have show method
here and then we are creating the object
let's call those methods will say obj
one dot show and with the obj two dot
show okay and so if I know this code we
will be going over output we got five
times
and we got five times hello right it is
it is running because we are calling
obj1 dot show when you call this so your
main thread will go to this show and it
will execute the complete method it will
execute this four loops it will execute
this four loop and then you'll be
executing this high statement five times
the same thing once it is done your obd2
will call show that means it will call
this method it will print hello five
times and the output I want as I want to
fire on this cord it's so instant we can
be getting all the output why I want to
see one one thing executing so I want to
I want to print higher then I want to
take some pause and then I will print
high so there should be a pause of at
least half a second okay now how to
achieve that pause now since by default
everything is everything is executed by
thread we can actually make your thread
wait for some time
or you will you can suspend your thread
so how do we suspend our thread is we
can use thread dot sleep so it's a
method which we use to suspend our
thread so we can say a dot sleep and we
can specify some time here so when you
say try dots leave five hundred it is it
means five hundred milliseconds which is
approximately half a second because 1000
milliseconds is one second now the
problem is it is uh it may throw an
exception so this is a checked exception
so it is we should handle the exception
so we can use try catch here let's write
try catch in one line itself again we
can write try catch in multiple lines
what I will prefer here to write it one
line because I know there will not be
any result because of this why to best
multiple lines so we have this one line
let me just copy this and let's do the
same thing for hello now if we run this
code what will happen is your thread
will wait for half a second so you can
say it is pretty spending it is waiting
for half a second I just printing this
one waiting for office again writing
this waiting for half a second so you
can see it is just waiting for some time
so that is half a second okay if you
increase the increase this time it will
wait for some more time there okay so we
are getting the output and off to some
waiting some time right if
if I make it one if I make it thousand
it will it will wait for one complete
second by differ on this code now so you
can see just printing higher then
waiting for once again printing high
rating or one second I enter spending so
if we take it took five seconds to print
all highs it tooks five it took five
seconds to print all handl right so when
you know that your this loop will take
four this method will take five seconds
this method will be executed after five
seconds right I mean just imagine we are
not doing we are not doing any sleep
method here it is internally we are
doing some programming we are doing some
stuff which will take five seconds so in
that scenario your other your other
method has to wait for five seconds
right and that doesn't look good because
if your one try one method is busy
executing something and the other other
methods are waiting for the first method
what exactly we should be doing is if
one method is executing on one code of
your process of same since we have
multiple processes in our machine one
method is busy on one code this method
can be executed parallely right I mean
there is no dependency on these two
methods why there is no dependency of on
of hello on high so we can execute them
parallely now how to execute them badly
so when you when you say you want to
execute them finally that means the
output we expecting is something like
this we should be getting high then we
should be getting hello and then we
should be getting higher then we should
be getting hello so we want high and
hello alternate so the way you can do
that is by making this classes as
threads now how do you make a thread so
it is very easy you just have to say
your class will exchange thread so if
you do this your class will external
thread both the in both the scenario if
we do this what will happen is if I run
this code okay it is not running
parallel it's because just Spock just by
saying exchange thread it will not make
a thread right you have to do something
that something is whenever you create a
thread you have to start this thread
because now this this high is not a
normal class it's a thread now right
because every time you extend with
thread your class also becomes thread
so this object here also becomes a
thread so what we'll do is we'll say
obj1
dot start can you see that we got a new
method now start and it belongs to our
class thread here can you see that and
then we say obj2 dot start ok it should
work now and if you want this code oh my
god it is still not working in parallel
the problem is when you say start
internally so every time you say start
internally thread execute a method that
is run method so whenever you venom is
whenever you say start internally in
thread we we always call a run method
which means instead of calling show we
should be calling run because start
always calls run it be simply difficult
initially but don't worry once we
complete the for example he will get the
gist of it so when you say when you say
when you call start it will call run
method or and if you run this code now
and you see that we got hi hello hi
hello hi Rallo in parallel so the way we
do that is we we have to say obj one dot
start and then the start will call brand
so instead of calling show we to call
run so whatever logic you are writing
here that should be a part of run method
okay so one is the internal method of
thread so whenever you create a thread
it is your responsibility to override
this one method but hold on this days
are these a small issue here the issue
is you can say we got high hello record
high hello
but unfortunately we are getting hello
first why not hi it's because what is
happening is when you say obj1 dot start
I mean we are starting both the thread
at the same time this is a difference of
one milliseconds maybe so what is
happening is when you are when your
thread goes for the execution so let's
say your thread want to execute hi all
print hi your CPU is only 1 right so CPU
will say ok you want to print hi just
print it so just printing hi then hello
goes and say I want to print hello it
says ok hello you also print then high
goes and then high says I want to print
hello says I want to print but somewhere
between what they both are reaching at
the same time ok
let's say we have two cools and they
both are reaching to this scheduler so
we have in your OS you have something
called as scheduler so both the threads
reaches to the schedule at the same time
and now both the thread says hey I want
to execute I want to get executed now a
scanner will say say hold on oh I cannot
execute both at the same time so I have
to choose between you there are multiple
criteria is based on which your
scheduler will pick up one one thread so
criteria like the thread priority
criteria like a thread which will take
less time will be executed first so they
are different different properties based
on which it will select but in this
scenario both the threads hi and hello
they have they don't have any priorities
I mean they have a default priority they
they have the same time of execution so
at this point of time your scheduler
will take will go for a random order so
it will choose any any thread at random
and that's why somewhere in between it
will print hello because it is going for
some random stuff now if you don't want
to don't want to get dag what you can do
is from star itself we can have a delay
of some second between this two threads
so that they will not match it up if you
add a delay of 10 milliseconds what will
happen is I will execute and after 10
milliseconds hello will execute so there
will not be any clash between this tool
and if you can see this we got the
output as hi hello hi hello hi hello
so that's how we can achieve a working
of threads that's the example of thread
in the next video we'll talk about how
to do the same stuff with the help of
interface because we have used a thread
class here can I use an interface here
so that we'll see because what I mean
why we need an interface that is because
let's say I have a holiday I've had
class call as a and this class hi want
to extend a class a and unfortunately in
Java we cannot achieve multiple
inheritance right you cannot because you
cannot say class hi extends a and thread
both so for that we need to use some
interface and how to do that that we'll
see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
