going to cover is I will talk about
interfaces okay the second thing we will
talk about is what we talked about a DS
and the third thing we'll talk about is
patent so once we have done with this
that will be the end of session okay so
let's start with the first one which is
interfaces so i hope everyone remember
interface right so this is just a ravine
station for that okay so let me get a
new file we use this package just gone
to extra so let me explain interface in
with a different example now okay so let
me get a class and within this class as
God Oh may not be caught but they said
this is a bank band that's bank service
so we have a class here which is called
as band service okay and in this class
will be having a main function so we got
this class which is Bank service and
it's here so what we are so what we want
here is we want to create a ATM service
so let's say if a customer's comes to
you and say I want ATM card then of
course you have to provide an object of
ATM card right so that's how view this
oops concept works so what we'll do is
we'll create a ATM card so we say God
obj equal to new card right but didn't
hold on there is a problem here have you
created this object early or we have
paid to this class it's a new class
right yeah so the problem is it's a very
news it's a very new class and we have
not created this so just say create
class card you know it Chris efficient
it will give you the suggestions here so
if I click on create last card and
the class name is God itself let's click
on finish so what this God will have us
it will have so a card can can have
three features right so like you can bar
you can take an ATM card you can take a
debit card you can take a great card
white all people have a different
feature example ATM card walks in ATM
debit card works and credit card and
debit card you can use it as in the
shopping mall right so nowadays we get
the combined card we care when you buy
when you get an ATM card so when you get
a debit card you also get an ATM card
right but that's not the case with agent
card when you get an ATM card you only
get it get the ATM card all right so
when you when you take our ATM card you
will only get 18 / but I mean it take
debit card you will get both ATM and
debit when you take a rate card i'm not
sure if you get a tia min that but let's
say this car has three features the
first pitch of this car has is let's say
ATM right so whenever you have an object
of car you can actually call this method
called as ATM and we can say okay this
is ATM okay then we can have second one
which is public void the second next
service will be debit right and we'll
say this is a debit we've got to
services and let's go for the third one
which is good right service a public
void credit and we say system dot out
dot println this will be ready some
squat right so this is this we have this
three methods here now in this Bank
service the god we have we got the
object of car and we can simply we can
simply call all the methods wise we can
say obj dot debate and we can say obj
dot credit right so we got three methods
and I phyllanthus code we are getting
the output as we got all the three
executions right so everyone are good
with this why there is no problem with
there okay so let me just go to the car
class
seems good but let's say if you got a
customer but who just want ATM card I
mean he does he don't want David current
credit card and if I if you provide this
object of obj and he can access
everything right so let's say for the V
goes to a bank and says I want an ATM
card and bank says okay you want an ATM
card but the problem is we have a class
Cullis card which has all the features
and you will get a card with all the
features but la vie says okay I don't
want all the features i just want ATM
service banks is okay take this card and
bank says you don't you you can use this
card in debt as a debit card but don't
use it user only has a great as an ATM
card but Robbie can you control our
emotions of course not right if you got
the debit card credit card why you will
control your emotions variety of course
you will use all the features then how
can a bank just click this thing because
bank only wants to provide ATM service
they don't want to provide the debit
card service so what bank and also what
options do what options you have okay
using interface but what you eat what
this interface will do let's try it out
let's try that what if you can just
create an interface work off only ATM so
we got this interface with this ATM and
in this interface 18 we just got one
method which is void ATM okay we don't
have any other method and this class
card will implements ATM right and in
this Bank what we can do is we can say
instead of creating the reference of a
class we can create a reference of an
interface and you can see as soon as you
create a reference of interface you
cannot call remaining two methods right
so that means we cannot call that so
once you create an object of difficulty
reference of interface it can only
access those methods yes this ATM is the
method of ATM and in this interface so
as good now let's say if a person comes
and he says okay I want a debit card but
debit card by default will have ATM
feature right I mean debit card will
have by default ATM I mean if you get a
debit card you can you can call two
methods ATM method and debit method
right now how to achieve that we can
simply create one more interface will
name this interface as debit okay and in
this debate we can have two methods we
can say public not public we don't
require public right because by default
all the methods interface are public
abstract so we can simply say void debit
and since it's also provide the features
of ATM will say void ATM so it can have
two features and let's say if sudden
comes and say I want I want the card
which has two features so bank will
provide a ATM card are not a debit I
evil bank will provide a debit card
which will have two features and you can
see they are creating the reference of
our interface and the object of class
right but hold on we are getting it
error anyone can you guess that was the
errors
exactly so this car needs to implement
that interface but hold on can we
achieve multiple inheritance using
interfaces I mean can be teeth can we do
that we can write so we can just say
karma and debit that's much possible and
in this you can see there's no other now
I can simply say obj1 dot ATM and obj
one dot debit a knife at on this so this
is ATM for Ravi and this is ATM debit
for Sarang and let's say if one there is
one more person who want only great card
and we can also do that right there is
no harm in that I mean can we do that
anyway everyone can we can be create one
more interface credit and this card can
implement three interfaces and that's
much possible right okay that's awesome
but now let's say say this a debit
interface in the set debit interface we
have a method which is ATM Lloyd which
is declared and in adium also we have
ATM so we have two statement which are
similar which are same in two different
interfaces and we know the concept of
inheritance right when you have
something in one one thing why to just
write update in another thing we can
just use it right I mean can be used can
we say debit extends ATM is it possible
and the answer is yes we can extend our
interface from an interface okay so when
it comes to class of class implements
interface but it when it comes to
interface interface it is only extends
makes sense right everyone
okay that's good so we got ATM and we
got debit so let's run this let's see if
it is working or not and it's walking
you can see we got ATM for Derby and ATM
and debit for Sarang what is the
question here in debit we have how many
methods we have in debit knob to right
we have two methods one is coming from
ATM right yeah and this guard implements
two interfaces one is ATM second is grab
it while we are implementing ATM here is
just because we want to access this ATM
method what if I remove this will it
work I mean will this Bank service work
and you can see there is no error it is
walking we don't even have to implement
ATM is because since we are implementing
debit it it means that we are also
implementing ATM because since we are
implementing debit and debit extends ATM
so we are indirectly implementing ATM
why there will be any difference pasad
see we are implementing debate droid and
dab it extends ATM there's no there is
no difference it's almost same now now
ATM we can also create the reference of
ATM and car or and the object of card
even if your car doesn't implement
anything and it doesn't implement into
ATM because there are two ways of doing
the same thing and if you run this
question should get in the output make
sense wife okay
Oh
now now what else so this is how we can
use interface let me give one more
example for this so let's say in this
card class we have one mode method which
is public void show this show will print
can one okay there's a question for
mammoth can interface explain more than
one yes we can do that we can extend
multiple interfaces example let's say a
time is one of the interface and one mod
is realizable which is in bill interface
we can do that there's no harm in that
we can begin exchange so when each of us
can extend multiple interfaces okay so
let me just go for one more method here
so in this card class we have one more
method which is show okay and this show
what it prints is the it please the bank
name so this ATM raided debate they
belongs to a bank right so it will
simply clean the bank name and let's say
if I have a bank name as ok let's Nick
let's not take this example it so
everyone got this idea about this
example I let me go for one more a
simple example to demonstrate the use of
interfaces I'm just providing different
user use cases where to use interfaces
everyone good with that right
okay just just going on
okay so let me go for one more example
here and what example should I take let
me just say up class again a typical
example here hope you forgetting a class
let me create or interface and will in
this interface as let me just get a
class itself let's say I'm trading a
class for a sketch yes we can restrict
the access to our members using
interfaces also so that's one of the use
cases okay so let me say this is not a
this is not interface is a class and we
say sound so what type of sound Oh cat
makes anyone can you just give me a
sound what type of just say new mouth
right so it's a mouth now that's weird
yeah now yeah so we have we have a sound
from cat videos now and then let's say
we have dog okay and we say dog so what
type of sound dog makes
Oh booth okay
it's sudden that was very typical bow
move will do it right okay so we have to
we have two classes one is we should go
for silent way right Bufo so we have we
are we have to we have now and we have
both right now let's make 3h mean we
have to pay the class which will say
this is a class noise and this class
noise will have a method which is public
void this will be public static void
show or not sure this publisher avoid
mean which takes a string arguments you
say this is oh it's not finding anything
here so what I want to do now is I have
one more class which is a house
okay and this house has a meta which is
public void show okay so what this show
really does this it's bitsy we have four
classes now one is we have cat we have
dog we have noise right and then we have
house right so in this 11 house I can
have multiple we have lot so we can have
lots of cats dogs we can have what we
can have padded right we have all those
things but let's say in this show I want
to call this method sound so how can i
call sound from house anyone
of course I'd by making an object so we
can simply create object of dog right so
we can create object of dog here so it's
a dog obj equal to nu why obj will say
dog Tommy and with a new dog right and
then from this we can say Tommy dot what
sound right and now how to how to call
this show from mean so in order to call
show from mean we can simply create
object of house right we can say house
obj equal to new house and then we can
say obj dot show everyone a make me
disco the example is making sense why he
fell on this code will be getting before
so in this noise we are getting the
object of house and they're calling show
and show itself calls this sound rather
than sound is calling sound but now my
question is if i run this cold i want to
i want to print mau mau how can you do
that
so for that we have to go to house and
this instead of hitting object of doll
we have to get object of cat right so
what if instead of creating this object
here what if I pass this object as a
parameter now can we pass object is a
pedometer and the answer is yes we can
pass a objector it's actually they are
not passing the object we are passing
this effluence ok so this Tommy is a
reference but how can you pass this so
in this nowise before with before
calling before passing the object of dog
we can say it is dog Tommy equal to new
dog and we can pass Tommy here now since
we are passing the object Tommy it goes
here and then we are able to call it
right everyone you're getting what I'm
saying ok but still it is still printing
dog I want to just fill pending woof
woof which is for dogs I want to print
meow how to do that so we have to get
the object of cat okay that's that's one
of the thing so let's say if I create
object of cat now so if I say cat Tom
equal to new cat and if I pass dad will
that method accept it it will not accept
right because we are possibly of
catching the object of dog here right so
here we are here we are we are so the
problem is when you pass object of dog
it is working when you pass object of
cat is not working but both the both the
objects are the same method which is
sound right so if you have such a
scenario where you have two classes
which are almost of the same family and
they have the same methods we can
achieve something called as abstraction
here
now what I mean by abstraction is we can
create a class and we'll name this class
as animal in which you can have a method
which is public abstract void watch in
fact instead of going for abstract we
can say public void sound okay and we
can simply say we can play anything
doesn't matter watch the method anus
doesn't matter I mean what it does but
the thing is both this cat and dog will
extend animal
okay now the advantage would be in this
nowise instead of creating a reference
off dog can dictate reference of animal
we can do that by the shop taking the
object of dog the cake we can create a
reference of animal and in-house instead
of accepting the reference of dog we can
create a reference of animal it's just
that in we can you know this is this is
a way typical example when you go
forward the advanced part where you have
to create a class which accepts the
object so this I've cated this just to
have this method which is show example
we you get into room and then you can
see a dog there so dog will shout right
so that's sound if we can also pass
liquid we can also pass multiple
reference here we can pass a dog
reference we can pass catcher offense
but why to do those stuff when you can
achieve using abstraction just pass with
one okay so even if you now if you pass
storm this is a cat right this house
will accept the object of cat okay let's
not name it as Tommy let's name we can
have a common name for Tom and Tommy we
can say so too it doesn't matter right
is it a cat or the dog we can call them
a show too and then we can go to not
know eyes and if I run this regard now
mayor because we are passing the object
of Tom and if I pass the object of Tommy
which is a dog and if I run this we get
gufu we don't have to change any extra
code and that's the advantage of using
abstraction so what we have we are doing
is we are abstracting so we are we are
doing generalization of cat and dog
which is animal right because both
animals make sense right
see in this house I have a method which
is show see in this house I have a
matter which show which takes the object
of either dog or cat and it will call a
method which is sound right so this
sound belongs to dog and the sound
belongs to cat so if you pass the object
of cat you want to print meow meow if
you found the object of dog you want to
bring book book in this scenario if you
are passing the object of dog and the
reference is also of dog then in house
you have to create a reference of dog
right but if you don't want to do that
you can generalize it now when you say
generalization it simply means let's say
there's a phone called samsung s3 which
is for humans right so a girl and a boy
both can use the use that phone because
it is for human so we are generalizing
it but if you talk about a phone like
watch
which phone I mean there are some phones
which only looks good with boys and that
there are four ms only look good with
girls right example if you buy iphone
sex with a gold color at the back end
that's suits more to go right so on a
pinkish this goes going to color so that
suit move for girls so we have being
very specific there but if we talk about
samsung s terday it is for everyone
right so we are generalizing it by
saying for humans so that's an
abstraction so we are trying to achieve
abstraction here which is animal so cat
is an animal dog is an animal we can
create reference of animal and animal
does not matter object which object you
have here right and then this house if
you pass the object of dog it will
accept because it is animal here we can
create a reference of super class I hope
you remember
so there's a question from amid if I
remove this method if I remove this
metabolic work and the answer is no is
because in this house we have we have
this reference of animal which is
calling sound so of course we should
have that there it will not work but
hold on we are not using this method
right we are we don't we are not using
this implementation then why do you want
a tax implementation we can remove the
implementation and we can make it
abstract we can give a semicolon here
anyway because we are not we are not
using that method light so if you are
giving a semicolon we just have to make
it abstract and we just have to make
this class of swabs abstract I soon as
the concept of abstract classes we can
achieve abstraction using abstract
classes but there is one little problem
with abstract classes I mean classes you
cannot go from multiple inheritance so
instead of abstract class we can create
we can make this as interface and we
don't require these two methods or two
things here so now in this cat and dog
issue of saying extends we have to say
implements and even here we have to say
intimates make sense everyone
so that is the true power of interfaces
so there is one method which takes dog
and cat both because they belong the
same interface okay just remove at this
point because when you go for the
collection API this is very important
okay so I met cause any questions
abstract class will work here but let's
say if you want to go for multiple
inheritance then after class will not
work right because we cannot achieve
multiple in items with the other classes
yeah here it would have worked I
interface I mean we can use abstract
class here but since I just wanted to
prove a they give the idea about
interfaces that's why we went for
interfaces because it has one extra
features compared to abstract class
right okay now everything is walking
good we got cat and she got dog but
let's say in future animal got a new
feature because we as human we are doing
lots of we have we are going insane
right we are hurting animals now we are
hitting them so let's say in future we
could be how we want animals to have a
new power so they should be able to
shoot a human right so because of that
clarity yeah exactly animal experiment
we are cutting them so let's say we got
a new method in future so animal can
shoot humans but the problem is since we
cannot we should not change the
interfaces right because if you change
it it will affect your classes you have
to implement that method also right so
till java 1.7 it is it was not allowed
in fact it was allowed but it is not
recommended that you should create you
should update your interface so that's
not that should not be the case in java
7 but in java 8 we can actually define a
method so let's say if we don't want to
declare it we can actually do we can
actually define it so we can say default
so we can define methods and interface
using default keyboard and we can say
what then human will say out how to
write ouch ouch ouch right and then from
the house we can in fact human also any
was right so we'll say should right now
we don't have to implement that method
because that's the power of Java 8 we
can actually we can directly call those
methods we can say out out out because
they are shooting us okay don't imagine
the DL gun imagine the plastic guns you
know those the plastic bullets and it
hurts you know when you when you shoot
it from a short distance it will hurt oh
oh oh sorry we are we just made a
spelling mistake here it should be shoot
sorry for that shoot
yeah exactly so now everything
everything looks good write any code any
questions here Amit what are those
reactions are okay anyone any questions
I know those are emojis okay so animal
is the interface in which you can
actually define methods
yeah so no no question is right
why animals means didn't get you
am I writing wrong spellings today
and get your questions are on
it's just that animal makes sounds and
they all they can also shoot us in
future so that's why shoot it's just I
want you to describe this default method
I mean we can define methods interface
okay so everything seems good right so
there's no question here right so let's
go for the next concept which is re okay
so we know the count basic concept of
added aight let me go for a classier
will say this class as demo and it
because we are going for the definition
or the basic concept of added so let's
say in this we have a main function
which is public static void main and
will say this is spring arguments okay
so you want to see the new noise class
Goddess Shri this is the class that's
nice
it's no ice that's
any questions are just real
ok
we can use
yes I have covered the topic abstract
class and interface both but the example
which is ended here it was of interface
so let's go for the so this video will
be uploaded on YouTube in one art ok so
if you can just you know you cannot gain
the cap default session ok so there's no
taller with the communication right I
guess I got a message from ravi that
there's a this venetian lost
okay so I multiple guys
okay so let me just get back to this
demo adding so normally how do we create
added so anyway you want to have a
collection of elements we can create an
alley right so we can say int values
again there is a problem
okay so I'm just talking about the addy
just let me adjust links in text about
this so this is how you can add it right
so let's say if I have four elements
here so we can create a link added we
can say int values equal to new int and
we can specify the size of the eruv it
is for right so we can have four
elements here okay what about those are
you facing any problem yet okay so now
we can just assign the value so normally
when I talk about a day so just imagine
this is block of values so this is how
it looks like so it start with a block
we can have four values let's say for
the sex I mean four five six two so we
have generators talking about added so
let's say we have this four values here
so how to assign these values there are
multiple ways of doing this the first
way is don't specify the size drag to
specify the values we can give our curly
brackets at the end of the square
bracket or curly brackets on you can
specify the value four five six and two
so that's one way okay so if you're
going in this way if we approve if you
are creating an array in this way how to
print the values so we can print the
values in such a way like we can use a
for loop in fact without further if we
can clean the values so let's say if I
just print the values I'm not printing
any element I'm just saying values and
if I run this you can see we got
something and this something is in hash
code so whenever you try to because in
Java a days are objects right so
whenever went try to print the object
will give you hash code but let's I
don't want to get the hash where I want
to get the value so we can say values of
zero it will give you four if I won this
regard for if I say values of three it
will give us the last element which is
to write but that's how it works who
start with 0 and it its end that the it
ends at three so it is 0-1
then two and then three right ok so now
once we go out these three values I mean
I think once we got the four values
unless I want to print all the values so
we have to write for statements Lloyd
one statement will print the zeroth
element second will plain index of one
index of two index of 3 and X and it
goes on right in sure of that we can use
a for loop so this father will start
with zero because normally in a day
index numbers start with zero will say I
less than equal to 4 i'm less than 4
which is equal to Maine which is less
than equal to three and i plus plus and
we can give or curly brackets there
ensure three we can say I ok
now if i run this code will be getting
all the values right which is four five
six two but now what next so this is one
way of covering the element the second
way is you don't have to even write this
stuff we can thank you write the cullet
we can write data reference and assign
the values in using this array single
and if you run this and we call the
output so this is the second way of
doing it the third way is just specify
this size and you can add the elements
later now how to add element data we can
say we can again assign a for loop but
how was I defined there's a question
from Sarang this is the guy right this
is I here in for loop okay let's get
back to this so how to assign value so
we can say values of 0 is equal to four
and then values of one is five values of
sixes and then list goes on right so we
can assign values in that way I think
the best way is I mean when you once you
know the value of this is I think this
is the best way to do it right
so now so now let's so this is one way
the second way is using enhanced for
loop the problem is here we know the
values right we know the starting point
we know the ending value then why to
traverse by ourselves what we can do is
we can just come in this section I don't
like this okay I mean other we are you
serious we want to answer this code you
want me to answer this question why this
index number start with 0 okay just we
want to secure the number of bits
required to represent number Saudi so
array start with 0 because the computer
the computer addressing starts with 0 so
the basics of computers the addressing
starts with 0 now why they start with 0
because to represent any number if you
start with 0 it may need one less extra
it may lead one bit less example you're
going to represent our number if it will
represent eight numbers and if you start
with one the number on the eighth
element which will be eight right which
is one triple zero so it will it will
occupy four bits be sure of that if you
start with zero your number will end at
seven so that will be only three bits so
you are saving one extra bed okay so now
let me just create so add a creation
down what next
so let's say what next we can do here is
we can use enhanced for loop to print
this so how do is enhance further we can
say for loop and we can say 8i I mean
let's not I let say inch number num
colon values the advantage will be from
this values which is an a day 11 value
will come out and it was stored in num
so initially for will come out and it
will store it inside num then five will
come out and it will store inside now
and then once you've got those values
you can just print it so when you are
getting the value just keep printing it
and if you run this we got the same
output right so if you can see the
difference in this you're counting the
values here you are not counting the
valuation there you are just fetching
the values and then since the value is
coming out you're just printing it so
that's the advantage of using enhanced
for loop okay
that's good yes using announce partner
we can print all the elements that is
the only drawback you cannot print
specific values okay so that's your the
enhanced for loop what next
okay just hold on
do dat yeah so let's talk about to the
LA now so in this story and I let's say
we have two a days one with one added in
second added so sure that we can have
both the address in one big added so
what we can do is we can specify the two
brackets there and that's an added aight
so we can enclose in one more package
and we can give a comma and we can have
more values we can say six from our
three cops 3 comma 4 comma 6 right and
then so this is your two-dimensional
adding ok so let's print this values how
would you print it let me just add one
more added it's free right we can have
multiple errors here now how to print
because if you use enhanced for loop
here you will get one at a time so this
is the this is one element see for this
array so for the internal array for is
an element right five is the element six
is the element for this array food is
the element I mean 6-3 4-6 xelement and
for this a day 7 4 3 2 is the element
right but for the outer array one a day
one in internal array is an element so
for the outer array we have three
elements one element second element I'm
in this second element and this is
internet third element so once you will
get the whole array and then we can use
one more for loop to press the values
from that particular array we can say 4
inch or we can say n colon numbs because
we are fetching the values from the
array and then we can just print em here
that's not numbs but now so that's how
you use two dimensional array we can
record all the values but definitely the
new line right we can actually print at
in tabular format if you remove / in
here I'm in the new line and you provide
the new line there you can see we got
Ian tabular format
then we can also have Jack daddys so if
you remove this tree here so this drag
the other night because the number of
those are fixed but column is keep
changing so that's Jack daddy
so in the first a day we have for them
in the second derivative just we just
have three elements so the number of
elements are not fixed so that's why
it's called a jag adding okay okay now
what next so we talked about Jack Eddie
what next we can do here okay let me go
for a question let me remove this stuff
let's say i have a class called as
students a week let me get a class for
the student and this class student we
have two variables one is roll number
and one we have is named so that's as
mean and in this I want to get one
student object so what were to do so we
have to say student s equal to a new
student right so that's a great object
yes or no
right now let's I don't want one student
i want for students so what have to do
so they have to create four objects
why'd we have to say s1 then we have to
say s2 s3 s4 for that would be a mobile
cities right so instead of creating for
objects can we have an array of students
I mean can we have array of objects
let's try so we can say this is students
s and instead of giving a round bracket
we can provide a square bracket so we
have to say this is not a normal objects
in LA and the addy is of four elements
okay so can I can access the first
student so can I say s op 0 dot roll
number is equal to 7 will it work if i
if i run this call will it work ok let's
try so people are saying yes and the
answer is no we got nullpointerexception
the problem is this a day here this is
not the object this is not the array of
object this is the added of references
we have not created the object yet
because we can create the object only
knows what else are we can create the
object only with the constructor white
and where is the constructor
so what would you do is so before using
the object we have to say SF 0 equal to
new student so we have to create all
this objects so we have to say SF 1
equal to student and same goes for s 3
and s 2 and s 3 now we got actually for
students so whenever you create the
array of objects I mean the array of
references you have to provide the
objects here ok
ok so now if I done this it will work it
will accept the value it will not print
because there's no other way we have to
do in that way only so we can say a sub
0 dot roll number and I from this record
the value as seven simple that this is
one with is one more way I don't know if
it will work we can provide the dynamic
Arabic and say new student so the first
object is new student the second object
is new student and the third object is
neo student so that's a that's one way
you can do ok we got three object this
is like providing the values imagine
this is one value this is second value
ok so if you want to if you want to go
for a hundred objects that's very easy
you can take a for loop you can start
with zero I less than 100 and I plus
plus
so we can say s of x of i equal to new
student and we got hundred objects here
and if you print the length of this eric
how to print the length we can say s dot
length it's just we just have to provide
the size that's hundred and learn we got
and we actually got hundred objects
there now we cannot do s not add because
as in s.s is then added is not a
collection here so when you go for
collection we can go for add omit this
this is for you
okay so that's it patterns will do next
time that's it I guess so I've talked
about interfaces abstract class and
Addie so that's it will stop it here
itself or that's one our session so i'll
be uploading this video in half an hour
maybe so if you want to recap not yet i
have not bought the geophone yet i'm
just using my home sing tonight that's
it then see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
