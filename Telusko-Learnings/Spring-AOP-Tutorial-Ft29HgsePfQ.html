ready and in this video we'll see an
example of spring AOP so before going
for AOP you have to make sure that you
know Spring Framework at least the
basics of it in in the last video which
i've uploaded there is a video of Spring
Framework so you will find the video in
the description area if you have not
seen that do watch it but if you already
know Spring Framework that's fine I will
explain the code to you and you're good
you're good to go so what I'm doing here
is I'm trying to use I have an alien
class here a very simple class in which
perhaps I have a method for college show
and I made this class as a component
because I want to make this as spring
beam and that's how we do it right we
simply right add component which will
make this class as a spring beam class
and so what I wanted is I wanted the
object of alien here so we got it object
here but instead of doing alien a1 equal
to new new alien not normally what
that's how we do it in Java right but
then since Spring Framework says we will
provide you the provide you with the
objects you don't have to make an object
by yourself we are doing this extra
thing this is the object of application
context which will help you to give the
which will which will help you with the
object you simply have to solve you seem
to have to call this method we just get
been bypassing the type of a class which
of which you want an object so we want
an object of alien so we will get we
will get the object now where I have
done the configuration for this so there
are multiple ways you can configure your
Spring Framework there are XML based
configuration we can use annotations or
we can totally go for Java based
configuration so I am using Java based
quantification here so as you can see I
have a class class app config in which
I'm not doing any configuration and I'm
asking Spring Framework to do everything
for me so just right at configuration
and add component scan and by mentioning
the package in which package you have
all the components it will do it for you
so as you can see I have a I have a main
method here in which I am creating
object of alien and then I'm calling
show this is what is normal spring code
example so before going for AOP again
let me just run this code just to show
you what we are expecting so if I sit on
this file
you can see we got the output and output
hello world it's that simple
but then why do we need a o P so let's
go to this alien here and think about
this if we talk about a method and this
will be your business method right
normally we don't write a method which
prints on the world right in real-life
scenario we write lots of codes example
let's say if you want to buy something
online or maybe if you want to create a
method for that maybe you want to
transfer money to someone maybe you want
to check the all the details about a
customer you want to check you want to
transfer all the assets from one's
department of the department so normally
you do all those things in a method
right now this method will have multiple
statements not like one statement here
it will have multiple statement let's
say it has 15 statements now 15
statements is something we using which
you can do all the tasks let's say you
are transferring money so all this thing
will be mentioned here now this 15
statements is actually your business
logic because as a developer our job is
to convince all a business problems
right so this is my business logic so
this is where I will write my business
logic so this 15 lines is business
business logic but what happens you know
with this logic we don't only write the
logic we also add some extra things
example whenever you call a method we
also maintain a log file right log file
will normally take two lines of code
maybe one lines up one line of code or
two lines of code so we we maintain a
log when you call a method and we also
maintain a log when you are done with
the execution so here also you will
write two lines of two lines of code for
log write again if you know about
different logging concept we can use
log4j or whatever logging concept you
use or maybe tracing so you normally do
that so in all the enterprise
application we do maintain a log file
when you call a method and when you done
with the method execution because it
will be helpful for you to debug your
application later let's say if you are
deployed your applications on a server
and something went wrong how would you
know what went wrong and that's where
log comes into picture right so you can
debug your application there now we
don't just write log files we also write
a security code when I say security code
I simply mean you know when you are
calling this method you want to make
sure that the users
logged in because I want to I want to
transfer money only when I'm logged into
the system so maybe while enough code
you will check for the secure you will
do some security stuff maybe one line of
code or four lines of code depend upon
which security feature you are using
right if you are using some API is you
can do it in one line if you're doing it
by yourself maybe if I do six lines
right so that's one thing you will write
now we also have to do the transactions
now whenever you work with databases or
if you work with J and D I maybe some
you have a database on some other server
and if you are using some framework so
normally what we do is we maintain the
transaction now what we do is before the
executing your business logic you have
to start the transaction because he of
course when you're transferring money
you are doing a transaction right in
that case you begin the transaction so
here here somewhere you will begin your
transaction right and then at the end
once you complete your business logic
you will end your transaction here so
this is where your transaction gets
dominated or maybe you can say commit
now this is where you will commit it
right okay now once you say begin and
commit so just see this it may be one
line of code name five lines of code you
never know right so it may be one line
of code here maybe five lines of code
the thing is if you are doing this code
I mean if you're writing your method you
have fifteen lines of code which is
actually a business logic and apart from
that you have so many lines of code
which is responsible just to have those
extra thing now think about this as a
developer you will be writing multiple
methods right and you will not write
just one method every method will have a
bit different is logic so when you say
business logic it will be different for
different methods but what about log log
code it will be same what about security
code it may be same whatever transaction
code it may be same right and that do as
a customer what you want is your
business logic right this is something
which you write as a programmer you
don't you don't ask your customer hey I
will be putting all these things right
and the second thing is as a developer
we want to see only business logic in
the method because if something goes
wrong you don't want to play with this
code right
and that's why what is recommended is
let's just imagine if you have 50 to 60
methods do you think is it logical to
write all these things in all the
methods people do that okay so when you
make the application we do that if we
don't have a choice but do we have a
solution for this don't you think we
should be making these things is a
common out somewhere I mean I will write
this stuff in some other cool and
something like this what I will do here
is I don't want to do all this stuff
here let me create another class I will
say this class is my I will call this
process anything I will say helper
helper class it simply say helper so we
got a class here I want in this class I
want all those things example log should
be maintained here so I will say hey you
are responsible to maintain a log you
can write whatever statement you want to
write here example I will say sister I
will say system dot out dot print and I
will say logged or maybe you can you can
say show call your maintain a log file
here again you can write multiple lines
of code that's not important here you
can write you can you can do whatever
you want
important is you have to make sure that
you separate your code so whatever extra
code you have which is not required in
the method you can separate it out and
you can keep that and you can keep that
in a separate method right so log is
done there we can also do it for
security so what you can do is you can
put another method which will maintain
the security and then what you will do
is instead of writing all the code here
you can't you have to call log right so
you will call log from here then you
will call security from here right and
then you will call transaction from here
so you will say begin transaction you
will say commit transaction so you can
do that all those stuff but don't you
think again you are following those
methods so anyway you have to get object
of helper you have to call log now what
if I say you don't have to write any of
this code I mean you don't have to write
any of this code here just write about
your business logic so inside your show
method there should only be business
logic you can create all those methods
here okay and you don't even have to
call them it will be called
automatically I know you will not
believe me here right
and that's why a opie comes into picture
now a o P stands for it is
aspect-oriented programming which simply
means that you have to create you have
to think is a different you have to
think in a different way
normally in Java we could use
object-oriented programming where
everything is an object for us so I'm
not saying you have to replace oo p with
a o p but then a o p is a supplement for
AOP which simply means that it supports
Oh P so what we are doing is we are
getting a separate class and this class
for us will it will be called as aspect
in fact we can also use an annotation
here so we can simply say aspect and
this class becomes an aspect for us so
this aspect aspect will have all the
methods which will act as okay so we
have a special name for those things so
example we have log we have transaction
we have security all these things are
actually called as okay there are lots
of jargon CL okay so be with me it is
also called as cross-cutting concerns
because these are this is something you
can take it common right so we have all
the cross-cutting concerns and you will
keep that in an aspect so whatever
cross-cutting concerns you have you can
keep that in an aspect so you can see I
am getting a class here called as helper
and for me this class is a aspect and
you can simply write add aspect there oh
but if I do that if I say control space
if I try to input the package you can
see it is not working now the only thing
is if you want to use spring AOP you
have to download the java files enough
goes right with nude frameworks you have
to download new java files now if you
remember in spring framework we used to
work with normal java files right so
whatever Spring Framework required if
you if you observe we also have AOP here
so it should work but then spring AOP is
actually depend upon some other Java
files so for that you have to download
those Java files here now from where you
will get it technically you have to go
to Google and if not you have to
download those Java files provided you
know the Java file names cuz I hate most
most of them II don't even remember
those Java file names so what I did is I
have downloaded the Java files for you
and introduced Christmas description
area you will find a link where you will
find all the Java files
just to show you where it is in my
machine if I open desktop you can see
ignore all the other things you can see
we have ok ways that we have AOP in this
AOP folder I have this three files this
three Java files is something required
okay
only if you have only this I mean if you
have this files only it will work then
so what I'm going to do is I will go
back to my NetBeans and here let me just
add those Java files so how do you add
that so right click I can depend upon
which IDE you're working with steps may
change so I will go to properties and
here I will go to library and I will say
add and here I will say a Obi and I will
select all the Java files click on open
and ok so you can see we got our Java
files in this if I expand the library
folder here you can see we got ways that
if I scroll down you can see we got this
three Java files and that's it now say
control space and you can see it will
import the package for you our job is
done right we are importing a package
that's great ok now I will go back here
so that we got we are done with the
aspect now what else required here now
the another thing we require is how how
will it will call so will it be called
automatically
let's try so what I will do is I will go
back to smile spring demo let's run this
code and you can see it prints hello
world
that's fine HelloWorld is called because
we are we are calling this alien show
right does it that is why hello world is
spending but it is not printing show
called that means the aspect is not
working this is not getting called
object automatically now we have to
remember some more terms the some more
terms which is one of them is called as
advice notice advice advice is what so
you have to answer what so when you Paul
show what should be called
so what I want what I want is when I
call show method of alien when I call
show method of alien I want to call this
this log method so this is my advice
here and to make it an advice you have
to use the type of advices there are
different type of advices example you
can guess it I mean one is before you
can guess the next one which is after
your right eye interact there are five
five things will only discuss about this
too we have before and after before
is this log will be called before
calling show and if you say after it
this log will be called after padding
show this time I want to go for before
so I will say before control space and
you can say record the package this is
how you define advise so you will call
log before calling the show method and
that's what we are doing here but it is
giving you an error now before say say I
will be getting called but when how
would your log knows when to pop when to
call when to be called because there are
multiple methods right let's say if
you're writing our application you might
have 10 methods and you don't want to
call log with all the methods so you can
mention here in this in this round
brackets when you have to Eve anyone to
do it so you can write in English use
you can say whenever whenever show
method is called so you can write in
English whenever I show me that get
called but that will not work right I
just does normal English so what you
have to provide is you have to read okay
there's one more jargon here and that is
point good I know I hope is very simple
only problem is with the with the jargon
Co technical terms
so your point cut is something where
which defines when or where so at what
point you want to call this so where you
want to call this so I want to call log
where when you execute so that that's
how I write it so you have to say
execution of so the execution of the
method which is public void show so
anybody call show method I want this to
be called I start is that easy let's go
back to my spring demo and run oh it's
still not working you can see we still
got hello world no one is not working
because you are working with spring
framework and spring framework says if
you are using a notation based
configuration you have to use one mode
annotation which is add component see
spring is all about annotation side we
have to remember so many rotations here
so you have to mention this class is
also an annotation ok aspect is also
annotation now let's run this and oh
it's still not working you can see it is
still not printing show it's still not
printing show called it's because by
default aspect a o P is not a neighbor
in your system okay so in your
application you have to make sure that
you enable AOP and how do we do that so
one more intuition I promise this is the
last one I know that I'm coming with
lots of annotations so this is an able
aspect J or top tocsy and this is how
you do it so you simply write a
annotation which is enable aspectj Auto
proxy now I think it will work let's go
back to these spring they're more let's
run this code and can see that it worked
we got show called
right and that's the beauty about spring
AOP and if you if you observe in my
alien you know this engine is so in no
scientist doesn't even know that you
have a helper class who is doing the log
maintenance for you right and in future
if you want to debug something you just
have to debug this one right you don't
have to touch the helper class and
that's the beauty about AOP so this is
simplest example for the AOP again
they're not something in LP which we'll
discuss later time bin you can you can
try this example it should work and let
me know your thoughts in the comment
section if you have any issues so that's
it from this video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
