of java we have talked about arrays and
objects static keyword and all the stuff
now let's move towards the oops concept
so when you say oops it provides you
lots of features so I need to write you
inheritance abstraction data hiding and
capsulation so we start with the first
one which is in height in seer so we
talk about inheritance what exactly it
means is again we can go for some
complex example but I believe in making
thing or keep it simple right
what we'll do is we take a simple
example again which is very typical
example when talking about inheritance
we'll go for the same example here and
that is to create a calculator so what
we'll do is we create a class first
calculator okay so that's our class here
and in this class I want to perform some
operations and the only operation I want
to perform here is let's addition of two
numbers so what I will do I will say
public which returns int the method name
is add which takes parameter which is I
and the second parameter which is J it
returns I plus J quite simple right so
we got this calculator class here and
now let's create the object of it now
how do we get object of calculator we
simply say calculator we'll say this is
c1 equal to new calculator now what I
will do is I will simply create a
variable here I will say this is Inc
result equal to c1 dot add and if I pass
two values if I pass four five and four
and if I print the output here it will
print result so if I on this code we are
getting the output which we are
expecting here and that's our output
which is nine so this is one class white
so let's imagine in future in future if
let's say if I am creating this object
of calculator and and then I'm giving
this calculator object to my customer as
I develop I am giving this object to a
customer customer is very happy because
this character can perform one operation
and this code let's say this code code
belongs to some other class some other
file now in that scenario if this class
belongs some other file and let's say as
a developer you have deleted this file I
only have the class file I mean okay let
let me just let me just make it simple
let's say if a user comes to me and
okay I want one more feature now I want
this calculator to select also not just
add it it also wants to subtract it
I mean subtract two values but the
problem is due to some problem you
cannot make some changes here because we
don't have the source code of calculator
imagine imagine you don't have the
source code for calculator now what you
will do but you have the class file what
is class file so when you combine your
Java code you get the class files right
so let's imagine you don't have this
source code that means you don't have
the Java file but you have a class file
so what you can do is you can create one
more class in that scenario will name
this class as calculator advanced so
this is advanced Calcutta which should
have two features again since you are
creating a new class we need to define
that ad with a once again right so we'll
say public in fact when you want to
define it let's just copy paste copy and
paste I mean in real life we will you
will type it because it don't have the
source code and again you will paste it
but this time this should be sub and
this should be subtraction all right so
now we got a new class which has two
features one is addition and subtraction
so from your main method in shop hitting
object of calculator will create object
of calc advance so here we'll say result
one is the addition and we say end
result to is it will be subtraction now
so since we have the new class we can
perform the subtraction operation also
and let's print a result one and let's
print result two now this will be
resolved too so now if we run this code
it will work right because we have a new
class all together which has two methods
but hold on you already have the class
file off of calculator right can I use
this ad in this class why to write the
same code two times this is redundancy
right we are ripping the codes so will
not repeat the code will simply fetch
that feature will simply fetch this
feature of add in this class now how do
we fetch a feature by using the concept
of inheritance so we'll simply say
extends calculator now in this scenario
this class becomes a super class and
this class which is calc
advanced is called as surplus so
superclass will have only one method
called as ad but subclass will have to
methods one from this class itself which
is advanced calc and one method will be
coming from calculator so this is super
and this is sub so we got a superclass
and we got a surplus and now even if you
run this code now you can see it still
works we are getting this subtract
method from advanced calc itself but we
are getting this add method from
calculator okay it is that simple that's
how you use inheritance this is
basically a single level in items
because we have only one levels right so
this is your super and this is your sub
we can use some more terms in shops
simply saying super sub we can also say
this is a peasant class and then and
that scenario this becomes a child class
we can also say this is as a base class
so if this is a base class now this will
be called as or did I plus so in Java we
use a term colors event super and sub in
in the concept of oops we use parent and
child in the concept of seep of C++ we
use base and derive so in Java will be
using super and sir will not use this
two keywords but you can say that I mean
no one will kill you if you mention
parent and child
it's just that in Java we use super and
sub so that's how you create a single
level inheritance now we can also
achieve a multi-level inheritance here
now how to do that let's let me do it
one more calculator here we'll say this
is calc very advanced calculator okay
which will have which will have three
features the addition the subtraction
and one more thing which is
multiplication so ensure of creating
three methods here I will simply create
one methodology which is multi which
takes two parameters int I comma int J
and it returns I into J okay and I want
this class to extends calculator I mean
the Advanced calculator that's it
because if this class extends Advanced
calculator advanced capita extends
calculator so this class will have all
the features of advanced I mean as and
sub so if you imagine this is our
grandfather this is a father and this is
a child okay and now I'll show creating
object of cows we can create object of
advanced variation calc very advanced
and we can
call three methods here so the pay
streak this is result three and this
will be multi let us say this is 2 &amp;amp; 3
and let's also paint the third result so
we have achieved a mighty level in
height in Co so we have this first level
so if you talk about these two classes
this is first level in it is a single
level in heightens if you talk about all
these classes this is again this is
multi level but if we talk about only
this two this is again single okay
because we are talking about this - only
that is single
this - single and all this three there
are multi level so in Java we can
achieve single level inheritance we can
achieve multi-level inheritance but how
about multiple because if we talk about
oops concept it also provides you
multiple inheritance but unfortunately
Java doesn't support multiple
inheritance
why exactly doesn't support multiple
inheritance that we'll see in the next
video but time we remember we we we work
with inheritance like this again in
heightens has two things one is there
are two relationship in itens just to
let you know this is called as is a and
has a now what it means whenever you
have a class which extends another class
it is called as easy and whenever you
have a class which in which you are
creating the object of another class it
is called as has a example in heightens
demo can access the features of add
because we are creating the object of
calc very advanced I'm saying that in
this class I have the object so when I
say I has I have so that is has a
relationship and when you extend that is
easy example when you talk about dog is
dog is an animal so dog extends animal
but when you talk about a bathroom so
bathroom has it has a tub right so
that's a two difference I need in a
chance we have okay but time remember
only easy so yeah that's it that's about
inheritance single level and multi level
or in the next video we'll see why Java
doesn't support multiple inheritance
