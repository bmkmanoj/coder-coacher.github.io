ready from those four learnings and
today we'll talk about hql which is
which stands for hibernate query
language now why we need this concept
when you have when you can use the
methods like get when you can use method
like save update so if you can use all
these methods to change the data in your
database why you need another language
okay just think about it now when we use
our method called as save what we do we
save the object to a database when we
use update we normally use we change the
gate again with the help of objects but
when we use something called us get what
we specify is the class name and the
primary key right so let's say if you
want our object which is the fifth row
of your table we will be using a get
method and again we have to specify the
primary key right but what if you don't
want a simple row you want some you want
to work with multiple tables maybe you
want to fetch not the entire deck watch
was some specific records I don't want
to have the entire record I don't want
to get the entire row I want to get only
one rule how do that for this you need
hql now you might be thinking about ok
we have to learn another language now or
not exactly if you know SQL SQL is very
very easy
how provided you know SQL ok if you
don't know SQL then there is something
called as learning curve but if you know
SQL if you know what is the next star
from table if you know it is select row
number from student if you know where
clause you are good to go so in hql what
we change so first of all in SQL what we
mentioned is so let's say if I if I use
this query the above query here which is
select the number from student now this
roll number is a polymer and student is
a table name in SQL right in hql what if
dimension is you have to mention select
then you have to mention roll number but
this roller is not a column name it's a
variable name or the field in your class
or the property in your class and then
you have to mention the class name not a
table name but the class name and that's
why you can say this is student in small
as this is student with capital
right so I have to mention the class
name not the table name that's that's
something have to remember this is a
skill and this is SQL almost same right
so that is exciting you know you have to
you can go you can learn a new language
or SQL if you know SQL you can learn SQL
if you know SQL right now now what
what's new in that I mean can we do some
extra stuff and yes so let's say if you
want to fetch the entire table what you
do in SQL is you say select star from
table name in case of hql you can simply
mention from table you don't have I mean
from class name we do not to mention the
Select query because it is something
which is obvious right when you say
select star you want the entire table
then why not go with this instead of
saying select you can simply mention
from class name it will fetch the entire
table for you right okay can we do join
see yes of course instead of using to
ensure of using to table name you have
to use two class names can be used group
I of course can be used order by of
course everything is possible again how
to do those things that we'll see in the
in the practical session but it is
possible to use all those things which
we do in SQL in SQL as well okay now
there's one last thing which I have to
point Q here so if you talk about SQL
let's say if you are working with Java
and database and you are using JDBC now
if you remember we used to use these all
set so when you father query you get the
data in result set and then what you do
is you apply those weird while loops and
then you try to fetch the data in case
of hql you get so when you file a query
you get the list of objects which means
you can fetch all the information with
the help of enhance for load it's that
simple
okay so xql is simpler than SQL okay can
be used okay can we use SQL in hibernate
and yes we can also do that so there is
something called as native query so if
you want to use SQL NH in hibernate
instead of using SQL we can do that okay
with the help of native queries how to
do that that will see in the petiole
session so I hope you liked this video
