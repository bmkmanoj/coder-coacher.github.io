in C programming many want to go for
flow control we have to use so we have
two things in V we have branching
statement and we have loops so we start
with branching statement and then move
will move towards loops now went about
branching statements so we can achieve
dancing with the help of if-else so
let's say you want to execute some you
want to check a given number is even odd
all so let's say we have a value which
is int I equal to or maybe let's say 6
so I want to check if the number is even
or odd well now why when I will go for
even out later let's say I want to check
if the given number is greater than 10
or not
so if 6 is greater than 10 or not so 6
is smaller than 10 right but how will
you check so to check something we'll
simply say if then you have to apply a
condition so in if we have to apply a
condition which is if I is less than
better than they will check I do them so
if I is greater than 10 if that is the
case so we'll execute this block so this
is the block which will be executed if
this is true every is false this will
not execute so if I ITER statement here
so I will say print F and let me print
yes obvious a greater simply okay so if
I print greater with simply means 6 is
greater than 10 okay but that's not the
case right so it will not print anything
so if I run this it will not print
anything simple but let's see if I
change the value from 6 to 16 so if I
make from 6 to 16 and if I run this you
can see the output is greater simple so
this if we'll check if the given
condition is true or false since 16 is
greater than 10 it will print it will
execute this block otherwise it will not
execute the block as we have seen for 6
so first things it will not execute the
block that's why we are printing nothing
but let's say we want to print some
we want to print if this is greater than
10 or if it is less than 10 we'll
execute something so that something will
be else so if not if then whaat so it is
else
so in else we can use a printf and we
can double course we can mention it's
smaller okay so and if I run this now so
it will print the else part I also want
it on newline so we'll say slash in and
slash in okay so if I run this code it
will print smaller so if this condition
is not true which is false it will
execute the else part okay so that's how
we achieve a branching statement using
if but let's say we want to have will
see bug it will see remaining in the
next tutorial yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
