career you need some skill set right so
if you want to get a good reviews if you
want to stay in your company don't you
don't want to get layoff from it from
the company you need some skill set
right so in this video we are going to
talk about those five important skill
set we should you should have to be a
good IT professional so welcome back
aliens and they will read different eyes
for learnings so let's get started so we
are going in descending order from five
to one and let's start with the fifth
one so now the fifth point so the fixed
point is how to learn now you might be
wondering mean we all know how to learn
right so we are learning from our
childhood in fact when you born you then
after that you know you have learned how
to walk you have learned how to talk how
to eat and then in your school also you
have learned different subjects in your
policy have learned different subjects
but then learning in your education
system is different from learning in IT
industry because in education system
there is someone to guide you right we
have you have teachers you have mentors
but the moment the moment you join a
company the learning is different and of
course right you have to learn in every
stage of your life maybe if you have
joined the company now so you if you're
a fresher they're not something you have
to learn but even after getting some
experience maybe after six years seven
years you have to make sure that you are
learning stuff don't stop learning but
then everyone knows that right you have
to learn but in question arise how to
learn now there are different ways of
learning right so there are some people
they love online resources there are
some people they love books there are
some people who need one-to-one training
and everything is good you know
everything is best depend up on people
so we all we all are different and
that's why we have a different way of
learning example if you ask me how I
learned so what I do is I learn from
online online resources maybe online
documentation maybe online online online
well I mean online websites where you
can learn example prolyl site udemy
YouTube there are different websites
right from where you can learn in fact
let's see if the technology is very old
normally I don't read old technologies I
don't know I have this problem okay I
cannot I cannot learn oil technologies
maybe there is a technology which
everyone knows I do
want to learn those technologies I don't
is there something wrong with me so I
always try to learn something new
example recently Google made and cotton
is the official language so I learned
quite length from well from the
documentation because we don't have good
books for that so again from where to
learn it's all depend upon you right so
you can learn from an online online
education system from online resources
documentation or you can read books
whatever whatever publication you prefer
or if you want to learn new technology
maybe like Big Data I do maybe if you
had to learn about data science data
deep learning you can buy books and you
can learn right so the different ways of
learning so there are some people who
also provide one-to-one training so if
you think that there's someone who know
the technology let's say you have to
learn about Big Data and there's someone
who are they know Big Data it's better
to have a one-to-one session I can that
with the costly but then that's fine
right if you are learning something new
it's worth an investment because they
took to be in the IT industry and if you
want to get does good ratings you have
to learn and you have to do some hard
work so make sure that you know how to
learn so learn how to learn first right
so there are lots of businesses online
just go and search for how to learn so
the fourth one is communication now you
have to be good at communications I'm
not saying you have to be great at it
you have to be good at it but in
question arise why you need
communication when you are from
technical field now you might be
thinking we know Java be no big data we
know data science we are technical
people but the thing is you are not
working alone you are working for a
company and when you are working in a
company there are lots of people around
you maybe thousands maybe hundreds to
ten people you have to interact with
them and the way you will interact is
you have to make sure that when you talk
to them this should be a connect right
and that's how that's where you have to
include improve your communication now
communication is not bounded to a
language okay it doesn't matter in which
language you like it maybe English maybe
your visual language it may be your
native language doesn't that's that's
fine you can use any language what
matters is the way you talk it's what
matters is the way you behave right so
you are what you what you say how you
listen and watch your world language
everything is combined to give that
effect
right and that's where you have to
improve your communication again you can
just go to youtube and search for how to
improve your communication there are
lots of tutorials available right so
implement those things right and it will
it will help you to improve your
communication now when I say
communication is not just about
communication we have two more modules
here the second one is networking and
the third one is public speaking now you
might be wondering why networking is
important now see all the opportunities
which comes to your gums in your life
will be coming just because of
networking okay I'm not a hundred
percent but then ninety percent upon
changes which which you will be getting
in future will be based on the
networking or the strong network you
have so you have to connect with people
now the way you can connect with people
is by interacting with them and that in
fact there are lots of psychological
psychological tricks you can apply to
network with people I remember one
example so I visited one dentist one day
and then so I was knowing that person
from a long time not by but not by
talking but then having that a smile
thing every day way when you should see
because our our offices were nearby so
when I visited him we just had a talk
for five minutes and then at the end he
asked me you know what you do I said
okay I'm a corporate trainer now he was
having some clients I don't know he was
having the client or not but then he
said he was having some clients who are
from the corporate industry they provide
corporate training so I'm a corporate
trainer so there was a there was a so I
mean those people will be help to me
right so the way he given that example I
got connected to connected with him
because I thought this guy is I mean
this guy is useful to me right he can
help me in future so the way that's does
that that's the way I connected with
connected with him and then after that
time I have given him some more clients
you know I have some friends and then I
said okay that dentists is good right so
that's how you can you can connect with
the people you have to improve your
networking next thing is the public
speaking now when we talk about public
speaking it's all it's about you have a
public in front of you and you have to
interact with them now it can be one
person it can be ten people in the
conference room it can be hundred people
or it can be thousand people right you
have to be have to know how to talk in
front
of them right it's your body language
it's about the way you talk it's about
how you use your stage and all those
things now you might be wondering will I
ever be presenting on stage now see as a
corporate winner I get lots of
opportunity to prepare to present on
stage to present and fit in front of
thousand people in fact I am doing a
video now so this is also a public
speaking but then I'm facing only a
camera here so I can see that lens there
I'm talking to the talking to it but I
can imagine you know that thousands of
people sitting inside the lens right so
you have to so when you want to present
on stage you have to improve that skill
so it is not a skill set which we'll
come to in one day but again the
question is will you present anything on
stage in your life everyone gets that
opportunity most of them they ignore it
but then some people they do grab it but
in the confidence from itself if let's
say your boss says hey here Pradeep or
Sandeep just come on stage and present
now in this case if you don't know how
to talk in public you will get nervous
that's your one of the biggest
opportunity which you have now we have
to talk in front of delegates but then
you are nervous right and you lost your
opportunity see opportunity will talk we
will knock your door every time the only
thing is we should be ready to accept it
so improve your public speaking as well
so three things communication networking
and public speaking now the third skill
it might sound weird but in third skill
is domain knowledge you should be very
good with your domain knowledge like
example let's say if you are working for
a company which deals with insurance so
you should have insurance knowledge also
again I know you are coming from
technical background maybe I have done
your engineering maybe I've done your
masters the thing is if you are working
for a company and their main job is to
work for the insurance you have to know
everything about insurance if you are
working for banking industry you should
know everything about banks at least the
domain which of the product which you
are working on you should be knowing
about travel so let's say if you are
working for travel agency you should
know how everything works there now you
might be thinking this is obvious right
everyone knows about their domain that's
not the case not everyone knows about
domain what I do is even if you are
working for a company this there are
people they avoid is such knowledge the
specific geek people you know when you
when you talk to some geek people they
are very much what you say a bind it
with the technology they say ok my main
job here is to provide security my main
job here is to create the design I am
NOT concerned about the domain part but
that's not the case when you're working
for a company and when your client is
specific to domains with a specific
domain width may be insurance or oils so
you should know how they work because
that's how you will get your promotions
because somewhere you have to interact
with the client right you have to
interact with the client you have to
interact with your boss based on the
project and you can give your two cents
on the project only when you know what
you are building on example let's say if
you're working on maybe you've got a new
project in the company and that new
project deals with insurance now again
insurance understanding insurance domain
is damn difficult ok one of my friend is
working for insurance domain and then
you know when I talk to him he's very
good with insurance now because he had
done this I've done the certification he
wanted to get the complete disk of it
when he was talking to me about
insurance I was like ok ok but then the
the the topic changed to technology and
then I was like ok so now let's talk so
so you have to be very very good with
the domain knowledge as well so so we
have talked we have talked about the
Third Point which is you should be good
with your domain knowledge ok once again
not the entire stuff but the basics are
important of domain knowledge so nice
skill is you guessed it right it is your
technical skill so when you talk about
the second number this is your technical
skills now of course right you might be
waiting for this from a long time so we
have talked about 5th 4th 3rd and 2nd
now and second one we have technical
skill that means the one is bit
different right and you might be
expecting technical skills will be the
most important thing right but then this
is second last skill so technical is
important of course right so if you are
in IT industry and if you are doing some
specific topics example if you are a
tester you should be you should be
knowing how to test an application you
should know different frameworks using
which you can test application I'm not
saying you should know every framework
but then the framework which you are
working example maybe if you are using
selenium you should know selenium from
start to end if you are working on maybe
some other 2
for testing you should know that tool
from start to end if you are working as
a programmer and maybe if you are using
a spring framework so again it is not
composite to know everything in spring
but then you should know enough to build
the application see normally what
happens is most of the time as a
programmer you copy code from Internet
okay that's that's fine okay you you
search for the modules let's say you
want to do this you will go to google
and you will search okay how to do this
and maybe if you are going if you are
facing some issues and when you go to
stack overflow they will give you a
solution you need to understand that the
problem is is not just copy paste engage
you have to also understand what you are
copying and where you're pasting it
because the more code you copy from
somewhere the more bugs you're
introducing in your software right so
you you need to have the good technical
skills so depend upon your domain if you
I mean depend upon your work maybe if
you are a tester you should be good with
testing if you're a programmer should be
good use programming whatever technology
you're working with if you are a hacker
you should be very good hacker not just
a hacker you have to be a hacker you
should know how to how to use different
tools available for hacking how to how
to crack some codes and all those things
right so depend upon what you are doing
you should be having good knowledge
about that now question arise which is
the betting based technology when it
comes to programming which is the best
hacking tool what is what is the path
for doing that this is not the video
about that this is the video what you
have to improve right so yeah so when I
say technical skills it comes on number
two so depend upon yours depend upon
your work depend upon your career you
have to change or you have to improve
that specific stuff and you have to make
sure that you are being the best in
whatever you do so if you are a tester
you should be the number of what number
one tester in your company if you are a
programmer you should be the number one
programmer in the company and if you are
maybe a support guy you should be the
top supporter or you should be tech top
tech guy in your company so always try
to be the best I'm not saying you have
to you know you have to defame others
it's just that you have to give you a
hundred percent maybe you are not doing
you're not beating people there but
that's fine you're not here to compete
with people you are here to improve
yourself deal
so work on your skills and be your best
so give you hundred-person
and that's how you can improve your
technical skills and anyway telesco
learning is there to work mode on your
technical skills now the most important
skill you need in your career now I will
not tell you now but then think about it
when you go for the interview the first
round is the technical round by all the
aptitude round
now as to always used to wonder why this
company they go for aptitude wrong we
are taking a people right why they ask
you if you have a train so train is
coming from this and this station it
goes to the another station what is the
time limit I mean at what time this do
train will meet again you might you
might have seen that those questions
right and I used to always hate those
questions but later I realized those
questions are to check your analytical
skills right so analytical skills is
very very important right we can also
call them as problem-solving skills so
like example if you give me a problem
what I will do is I will first of all as
I try to understand the problem and then
I should be able to solve it not at the
same time but it will take some time but
then ultimately you should be you should
be good at problem-solving I have seen
many people they are damn good good oh
right so they can write any software
provided they know the they know how to
do it what if you don't know how to
break a particular model example when
you talk about this no simple course
like palindrome factorial prime number
those are damage' to work with the
moment you go for let's say student
relation from bank account everyone
knows how Bank works what everyone knows
how library works but let's imagine if
you are building a complex software
you're working for maybe I can let me go
with the insurance company because I
don't know I have that fear of insurance
now so let's say if you are working for
an insurance company and you got a
problem statement you should be able to
solve that so let's say if your client
says hey we are going for this new
scheme or this new new new policy we
have I want you to change yourself a
base on this policy now if you don't
know how to convert that column into a
solution which can be cook which can be
coded you are not a good problem solver
right so to get a good success in your
life you should know how to
solve a given problem so more than your
coding knowledge your problem-solving
knowledge is more important so if you
want to be a good programmer if you want
to be a good professional you should be
good at problem-solving it's not only
for programmers even if you are in any
field doesn't matter if you're in tech
support if you are in a database world
if you are in big data world if your
data warehouse wall doesn't matter what
matters is everywhere your
problem-solving skills is very important
so if you want to improve your skill I
would recommend you to enhance your
problem-solving skills now let's go for
a quick recap so the first skill so
let's say from today you want to improve
your skill the first skill you should
improve is your analytical skills the
problem-solving skills the second one
you have to improve is your technical
skill okay
whichever domain yoga I mean whichever
technology are working with the next
thing is you have to improve your domain
knowledge so whatever domain you're
working well maybe again insurance oil
industry maybe travel industry you have
to improve your knowledge based on that
the fourth one is communication you have
to make sure that you're good with
communication again I'm not saying you
have to be great at that by the great
getness will will a good thing but then
you should be good at communication at
least the basic communication you should
not be like okay I don't know how to
talk I don't know how to behave so that
should not be the case right it doesn't
matter how good you are in technical
world how good you are with problem
solving if you cannot communicate the
people because you cannot build a
project by alone right so you have to
you have to take help you have to take
help from your teammate you have to
communication communicate with them
because there will be one big software
which will be built by all these people
right so you have to make sure that you
are also improving your communication
now the fifth one is how to learn right
so due to all these things important
thing is you should know how to learn so
let's say if you get a new technology
now if you are if you got a new thing
you should be learning that in a week
and to know to do to complete something
in a week you should learn how to learn
so that's it I hope you enjoyed this
video and I hope you like this video and
do share with your friends thank you so
