will talk about palindrome number now if
we talk about any programming language
let it be C C++ or Java or ASP you have
to deal with number of examples right to
understand how programming works you
need to go for some examples so normally
starts with even odd then we go for a
factorial then we come across something
one less well in room now see to
understand this palindrome we have to
understand how it works see the basic
problem is not to not to cool the
problem is what the exact logic to solve
that particular problem and the problem
means you have to find a palindrome
number so that will be like suppose
you're given a number so 1 2 3 you have
to check the given number is a pendulum
or not right then we have a concept of
amstrong also the delivery thing about a
palindrome now let's suppose a you have
a number 1 2 3
so palindrome simply means you have to
reverse this number so once you get the
reverse number it will be 2 3 2 1 you
have to check both this number are same
or not so 1 2 3 should be equal to 3 2 1
right now are the same no so we can say
they are not palindrome if you have a
number called as 1 to 1 and we say if
you if you get it was not 1 to 1 you
will get again 1 to 1 so that means this
is a palindrome number because of input
and outputs are same Saporito input is
different output is different not a
palindrome right so first type we have
to go for is reverse so first you have
to reverse a number so let's go for the
logic of reverse now to understand how
the voice works thing in this way let's
suppose you have a number again 1 2 3 ok
now once you get this number 1 2 3
excuse me I think we have some work done
so we have a number 1 - Z nice work now
if we talk about this number 1 2 3 you
have to break down these numbers so
first you have to isolate 3 so that you
will get 3 so once you get 3 then you
have to increase the status like let's
suppose if you have a number 3 so it
will be a unique place so you have to
isolate 2 and bring it here so this 3
should become 30 so you have to multiply
this number by 10 so that you can append
it with 2 right so once you did once you
isolate one it will come here then you
have to multiply this number by 10 so at
from 32 it becomes 3 20 so now you will
get 3 21 right this is how we are to
reverse a number okay so I should go
with syntactical way now let's go for
this
so syntactical way first you require
some variables so let's suppose your
variables is paint I know I whip it up
with I let suppose n the number will be
1 2 3 then we require a number colors of
wherever is R and s so initially swill
be 0 now this R we are using for the
windows because to isolate our number we
have to find the remainder then we have
to break down the number so remainder so
once you get the actual reverse reverse
will destroy in this s so to do this we
have to apply some steps so all equal to
it will be n mod 10 now n mod 10 will
give you a remainder so n is 1 2 3 so if
you apply mod 10 you will get 3 so here
we'll get 3 then you have to actually
break down the number so from 1 to 3 you
have to make it 1 2 because already we
got 3 so n equal to n divided by 10 now
you will get here n equal to 12 right so
once you get this
three you have to increase the status of
three and that is why you have to
multiply this number by ten and plus our
initially your s is 0 so 0 into 10 will
be 0 plus R which is 3 okay now you have
to do this thing repeatedly for two for
one and that's why we require a value
then question is till what time you have
to break down this number you have to
repeat this loop till your n is greater
than zero so once your n becomes zero
you have to stop this process right
because once you get n is zero you are
already getting these the was number
right so this is how it works now if you
want to check let's let's go for the
actual process let's debug this so yeah
n is 1 2 3 and it is greater than 0 yes
now n mod 10 will give you 3
so yes it's your 3 now let's suppose we
have variables and R and s initially
your n is 1 2 3 are n which is 1 2 3 mod
10 you will get our as 3 right now n
equal to n mod 10 it means your n is 1 2
3 you have to break down your n right so
your 3 will be removed you will get only
1 - okay because if we talk about n it's
an int value so in try only go for the
actual question part okay then after
that you have to go for s equal to s
into 10 now s is 0 5 point so 0 into 10
will be 0 plus r r is 0 3 so s becomes 3
ok again the loop will go on and your
end is 1 to 1 20 skater than 0
yes are equal no it's N and is 12 12 or
10 R will be 2 right then n equal to n
more 10 n is 12 12 or 10 12 1 by 10 you
will get 1 your s is initially 3 so 3 10
3 note on his study
30 plus odd odd is your 2 so you will
get 3 2 okay
sections then again the loop will run
because n is 1 so 1 is greater than 0
yes r are equal to n mod 10 you will get
our as 1 right then n equal to n divided
by 10 n is initially 1 you will get now
0 and once you get here so s.res this
item by 2 into 10 H 7320 plus R which is
1 so we will get 3 21
so now we have else which is there
anyone again we go for the loop and is 0
0 is greater than 0 no and they look
will get out so if you say loop is out
it means you get a reverse number which
is as your initial number was n but now
n is 0 to compare see if we call T
diverse number right now we have to
compare what was the input and what is
the output so forth for the actual go
for palindrome we have to use one more
variable called as T where T is / 2 and
right because and is already 0 here for
so once you can't complete the loop and
it is 0 we don't want a n will be 0 we
want our initial value so it will be
stored in T so now we can say here if
your T is equal to equal to s okay
secure T is equal to equal to s it means
your number is final because your input
and output is same so we have to go for
sop again SOP system dot out dot println
language changes statement changes
everything is same in Cu i printf in C
out in her C++ you write C out in Java
you have to go for system dot out dot
println and in brackets you have to say
it's been in room like otherwise if you
say else part as you have to say sop not
a palindrome
okay so either it can give any drug or
not a palindrome so if you have input
and outputs are same palindrome if your
input is different from output not a
palindrome you have to reverse a number
first step you have to reverse a number
to reverse a number we have this logic
so if you if you're fighting a number
reverse so you can apply this for
but if you want to go for Belinda first
you have to reverse then you have to
check your initial point and the ending
part which is your s if they are saying
palindrome if you are different not a
pageant girl now if you can check for
any number and it be one to one so if
you go for one to one initially and this
whole thing changes ultimately the
diverse number you will get is 1 to 1 if
you are input is 1 to where the open do
you want to 1 because if you go for all
this processing 1 to 1 is equal to 1 to
1 yes we get a palindrome for 1 2 3 not
Avellino for one-to-one palindrome so it
means 1 to 1 is a palindrome 1 to 3 is
not a palindrome right simple right
again if you want the actual code find
below in description area you will find
the actual link for the coal and for

you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
