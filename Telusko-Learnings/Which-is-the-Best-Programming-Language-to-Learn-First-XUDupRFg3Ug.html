programming and if you are wondering
which is the first language to learn so
in this video we'll talk about which
should be the first language to learn if
you want to be a software developer
so welcome back alien salmon have been
ready from Toys for landings and in this
video we'll talk about which should be
the first programming language you
should learn now if you search for the
same question on Google you will get
lots of answers now some post will
recommend you to go for C language now
some posts will recommend you to go for
Python then JavaScript and the PHP then
was the correct answer so if you think
that there is only one correct answer
then the thing is this video would have
been short right maybe one or two two
minutes but you can see this is a
landing video so it is because there is
no specifically under this there is no
specific language we should learn we
should learn first I mean you can start
with C programming language that's fine
you can start with JavaScript directly
that's fine you can start with Java also
or you can go for PHP but then which
which one to choose so first of all
before going before learning any
programming language just I mean just
classify why you want to learn
programming I walk why you I mean which
feel you want to get into so if you want
to get into web ball and if you know
that you want to get into web
programming like web designing web site
building go with go with JavaScript
there is no harm in trying with
JavaScript because in fact in JavaScript
itself you will learn lots of things you
will learn about variables we learn
about how to use while loop how to use
for loop and that's what we learn right
when you learn a new language it doesn't
matter which language is start with the
first particular ideas hello world for
sure the second one the second code you
will write is addition of two numbers
then you will go for if-else which is
even odd numbers they will go for loops
you will try to print the pattern the
same thing is applicable in all the
languages and if you know that you will
be going for web development why not I
can start with JavaScript because if you
can if you can use JavaScript the
advantages it will actually see
something happening you know first of
all you have to learn HTML for that so
learn HTML learn CSS and go for
JavaScript so that you can actually make
webpages and trust me when you build
your first web page you will feel happy
you know you will get that confidence
all for building building of pages and
then you can combine multiple pages you
will get a website right so you can
build your first website just by
learning HTML CSS and JavaScript but the
only thing is that will be a static
website you cannot work with data based
on all those thing but then you
have a website right so if you want to
build a website go with HTML CSS in
JavaScript but then website development
is not your main aim you want to go for
server side scripting or you want to
just learn a programming language I
would recommend you to go for Python
because python is very very easy to
learn at this and the initial phase so
if you want to learn Python and if you
want to learn it very easy I mean if you
want to learn programming easily go with
Python it's damn easy to work with
I mean I'm not saying it is very very
very easy but it is easy to easy to work
with then so if you want to go for web
development of course go for JavaScript
if you want to go for server-side
scripting if you want to learn
programming go for Python because if you
are not sure okay if you are not sure
what I want to do I just want to learn a
programming language that's where people
start with C because C is the first
complete language you know if you want
to if you want to be something in future
and if you're not sure what you want to
be have to so you have to follow certain
steps so you have to learn first learn C
programming you will understand what is
programming then then C++ you understand
how to use objects inside C and then you
can go ahead with Java because if you're
not sure what to learn because you I
mean if you're not sure what to be in
future lo Java and then you can get into
everywhere right you will I mean while
learning Java you will understand what
you want to do so you can get into any
of the field because Java is everywhere
right because if you are not sure then
only go for this path C C++ and Java but
if you if you know that you want to go
for web designing go for JavaScript if
you know that you want to just learn the
programming language go for Python if
you want to be if you want to be open
for everything go for C C++ and Java now
let's say if you want to get into big
data world and if you're not sure what
to learn for big data and you will
understand that when you want to learn
big data you will you have to learn Java
in that case do we have to follow the
entire path do we have to first learn C
then C++ or Java or we can directly jump
to Java and the answer is you can
directly jump to Java there is no
prerequisite to learn Java I mean there
is no prerequisite that before learning
Java you should learn C and C++ you can
dagby jump to java the only thing is you
will find it difficult to understand the
concept is just because you are learning
two things
so you have your learning programming
and then you are learning
object-oriented concepts because when
you learn C programming you only learn
about programming right you learn about
how to call functions how to define
functions but in when it when it comes
to Java you have to learn two things the
programming concepts which is syntax and
how to call functions how to call
methods you also learn about objects and
how to work with objects how to work
with polymorphism all those stuff so if
you know that you want to get into Big
Data world and if you don't know
programming that's fine you can that you
learn Java and it will work in fact it's
my personal experience I'm training
online for different different people
there are some students in my bags who
don't even know this programming and
then there's they're still trying to
understand the concepts I mean they do
understand the concepts and that's what
I'm getting the feedback but then but
then it is possible you can - you learn
Java without learning any other language
ok so if you know that you what you want
to do it based on that you have to
select the language don't just go to C
programming language because everyone
learns C first because I mean if you
join any college if you join any degree
the first language that they will teach
you is C because they are not sure what
you want to be and that's why they teach
you C so that you will go into that get
into that stack you know C C++ Java then
you will learn dotnet and everything
right but then if you directly know what
you want to do go with that particular
language so let me just recap if you
want to get into web designing and web
world go with our JavaScript you will
love it because in fact nowadays using
javascript you can build everything and
now you can build a client-side program
you can write server-side scripting I
don't know if you have if you have heard
about mean stack which is M e a n well M
stands for Mongo DB e stands for express
rails a stands for angularjs and n
stands for no dot no jails using this
mean stack you can build the entire
application there is no need for Java or
PHP or Ruby there you can build it
everything is in JavaScript
it's a beauty right but then if you want
if you want to get into Android
development if you want to get into
biggity development then you have to
learn a Java right and if you you can I
can start with Java and if you want to
get learn
I mean language easily looking for
Python and if you're not sure what you
want to do start with C programming and
you will love programming so that's it
that's about this thing what which
language to learn I would suggest you to
go for Java step all C or Python
they've been upon what you want to do so
