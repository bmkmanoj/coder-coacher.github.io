different toys for learnings and in this
video we'll talk about why you should
use Linux if you are getting into IT
world to understand this let's go back
here in year 2000 four or five at that
time every machine was powered with
Windows right so in fact in desktop used
to use window we used to use Windows in
fact when I studied my first computer
maybe in my college or school the first
thing which I saw is Windows XP loading
I mean can you imagine that the first
thing we have seen is Windows right so
that's why we all are using windows and
we thought in future every device will
be based on Windows Mobile he was also
but then things changed right now we are
using Android right so in 85 percent of
mobile devices are based on Android and
Android works on Linux so indirectly we
are using Linux but then why people
don't use Linux for desktop because they
have one misconception and that
misconception is Linux is difficult to
use
not exactly the problem is Linux is not
difficult it's just that Linux is not
familiar we are familiar with Windows
and we know how Windows works because we
are born with Windows right but the
moment you want you are working on
Ubuntu or maybe any that had distro for
that matter or any Linux distro for that
matter if you are working on Ubuntu or
Fedora what happens is they have a
different way of working compared to
Windows and then this will be comparing
it you know ways which they will we
always compare in Windows we have drives
we have C drive a drive D Drive and you
know when do we don't have those things
right but they have a different data
structure so so it is easy to use it's
just that we are not family you if you
spend at least one week with Ubuntu you
will love it it's just that we don't try
right so you should try using Linux but
why now why not you know why I have not
gated this video way back or why not
everyone is forcing you to use it there
are multiple reasons I mean there
multiple advantages of using Linux now
first thing is everyone is moving to
open-source in fact all the companies or
all the in fact government institutes
now they are moving to
especially in India now all the colleges
all the government offices they were
using Windows before but now even they
are moving to Ubuntu so see that in
India have c-dac you have created their
own OS called as boss OS which is B OSS
so it is based on Ubuntu it's open to
flavor and that is based on Linux right
so somewhere in future every college
every University every government
organization will be using Ubuntu so if
you don't know one - then who should
know it right so it's time for us to
start learning or start learning laners
or start working on Linux so as the
first thing the second thing is people
are moving to the cloud service right
so in fact mobile devices we went from
smartphone Windows Phone to Android
phone now in fact if you talk about
Android phone if you talk about iPhone
they all are based on somewhere they are
related to Linux
right so if you are in future we will be
using the cloud OS so in fact google has
an own cloud OS now and all the cloud
platform even AWS they are using Linux
for their servers so in future if you
are focusing on cloud OS 90% chances are
there that that will be based on Linux
only Windows as your platform which is
which is made by Microsoft is using
Windows other than that everyone is
using Linux by any mean are not saying
ok I'm not saying Windows is bad it's
just that we we know these we have used
Windows right and it as a programmer
user to you you should have experience
on all different platforms Windows Mac
OS or they nurses just that Mac OS
depend upon your budget if it if it's
not in your budget ignore that we are
focusing on Windows and Linux right so
since we are moving towards cloud and
every cloud platform is based on Linux
we should know Linux but then you will
say ok the moment when we move to cloud
we will learn Linux it doesn't happen
that way using OS should be your
internal part if you start using Linux
now then you will get that habit you
know Venus will be inside you example we
talk about Windows we all we know
everything about Windows right how to
how to use this how to use that how to
go to control
so no one has taught that windows you
know we should do this we should do this
we have explored it over in this in this
five to six years or maybe ten years if
you start using Linux now in future
since you are using leanness from a long
time now
you will get that internal you will know
the internal part of Linux how exactly
it works and how to work with commands
so all those things so try to work on
Linux and try to also explore different
commands the thing is as a programmer
you will be exposed with different
technologies like github like Hadoop and
all this frameworks they initially they
were made for Linux and then there was
they were supported on different
platforms like Windows or Mac OS
everything which starts they all start
with Linux or I mean all the
technologies nowadays bit up the gate of
then we have had Europe then we have spa
they all start they started all the unix
and then they move to different
technologies so if you know linux how to
use the innocence there's a high
probability that you can use these in
technologies right so start exploring
only nuts and now it's not that
difficult locate trust me it's not that
difficult just go to go to google
download Ubuntu and go to youtube search
for the steps how to install Ubuntu and
you are done with it and if you can
spend one week trust me you will love
Ubuntu now in fact there is one my
advantage of using Linux this I mean the
first advantages it's free ok Windows
you have to buy I don't know when buyers
windows in India but then but then
windows you have to buy right if you are
going for this real version or the
original version you have to buy Windows
Linux is free the second thing is if you
are using Linux and if you have a slow
machine maybe dual code machine or
quoted over machine Linux will work
faster than Windows in fact if you are
Android dollar point if you use Android
studio try open - it will work it will
work much faster than much faster than
Windows Windows machine ok so try it out
try out different try out different
destroys of Linux and get ready for your
future because in future everyone making
more maximum people or maximum OS will
base will be based on Linux so it's time
to explore thank you so much for
watching and this is Kai</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
