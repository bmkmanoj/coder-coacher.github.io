have talked about how to use partition
how to use filter and then how to create
a complex object right now what we do
now in this video is we'll we'll be
walking with tuples or tuples we can say
so what is the tuples are so let's say
you have so many when you run a
partition so it is dividing the least
into two parts right the first part is
so this I mean the first part will have
two elements which is 40 and 60 and 80
which are satisfying the condition and
then last 2 which is 40 and 50 they are
not satisfied satisfying the condition
right so again so if we have two
partition I mean we have two parts here
part 1 and part 2 so so this is so
normally what happens is when you work
with our method it returns only one
value right but in Scala
we can return multiple values and those
values are called as tuples or tuples or
whatever whatever you can you can call
it ok so it is normally referred as
tuples or tuples and on you pronounce it
let's say tuples I will use the term
tuples here okay so it is returning or
tuple to you right because you're not
getting one value you are getting two
values to list now how do you fetch one
list out of it I don't want the second
value I want only the first list so I
want only the first list here from here
to here so how we can do that is we'll
say well so we say well part 1 equal to
so that I can we can use any name there
so it's a part one part start now how do
you face the first value now we cannot
use index number 0 so in big two
positions are put index number but we
can use underscore 1 underscore 1 means
the first part of it or if you say enter
it should give you the value hope for
the year so you're going to value which
is 80 and 60 because you have we are
fetching the first part of tuples we can
face the second part also we can say
power 2 equal to parts dot underscore 2
so it will return the second part of
tuples which is which is this right
which is 40 and I mean and mohini 50 now
we cannot we cannot do we cannot use
something in this way normally we do it
in lists we cannot do that here this
will not work because interpose we need
to use the syntax as underscore 1
okay that's how you get the value right
so this is one way so if you're not if
you're not comfortable with this
underscore one I mean even I am not
comfortable with that
there are lots of people they're not
comfortable what we can simply do is
here all here itself we can say part 1
comma part 2 instead of doing this later
we can simply say part 1 part 2 so we
are defining two things here which is
part 1 and part 2 in fact no no we do
that we don't have to use Part C we just
simply say well part 1 and part 2 so the
first part if I try it if I try to print
the first pin fagot is done here let me
try to print the first value let me say
part 1 and you can see if I say part 1
why am I still using space there is it
working okay if you can see that regard
the output of output for part 1 and now
if I say this is part 2 it will print
the value for part 2 so that's how you
can use tuples or tuples in in Scala
so that's it that's about this video see
you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
