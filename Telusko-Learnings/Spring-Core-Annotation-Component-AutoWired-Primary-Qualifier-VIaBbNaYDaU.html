create bins with without using this bean
tag so this bean tag here is a
replacement for this bean stag inside
XML right but I don't want to do this
thing also right so let me move this
stuff and still it should work and if
you run this without those stuff we are
getting the error right so it's saying
no qualifying bean type so how to
achieve that so to make this as a bean
by default you just have to write a
antigen coruscant component so every
class of which you need an object
example for Samsung we want the orbit of
Samsung's I just make it component in
fact we require object of snapdragon
just write add component so the
advantage of adding add component is by
default will be getting the object of
snapdragon and samsung okay you don't
have to get any any beans for that but
since we are saying that we want to go
for the automatic configuration which
means we don't have to specify anything
for that we need to use an extra
annotation here with configuration and
we have to say all the components are
predefined so just type component scan
it will scan all the components for you
and in this you have to mention the base
package in which package you have all
these things so we have in package which
is comm dot telesco telesco dot
spring demos or spring a no so that's
the package in which you have all the
required classes right so you can see we
have all the classes we have Samsung we
have app config inside or we have
something we have Snapdragon inside only
one package so if you have multiple
package you can specify my TV package
using comma
okay sounds good I think it should work
now if I run this code everything sounds
everything looks good if I don't this
code boom can you see that we got the
output so we don't have to specify any
being tag you just have to say add
component scan it will scan all the
components in your project on this
specific package okay so it's that
simple
now what it is doing is it is going for
by type okay
by default every example see in this if
you go for XML type every class will
have a name right so that's an ID what
about this thing since we are writing
component what will be its name so by
default the name will be so you have to
give the body for the name will be
Samsung okay so it will remove it will
make this small as it will capita it
will make that capitalist and small s so
this is default name for that so even if
you don't mention the name it will be
Samsung if you change it you can change
it you can say this is let's say my
Samsung okay you can do that also but by
default if you don't mention it will be
Samsung so if you write this component
annotation the default ID will be given
as the name which is non-qualified just
non-qualified and watch non-qualified
and d capitalized or just just let's
just ignore the spelling there so it is
non qualified and D capitalized okay
which simply means you don't have to
mention the package name so your your
name will not be have a package name and
it will be with it will start with a
small character okay so which is going
for byte type right so when you specify
a component scan it which is searching
by type now let's say so we see in this
Samsung we want object of cobalt alright
so we are getting object of Snapdragon
what F if I create a new class and we'll
name this class as mediatek okay that's
the model name or that is a company name
and this media tag also implements
mobile processor and this I will print
second best this is not the second best
CPU but still let's ride it second best
now the problem is we need to mention
this is also component right we have to
specify this even this is component so
just go okay watch that now
so this art component look so now can
you see we have two classes not dragon
and mediatek both implements mobile
versa and Samsung needs mobile bells so
we have not mentioned we have we want no
one we have mentioned we want Snapdragon
droid now this time how to specify that
we want snide leg and we want media tag
so if I run this code now there will be
an error because of the confusion
because the confusion is so you can see
there is a error which is no unique bin
definition exception which means for the
same interface we have two classes which
is mediatek and snap dragon can you see
the names here small m and small s
because of the names there so how to
make sure that we want let's say if
there is a confusion I want mediatek
only I don't want to I don't want what I
don't want Snapdragon so we can specify
something others primary so if you
specify primary ok so it will if there
is a confusion it will take this one
into consideration the MediaTek and if I
am this so since we don't have any
confusion we got the output which is
second best and second best should meet
a tech right and if I copy this if I cut
this primary and if I paste this into
Snapdragon now and if I run this code
we should be getting world best CPU we
are getting that oh we are getting
exception wait I have pasted it oh it's
not not paste it
okay let me run this cancer that we got
well best CPU so that's how we use a
primary annotation okay we have one more
thing but let's say that I do not want
to mention prime annotation here okay
and in and this Samsung itself violating
auto why'd I want to mention the name I
want Snapdragon or I want me attack so
you can do that with the help of
qualifier so if you don't if you are not
going for primary which means you want
to specify which you want so you can in
qualify you can mention I want media
like I don't want Snapdragon I want
media text when that will do and if I
run this code we got the output like a
second best while second place because
we are mentioning qualifiers meditech we
can also specify it's a Snapdragon now
it will fetch Snapdragon right so you
can see how many annotations we are
using here so this is spring so this is
this topic is called as a spring code
annotations okay so if I forgot why any
timing of this annotation see if I click
on component so I can say it was
introduced into point 5 so if you have
if you have worked on spring which is
before 2 point 5 we have to use all we
have to use all this stuff which is XML
based quantification now since we are
using a spring which is B R which is I
guess for so it will this annotation
works then okay so we have so just
remember how many annotations we are
working with we are working with add
component which is for the object or we
can specify the class object we can
write auto wire so that it will search
for the object itself we can specify the
qualifier to match the name we can
specify what we can specify at
configuration which means it will it is
a configuration file for you add
component scan which means it will scan
all the components for you then we have
that said these are the configuration
with these are the annotations we have
walked on this in this project so that's
your spring annotation if you have any
questions any doubts they can just post
posted
comments-section in fact you can give me
also some feedback your if you like this
video or something like that
