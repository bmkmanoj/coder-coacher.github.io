have seen how to use its masculine web
page and how to create database how to
use database how to create tables in it
and how to insert values so once you
have done the inserting of values you
can fetch data using so the query that
we have done now in this video will see
there is something called as TCL so if
you talk about these languages so we
have already seen what is DDL so jdl
stands for data definition language then
we have we know what is DM l which is
data manipulation language and then we
have seen what is d q which is gql which
is data query language you can also say
it is as dr l which is data retrieve
language now there is something as TCL
TC R stands for transaction a control
language now what is transaction here so
let's say you want to do five things at
a time so let's say you have multiple
tables and your let's say you have table
like inventory system in which you have
the stock of materials so let's say you
you are you are an e-commerce website so
you have when you are selling something
let's say you have so into a mobile
phone so you have to update multiple
tables right so you have to delete from
a stock you have to update the amount
table so you have to do not solve for
transactions you have to do execute lots
of queries so when you execute lots of
queries together which completes one
task that becomes one transaction so
what happens you know when you execute
multiple queries so maybe some queries
will be insert some query will be update
some query will be delayed so if you are
inserting some some field in some table
which is directly recruited it is
directly connected to other table and if
that con transaction fails so it makes
your system unstable so what we want is
once you execute all the statement at
last I should commit all the things
there is a problem in the transaction so
let's say after five queries this sixth
query is
then it should go for a rollback so it
should like it should look like nothing
is nothing as they would happened so for
that you have to use something called as
commit and auto commit now by default
when you talk about masks you'll it is
it has set auto commit which is one
which simply means whenever you execute
some statement it will get committed so
what we want is the first table to us
widely for you to set set auto commit so
have to say is that auto commit equal to
zero which will remove your which will
which will set your property as not auto
commit you have to go for manual commit
here so for to execute this we're just
press control enter
so yes so we have said they are to
commit equal to zero now once you are
done with the auto commit let's insert
let's see some data in our table so we
have a table which is select start from
the table name of our student and let's
fire the query so you can see it has for
the cause which is Naveen Rahul Kiran
and eh-eh-eh so you have this record
here now what we'll do is let's remove
some data from this so let's remove
maybe Rahul so in order to remove this
or let's let's add some values why to
remove so what we'll do is we say insert
into student and we'll insert a values
let's say a six or five comma we'll
insert a value let's say Mangesh so
these are the values you have here and
let's say control insert a control enter
so it you can see we have insert is a
value and if I file a select query now
so you can see we are getting this five
records now let's say I don't want the
last entry so what we can simply do is
we can say rollback so going back is the
option it will remove the last data or
the last transaction so if I say control
enter
so it says well back is executed so
there's a tick
no problem now let's say select star
from student you can see the record 5 is
deleted it's only because we have done
rollback but let's say once I execute
this thing now so let's say control in
terms of it has again inserted the value
let's say select star so I can say they
Santa Claus monkey Xie now if I say
commit so come it is something that once
you say commit it will store all the
transaction now you cannot go for
rollback ok so once you say commit we
waiting the same data but let's say if I
say go back now which means I want to
remove the large inserted values which
is mangesh so I have done rollback here
now let's fire the query so I can see
I've done the commit right not done the
commit I made a mistake so let me just
insert again and say from it how it is
commit and now if I say select star I
got 5 records now let's go for roll back
roll back done knife Isis and X star
okay so you can see the data monkish is
still there it's because once you say
commit the data will be there forever so
that's how you have to work with DC l so
TCU's transfer transaction control
language which is done with the help of
commits and rollbacks statements so that
is from this video and the next part
will talk about how to maybe drop a
table drop the database and then we'll
see some more things in masculine so if
you have liked this video so do thumbs
up and thanks for watching do subscribe
