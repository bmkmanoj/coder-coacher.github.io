have go to this class which is app and
then tire and we are trying to create
the instance of tire here so for that
what we are doing is we are saying
coyote equal to then in using
typecasting so we have to use context
dot get bean we have to mention tire so
if you mentioned this line here you will
get the instance of tire from we are
getting the instance so if this this
file is helping you for the instance and
then we have used a property tag to
assign the value for the tire so if you
can see in this tire we have a variable
for this brand and then I am assigning
the value brand using this property tag
now whenever you use this type of
properties so basically you're using a
method which is set up also this one so
we are using this method which is set
okay so whenever you use a property tag
inside your bean you are actually using
a setter here but it's not compensated
that we can only assign the value using
set or we can also we can assign a value
using constructor so whenever you use
set or it is called a setter injection
whenever you use constructor it will be
called as constructor injection now in
order to use constructor injection the
first thing we need is we need a
constructor here so to assign a
constructor will use will say so okay
give me a constructor with fields yes
and then with brand so I got a
constructor here and then when once
you've got the constructor we cannot use
property here so we'll comment this part
okay now once you got the comment let's
define a constructor so out to write a
constructor so just say control space
you will get constructor Arg
as the suggestion use constructor Arg
and then you can mention our value so in
this value will specify let's again
MRF okay and then this MRF will go to
this ty of parameter which is brown and
it will assign the value here simple
right and let's run this so now if I run
this so you can see it is ground
MRF simple
that's how you can use a constructor
injection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
