operations now when we say we have to
accomplish arithmetic operations we
require some operators like addition
subtraction division and multiplication
right so now to go for that what we'll
do is we create a new file and now to
create a new file in turbo C++ you have
to press ctrl alt F it will open the
menu again you can use a mouse and then
you can click on this new ok and then -
you can see now we have we can see two
files one is this new one and the old
one ok so to make it fullscreen we have
to press f5 so when you press f5 it
makes it full screen and you can see by
default a name is no name 0 0 dot CPP
now say P P stands for C++ since we are
walking on turbo C++ the by default the
extension it will give you as thought
CPP but since we're learning C
programming we'll make it
dot C now now what we'll do is we'll try
to save this file to save this file
press f2 and we can provide any name
let's say we are going for automatic dot
C now now let's let's start with the
coding again you know we will be using
some some kind of functions like printf
or get CH or a clear screen so we have
to use two header files first header
file to be used here is esterday IO dot
H and the next one is it is gone when
your dot H next since you're programming
start with main function so we have to
say mean and then we say we have to add
two numbers right so we can directly use
print F and in this printf we have to we
have to put in something right now so
now what we'll do here is we'll say I
want to first clear this screen I don't
want the last output
and I want to hold my screen so get see
it so clear screen CLI see l RS here is
clear skills which will clear the last
output and then printf will print
something and get CH will hold this
screen until I enter something now now
if I say I want to print I want to add
two numbers let's say I want to add two
and three now to add two numbers we have
to use an operator called s plus
operator so we are using a plus operator
here and then as in printf we use this
double quotes to put in something so
let's say what let's see what's the
output of this code now when I done
compile this file and run the output we
are getting is 2 plus 3 but hold on we
don't want this output we want the
output which is 5 that means this two
numbers should be added now to achieve
that task the problem here is anything
inside the double quotes becomes string
literal which means your compiler or
your C interpreter will not try to make
any operation on that what I want I want
to ask them I want to add this two
numbers that means don't print it first
add this two numbers and then 2 and then
print now let's try oh and we are
getting an error it says type mismatch
in parameter is because print F stands
for print format now you can see there
is something else of format here so
print F stands for print format which
means which means we have to print
string always we can only print string
we cannot print normal numbers now
question arises how to print a string
with numbers since plaintiff asked you
for a string and you're passing numbers
so what you can do you can simply say
printf I want to print some value those
values are 2 and the addition of 2 and 3
which is 5 and I want to print this your
printer will ask ok I will print but
just specify the type of those values
and the type of this values is integer
now integer means you can go with all
these numbers like 5 12
of 15-16 so negative range to positive
range so those numbers are called as
integers and to represent the number is
integer we use percent D person D means
I will accept any integer value now how
to replace those person D we have to use
comma so this person D variable E will
be replaced by the answer that is 2 plus
3 which is 5 and knife I done this
answer is 5 simple right so this is how
you have to use printf
now whenever you work with this
programming for sure there might be some
chances that I will change this number
or I want to reuse this number what if I
want to print in this way the addition
of 2 and 3 is 5 right the output I need
is addition of 2 and 3 is 5 so what we
can do whenever you do this this thing
first you should store this value
somewhere so that you can reuse it now
where to store values C programming
offers you something called as variables
now what are what are variables
variables are container where you can
store your values
now variables can be with any name
provided then the characters should
start the names to start with the
character or with an underscore so we
can say my variable name is num1 again
you should always go for some logical
name you can take a variable name as a
xB some something but the name should be
logical so we will say in num1 now to
how to assign values we will say num 1
equal to 2 simple and then we say num 2
equal to 3 so we are we are signing this
values here and then we can simply say
it is num1 plus num2 simple but the
problem is if I try to run this code
let's just try to on this code you will
see we are getting 2 errors ok and when
you go to 2 this 2 errors it says
undefined symbol number and undefined
symbol num2 it's because your c
programming or c compiler always ask you
for keywords or those keywords on those
words which are understanding
well my turbo C++ now what it means your
turbo C++ knows about Sheila SCR is
because it belongs to Coney oh it knows
about printf it because it belongs to
Coney oh and yesterday it knows about
gets the urge but in turn about num1 it
is your own variable that means if you
want to use your own variables or own
keywords first you have to declare them
now how to declare you can simply say I
mean I want to use a variable called as
num1 and the type of this variable is
int now int means integer that means if
you can it will create a content a
container for four values which is of
int type and we can do same thing for
num2 we can say it is int num2 which
means the type of the value in this
number will be int now what is exactly
intense int take two bites of your
memory
now when you say two bytes which comes
out to be 16 two bytes comes out to be
16 bits 16 bits the weight has 16 bits
the maximum value you can have as it's 2
raised to 16 now that carrot imagined a
cat has 6 days 2 so 2 X 2 16 value and
the value is 6 5 3 5 5 6 @ 6 5 3 5 6 so
it is the value you are getting after 2
days 2 16 that means we can start our
values since we start the value from 0
so it will start with 0 2 6 5 6 5 6
five five three six the value will be 6
5 5 3 5 so this is this 3 5 this last
number but since we say it's an integer
that means to start with the negative
value so we have to divide this number
to two parts 1/2 range for negative half
range of a positive so the actual range
the actual range of int is minus 3 2 7 7
6 8 2 + 3 - 7 6 7 but your question will
be this is the range but your question
will be why this line comes in this
really color
why not it's not green and white it's
because I have used something called as
double slash that means even if I'd on
this code the compiler will ignore this
line or this this part of the statement
after this double line it because this
is comment so how did he find comment we
have to use double slash okay and now if
I run this again two arrows declaration
not loud here yeah when you want to
declare something always declare before
before CLR SCR okay so you shouldn't
define you should declare all your
variables before CLR SCR point to be
remember and knife around this the
output is 5 right it's because my values
are 2 &amp;amp; 3 what if I change my values if
I say it is 4 and 7 the output you will
be expecting is 11 so if I run this code
now and the answer is 11 right now let's
say I want to print the addition is
leavens what I can simply say is I can
say I will do that in the evenings part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
