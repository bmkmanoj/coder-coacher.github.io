going to discuss about how can we delete
some of the records from tables that we
no longer require so the syntax for it
is very straightforward and simple that
is delete from and then we have to just
specify a table name so if I want to
delete all the records from table EMP
then the query would be delete from EMP
that's it so we get the message of six
rows deleted and if we check out if we
get any records from select star just no
record presented so delete is a DML
query that is data manipulation language
and in SQL any query that is of DML type
the results of that query or the effects
of that query can be undone so we can
have an undo command for that we use in
database language you called as a
rollback so I will use a rollback so
that I will get all my six records back
okay so now when we use a delete queries
simply like this delete from and then
table name it removes all the records
and suppose we want to remove or delete
the records of that will satisfy some
special specific condition then what we
can do is we can specify a where clause
let's say where Department number is
equals to 10 so this time only two
records will be deleted yes and we will
see all remaining four records okay so
the syntax for delete is pretty
straightforward either we use delete
from table name or delete from table and
with some condition
and if you want to undo the changes that
we have done we have to be just fire a
rollback okay we get all our records
back so that's it for deletloss still
then happy learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
