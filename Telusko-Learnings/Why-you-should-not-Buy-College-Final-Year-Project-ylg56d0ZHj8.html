are going to submit your college final
year project and it's time to buy a
project
so welcome back aliens I'm Loretta from
toys colonics and in this video we'll
talk about why you should not buy your
final year project so what happens you
know when you get into any IT degree
maybe computer science or BSC ITV sitcom
science all masters so we expect that
your College will teach you the cut
practical aspect right so what we learn
is only theory right we learn about C
programming we learn about C++ then OS
concepts networking then we will learn
lots of things and then we sometimes we
expect you know college should give you
more technical knowledge but then we
have a chance you know in your last year
you need to submit a project and that's
your chance to prove yourself just
that's your chance to learn about
something practical but what we do we
buy it right so and so the main problem
is if you buy a project you are losing
lots of thing in your life the only way
to get a good career ahead is to build
that project trust me it will always
help you if you build your project by
yourself I know there are multiple
constraint there are people they don't
like programming there are people they
fail they feel you know when you buy it
when you get when you can buy a project
why to build it by yourself but then
there are lots of reasons why you should
build a project by yourself the first
reason is you will get the confidence if
you can build a small project by
yourself you will get the confidence now
if you if you are wondering you know we
have done lots of assignments but then
that NIC that will be a project right
and not that it's not the case what
happens you know when you're getting
assignment you know how to solve it so
you already have the algorithm your mind
and then you try to implement that in
coding that's not actual software
development if you want to be a true
software developer you need to build the
project from start to end at least once
in your lifetime I mean if you join a
big company it may happen that you are
not part of the entire lifecycle but
then in your college you can be a part
of the entire lifecycle from start to
end now if you know about a software 11
life cycle which is SDLC we have to
follow certain steps right we have to
take the requirement you have to design
the software you have to build this
offer you have to test this software you
have to maintain it right so if you do
it by everything by yourself you will
truly understand what every step means
when you say you have to
and the requirements from where you will
get requirements you have to design the
software I mean it's not about just
about designing a UI it's all about how
can you send data from one module to
different modules then also how to
design your database how to achieve all
those novice and concept in databases
right it's also about how to convert a
design into coding and then how to test
this software you will learn other thing
if you build the project by yourself and
if we do it once you will get huge
amount of confidence right even if you
want to crack the interview in your
interview doesn't matter which job the
value will go for they will ask you
questions based on your projects it's my
personal experience when I went for my
first interview the entire technical
ground was based on my project it was
not based on what I know what I don't
know it's all about project what I did
did in the project what went wrong what
went right it was all about project and
if you are buying the project what
experience you will give because you can
buy the project right you cannot buy the
experience right so you have to build
the project so that you will get the
confidence and you will get that
experience second is you know you will
you will understand each and every thing
about the project how to take the
requirement how to work in team because
if when you join a company you will not
work alone right you will not say I am
the boss here is just that you have to
work in a team where every member will
be building something and you have to
coordinate with them and if you do the
project by yourself you will learn this
thing in your project right so there are
lots of reasons so this is one of the
reason why you should not buy project
you have to build project by yourself I
can it may be late now it's March now
and you have to submit your project next
month it might be it is late I know but
then you can still try it odd if you are
in your second year of your graduation
or if you are in 30 of your graduation
if you still have one year this is the
best time don't think about buying a
project build the project by yourself it
will help you in increasing your
confidence it will help you in
increasing your skill set and it will
teach you lots of different skills you
know leadership leadership skills how to
how to take the requirements and
everything okay build the project by
yourself it doesn't matter which project
you're working on maybe Android project
the iOS project maybe web project maybe
maybe our embedded software may be
working with your fan AC you can build
any project doesn't matter because
everywhere we have the same requirements
right we have the same cycle what
changes is the technology what changes
is your the language part but then other
things with the software development
lifecycle remains same and at least if
you if you can build one project you
will understand how that works it's not
just about theory you will also learn
how the practical expect effect so if
you have some more queries about your
project how to build the project do do
comment in the comment section if I am
NOT available to answer those questions
there will be other members who will try
to answer that so that's it build the
project by yourself and don't let your
project sponsors who your video so
that's a thank you so much for watching
and do subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
