with part two now so we have seen all
these languages right we started with
Fortran COBOL and then we have talked
about C language what was that and why
they created C language
now push arise how why we got two
languages C++ and Objective C and why
only Apple uses objective-c and why only
I mean everyone else uses C++ so when
object you see was created everyone
wanted object in C language so object
you see was more famous before C++
because C++ is was just an eye of
nostalgia because he was only planning
it how to build a language and then it
was in early release it was not having
all the features which we have now
because after that you know once C++ was
introduced there were lots of updates so
everyone went for object you see
initially and then later they taught c++
is better so they went for c++ and then
at that time next company which is so
this company which is which bought by
Apple later so they were using next but
they were using Objective C pull all
their OSS and all the software's and
when Apple bought next in fact they were
forced to use object you see again they
could have went for another language
because the problem is at that time
there was no Java there was no PHP there
was no Ruby language the only language
the only option they was having is
object you see right so they went for
object you say at that time and later
Apple thought you know everything is
working with object you see why we have
to go for some of the language and for
Apple OS also which is your OSX or maybe
iOS they are using object you see there
in fact they were using or did you see
for the last few years so but other than
that everyone used C++ but why everyone
went for C++ why not object you see
because object you see is not it doesn't
have all the features which we need it
in fact people Apple don't use object
you see because it's object you see
because Apple have their own framework
to work with which is called as Co Co Co
Co a which is cool I don't know how to
pronounce that but then we have this
framework of Apple because of that
framework they are they that framework
works with object you see and when they
combine together they it becomes an
awesome language so object you see alone
is not that covered
that that that's strong when you
compared to C++ in fact C++ has
different versions nowadays B in 1998 or
C++ got this standard so it is it is
made in 83 it took a long time to get a
standard for for C++ in fact now the
current one is I guess C++ 17 I'm not
sure so they have the year number so in
1998 they called it standard is 98 in
2011 also they got a standard so it is C
C++ 11 in I guess the latest one is 17
I'm not sure you can see the image here
now so that's C++ so that's why everyone
is using C++ and only Apple use object
you see in fact after object you see
Apple is now using Swift again we'll go
back go for that later now okay so
everything was good in 1983 right then
the problem was everyone was you was
using UNIX or void because at that time
there was no windows no Mac the only OS
option you were having is Unix and in
UNIX if you want to generate reports if
you want to create I mean those reports
business reports or maybe scientific
reports you need some language to do
that right in fact you can do that with
C but then they went for Perl language
so using Perl language you can generate
reports in fact you will be shocked
Amazon when they created for the first
time Amazon was using Amazon used pearl
to make their website and later okay so
it whatever ething was good in 1987
before I born I bought in 1989 so after
in 1989 everything changed you know
obviously since I bought I was saying I
was there so yeah just a part in 1991 we
got another the awesome language in the
world what happened you know at that
time there was a guy he was he was
thinking you know all the languages are
good but it is there is no fun in
languages you know when you learn a new
language there should be a fun you know
how can you add a funny language how can
we use a language in a playing way so he
gave me the concept of Python and Python
is actually a funny language not a funny
language but in a fun language you can
up so it is Python is easy to learn it's
very fun to learn it's awesome thing to
learn so if you don't know if I tune yet
you should learn Python you know you
will love programming but then if you
already know Java if you already know C
Java it was
be difficult for you to not to go back
to Python because Python is easy to
learn and since you have low in Java
which is which is one of the most
difficult language going back to easy
language is be difficult you know it is
it's both ways when you learn a new easy
language if you're going back to the
Defiler language it takes time if you
have learnt if you the language if you
are going back to easy language again it
takes time and that's why I'm not left
by thon yet I mean I know Python bit but
not exactly yeah
so uh so 191 we got Python and then in
1994 the problem was in nineteen
nineteen ninety-four they were making
all these networking services websites
but the problem was they were using CGI
which is common gateway interface and
the if you want to create a website
which is dynamic website now now adays
we use PHP we use Ruby we use Java at
that time they were using only CGI which
is common gateway interface and the CGI
program you should done using C or
Python languages but then they wanted a
easy language to implement server-side
programming and then they came with the
concept of PHP which is initially they
were called as I guess they were called
as hyper okay it was personal homepage
and then they change the name to hyper
processor or hypertext processor okay
yeah so that that's so that's the full
form again they have two different full
form idea they were having different now
they have a different full form and then
PHP was made to create web pages and in
fact one of the famous website in the
world now which is Facebook was built
using PHP Wikipedia was built using PHP
so yeah so utter your language and the
old technologies like I mean technology
which is created way back like Facebook
and the keep it here they were using PHP
there was a bit using PHP now be a
Facebook is not using PHP anymore I mean
they are using a flavor and version of
phd again we'll talk about that in some
time so everything was good until 1984
and then since we have PHP you know
there was one guy here so thank you know
PHP is good but then there's not much of
enjoyment in that so he can be the
concept of Ruby again he was not
comparing Ruby with PHP but then he
thought you know let's make programming
much more easier and then he came with a
concept of Ruby again Ruby was not that
that stable dot not that famous at that
time it got famous
year 2004 2003 when Ruby gods of the
Yoruba got a framework so ruby has a
hole is not a perfect language Ruby
needs a framework to work on which is
Ruby on Rails so when Ruby on Rails come
into the picture - comes into picture
this one of the best technology not now
but then it was the best technology at
that time in 2004-2005 so they came with
a ruby in fact after ruby came with
rails which is Ruby on Rails Ruby using
goopy language will be on Rails we got a
language or we got a technology got a
website called as Twitter so if you know
about Twitter
- - was made using Ruby and then in 1995
I know in a so there was those there was
Sun Microsystems Sun Microsystems was
working on hardware devices now if you
are if you are wondering Sun
Microsystems is a software based company
who makes software's not exactly it was
a hardware based company Sun
Microsystems and they wanted to build a
language using which you can create a
software which is which can work on any
platform
the problem with C language C++ object
you see they are platform dependent
which means if you build a software for
one particular machine it may or may not
work on other machine so they wanted a
machine which was they wanted a softer
line or the language using which you can
build a software which should work on
any system and then he gave me the
concept of Java so James Gosling came
with the concept of Java again with a
team of bits and Mac system and they
named it as Java because we drink lots
of coffee when when you win when you
write a code right and Java I mean they
use they use a symbol of Java on our
coffee machine okay there's a big story
behind that but then the name was Java
and what in fact the current in the
current scenario one of the best
language now is Java right in fact the
mobile applications are built using java
enterprise applications are built using
java and I know Java so I know they were
the only language Java okay and then in
1995 also we got one more language with
Java we got one more language for this
live script that sounds weird right you
have not about like we have not heard
about live script yet right so the
language name was live script they also
given some other language to that they
also give another name to it but then
live script what they have to call it
but later you know they wanted or they
also want to promote that language
because you think that life script you
can actually provide a client side
meditate validation in fact you can
create website so you can every
everything will be processed on the
server side right you wanted something
to process on client side as well so
they created a scripting language for
the live script the problem is live
script was good but then the name live
script was not that famous invite people
you people will take some time to get to
know about life script right so they
changed their name what happened in 1995
end of 1995 a Sun Microsystems has given
a trademark to live script and they have
changed the nante language name from
live script to JavaScript so javascript
is not Java there's no relationship
between this two is just that it came
after Java and they wanted or they
wanted to get famous and that's why they
came they came with a concept of
JavaScript again the Sun got Sun have
given the trademark so they can't use it
so javascript is nothing to do with Java
is just that they wanted to make it
famous and he got famous right now in
the current scenario if we talk about
different technologies javascript is
used everybody
initially it was using only at the
client side now using javascript we can
do you can use you can build any type of
software you can build mobile
applications you can go for interface
application in fact I have a video on
this you can the you can find that it on
my channel so yeah so JavaScript can be
used everywhere on mobile application
desktop applications website in fact not
just client-side programming you can
also build a server-side programming
using using javascript now i don't know
if you heard about mean stack which is m
e a n where m is MongoDB e is expressed
as a is angularjs and RN is node node
dot J's using all these technologies
using all this means tag you can
actually make the entire application
from start to end there's no need to use
Java there is no to use PHP or Ruby
anything or anything of that sort you
can build the entire application using
JavaScript or something right inter
mobile applications in fact you can
build a cross-platform OS using using
javascript that cross-platform without a
cross-platform software
okay so it was he on i-95 and then in
night in around in 1997 when Java got
very famous okay we are we have this
from 1950 to 1990 97 now so in 1997 when
Java got very famous Microsoft wanted
Java because Microsoft believes you know
if anything is good it is mine so they
wanted to buy Java from Sun Microsystems
but then Sun refused it so Microsoft has
given this statement that in next two
years we'll be having a better language
than Java and what they did they copied
the entire Java and they came up with
the concept of c-sharp in fact if you if
you put a c-sharp code and Java code
together they will not be much
difference right the only difference you
will find is in Java we right am small
for main in c-sharp we like capital m in
Java right system dot out dot println in
c-sharp right console dot write line and
everything else remains same you have
the same publisher avoid main which
takes a string arguments you have the
same ink i8j and then everything is
almost same then we have a concept of
objects polymorphism everything is
almost same so c-sharp has actually
copied everything from java and they
gave me the concept of c-sharp I mean
there's no there's nothing wrong with
c-sharp
it's an awesome language in fact it's
also more powerful than Java when it
comes to processing and then when it
comes to software development but then
yes it is copied in fact you cannot
blame that is because when C shop got
famous in year 2000 yes Isha was
introduced in year 2000 in fact the end
tag dotted platform was introduced in
2000 year 2000 we will arnett C shop
dotnet asp.net everything was introduced
in 2000 in fact before that as well we
were using Ruby people use it or not
Ruby VB we were using ASP but then it
was only BB and ASP but after dotnet
framework which is a technology we got
this vb.net CAS protonate I see some
dotnet right so and in c-sharp c-sharp
was having more features in Java what
Java did then okay C shop got more
features what we can do is we can copy
those features from C sharp so Java
copied features from c-sharp
they came with Java 2 and then C sharp
copied again Java concepts on Java and
they came with it with 2005 version of
visual
Visual Studio then Java again copied
from c-sharp and then they are still
copying it from each other right and
then yeah that's what that's year 2000
but then after that everything changed
because there were not many languages
which were introduced so because the the
industry is changing now from from -
2000 the the industry is moving towards
DITA we are generating huge amount of
data and we want to process those
information right because of Facebook
because of Twitter because of companies
because of sensors because of mobile
devices we are generating so many so
much so much of data to process those
data we need a strong language right so
in year 2003 we got a language color
scholar now Scala is very efficient when
you compare to other languages in fact
before that as well we were having a
language called as Haskell which is
functional programming we were having
add languages our functional programming
but then Scala is both it's a functional
+ object-oriented programming and to
work with big amount of data Scala is
awesome and then the god sky language
and Scala is much more powerful than
Java right so if you want to go into big
Gator void in fact I guess to work on
big data framework like Apache spark
Scala is the best option
so Scala is the first one Java second
one and pythons a third one
these are the only three option you have
there right so that was scholar language
and then in 2011 we got a new language
from JetBrains called a sparkline now if
you don't know yesterday itself google
has announced that Kotlin will be the
first class language for Android
initially the for Android we used to
work on Java Java was the first class
language and then C++ and Portland was
one of the supported language but then
now Portland is an officially first
class language for Java that for Android
that means you can use Java and Cortland
as a primary language to build Android
applications now a Portland is much
similar to Java it is actually what you
say the enhanced version of Java that
doesn't mean Java will not be used
anymore but then Portland is a new
language and I guess it will be future
because Android is supporting Cortland
that's a big thing right so again the
Cortlandt is introduced by jet planes
I don't know if you have ever used
IntelliJ before IntelliJ is actually
created by JetBrains which is or which
Android studio is also graded by
JetBrains so we have a big hope for that
and then in 2012 in fact the project
started in 2009 Google you know being we
all are so proud of Google and there was
no language on Google right so in 2009
Google came up with an old language
called as go language again you can say
goal and but then you can remove that
lang they have go language so it was it
was started with a style walking when I
took 2009 again the founder of go
language is the same founder who's who's
corrected be language and C language
which is Ken Thompson
right so Ken Thompson also worked on go
language and in fact using go language
we have also created Dropbox so if you
are using dropbox dropbox uses go
language so you can just go to dropbox
wikipedia page you can see there's a go
language mentioned so yeah so Dropbox
uses go language and so Google have
their own language it was it was
introduced to public in year 2012 I mean
you should learn good language or not
that's depend upon you I would not
suggest you to learn go language now it
will take some time for go language to
get implemented ok then in 2014 when
again Facebook got huge amount of
processing data and some and you know
PHP cannot handle those huge amount of
data to work with
and that's why per for persisting they
are using different languages like C C++
they are also using Java for back-end
programming but then they wanted a
language which will be more secure than
PHP so they modify the PHP and they give
you the concept of hat language and so
Facebook got a new language is hack and
it was on hip hop virtual machine if I'm
not wrong and also one of the most
secure OS
most secured language available for PHP
framework or PHP language yeah so that's
that's hack language and Facebook still
uses hack language now again if you are
saying that dot PHP extension on
Facebook that's actually a hack language
and then in 2014 again in the same year
we got two more two languages when his
hack and we got swept the problem with
object you see you know everything was
good with object you see the thing is it
is difficult to learn so as a new
program
let's say if I want to be a palapa I
have to learn entire object you see
right so you should have that I can
actually learn Swift language and Swift
is much more easier than objective-c
just have to learn Swift and you can
start building iOS application in fact I
guess Swift in the future in fact you
can also use c-sharp to build your iOS
applications and to you can also build
Android application using c-sharp
if you had not about heard about it we
have xamarin frameworks so using
sampling framework we can actually build
both the we can build one application
which will work on Android platform
Windows platform and iOS platform but
then examining is not that stable yet
still working on it
when you compare to see I mean when you
compare to the native languages like
Java and Swift
Samri is not that strong but again in
future you don't know maybe examine it
will be more powerful than all these
languages so yeah so that's the history
of all the languages I know it was very
rapid very fast so if you have liked
