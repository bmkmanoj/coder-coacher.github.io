ugly Wudi we talk about something called
as Python Springs so spring
what is the strings strings is nothing
but combination of characters okay our
set of characters so let's you an
example I will show you if you have a or
s that is an egg if you have SWE that is
the strain so we'll explore some
properties of embedded proper fit
features and properties of Python okay
to work with a string so what I will do
is I will simply say I will simply make
one spring or STI and I will assign some
value also I will say so in that I else
my need top now say in the street art
it's something now what I will do L say
print
xpr of 0 so let's see what is out see
what is great thing this index value
example I have SW and I don't sing a
scale of 0 so it is taking this one with
an x value of 0 and X in the same way
forensic pain
to call them ice and so here we can see
that I caught values from core value
third like if you talk about programming
in programming index starts with zero so
what what it has taken his silence so
what is that me actually
what is that mean it's my civic variable
first where you go a second variable for
search and that is 60 so this is like if
I will see str2 : 5 so it will it will
start from second okay and you go to 4th
why because if you see the sequence
sequence as I told you it it starts with
0 so it starts with 0 1 2 now waiting on
I want to fifth
so it will go what it will take 3 only
one two and three so it prints only
three characters starting from second
index ok and index will start from zero
ok the same is a just PR of all n ok so
it returns it starts with second index
and it will end in five asides of only
value this and as I say
that's the part you can see start from
second in next and it will take till
last
so like again I mean if you want if you
want to print your string two times she
won't be produced in three times yeah so
you can see like a sprint database so
this is nothing but I think strings can
also explore there are many more
features you can flip documentation of
on of items and ways you can explore
many more properties of items vector
letter in our tutorials we will also
design from simple after learning some
new statements and loops will design one
application that will that will produce
meaning of your name okay so like this
video subscribe thanks for watching
