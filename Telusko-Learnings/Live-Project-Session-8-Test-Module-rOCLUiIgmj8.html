for keeping you waiting because I was
doing some you should set up it took
some time for that okay so I just hope
everyone you can hear me I'm not showing
my screen yet so if you are thinking why
you are not able to see this pin is just
because I have okay so so here we go so
let me astray my screen now and let's
also discuss what we did in the last
session and what you're going to do now
so I'm showing my screen here we go say
star share so now we are live is it yes
I hope you can see my screen now and I
should also also recorded session for my
side of let me just do that and here we
go so with three two and one so let's
discuss what we did last time again when
I say last time not talking about the
last session talking about the actual
session which way did of two weeks back
not the not this week session okay so if
you remember we have created of method
for tense touristy and which would
return me the reached of questions which
whatever we do now is I would simply run
this code let's see let's see what
happens now I just made one more change
in the project before going with us
before going alive I have added a one
more tag here which is called as MBC
annotation driven because if you want to
use restful web services you have to add
this annotation which is MBC annotation
driven because you want to return a
adjacent file right okay so okay and now
there is one more thing if you are
watching this video okay if you are
watching this video for the first time
just remember one thing a watch this
video on 720
you don't need a 15 Mbps speed you just
need around four ma peers of speed to
watch this in 720 and I cannot go beyond
this the size of this screen now this
this is the minimum I can go for if I go
below that you cannot see anything there
okay so that's the first thing yeah so I
have added this annotation here yeah I
was talking about the people who are
joining for the first time so if you are
joining this session for the first time
we are doing a live code here we are
building a project we are redesigning my
website so if you don't know about that
just go to my website which is the disco
calm and have a look what executive
squad comm is and you will understand
what we are trying to redesign okay so
alright so this is what I have made a
change we have changed MVC annotation
and this is the 8th session ok so make
sure you have seen the earlier session
to get the better understanding of it ok
so let me run this code let's see if it
is working or not so if I say right run
this code or just taking some time to
load ok done I don't know which browser
it will open now I will use Firefox okay
where's the output so if I'm not wrong
I'm using a partner which is eight zero
eight five and the project name is dusk
and we are searching for test dot HTM so
in a sense when I send a request for
tests or HTM you can see it will try to
fetch the data from the database and
yeah you can see we got all the
questions the awesome thing is every
time you run this code every time you
run this code you will get a different
questions why this is what we have done
in the last session now the first thing
is what you are getting here is the
least it is the least of values okay so
you are getting a list of questions here
but to make it work
I want to fetch adjacent file now how do
I fetch adjacent file how do I convert
this data into JSON now first of all if
you compare these two methods we have
get questions and test you can see we
have this same code so let me remove the
extra code register
extremely simply use get questions
because even get questions will be the
same thing right so I will say get
questions I would like get questions dot
HTM and if I do that uh okay so you can
see we are getting questions but there's
only one problem we are getting more
than what we expected because it is
giving you all the questions so I did
remember I should I think we should go
for this one only because this is get
test question and that is get questions
okay so get questions we'll give you
everything and get test questions will
give you any test question so what I
will do is I will create this method
because know where I want all the
questions right I want only five
questions so I will go with get
questions only which will fetch only
five questions and let me just go back
here when I say get questions now I made
the changes and it should reflect now
and you can see we got five questions
now every time I want this code you
every time I say enter it will give me
five questions now what I want is I want
to represent I want to French this data
in a page right example think about this
if you are a participant and if you want
to give a test just imagine if you go to
my website and if you see a question or
something like this you will not like it
right so you want questions in such a
way that you can actually attempt you
can actually give answers so of course
we need a GUI here we need a page where
you where you can show these questions
right so I have created a design design
for this okay so if we have one question
here okay so now I have created this
design okay now the top thing is I'm not
dad could be designing so what I'm doing
is I'm I have I'm using the earlier
design again this design is open to
change okay so you can change the design
of this so I can change the design for
this okay so so
this design which we did last time so
let me okay to this code done last time
okay I mean the same design here again
this this design is open for change if
you want to if you want to change
something just let us know what you want
to give it to us so their design and so
how it works exactly so before a one of
doing anything extra let me just run
this code let's see what happens if I
call how do i call test dot JSP so when
I call for okay now first of all we have
to call that page right because this is
the page which will be getting called
and you will see this questions okay now
question arise how do we call this test
or je suis because I want those
questions on test or JSP now to call a
test or JSP we need one more controller
so when you call for dot HTM it will
call for dot JSP so what do we do is I
will copy test or astrium so I will copy
this code okay I do have a code already
I will just use that code and so
whenever I use a call for a test dot HTM
it will call test dot JSP this is what
we want here right so when we call for
test or estimate we call test dot JSP
let's let's see if it is working or not
let's go back to the Firefox and let's
say one and ok is taking some time or we
are calling for get questions riod we
should be calling test dot HTM now if I
love this code you can see oh we are not
getting questions can see that we got a
page we got a design here but we have
not we are not getting the data okay so
now we are not getting data right so I
want to go to design here but not data
so how do I get the data here to get the
data of course we need to write some
code right oh okay just hold on guys
okay
so lon so I'm very thankful for some
people here so Rahul aggarwal thank you
for so much for being a part of the
disco and now you are going out okay
just hold on just me just do some
changes here okay so I got some comments
here from some people okay so what I
feel you know if you are not getting
stuff from this channel you should not
see this channel right so what do we do
is people who are not enjoying this
session you are getting blocked from the
channel so there is no more learning for
you on this channel so now lagravis get
lost the breeze shake get lost are so
now we can continue
okay so now we can continue I hope you
can see my screen now yes so what I'm
doing is I'm whenever whenever you call
for tests or a stream it will call for
tests or JSP right now if you go to
tests or JSP ideas I just did one more
thing here so in this state dot test dot
JSP if you go down you can see I'm
caught I'm sending adjacent requests now
I don't know how many of you are
comfortable with Jason here or how many
are comfortable with jQuery now again
this this is not about jQuery here and
not dad would deal with J's a with
jQuery so what you have to do is you
have to send a request for get Jason so
you have to send a request and so I'm
sending a JSON request here and for that
JSON request I'm sending a request for
get questions oh but I'm sending a
request for get G's get questions and
get questions hands God HTML it me
remove that dot HTM here I don't need
that I would say I will request for gate
Jason so I get questions now this gate
questions should return a JSON file
right now unfortunately what we did till
now is whenever I was whenever whenever
I was running this code I was getting
those okay when I say get questions now
if I say let me just show you something
if I say get questions not dot HTM but
look out dot HTM if I say get questions
okay you can see we are getting data but
this data is not in so this we are not
getting data in a JSON format I want
data in a JSON format so to do that if
you want to convert it into JSON format
you don't have to do much about that
okay you it's very simple what you have
to do is you just have to return with
these tough questions the awesome thing
about spring is spring internally has a
JSON library which will convert your
least into JSON
you know you don't have to do much about
that in fact earlier we used to do
everything by ourselves we used to wait
to convert the JSON file v2 I mean we
have to create a JSON file from the list
but now we have a in Bill library called
as Jackson so using Jackson we can
actually fetch data we can convert the
list of questions into a JSON format and
that's it let's try to work with this
now if I say get
questions you will get the same
questions but in a different format you
will get adjacent format you can you see
that we got everything adjusting format
and that's what I love about I love
about Firefox you can see we got
everything in a proper adjacent format
again when you fire the same query in in
Chrome if I'm not wrong you will get a
normal Jason text but in Firefox what
you get is the you see that we got a
normal Jason texture but in Firefox use
you can see everything in Jason format
it is much variable okay and I can see
we have 15 people watching and 10 likes
and 3 dislikes come on guys you can hit
that like button to get to motivate me
I'm already some I am already feeling do
motivated because of some comments okay
okay so yeah so you can see we got Jason
via roid so what I'm going to do now is
in test dot JSP I'm sending a JSON
request now this JSON request will give
you the JSON data right so data which is
we are getting here or not this one but
this one so whatever data you are
getting here you can actually fetch so
you're fetching that data which goes to
Jason one text so I'm okay again if you
are if you are not familiar with jQuery
and I Jax request so when you when you
send a edge ax requests so this is a
Jack's equestria which we can do that
with the help of get JSON method or this
is this is a jQuery stuff if you're not
comfortable with jQuery just do watch
jQuery videos and then you will
understand what I'm talking about
so get jason is a jquery thing because
they how do we get how do we know that
this is jQuery so whenever you have
dollar and dot so when we just say dot
and method or function name that's a
jQuery thing okay so when you send a
jQuery thing when you send a gesture
quest it is sending a request whatever
data whatever response you get from a
server
you are getting a response this you are
getting this response from the server
right now that response will be stored
in JSON one so that response will be
Jason one now this Jason will one will
have all the questions now what I am
doing now is first of all I am fetching
all the question IDs because the idea is
let's say if you get all the questions
and on the page you are showing all the
questions the moment you are showing the
moment you are showing all the questions
you have to give Unser's ID as a student
you will give answers now at the end
when you click on submit those questions
and answers should go to the server
right for the verification if you let's
say out of five or five questions you
have once or three right questions how
do you verify those three right
questions right or three right answers
so those questions will be going to
server so what are we doing now is I
will be sending the question ID and the
answer so whatever whatever answer you
gave to for that better version ID I
will send out on a server to do that I
am first of all I am fetching all the
question IDs so from the Jason from the
Jason which is Jason one in Jason one we
got all the questions right since I am
I'm fetching all the question ID which
is which which I am storing in Q s now Q
s is an added here well I have all the
questions so we got all the question ID
in Q s that's the first thing we did the
next thing what I want to do is when the
moment you load your questions the move
the moment you load your questions what
it will do is it will load that question
and okay first I think we should first
run this code just to get the
understanding what is happening behind
the scene so if I say test dot HTM and
if I say Enter key to see that requite
question and we got options as well I
know the UI is not bad good so the UI is
not that good I know about that but then
at least we are getting questions right
so we got the question and we got the
option so when I say my favorite
technology of course it's Java I was in
next which compilation of java java
application or ignore that spelling
mistakes application we have to use
which competition this is a long
question I guess why the compilation of
okay okay we have to use a class file
and then Java ID totally depend on okay
we are not able to print that thing okay
that's a question mark oh that's - -
concepts so Java is based on object
oriented questions again next one Java
runs on which platform all the platforms
right we click on next and then ok we
got the same question again because of
some database issue that's that's a
different thing so when I click on
submit and you see that we are sending
all the data on the address bar how
exactly it is happening so we are doing
that we are doing that on the on the
test or JC pH so if I go to my editor
again the entire project will be
uploaded on github once the session gets
over
so once we session get session gets over
I will upload the same code which we are
doing now on github you can access those
codes and you can you can make it work
by your for yourself okay I will just
hold on so now we got some annoying
people and I should add someone as admin
here when people don't get job they do
something like this okay you know we
should create
software using which we can actually
block such people people were so many so
much of time on okay is it that easy to
create so many accounts I think I should
keep it handy for me so that I can block
him as soon as he get a new account
let's see who wins today okay okay
alright let me just go back to my
splendor do that thing I have to okay so
you can see we are sending a request to
verify dot HTM so what I'm doing here is
we got all the questions from be from
this server I am so I'm sending I'm
sending a request to get Jay get
questions where I am getting the jacent
data so the moment I am getting a data
from from the server which is going in a
JSON one and then from Jason one am so
from Jason one
I am fetching one one question so that
one question should see we got five
questions right so I want to I want to
show the first question and to do that
we have a counter again the people who
are good with Java they know about this
thing right so they know I mean they
know the counter so initially the
counter will start with zero and then
I'm fetching the first question to do
that this is my elements of the of the
page so we got a question number you can
see if you see the output if you see the
output here this is your question number
right the question number one we are
getting that because of this one because
we have an element which is Q no qn1 QM
in Q I know and then we got a question
we are getting this question because of
this one I mean we are getting this
question because of Q we are getting the
options because of option one option two
option three option four right and we
are fetching
all this data from the JSON so whatever
data you got from jason one we are
assigning that to Jason so you can see
we got Jason okay so regarded jason and
we assign that value Jason 1 - Jason
here and we are fetching data from Jason
now you might be wondering why I did
that why I copied the concept con
content from jason 1 to Jason it's
because the moment I click on next what
should happen when I click on next
because the moment I click on next it
should increment the value right it
should increment the value of this 1 to
2 and then it should also change the
question to do that we have created or
something called as a dot click I mean
the click function okay so we got the
click function here and that click
function is happening on a next element
so the way we have next element we also
have a previous element so if I scroll
down we have a previous element I mean
the code may look difficult but then
once I upload this code on github ok so
the moment you click on github
you will get the entire project and then
you can have a look on the code you will
get the clear understanding of it okay
so
so we got this thing we got a previous
okay so we got a we got a before funky
got the next question we got the next
button and we got a previous version
right so when you click on next this is
what happens when you click on so when
you click on previous it will go back so
every time you click plus I mean every
time you say next it will increment the
value of I and every time you say
previous it will decrement the value of
I it's that simple
ok so when you click on next button this
is what happening right it is changing
the question every time you click on
next so when you click on next it
changes the question okay so it is
happening because of this i plus plus
the thing is if you remember this Jason
won so Jason one is that is a point
where you are getting all the questions
right and the scope of Jason was Jason
one is only for this particular method
which is not available for the next one
slide and that's why what I did is I
have created one more variable which is
called a Jason so that when I get this
data from Jason one I can assign that
value to Jason so that now this jason
has a bigger scope right it can be
accessed from anywhere and that's why we
are doing here so we can access that
Jason from anywhere it can be accessed
from so in the next in the next dot
click as well I can access that Jason
thing so I can access Jason here
so we can access that in next and we can
also access that for previous it's that
simple
okay now what next now once we got this
thing they're getting all these
questions right so you can see when I
say a while compiled of java application
okay so when i click on next next next
we are getting all this data right now
kosher lies when I click on n text and
test what happens when I click on none
of this and when i say next when i say i
OS that's a long as i know so when i
click on any of this answer here and
when i click on end test what happens
i want to send all your questions and
answer on the server right because the
verification will be done on server now
how do you think we'll be verifying this
thing so to verify we have so what i've
did is with on that on that button which
is n test so if i go to design now so if
i go back to the design which is here is
that ok ok ok yeah so can you see that
when you say n test the moment you say n
test which is the bet on you which is
the button you can see on the screen it
calls a function called as go now go is
a function in JavaScript I mean it's not
a predefined function we have created
that function here and that function is
defined somewhere below so somewhere
here
ok Schedule C like we got a go function
here now every time you click on and
test it will call a go function now
inside go function what I'm doing is
whatever it whatever you have selected
all we have one more point here which
are forgot what happens when you click
on next because see if you if you are
waiving this first answer here if I if
you are giving the first answer is let's
say AWS when you click on next we want
to preserve that data right whatever you
have selected in the last answer so I am
doing that in one of the adder here so
every time you click on next
okay what is that so every time you
click on next you can see we are
checking which one is actually checked
before so is it opt one which is checked
in that case it will assign it will
answer the answer would be one
if it is opt to which is checked it the
answer would be to if the opt three is
check the answer would be three the open
it for you straight dancing before so we
are also saving that data somewhere so
we have an array which is called as
answers in which you are storing all the
data right so at the end when you click
on go you have to send two things you
have to send the question IDs and you
have to send the answers so if you
remember question IDs are stored in Q s
and now the answers are stored in
answers so we have two arrays one array
has question IDs and second array has
answers I hope everyone you are getting
the stuff which I'm to which we are
talking about which we are talking now
in case if you are new to this session
or you have to watch earlier five or six
videos just to get the understanding
what we are doing the live project okay
so we got a question IDs here and we got
answers right I want to send this
question IDs an answer okay one more
thing when I when I click on that end
and test after clicking next next next
when I click on end test can you see
that in address bar what we are sending
is we are sending T name because see
when you wait whenever you give a test
you have to give a test based on some
topics wide it may be Java it may be C++
it may be any on any language so in that
case when you have we have to specify
the language as well again we are not
verifying that here that will be doing
later
the main focus here is this this answers
so the question I do one which I have
selected I mean the the question ID one
is 12 because we are getting random
questions right so you can get questions
and anyway then we are getting the
answer 1 as 2 because I have cited the
second option for question ID 2 which is
9 as I did the answer which is again 2
for question ID 3 I selected the answer
one of the SS I did too and I guess I
for every answer have cited the for
every question of cited the second
answer that's why you can see all the
answers are 2 to 2 I want to send this I
want to send this question to this I
want to send all this thing to a server
right
the way I have created that URL is by
using a for loop so using the concept of
appending you know if you remember the
concatenation operator using the
concatenation operator I have
concatenated everything to create one
request and I'm sending that request to
the server by calling verify the DCM I'm
sending the T name and then I'm also
sending the JSON data so I'm sending all
the data images okay now it is not a
JSON format actually I'm sending data in
any particular format I'm just giving a
name for Jason okay because I was doing
some experiment and then later I
realized instead of sending out a JSON
request we can also send a normal data
in fact it will be better if you send
the question of post format because if
you use post by default we are sending
out get requests right I want to send a
post request value where you will not
see all these things on the address bar
okay and then once you got the link we
are calling that page using JSP call and
that's why you are getting that page
which is verified of this TM but then
question arise we are calling for verify
that is not is TM right oh yeah so where
do so we have to create one more
controller which can work with verified
or this GM okay now the thing is okay
before going ahead if you are new to the
session just click on the like button so
that I will know that you are liking
this session okay
so yeah so I'm sending this request to
verify the HTM right and so we have to
create a controller to accept that right
so in the quotient controller we have to
create a controller which can accept the
request for verify the distri M so what
I will do is I will create a controller
here and I will mention something like
this yeah so I have created this
verified or HTM so whenever I use up
calls for way further extreme I will
call this verify method
now this verify method will take
multiple parameters as you can see
required question ID one I have just
written only for questionary one we
should be writing for question ID to for
answer ID one I'm sorry to all those
things for it we can do that when you
show up the addition of having all those
values there's one way you can create a
class here and then you can send all
this data up there so what I would
recommend you people to do is you try
this code by yourself create a class
that class will have ten parameter then
properties question ID one question to
question you three cosine T for question
five and so one answer to answer three
and so for answer five so in total you
will be having ten properties
create a class with ten properties the
advantage would be here you simply has
to use a great model attribute and let's
name that class as maybe a
question/answer class so create a class
for this question answer and create just
use motor attribute and it is you can
simply specify the object of that and
all the questions and answer will be
stored in that class and later on you
can verify what is this code okay so in
this session we have we have focused
mode on the verification or the design
so again I will be uploading this
project on github for you to watch or to
check so download the project have a so
have a have a okay so clone this project
from github how I look input this budget
on your on your IDE and just make it
work with that and try to complete this
thing again I will be completely
completing this thing and
load the project on github for you to
watch or do for you to clone it so yeah
I'm in the next in the next live session
we'll be talking about result generation
how can we generate a result if you get
all these questions so yeah that's it
this is what I wanted to talk to you I
mean I wanted to convey to you today
just let me go for a quick recap what we
have done so first of all I wanted to
fetch all the questions and that's what
I am using get questions so the moment
you say get questions it will fetch all
the questions from this from the
database on it will return you this
questions the thing is this questions
will be returned in in a JSON format
reason why we are getting just inform
idea is because of response body the
moment you say response body it will
return a JSON format right okay now
advisees in why not XML is because by
default spring supports Jason that's why
we are getting Jason here so once we got
a JSON data we are sending a JSON data
okay that's good okay we need to call
this from somewhere right so what I'm
calling is from the address from the
browser I am calling for test dot HTM so
I'm calling for ask dot HTM the moment I
call for test dot HTM I can see I am
getting a question I'm not just getting
one question I'm getting five questions
now those five questions are actually
coming from database and so when we call
test on HTM we're actually calling test
or JSP this test dot JSP is sending a
request which is a earth synchronous
requests to the server to get GZ JSON
