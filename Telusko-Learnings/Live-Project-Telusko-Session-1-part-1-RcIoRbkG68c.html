different oyster landings and finally we
are reaching that benchmark of 50,000
subscribers so we are a very big family
now and thanks for your support for
watching my videos for sharing my videos
and liking all the videos which bitches
which has motivated me to make more
videos so and I have a giveaway in fact
last week I have announced about this
giveaway 9 today is the actual
announcement a giveaway is a project a
live project now why we are doing this
is it is it that any advantage of this
so what happens you know when I was in
my college days when I was doing my
graduation I was knowing about all
different concepts you know I was
knowing about programming I was knowing
about database I was knowing about all
these times but only the theory part
okay we have SQL and this is how it
works
we have Java and this is how it works we
have D of D this is how it this is how
it works
we have testing and this is how it was
but then loving all this thing isolated
will not make any sense right you should
have a one real example where you can
connect all these things so when you
work on a project that that's where you
will understand how to use all these
things together right how to deploy the
project how to manage using github so
will be will be saying all this thing in
this project so after computing this
project you will be knowing lots of
things you will know why do we create ER
diagram so you will know why do we why
we why do we use a specific type of DBMS
why not some other DBMS why we use Java
as our primary language why not some
other language why we'll why we use
github why how to deploy the project
very declasse project why not to go with
the private hosting why to go for the
cloud hosting so we'll learn all these
things in fact I will not teach you all
this thing okay see this is not a
teaching session it will be doing
session ok I will not teach you any of
this you will learn all this thing by
yourself and you will not even know that
you are doing some hard work of learning
you will enjoy each and everything
because when you work on something we
really enjoy it
ok that's why we are making this project
now it is very difficult for me to
manage everything right and that's why
we have some other planning which which
you will see in the next video how you
can join this session and all those
things
then what exactly they are going to do
in this project initially I was thinking
about to make something new but then I
thought with this is just an experiment
right I mean this is I am doing this for
the first time so what I am planning is
we will redesign my own a bit of this
telesco website so we have asked our
website right which is already deployed
let's redesign it because I am getting
lots of I know in fact thanks to you
people I have got lots of mails last
week after the announcement I don't know
I got more than 200 mails I guess I mean
it was overwhelming you know getting all
those smells I added all the emails okay
I have no I was not able to reply to all
the image because it is impossible to
reply all those mails so thank you so
much for your feedback in fact I got
lots of ideas and most of them were
talking about redesigning the website
and using all those different
technologies so that's why we are came
up came with now so what we will be
doing is will be designing about website
business telecom ok from start to end
that will be our project now there are
lots of people who have seen my website
earlier already but then people who have
not seen that just go to the website and
have a look what are the models we
already have there and we will try to
redesign each another thing so if you
can go to the website you can see we
have a login page we have a code page we
have feedback page we will be
redesigning everything and you will be
doing all those things now to build a
project we need certain designers we
need we need people who will work in the
back-end team people who will who is
responsible for databases so again we
will try to figure it out who is best in
what what thing and I was thinking about
making it public but there is one there
is one issue it will be very difficult
for me to manage all those things if I
make it public so what we are doing now
is when we do it will be will not to get
public but then we'll be having a set of
people so only those set of people will
be a part of this project
ok I don't know the numbers now but then
not everyone will be eligible for tea
for different reasons first it will be
difficult for me to manage everything
second there are some people they they
are not interested they feel that
interest rate but then later on they
will not take much participation so what
I want is I only want serious people who
will work
this and so since you are learning lots
of things of course you are serious
about this but then I want to make sure
only those people will be part of this
who are actually serious okay now how
can you show your seriousness that we'll
discuss in the next video but then you
have to be serious to do to do this
project and so yeah seven video will be
redesigning our project which is the
risk ROM and while going this will be
learning all different things
what is ER diagram technology so what
are technology so we will be using here
so will be so okay let me let me just go
in this way so far before creating this
software first of all you have to design
the software writing on the paper so
first of all you have to design the
database on the paper
that will be your II our diagram then
you have to design the actual database
in you know the table structure what how
many columns we'll be having so we'll be
doing all those things later on we'll be
going for the UI phase where we'll be
actually creating the UI's now I need
people and I know there are in fact up
from last year itself I'm getting some
requests that there are some designers
who are my subscribers and they want to
point to me to get to the website you
should I was busy with the other stuff
so I was not able to concentrate on
those things but now we can't do that
right so if you are good at designing
you can help in the designing team you
can create the awesome GUI and you can
you can give it to us and we will try to
incorporate that in our in the new
project so in the next two months we'll
be redesigning the entire website okay
so from the old website which is nice
now but then we'll try to make it more
interactive we'll try to make it more
awesome right we are making an awesome
website now not I I mean I will not be
responsible for that you will be
responsible to create that awesome
website and yeah so so if you are good
at designing you can contribute your
designer if you are good with Java you
can contribute as a Java developer if
you are good with the database you can
contribute on a database way if you are
good with hacking you can you can
provide the hacking solution you can
provide a security solution to the
website and just imagine if you are a
developer you don't know how to hack or
you don't know how to you don't know how
to test this offer you will
having people with you I hope the people
who will be working with this they will
communicate with each other for all the
things because that's important right
when you work on a project communication
is very very important right and you
want the actual people and no one there
I'm just a person who is managing
everything that's it nothing else the
building part will be done by you right
and that's where I want the proper
communication now once I got the code
let's say if you are submitting the code
if you are submitting the designs we'll
be making a live video on that so let's
say after the submission okay so it will
it will go something like this or today
I'm talking about the announcement in
next two days you have to make a our
diagram for the website so just go to
the website and create our er diagram
now I know most of you don't know what
is e are just go to go to youtube and
search for what is e our diagram and
learn how how to make an e ER diagram
and then submit a a a diagram for this
for this website so you submit in fact I
will also talk about that what exactly
your diagram means I mean what I am will
be using for our website in next 2 or 3
days so we'll be having three days
mostly on Friday we'll be releasing a
next video where we will talk about the
ER diagram and then we'll go for that
page so every three to four days we'll
be having a new video for the for the
for the projects right so today we have
to learn yet our next two days and make
a year I am have the website and submit
that ER diagram to me even if you're not
good with designing if you are not good
with that you have to make the entire
website right we just trying to make you
a full stack developer from start to end
you can you can be a part of this
project not compulsory but then it is
better right and whatever design you
submit whatever code you submit if that
code is actually implemented on the
website you will be getting your name
your name there okay so designing at the
end of these on you will be having your
name there okay let's try to incorporate
where to put that and how to how we can
do that maybe at one will be having one
page for all the contributors let's see
how that goes because when you so when
you see open-source project we have
those contributions where right so which
I will try to implement that here as
well so yeah so so you have to learn er
I am for designing for for database will
be using MySQL for four
all language we'll be using Java for
code sharing will be using github and
for deployment we'll be using Google App
Engine so currently I'm focusing on
Google App Engine but let's say next one
or two months if I figured out how to
use a SS because I'm getting some
problem with database now if you can
figure it out we'll we can also deploy
that on a tablet server so you will see
from start to end everything like even
if you don't want to be a part of this
project that's fine you can you can just
watch what is going on and you can learn
by watching as well but then
participating is more important than
watching right so that's our first thing
now how to participate and how we can go
with this that we'll see in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
