we have to define a method which is mean
which is service method and then we have
to create object of printwriter then you
can print hello world in fact when you
want to add two numbers we have to
create all the stuff plus we have to
create we have to fetch the data from
the request object right and for that we
have to define those two objects request
and response in case of JSP you get all
those objects by default right
that means JSP is much simpler to solve
it and from today will be what we will
be working only on JSP will not go for
subjects right but that's not the case
if that was the case then why would why
would anyone will learn sublet why I say
we can start with JSP so what if I say
what if I say JSP I mean you cannot run
JSP right you can only you can only
write code in JSP you cannot run JSP
it's because if you remember when you
work with Tomcat we have sub list right
so servlet runs on Tomcat because Tomcat
is also called as a servlet container
right that means in Tomcat you can only
run subnets you cannot do on JSP but
then we have seen the output right way
we have created our JSP page and we can
draw in JC page on Tomcat how that is
happening then servlet cannot run JSP so
what happens is as a programmer even if
you write a JSP code that JSP goal gets
converted into servlets right so it
doesn't matter if you even if you write
a JC page that is getting converted into
servlet the only advantage of writing
JSP is it is is it is easier for
developers to write JSP files instead of
working on service right so kosha is how
can you convert so it's actually not
served into JSP be of moving from server
to JS by topic but when you run it it
goes in this direction so you ijj page
and that's get converted into a servlet
but then how exactly is possible so let
me create so on the left hand side I
will create a sublet class and then on
right hand side you compare that with
JSP how exactly
odd or we can write a JC page here ok
let me just just let me just go for JSP
here and solve light here so how exactly
it's get converted so we have
so in JSP we have all the HTML tags
right so in Jace is all about HTML and
then somewhere in between we have Java
code right so let's say we have HTML tag
we have one guy on all those tags let's
also write body tag here so body open
and then somewhere here we have to close
body tag and then we have to close HTML
tag right we have done that now what
here so here are some where here what we
will do what we'll be doing is if you
want to write a Java for let's say if I
want to add two numbers so what I will
do is I will say int I equal to and we
know that we can use a request object
dot get parameter right and let me say
this is a get parameter method in fact
it just make it some smaller because I
have two excellent code error as well so
I will say this is a t1 right so I got
this value from t1 again you will say
this will give you string you have to
convert that into a teacher so let's say
I'm doing that here so I am saying
integer dot parseint and everything is
here okay so I am doing that I am doing
that stuff I am converting everything
right and then in the same line here we
will say in TJ equal to the same thing
now we caught these two values I want to
add these two values we can say int k
equal to I plus J and then we can say
out dot print and we can print the value
of K is that simple right so we can we
can assign those two values and we can
add those two values and then we can
print the output the same thing if you
want to do in servlet how how do you
normally do it right so let's let's
ignore this topic I mean let's ignore
this logic if I ask you to get a solve
it I mean it doesn't matter what you
want to do in the subject if I ask you
to create a servlet what is something
which comes to your mind
step one we have to pay the class right
you should provide the name of the class
you have to extend that class with HTTP
servlet then you have to create a method
or a service or maybe do get or do post
you have to pass two parameters the
question response you have to create
object of print writer and then you have
to close everything that means it does
not matter what is the logic of the
servlet
you have to do all these things and I
forgot one thing import the package
right so you have to do all those stuff
here it does not matter
what is the logic you have to do all
those things right so let's see if I if
I create a sublet here I will say public
plus and it will name this sublet as
demo sublet which extends of course
which extends HTTP servlet right we have
that thing that if I open this you have
to define a method which is which is a
service method right so I will say a
method service this service will take
two parameters request and response so
we got these two objects if I open this
in this we have to create object of
plain Twitter which is out and then we
have to do something we have to complete
something so this is the object of this
is the European minor object so it
doesn't matter what subject you want to
create this is something which is which
is there right your JSP says hey don't
worry if you want to write some logic
here like the logic right in JSP we are
not doing any of those stuff so what
happens is when you when you run JSP
page it will convert itself into a
servlet
so what it will do this is fixed right
but hold on there is something which we
have to define here the class name so
what happens is your JSP name is if this
is demo dot JSP your class we will
become it is demo
I mean demo JSP dot JSP
so that's your that's your class name
right so whatever file you have so I
just demo I mean not J's it is
demo JSP ok so then what our JSP will
become demo JSP there so whatever file
name you mentioned here that that will
make on your servlet name then that will
be extended by HTTP of it you don't have
to do it right it is that is which is
standard this is something which your
tomcat will give you it will say ok we
will give you our service method do get
a do post this to object will be
provided by your tomcat so whatever you
write inside this code whatever you
whatever you write inside this tag well
I mean this will go into the service
method so it will it will directly copy
paste so this will be copied here and
that's why you get this odd out object
you don't have to create a
out object in jail speeds because your
subject will give you that object you
don't have to create a request object
because your subject will give you that
request object you don't have to create
a response object because your servant
will give you that response object not
just this three objects even your
session object your application object
everything will be given by JSP I mean
you're talking server basically and
those objects are called as implicit
objects in JSP again we'll be seeing
that in this session in the future
sessions okay so yeah that's how it
works oh it gets converted from JSP to
sub like it's that awesome right now
what else I just have one more queries
here what do you call this what do you
call this servlet I'm in this tag not
serving this tag so this tag here in JSP
is called as scriptlet so your script
let so this tag which is angular bracket
percentage sign will be called as I mean
this sign will be called as scriptlet
okay now what else we order this or what
other thing we have see whatever you
write in this tag will go to your
service method white so so this code
will be coming here
so whatever write in this script light
will be coming in service method what if
you want something here I want to
declare the variable I will say int
let's say some other variable let's say
value I want to create a variable
something like this see whatever you
write inside script light will go to
this service method right I want
something here in the digression section
I want to declare some variables there
how can you do that if you like that
inside this tag it will go inside
service now was a choice so what we will
do is let's let me just expand this
imagine be happy we do have all those
things we have HTML tag we have body
tags over there so we have one more type
of one more tag here see if I use this
tag again it will go to service so what
I was saying see I want to put some data
which is not in service
ok I want to put some data or some
declaration or some statement which is
not that inside service it is outside
this service so we can use an operator
there so we can say not right so it is a
service but not service right so it is
declaration so this section
will be called as declaration so we can
so whatever you write inside this so if
I say ain't value equal to one so this
code will go inside the classes section
right so anyway you want to define any
variable which is which should be here
which is instance variables if you want
to create any method let's say with this
service I want one more method as show
so you can you can create a show method
inside this tag in the digression tag so
if you create a method here that method
will be going in the class so whatever
you go on inside the class and outside
the service method that will go into
declaration section perfect right do we
have one something more we have one more
in fact we have two moles the first one
is let's say if you want to import a
package in your file somebody somewhere
here you want to import a package maybe
date API maybe date class maybe database
Java class if you want to import any
package so what you're doing some it we
simply say import and then we line it
there right so normally we import the
packages outside the class
what about JSP where do I mention I want
to import the package so for JSP we have
one more tag in fact in fact I will
remove this sweet - JSP so we have one
more which is percentage at the rate
right so if you light in a crate you
have to say at an eight-page then we
have to say import and then we say equal
to double in double quotes you have to
mention Java dot util dot date and
percentage close so what am i right here
will go into your import package so
since you are mentioning import
attributes so that read something after
remember this import is an attribute we
have to assign the value to it
we say equal to and then we have to
mention the package name what if you
have multiple package we are just have
to give comma so it is Java dot util dot
date comma Java dot SQL dot prepare
statement comma Java or SQL Raj
statement we can have multiple comas and
we can assign a sign everything there
right so that's three tags so this is
script light this is declaration now
this tag is called as declarative
ah this is the gravity this is directive
my mistake so it is directive so this is
this is directive this is declaration
this is scriptlet now do we have one
more yes we have so let's say if you
want to print something session of using
print out dot print we can also use
angular bracket equal to so we have to
use angular bracket percentage equal to
K so whatever you write inside this tag
which is percentage equal to will go
inside out dot print K so whatever you
write inside this this tag which is
percentage equal to will go inside your
out dot print right is that also right
so this tag here is called as expression
so we have four types of tags and JSP we
have directive so directive goes as so
if you want to import the package if you
want to do any or any other extra stuff
that is directive if you want to write
something inside the class outside the
service method example method definition
variable declaration you can do that in
declaration section so we have to use
percentage not if you want to write
something in the service method we have
to use angular bracket percentage
presentation angular bracket that is
your scripted tag if you want to write
something in out dot printed and
directly we can use the expression tag
right so this is JSP for you so whatever
whenever you create a JSP page it's get
converted into a servlet right so even
if you're adding a JSP it will make it
into servlet so again which is better
depends if you want to show data on the
page okay if you if you if your
intention is to create a page Jace is
better right but if your intention is
just to process it for that we have
sublet again which one to use when that
we'll see in the next video so that's it
that's it thank you so much for watching
