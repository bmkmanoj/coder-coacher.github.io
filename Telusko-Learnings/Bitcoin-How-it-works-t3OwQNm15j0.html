the current types of Bitcoin is
approximately fifteen thousand dollars
and if you convert that into Indian
currency it comes out to be one point 1
million rupees last year in March the
price was approximately one thousand
dollars and in nowadays giant ozone 18
and the price is 15 so you can imagine
the exponential group of from 1 to 15 so
in this video we'll talk about what is
Bitcoin and what is so important now
welcome back aliens my name is Ivan
vetti and let's get started
so what is Bitcoin so Bitcoin is
basically a currency which is digital
and which uses cryptography and that's
why we also term it as a digital crypto
currency now when you think about
cryptography you always think about
encryption right so to be specific in
cryptography we use this asymmetric
cryptography when you have two keys the
private and public one now we use this
public key to encrypt data so that we
can use private key to decrypt but then
we don't use cryptography in Bitcoin to
achieve secret Ness we achieve
cryptography we use cryptography in
Bitcoin to achieve authentication how do
you know if you transfer money who is
transferring it and that's why we use
this cryptographic concept but I can
even come back to that but before that
let's talk about the history of Bitcoin
so bitcoin is invented in 2008 by a
pseudo name called Satoshi Nakamoto from
that time there's so much of development
is happening in the Bitcoin world
Bitcoin is open-source and that means
the volunteers were why they are
contributing to a Bitcoin technology
it's not just a currency it's a whole
set of new technology we can use if you
want to know what about the code format
of Bitcoin just go to github and search
for Bitcoin there's a huge depository
for Bitcoin and every 5 or 1 week
there's a new updates to the Bitcoin
network Bitcoin is also a technology so
what it has so it has four parts the
first one which is a decentralized
peer-to-peer network which is also your
Bitcoin protocol the second one it
maintains a public ledger now when we
talk about that ledger how to build that
ledger but of course we need a ledger so
that we can maintain all the
transactions and then we have some set
of rules which we also call them as
pence
rules the fourth one is the proof of
work how can you make sure the
transaction is complete how can you
authenticate it now if you talk to if
you go back to the first point which is
peer-to-peer network Bitcoin is a beer -
peer network which also means that we
don't have any central body example in
real world if you want to send a message
now we use peer-to-peer network if you
want to play an online game videos
peer-to-peer network but what about
online transaction we use a set we use a
bank in between ready even if you are
using a online wallet for to transfer
money we still have a bank in between
and Bitcoin says no more banks you can
transfer money from one place to another
place by using a peer-to-peer network
now how exactly Bitcoin looks like
something like this know how what about
this one
exactly Bitcoin looks like this that is
nothing you cannot see Bitcoin you
cannot touch Bitcoin because it's
nothing in real world the Bitcoin only
works in virtual world as I mentioned
before as I always mention we are aliens
why we live in what should world and
bitcoin is a currency for the aliens so
what can you do with Bitcoin you can buy
products you can sell products and you
can convert that bitcoins into real
currency and you can convert a real
currency into a Bitcoin but kahshanna is
how you how can you buy a Bitcoin let's
say if you want to buy a Bitcoin now how
can you buy it so you want to buy a
Bitcoin you have to pay fifteen thousand
dollars and we don't have that much of
an amount now what can you do can you
buy so let's say if you have ten dollars
now if you have one dollar now can you
buy a Bitcoin and the answer is yes
because the smallest unit of a Bitcoin
is also called a Satoshi so it's 100
million Satoshi is one Bitcoin so if you
want to convert that into one dollar so
if you have only one dollar now you can
even buy approximately 6,500 Satoshi and
if we have one rupee don't worry you can
still buy 100 Satoshi
now push allies who create bitcoins
because in real world we have authority
who will who will print money right but
what about bitcoins now bitcoins are
created by a process called as mining
and what is mining and who will do the
mining so mei-ling's odd mining is done
by miners now the question would be who
are miners then to understand this let's
go back to the transaction let's say if
you
want to transfer money so if a person a
wants to transfer money to person B now
in this case you are transferring a
Bitcoin right now of course there should
be someone who will do the analysis of
the school so if you trust if you
transfer money or if you've transferred
Bitcoin from a to P every transaction
will be a part of a block right so let's
say at this point if in let's say in
this two seconds
we have hundred people who are doing
transactions so we have 100 transactions
you can combine all those transactions
you can put that in a block now this
block will have lot of mathematical
problems or it will be having one big
puzzle now the question is who will
solve the puzzle and if you can solve
that puzzle that is what is you call as
a mining so you need huge computers you
cannot do it by your brain okay you
cannot look at those puzzles and say ok
this is the answer it will take a lot of
time you can do that we are superpower
right
humans are superpower so we can't do
anything but then we need huge computers
who can who can solve this problem and
when you say a computer you also need a
dedicated CPU and a GPU as well so
nowadays people buy GPUs to solve that
problem and if you can solve that
problem you will be called as a miner
and we have so many people around the
world who are miners so every block so
let's say the moment I do a transaction
that transaction will be a part of a big
block and that block will be broadcasted
throughout the network for to all the
miners right so let's say if you have
1,000 miners in the world now they all
will be getting this block but question
arise why they will mind this so what
about what they will do is they will try
to calculate they will tow some of the
puzzle and whoever solves the puzzle
first they will win but then what will
you what you will get after winning you
will get bitcoins so currently you will
be getting 12.5 bitcoins for the block
transaction right so if you win in the
block you will be getting 12.5 again
this will change in future so how do you
generate bitcoins by mining so every
time you saw a block you generate new
bitcoins so you will get a reward of
those bitcoins because of course right
if you are giving your computer for
processing yet you ask you're wasting so
much of resources like electricity to
buy those hardware's then of course you
want some reward right and you get
bitcoins now can you be a mind
of course you can be so what you have to
do is you have to buy hardware you have
to build this stack the pedicle stack
which we have which we have talked about
you can build that stack and you can be
a miner now question is can you trust
Bitcoin what if you do a transaction and
if something goes wrong can you get your
money back and the answer is no in
really what venues credit card when you
use debit card we can actually roll back
the transaction in Bitcoin you cannot do
that
because we don't have any central
authority right so the only way to get
your money back is by talking that
person who have sent it you have sent
the amount so if you had transfer the
amount to be and you can ask behave
please return a little Mike bit bitcoins
to me so you cannot get your money back
but why what is happening behind the
scene so what happens is with the block
which we have talked about so let's say
we have hundred transaction that hundred
transaction becomes a part of a block
now this block becomes a part of a
blockchain so in this world we have a
public ledger which is a blockchain now
it is blockchain a series of blocks
every time you do a transaction that
becomes a part of a block and that block
will be assigned to a blockchain so we
have a big blockchain there and your new
block will be attached to this
blockchain now how can you guarantee
that you your transition is done now
more transactions let's say after 10
minutes we have some more transaction
let's say after one hour you are doing
some more transactions so in your drop
in that one are in the global if you if
you are completing six blocks because
one block will be solved in ten minutes
right so if you have many transactions
if it is part of one block so one block
will be solved or the problem will be
solved in ten minutes right and if you
if you in in one hour you will be having
six blocks so once you complete those
six blocks now you can come now you can
guarantee that your transaction is
complete that's how you build trust in
the Bitcoin world and the trust is built
thanks to the concept of blockchain now
I'm not saying bitcoins the biggest
thing but then the technology which will
change in future or which will change
the future because blockchain and
Bitcoin is not only for the currency
they can be implemented at different
places as well example they can be
maintained for the government officials
where you can we can also implement that
in a voting system and we can also
implement that with with hospitals with
Google searches and it will be getting
implemented
future and all the places I hope you've
got some idea about Bitcoin from this
video let me know in the comments
section if you have liked it and what
more you want in the content we I will
try to make one more video on this about
the in detail how exactly Bitcoin works
in the in the future so yeah that's it I
hope you enjoyed click on the like
