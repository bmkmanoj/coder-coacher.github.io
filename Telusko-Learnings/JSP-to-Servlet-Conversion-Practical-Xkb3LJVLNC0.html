ready and in the last video we have seen
that whenever you write a JSP it's get
converted into servlet and we have seen
the theory of it right
in this video we'll see the
implementation for that now just to
implement it I am using and NetBeans IDE
we can also do that with Eclipse but
then NetBeans provide you one feature
which is you can actually see the
converted servlet of a JSP to do that
let me get a project here and I will I
will make a web project and I will name
this project as demo JSP because we
wanted to see the the implementation for
JSP now this server I'm using is a here
is a glassfish you can also use Tomcat
that's fine
let's send next and finished we don't
want any of the frameworks here ok so
once you got this estate once we got
this project we don't known as tml I
want a jay-z page so what I will do is
in this in this project I will say new
and let me make a JSP and i will name
this JSP as i think you can have hello
dot JSP and say this is hello
or hello dot JSP and when you click on
finish ok so you've got your JC page
here right and we can write java code
now now as we know if you want to write
a Java code inside inside JSP in fact
before doing that let me just run this
code just to see if it is if it is
giving the output so I will say run file
it will take some time to load ok so you
can see we got the output as hello world
in your internet explorer browser
okay so we got hello world right but
then we don't want hello world we want
to execute some Java code so what we
will do is we'll write our script it the
way we do so this is our script tag and
inside this I will write some Java code
so what Java code I will write I will
simply say hello world but then this
time I will not print hello world from
here I want to print hello world from my
java code so I will say out dot print Ln
and here I will write hello boy and if I
give a semicolon just to run this code
once again so that you run this code
and you can see if I go back to my
browser it says okay it says to the
right content okay let's run this once
again okay so you can see we got hello
world I guess some other file was
running there so we got hello world here
now this time it is from out dot pland
so as I mentioned everything gets
converted into servlet right can we see
a serve it of this it net means you can
option off so when you right click on
your file in it means you get an option
of view servlet so you can also see how
this getting then how this is getting
converted so if I click on view servlet
you can see the class so the class its
create is the video file name itself so
the JSP file name is hello dot JSP the
class then becomes hello hello - JSP it
extends a class called as HTTP JSP base
I mean you don't have to by heart this
but then knowing it will not in make any
harm right so so that is one thing
now this service method normally in do
get in servlet will I do get do post
here we have underscore JSP service so
this is the method which we actually use
and if you can observe all these objects
are have been created here and that's
why we say you know JSP has all the
implicit objects by default because it
is there with you so you can see we got
all the objects of enable here and you
also have out the out view is to use and
this out is an object of JSP writer ok
now all these objects actually given by
the container but then you can refer
this with the help of this code ok and
then the code the statement which we
have written is out dot println right
and you will find that in instantly in
this code you can see that we got out
dot println so whatever you write inside
scriptlet becomes a part of your service
but then what if you want something
which should not be a part of a service
so I will go back here and example if I
if I create a variable if I say int I
equal to nine but I don't want this
variable I to be created inside my
inside myself inside my service method
so example if I click on view socket now
and if I see is it mink related I don't
think so let's run this code once again
just to get that file so I will write
like this and say one us one run file so
that it will compile the file once again
and now if I see the JSP or if I see
this outlet of this so if I click on
view servlet and let's go up can you see
that we got IND I equal to nine but this
int I will a nine is a part of service
method I don't want it to be a part of
service method I want to declare this
outside and that's why we have to use a
special tag which is a digression tag so
if I say percentage and not now this
becomes part of your scriptlet I mean
this this becomes part of your class
right but not the method so if I declare
a variable here if I say int I equal to
nine and if I remove it from here now
since we are declaring that in a
declaration tag now it becomes a part of
before checking everything we have to
run this file so that you will get the
composition of the other thing and now
if I click on view servlet you can see
int I equal to nine is not a part of the
method but if you scroll up and somebody
will find int a equal to nine so you can
see we got int a equal to nine in the
declaration section right so that's how
we do it that's how you use those two
tags so if you want to write something
in this service method we can write we
can use this scripted tag which is this
one if you want to write something
outside the method you can use the
equation tag we can also achieve the
percentage which we have discussed the
the expression tag so if you remember so
if I say this one the expression tag now
here if I mention something if I say I
want to print the value of I so when I
when I try to print the value of I here
if I right click and run you can see I'm
just writing I but in the if I if I see
this servlet one of this if I write like
this and if I say view servlet again
okay
now you will you can see if I scroll
down the I is actually a part of println
or print right so whatever right inside
the expression type becomes a part of
out dot print and in the same way we can
also go for
maybe import so let's say if you want to
input a package so what we can do is you
can write at a percentage a percentage
ad rate and you can mention page then
you have to mention input and when I say
import Java dot util dot date now what
will happen is it will import data to
the package okay now when it will import
I mean where it will be coming where
that input will be there so in normal
classes we do that at the start of the
class right or sort of the file and if I
look that look look for that here and if
I scroll up can see the import now so in
import we also have Java dot util dot
date and this is your detective right so
we have these four tags in in JSP and
whenever you write this code it gets
converted into servlet so Tomcat don't
run JSP but then also do you file gets
one nothing to solve it and you can use
sublet on Tomcat so yeah that's that's
how you get you get you convert your JSP
into servlet and that's how you write
all this codes so I hope you enjoyed
