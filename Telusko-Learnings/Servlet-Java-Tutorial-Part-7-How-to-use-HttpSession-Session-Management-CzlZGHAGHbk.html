have seen how to call a servlet from a
servlet so we can either use required
dispatcher or we can use a send redirect
and this video will see just to go with
the same example but let's expand
something now in this what I will do is
let me add one name so let me get one
more field we'll say enter your name
okay and here let me type it as text and
we'll give name as t1 okay so I have a
text field here and I need also need a
break tag which will break the
connection or break the line so I will
be having a text field or text box then
a break and then I button okay it will
look something in this way so it's nice
1/2 okay let me just go back and the
first so this it will this is how it
will look like if I say the name is
nubbin and if I click on ok so sure
printing in seconds of it I want to say
welcome nubbin okay so for that what we
can do is so the first sublet in shelf
using response dots and redirect let me
use a request dispatcher okay I think I
have directed the input so we'll just
say ctrl shift I now so if I call the
second sovereignty problem is this name
t1 it will come here in this sublet
right so I can access t1 here so let's
see how to access the one here so what
we'll do is we'll take a string STR and
how to fetch data so whenever you send
the request it the data will be in the
request object so I will say request dot
getparameter and in this we have to
mention the name of the field which is
t1 ok so you can see we have t1 here so
data will be coming from this HTML page
to the servlet in t1 tag and then we
have to fetch in STR and and we'll print
here itself
we'll say s out and we'll print STR
okay just within demonstration and if I
run this now go back to this and if I
say nubbin and if I click on this okay
button so you can see it falls in egg
and solid because we are not printing
anything on the webpage I am printing on
the console so let me go back to the
output window and here so I can see this
there is something else moving so that
means we can access the database is in
the text box in the first object let me
try the same thing let me just cut this
thing here cut and let me paste the same
thing inside seconds of it we'll see if
it is working this cut in this position
so let me just go back to my page and if
I say nubbin and okay
so it says I can solve it if I go to my
console okay and you can see it is
saying now in okay that means we are
able to pass the data from from the
first page to the last page okay and how
it's walking we are sending data in t1
which goes to this servlet in the
request object and then you are sending
the same object the same object to
second servlet in this fashion okay so
we are saying forward so you are sending
the same object and this object goes to
second servlet here and then you are
able to face the data that means you can
you can send t1 from the first server to
the now servlet it's working right now
let me go back let me just come in this
part and let me use response dots and we
Dalek which also sends a request right
and when I run this so it says enter
your name I will say now in and if I
click on ok it says in second servlet
let's see the console window and you can
say the output is null kahshanna is why
when you send a request when you click
on this okay button it will create a
request object in which will be having
t1 cool it will go to the first servlet
now first subject says ok I have this
take requests but doesn't matter I'm not
using that request I am just sending a
response to a client saying go to second
serve it so this response will go to
client and client will create a new
request which will go to second servlet
so this request is not the request in
the first servlet so this is the new
request and in that new request if we
don't have t1 t1 was there in the last
request right and as the problem then
question arise how to solve this I want
to get this t1 in this file also so what
we can do is basically we have to work
with different scopes by default we are
working with the quill we are we are
working with the request scope which
means your data will be there only for
the request scope which is this one as
it was changes your data will gone now
what we need the second type of scope we
can use this session okay now this
session session will be there throughout
your example exam you know when you run
when you go to Facebook when you log
into your Facebook you can access
multiple pages without even login you
know what you have to just log in once
and then you can you can you navigate
throughout the website you can click on
any link and you don't have to log in
once again because you are in the
session right you say la god then it
will you know it will invalidate a
session so if I click on ok so it will
go to the second socket from first
server to second servlet and they will
be in the same session so what I will do
is instead of using request scope let me
use succession scope how to use session
scope you have to first create object of
HTTP session which is the interface let
me import the package okay so if I go to
your sheet EP session it's an interface
with lots of methods so you can see we
have lots of methods will be using this
method which is said attribute and will
be using can attribute well so let me
create object as will say session itself
now question is how to create object op
HTTP session which is the interface
right so what we can do is we can use
the quest dot there is a method called
as get session
now get session is responsible to give
you object of HTTP session
good and let me add that data which is
this request object e1 first of all let
me just get that t1 here so we say
string STR equal to a session in our
session we have because the request
objects will say request dot
getparameter and we'll fetch it from t1
now once you've got that data from t1
which is steered I will put that data
into session now how to put that data
into session we have to say set
attribute we have to mention a key what
is against bug also cell label so we'll
say this label as t1 okay just for the
name Vicki were using t1 and the data we
are passing is STR so this STR we are
passing here the label for that STR is
p1 okay so now we are into session now
what we have to do is in the second
servlet we have to fetch that data now
how to fetch we do we cannot fetch from
request right is because in request we
have a new request now but we are the
same session so it's your request we
have to say session
okay now this session it's an object of
HTTP session we have to get out that
object here also so we say session from
the current session so it's a request
dot get session ok and then giving
update for the package package imported
ok now when you work with session see
here when you work with session we are
setting the attribute ok
that means in this file we have to get
the attribute so we cannot send we
cannot get the parameter we have to get
the attribute ok which is t1 but the
problem is this gate attribute will give
you object we what we want is spring so
we have to convert this object type into
string type by using two string method
that's it now once you got the data you
can print it so let's try so let me go
back to this file let me say it one and
it says it's passing a name I will say
nubbin and if I click on ok it says
second second servlet let me go back to
console and the last file you can see
the answer is nothing
cool right so because we have in the
same
but I don't want to paint it on the
console I want to print it on the files
so instead of printing in seconds of it
I will print a welcome and plus STR okay
so we have made some changes let me go
back to my file let me refresh this page
I will say this time move in and if I
click on OK it says welcome novel goal
so we are sending a data from the HTML
page which goes to first solve it and
the second servlet and throughout this
session we are maintaining the same data
okay and how to do it with the help of
HTTP session so that's it from this
video so in this video talk about
request scope and session scope in the
next part we'll talk about application
spoke okay so thanks for watching and do
