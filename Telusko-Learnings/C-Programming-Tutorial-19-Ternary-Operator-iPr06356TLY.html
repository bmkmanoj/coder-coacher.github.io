so now we already know how to work with
if and else so we have an example here
within which we have variable I which is
equal to 1 and we have J which is equal
to 0 so we are applying a condition
which is if I is equal to equal to 1
we'll assign a value to J as 5 else
we'll assign a value to J as 6 right now
since the value of I is 1 it will it
will it will give you the result which
is 1 which is a true value so this will
execute so the value of J will be 5 and
then you are when you run this the
output will be 5 right so let's run this
and here we go we got the output as 5
simple now we can replace this treatment
here so we can provide a comment there
and we can replace this statement with
the help of ternary operator now to use
ternary operator ternary operator works
with this syntax which is called as
question mark and : so we have to
provide a condition here so if there
will be a condition so if that condition
is true if that that condition evaluates
to true it will execute the part after
question mark so let's say this is
expression 1 otherwise if the condition
is false if it this condition returns
fall it will execute expression 2 so
let's implement this here so the
condition we are working on is I equal
to equal to 1 so we'll say J equal to it
is condition is I equal to equal to 1
that's your condition if this is true
then the value of J will be 5 otherwise
the value of J will be 6 simple right
and now if we run this you got 5 but
let's change the value of I let's make
it 2 now if I run this the value will be
6 it is because the condition is false
so it will not execute will not take
this value it will take this value of
the : so this thing here is called as
ternary operator so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
