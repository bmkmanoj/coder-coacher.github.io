languages are there in the world maybe
five ten maybe 50 maybe 100 maybe 1,000
make a guess and the answer is there are
more than 10,000 languages available in
the market I mean think about this why
would anyone would create 10,000
languages right it's because there is
not one person is making all these
languages right there are different
people working on this programming
languages in fact I feel you know if you
are walking on I mean if you are if you
are doing your PhD if you are doing some
research and you will deal to thinking
you know we have lots of programming
languages can we create our own language
which which we better than this in fact
sometime I feel that C programming is
best sometimes I feel PHP is good
sometimes filled Java is best and then
you know I think can we just merge all
these concepts and then come up with a
new language and that's why we are
getting new languages every new every
year or every two years
so then approximately tenth of the
languages and how many we know maybe via
we heard about maybe a 2030 and how many
how many we know is a programming
language maybe one or two right so in
this in this video we'll talk about this
series of programming languages not all
not 10000 but then we'll talk about this
is a programming language which is
taught from 1843
so welcome back aliens I'm having three
different eyes colored things and in
this video we'll talk about history of
programming languages so let's start
with the first programming language I
mean can you guess in which year we got
the programming language
maybe 1990s now because C came before
that maybe 1960's no because they were
languages before that as well what if I
say the first programming language came
in 19th century I will you I know you
will not believe that because the first
computer itself came in 20th century
right so what happened you know you
heard about Charles Babbage like the
father of computer and in 1822 when
Charles Babbage was working on the
mechanical computer and so he thought
about a concept where you can actually
implement a computer in fact before that
in 16th century there was a temple his
computer person who calculates you know
as a person if I use a calculator I will
be called as a computer and that will be
awesome right calling human sized
computers but then this generation we
talk about devices which are computers
right so in 1818 22 Charles Babbage came
up with a concept of mechanical computer
and with with him those are there's a
lady called as lady other Ada lavance
on lowlands he she created the first
programming language everything was
awesome everyone thought you know that
would be that will change everything in
future but then the problem is in fourth
for next 70 years there were not any
language I mean can you imagine that we
got the first language in 1843 I guess
and then out of the after that we got
the second language around in second I
guess Second World War or maybe after
that in fact you might you might have
heard about Alan Turing during second
one Second World War
Alan Turing came with the concept of
Turing machine because you know in
Second World War they wanted to decrypt
the message and to decrypt the message
it was mathematicians job to decrypt the
message and then you know it was very
difficult for them to decrypt a message
by people and that's why you give me the
concept of computer let's create a
computer who will decrypt the message
that was Turing machine and in fact at
that time it was awesome and then you
know people thought okay that's that's
what computer will be a computer will be
a machine
use in which you have to give the input
and it will process your data and it
will give you give the output but then
they wanted sound way to interact with
the Machine and they came in the concept
of electronic machines instead of going
for the mechanical devices they give me
the concept of electronic machine and
maybe in 1940s or late 1940s they can be
the concept of electronic machine where
it will be having vacuum cubes right I
mean can you imagine vacuum tubes I
don't know the size of I came to but
then it was a very big machine it's like
the first computer was so small and can
you imagine so small it was it was so
small - it used to take only four rooms
there's one room it used to take four
rooms just to accommodate at one
computer huge right not small so it was
a very big machine and it was working
with a vacuum tubes so they thought
about let's reduce the size of it they
instead of going for vacuum tubes they
went for semiconductors they went for
transistors right and then they also
thought about let's greater CPU because
you can program CPU right you can ask
CPU to do things for you
now what happens you know we always say
computers are intelligent devices they
asked Mart I mean do you think computers
are intelligent than than humans not
exactly computers are not intelligent
than humans because computer can do only
those things which humans say as human
ask them to do right now how can you
talk to computer is it easy to talk to
computer yes if you can use a common
language which I mean a computer and
human can understand right and that's
why they come with the concept of
machine language so it is machine
language now it's a language which is
which works with zero as one which is
been a language right so just imagine if
you want to talk to a computer using
zeros and one that will not be a good
wait I just imagine you know you have a
computer with you and then you're
talking to computer hey one zero one
zero zero one but the thing is committed
understand but a computer gives you a
response that will be difficult to
decrypt right so that's the issue the
second thing is let's imagine if you are
talking to someone on Facebook using 1
to 1 and 0 to 0 0 0 I mean just imagine
if you are saying 1 2 1 0 0 0 then you
will be getting some bad words on the
other side so you have to make sure that
you don't use those language with humans
and that was difficult for humans to
work with that language so we wanted a
language using which actually a that
language should be somewhere similar to
and then it should be also
understandable by computerize also and
that's where they give me the concept of
assembly language now assuming language
was low level language now when you say
low level language it means your
computer CPU can understand that what
exactly that language means there is
there will be only interpretation so you
just like you just you just have to
write the code and your CPU will
understand what you are saying but that
was a semi language and it was awesome
now the thing is assembly is a low-level
language not structured properly it was
having lots of problems creating big
software's in fact usually it was good
to work with normal CPUs but now we are
living in a generation where you have
octa-core CPUs where you can where you
will be having huge amount of data to
work with so assembly is not that
efficient in that case and that's why we
came is the concept of high level
languages now is the high level
languages there were lots of languages
at that time mostly at that time when
you say computers they should they used
to only use for scientific purpose
research purpose maybe mathematician we
used to use that maybe for rocket
launching I don't know at that time it
was launching it but then they were
using this computers only for that
purpose so they wanted a language using
which they can actually work with maps
and they came with the concept of for
train and for train came in here it came
in here 1957 now if you don't know the
full form of Fortran is very is it is
formula translation that means you can
convert your mathematical codes into our
programming codes everything everything
was good then they also gave me the
concept of Lisp which is least processor
and as field at least this is P and it
was also used for maths but then all the
languages are made for mash like what
about business because b we also we also
want a language to work with business
right and they give you the concept of
COBOL now COBOL stands for common
business oriented language so everything
was good we got for train we got list we
got regard COBOL but then you know let's
say we got all this languages now and
you want to teach in fact after this
also they got lots of languages we got B
language we've got BCPL but then let's
say if I am a teacher if I were to teach
a programming language to a person it
was very difficult to teach all these
languages because there were different
languages and different perspective
right
so we wanted our language using which
you can actually teach programming to
people and that's where Pascal came into
picture so in 1970 they got a language
called as Pascal now Pascal using Pascal
you can teach to people and then later
it was also implemented for business
purpose you can actually use Pascal to
make software's and everything was good
we got Pascal then in late night late
1970s or maybe late 1960s at that time
there was a guy called as Ken Thompson
and then he thought you know we have
lots of languages in fact ken Thompson
that time also created one more language
for this B language I don't know if you
have heard about that we also have a B
language now B language was there and
everyone was happy we got all these
languages but then if you heard about
this we also had one mode os at that
time OS which is called as Unix you and
I see s and I know you are talking about
you and I X white now the earlier one
was you and I see s and then it was made
in assembly language so Ken Thompson
wanted to redesign that OS using a what
you say a modern language so he thought
about gently use Pascal and can be used
B language no can be use some other
language and then he thought about let's
create a complete language because see
all these languages have their own way
of working right I mean there they were
used for specific reason so you won't
take a language which will be complete
language and that's where they came with
the concept of C language now ken
Thompson with Dennis Ritchie they gave
you the concept of C programming and
again it was made in Bell Laboratories
now you might you might have heard about
that lab right so we have all these
languages like C++ C made in Bell Labs
so record see everyone was happy in fact
C is also called as mother of all the
languages because it is the first
complete language you can do anything
you want you can build a networking
services you can build OS you can build
embedded software you can do everything
using C language but there is a trick
here the trick is what if C in real life
we work with objects right in fact the
thing which I'm holding here it's an
object the thing which is behind me it's
an object the thing which is shooting me
here is an object right in fact are
these things around me those are objects
but in in virtual world
is your programming world we are walking
with C language so everything is good we
got see we got regard object answer
how can you merge this because in real
life we use objects in virtual world
which is programming world we use
procedures can we use C language with
objects and it is tricky right how can
we use objects in C that's not possible
and that's where there were a group of
people they were working on this concept
and they gave me the concept of object
you see I mean that means we can have a
C language and then let's introduce
objects in that and your job is done
right in fact the awesome thing is in
object you see if you want to use C
program you can use that if you want to
include object you can do that it is
very flexible and at the same time there
was a guy who a scientist roster and he
was working on C++ I mean at the same
time you are having two languages
Objective C and C++ both derived to form
C language and both were introducing
object concept and everything was good
you know we had object you see we have
C++ but the question is which one you
will prefer example let's go back to
1983 it was a year 1983 yes so let's go
back to 1983 and now and let's say if
you are the Pali student or maybe you
are working on a project and if I ask
you to choose one one language which one
you will choose mostly people went for
C++ because it sounds much similar to C
right and object you see was kind of
weird because it was working with object
the only company who adopted object you
see was next in fact you you might have
heard about this if you talk about
colleges they teach you C++ right they
in industry also via C++ it's only the
Apple environment now which is using
Objective C and you try to can do Apple
programming using Objective C or using
Swift
why not C++ because they have not used
C++ why everyone is not using object you
see that's a question right we will
answer this question in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
