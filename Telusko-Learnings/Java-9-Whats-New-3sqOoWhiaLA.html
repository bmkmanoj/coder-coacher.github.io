ready
and finally Java 9 is here now you might
be wondering there's so many verses
which are used now like in fact there
are some colleges some universities they
are using Java 6 companies are using
Java 7 they are moving to Java 8 now and
Java 9 is already here
is it worth learning Java 9 features or
is it something very different and the
answer is yes it's very different from
the earlier versions in fact in Java 9
we have one of the amazing project which
is released which is called as project
jigsaw now jigsaw is something very
different again we talked about in some
time but then jigsaw was supposed to be
I mean it started in 2000 2008 so they
thought okay let's release jigsaw
project in Java 7
but then due to some problem they were
not able to complete the entire stuff so
that's they thought ok let's do that
into the in Java 8 so Java 7 they were
not able to do that so Java 8 the
problem was because of some security
issues and stability problems so they
thought okay let's nothing let's not do
that in Java 8 let's do it in Java and 9
and finally we got jigsaw project in
Java and 9 right
so they pillage started in 2008 and then
they delayed it they started they
actually worked 2014 when your Java 8
was released and then from last 3 years
they are working on this project so they
delete they delayed the launch from 2015
2016 2017 and finally Java 9 is here so
other than what are the new features so
one we have what they discussed about
one of the feature is jigsaw project but
what exactly jigsaw is so to understand
jigsaw again we'll make a detailed video
on that or what exactly jigsaw is what
is other concepts but then to understand
jigsaw you have to understand the
concept of modularity
so in Java 9 they have introduced
something else modules so what what
happens is think about this when you
make a project right every project needs
a jar file which is RT dot jar right
which is one time charge and it has all
the classes which which we normally use
right example if we talk about your a
string class if we talk about your or
system plus all these classes belongs to
this package which is our T dot jar now
a little jar does not only have all I
mean small classes it has so many
classes there are approximately
thousands of classes there are
proximately 4400 class
just imagine you have all these classes
in one jar file question arise do we
only use all the classes see every
project is different right when you when
I work on a project I have a different
set of requirements when you work on a
budget you have a different set of
requirements and you'll be using some
other classes why you have to use all
the classes I mean while you can
download that added or jarred right
why don't you can take part of it is it
possible in Java not 8 not possible
right in Java and 9 they said ok let's
divide the jdk itself so what they did
they created the modules in JDK 9 right
so they're approximately 94 modules
approximately 94 so you can so if you
want only this subset of features you
can use only those one so you can
specify the I need this module and it
this module I need this module and they
also have module dependencies so example
if you have this module which works only
with this module you mentioned that you
want to use this it will use this module
automatically again I know that's
different
different topic but then we have a
concept of modules then you might be
thinking okay that's which dedicate
that's what dedicated right if you are
working on a project what you have to do
with Jake module now since JDK itself is
modular dies what if you when you make a
project why to make up single job and
you can make when you can make multiple
modules and that's why the programming
so modular Java programming is on the
way so if you are building a project now
you can think about this concept of
modular programming so that's one thing
they have introduced right so jigsaw is
all about modularity so if you had
talked about that RT Dodds right okay
now that's the one thing that's the
first which I have introduced the second
one which is my favorite and I will not
name that now but then just think about
this all right let's say if you want to
teach a Java or someone in fact if we
talk about schools and colleges they are
teaching Python now so initially they
should teach Java but now they are
moving towards Python for one reason for
multiple reasons one of these in is it
is very famous nowadays and rostov
companies that are using Python the
second reason is python is bit easier to
teach example think about this if you
want to teach someone Python what you
will do for the first kind of code you
will you will teach is print right so
you will you will you will teach them
how to print hello world
so what you will do you will say print
so it's very simple you can simply say
print and hello world it works so I do
get the output but think about if you
think about this if you want
teach the same thing in Java what you
will do in fact I face this issue a lot
so when I teach Java it's very easy for
me to teach the later modules example
how these arrays what is collections I
can teach that very very comfortably the
problem starts when I when I would have
started the first good because the first
would itself if you want to print
HelloWorld
you cannot simply do that you have to
write a class you have to get a method
and that to public static void main and
I have to explain everything right what
what I do I say ok we'll discuss about
this thing later let's only focus on the
println right yet right so approximately
six lines of code just to print
HelloWorld
right so what's wrong with Java so Java
is good I mean everything is good the
only problem is it is difficult to teach
Java and it let's say that's the first
problem difficult to teach the second
problem is if you want to test a small
amount of code so let's say if you are
working on some algorithms and if you
have a code with you of three to four
lines just to execute that you have to
write the entire class or methods can
you test all the type it will of code
does it second problem the third problem
is if you have if you already have an
API with you and okay somebody says ok
hey and I mean this this is my new API
you can test it now even to test that
API you have tried the entire class
right and time methods can you test this
API with only one or two lines and to
solve this issue
we got something called a Snapple in
Java now everybody is very famous in
other languages like Queen Python so
that will stands for it is our is read
he is eval that ripple is pp is print
and alias loop so you can do that
continuously sets its label right now
ripple is very famous you can directly
type decline and you will get the output
it also called as interactive console
what you get in Python or what you get
in in scala also we have the same thing
you can get the interactive tool it's
there with multiple languages and
finally it's there with Java so if
you're the teacher if you want to teach
Java to someone now you don't have to
teach a class you don't have to teach a
method you can take you start with
system dot out dot print and that it
that feature was introduced in the in
the in the form of J shell so in java
jdk 9 we have ripple with the help of J
shell so Jason is very awesome you can
write up what you can write one line of
code you can test it or you can you can
right small amount of quota contested
again we'll talk about agile later in
detail but yes we have gel as a feature
the next feature we have is so in Java 8
what are they then of the thing which I
loved is stream API so in Java 8 we got
lambda expression because stream API so
it was good right it was a it was
initial release for stream now in Java 9
they have also they have enhanced it
okay they have added some more features
and now you can enjoy working on streams
so initially you can you you were
working on streams and now you can enjoy
working on stream with new features
right in fact if you have not learned
Java 8 I would recommend first you learn
Java 8 because Java 9 has defined way of
working with it right so first learn
Java 8 learn about lambda expression
learn about stream API and then you can
learn about Java 9 it will make more
sense right next and enhancement they
have okay so this announcement is
awesome so initially you know when you
talk about interfaces till Java 7 you
cannot define method or interface okay
you cannot define it oh can you declare
it right so you can I'll just put
semicolon at the end but in Java 8 they
said okay and now you can define methods
again due to some different different
problems if you watch my Java 8 videos
you will get to know what I'm talking
about but then yes you can define
methods and interface in Java 8 in Java
9 they said okay you can also define
private methods now I know of only
public methods now you can also have
private methods right just to have that
you know if you wanted if you have a
method in your interface and if you want
to perform some extra operations you can
you can define a method a itself which
you only want that particular method to
use so no other no other methods can use
it so we can do that right so now in
Java 9 we can have interfaces which can
have private methods defined right and
no one can override of course so it is a
private method so that's that's the
feature of of Java online so there are
lots of features we have also introduced
enough HTTP 2 protocol 2 features I can
touch into beta testing now I don't know
when they will be releasing it but then
yes they we have so many features they
they have some small they have some
small increments in the JDK itself and
for JVM we have a new tab we have G bunk
a garbage collector now again we'll talk
about that later but yes we have some
enhancement in JVM level as well so Java
9 is awesome right compared to the
earlier wash
every time I think Java 9 I mean Java
will be going away because of these new
languages but don't worry Java is coming
with new versions to solve all those
issues in 2013 I was thinking about
moving to Scala now we call Java 8 so
Java it says okay don't worry whatever
you will get in Scala I will try to
provide that now so in people who are
moving to Python because it is easy to
learn Java says ok don't go we so now
you can learn Java easily because of Jay
shell so in fact I'll be making videos
on Jay shell as well just to teach you
Java I will be teaching your Java
vajacial I'm trying to do that let's see
how it goes so yeah that those are the
features of Java 9 if you enjoy to this
video just let me know in the comment
section and click on the like button if
you really like this video if you want
some more videos like this in fact I'm
trying to do the entire series on job
online let me know your thoughts and do
