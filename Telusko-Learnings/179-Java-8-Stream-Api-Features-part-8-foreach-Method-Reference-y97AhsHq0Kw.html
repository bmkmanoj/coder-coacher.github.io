is we have created our list of values
over 2006 and then using this for each
method we have printed all the values
using a lambda X version now if you
concentrate here what we are doing we
are taking the value from the collection
which is our families which is one two
six one by one so first initially this I
will be one and then we are printing the
value of one I which is 1 then we are
switching to 2 and then we are printing
the value of R which is 2 and then this
is 3 and this is 3 right but what if
when we know that the only thing we hear
will be one variable and we are just
printing it then why when writing this
one when this for each with a knows that
it was to take all the values of all the
values from released and it printed or
to do something what we can simply say
is instead of taking a value you take
the value you do anything so furnish
will say ok I will take the value tell
me what to do we are specifying here for
every value printed we will say now for
every value you have to execute a method
which is print and then so what for each
will say ok what I will do now is if you
say you are specifying a println here
what I understand is I have to write in
this way so for I will take a value
which is I and it will print the value
of I this is what you mean I said yes
when I say print and then this is what
we need to do it will say okay but hold
on I don't know what is printed in so we
to say okay println is a method which
belongs to object out it will say okay
whenever you say print Ellen it's our
method reference so you are giving me a
reference of a method and whenever you
want want to work with method reference
in Java 8 you have to specify are two
colons here which says you are working
with the method reference here and then
you specify which object it belongs and
we
okay the object name is out wait hold on
what is out object out object is a
static object of print string pinch
print stream which belongs to our math
class for a system so you have to say it
is system dot out so this is the object
you need and in this object you will be
getting a method which is print LM so
you can see we don't have to specify any
variable I and we are not using any
lambda expression explicitly here we are
using something called as method
reference so we are passing our method
as a parameter now is it possible you
you might be knowing about call by
there's a method there's a system
something that is called by a value
so you're passing your value call by
reference you're passing a reference of
an object now we are looking at
something called as call by method and
this is passing or method as a reference
clear so Java supports something called
as method reference this concept here is
called as method reference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
