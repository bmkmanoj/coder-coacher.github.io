now once we know we have automatic
operators which is plus minus then we
have multiplication and division let's
try to use shorthand operators now what
is shortened operator so let's say we
have three variables one is IJ and K and
then say you have you want to say I
equal to I plus 3 so you want to add I
itself by three so initial value of I is
nine so when you say nine plus three the
new value for I it will be twelve right
let's print this so let's say print F
and we'll say person D to print and
we'll just print the value of I so no
need to print any statement I just I'm
just printing the value of I and now if
I done this you can see it says I want
to use slash and also mr. know it with
this so let me run this and you can see
the output is twelve right
yes Oh answer is 12 year let me just use
the complete spacer so answer is 12 now
Oh
instead of instead of specifying I once
again we can use a shorthand so what is
shorthand I will just comment this part
shorten we can write we need to add I by
itself by three okay so we need to add I
by itself with three so I stopped saying
I equal to I plus 3 we can simply
specify I plus how much plus you have to
say three alright and if it on this code
here we can same output it which is
twelve simple now let's say I want to do
or for multiplication we know same thing
we can say in shops saying I equal to I
in to 3 or any value wide by three
always let's say 4 so I so if I print
the value of I now let me if you don't
want to execute any statement we can
just use comments so we can define
comments using double slash or we can
also use slash hash trick so it defines
try to you later
so we can say I equal to I into four and
then if I print the value of I now you
can see the output is 36 why because it
is 9 into 4 to 6 so we can define a
shorthand form
so how to use shorthand so you have to
say I and you guessed it right it is
star equal to 4 so way to multiply I by
itself but with four run and that's the
same output clear and yeah that's that's
that's how you are you have to use
shortens so in the next video we'll talk
about post and pre increment so that's
it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
