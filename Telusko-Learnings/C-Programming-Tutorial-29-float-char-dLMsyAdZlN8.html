different data types which is int float
and CAD so as we say in the earlier
video of previous videos how to what is
different data types and how to declare
a variable but we have not taken any
example for float and CAD so in this
video we'll take an example for float
and care so when we talk about n so it
basically takes two bytes from your
memory float takes around four bytes so
inches two and float is four and we have
care which takes one bite so we also
have double we have long but we don't
use those those data type you know very
casually so we have this three which we
which we use in a normal normal basis so
how to use this variable so when talk
about n so we are we have already seen
lots of examples on int variables right
so we have to specify int I equal to
five but when I talk about float so we
have to mention a float here and we need
to use F equal to let's say to assign a
float value we have to assign our real
values which is 5.5 okay or anything you
can want you can send it five point six
so we can specify float values here now
you will be wondering why we why we have
this named float why not some you know
some name with a meaning example when I
talk about care it makes sense white
cage is character ain't it makes it is
integer what about float so basically if
I talk about CPU so in CPU whenever you
represent a point values so it is it is
represented with the help of floating
point representation so it has a concept
using which you can represent decimal
values in your CPU so since we have
floating point representation we use a
short for that we use float as a
datatype here okay when you talk about
Cal so we have to use care and we'll say
see again you can take any variable name
and when you assign a character let's
say I want to assign a character which
is why since Y is a character literal we
have to use a single quote to the person
character so for a collision of
characters which is
for the string we have to use double
quotes for single character we have to
use single quote okay that's how you
define variable that's how you create
different different different idea types
variable now in order to print this
variable so let's say I want to print
int value so we have to use print F in
double quotes you have to mention person
D now person D to represents print F
will give a slash and just to print on a
new line so we'll put in this and we'll
come to a new line and we'll say I so it
will print the value of I which is 5
right so they can run this and you can
see we got an output which is 5 but what
about the next variable so we have to
say print F so for float we cannot use %
D now for float we have to use % F and
again we can use slash in for new line
and then we'll print F let's run this
let's just to see the output you can see
we are getting five point six and we are
also getting some extra zeros because we
have four bytes right so it will try to
occupy all the memory it has and then
we'll be using again a double coach now
for character we have to use percent C
cool and then we have to say see here if
you run this code you will be getting
five five point six and why cool so
that's how we have to use different data
type and variables but hold on what what
happens if I assign a value 5 - f will
it work since float or f is of type
float which means it can have point
values what if I don't specify a point
value just specify the number will it
work let's run this and here we go here
it's working
but you are getting some extra 0 since
we have float value now what happens if
I assigned five point five here okay
five point five the float value and we
are trying to assign it to end
will it work so you can see let's let's
run this oh so we are getting five there
now why five it's because int will only
support the integer or the first value
it will only support five it will not
take the
a decimal part so this point will be
discarded here okay so what we are going
for these implicit conversions so
whenever you are signup flow fluid value
ain't it will cut the first or the last
part it will take only the first part so
if I say nine point five and if I done
this you can see I getting nine so we
are losing this value which is five
which is 0.5 simple what next now let's
say instead of assigning a character
value to C let's assign a number so will
it work will a number we'll support here
let's run this if I run this you're
getting output as a now why a may be his
I see Mel value let's try something else
let's a 91 and run
we got a square bracket
what about 90 we are getting Z so if you
compare 90 90 minus 65 is 26
that means from 90 from 65 which is a 90
which is there so in between if you say
66 it should be B right oh so that means
when you try to assign a number to
character value it will print the
character of that number because every
character on your keyboard will have a
unique value and that value is called as
ASCII value so ASCII basically stands
for it is American Standard Code for for
watch or information interchange so this
is omega shine Code for information
interchange that is your ASCII okay so
anyway when you assign a value just
expand this so when you assign a value
here 66 to character it will take the
ASCII value which is so 66 will act as a
ASCII value for B and that's why it is
printing B again we discuss more about
ASCII value the next video how to print
all the ASCII values so that's how you
have to use you have to use this
different datatypes with variables
so that's it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
