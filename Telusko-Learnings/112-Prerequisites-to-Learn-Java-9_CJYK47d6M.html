before learning Java in fact I got this
question a lot of time on YouTube
Facebook everywhere that do we know all
this languages before jumping on Java or
can we start learning Java from flash I
mean even if you don't have any
programming experience can you learn
Java in this video we're going to talk
about the prerequisites for Java welcome
back aliens
I'm loving the different high school
learnings and let's talk about the
prerequisites for Java now what if I say
to learn Java you don't need any prior
programming experience if even if you
don't know programming that's fine you
can directly start with Java I mean if
you have if you are from different field
and if you think ok programming is fun
you can make your career in programming
and you you might be having that think
ok I want to be a programmer so you can
stack it on Java without any prior
knowledge right so from today if you're
thinking oh you want to learn Java just
go to my channel I mean go to my channel
go just search for the Java to towards
for big new playlist and start with the
first video and you're good to go you
can watch that from the first video and
step by step if you practice each and
every video I mean step by step ok
doesn't matter if you follow which video
maybe my media my videos or someone else
videos you have to make sure that
whenever you watch those videos you have
to go step by step don't skip videos
that's where you will feel I mean that's
how I'll find trouble you know all the
videos in sequence so you have to go
step by step and while you're watching
that video you have to make sure that
you also practice the best way would be
you have a laptop screen there you I
mean you have a desktop I mean any
computer screen that and you have mobile
phone just next to you just watch the
video on your mobile phone or any other
any other monitor you have and finally
practice this and that's where that's
what you make you more comfortable
so with each video you'll write be
you'll be having some maybe you can just
you can generate some assignment
questions for yourself and try to solve
that and that's how you will learn Java
but then if you you might have heard
about this thing right before learning
Java you should know C++ why we have
this attitude it's because you can blame
the blame people from year 1990
mm the thing is Java came in here 1995
said before that people used to know C++
right so when the first book came for
job for Java or maybe when the first
article article came for Java they were
assuming that you know C++ so that they
can teach you Java example if you watch
my Cortlandt videos i have when i was
teaching catalina was giving a reference
of job okay this is what used to do java
and this is how you do in Kotlin because
pottery is new we don't have well good
resources available I mean if you have
to search for different resources but
but if you talk about Java now we have
lots of resources right so in that age
when took 1995-96 if you want to learn
Java you should know C++ but now it is
2017 you don't need to know C++ to learn
Java you can learn Java from start in
fact if you talk if you you can blame to
your college also that in fact in
courses also we teach C then C++ and
then we go for Java but then we don't
need any prerequisite to learn Java you
can't a great jump for that the only
thing you need is the attitude the
learning attitude because of course Java
is not that easy to learn ok I mean I I
try my best to make it easy for you in
my place but then Java is actually not
that easy that you will understand each
and everything at at first place it may
happen that there are some topics which
which will make you to watch my video
two times through it and that's fine I
mean if you can watch that video 2 times
and if we can understand that constant
that's important right so not every
concept is easy but then you have to you
have to repeat the video you have to
reap like this or maybe you have to
practice more on that particular concept
right but then yes if you know C++ if
you know if you have a prior knowledge
of any programming language it will be
helpful for you to learn Java so I mean
it's your choice if you think that you
should know both in languages like C++
and Java you can do that start with C++
and after some time you can jump to Java
right and trust me if you know C++ Java
will be very easy for you but again you
are investing lots of time on learning
C++ not a bad thing it will be it will
be advantageous for you in future but
then if you if you have a question do we
need to know any other language before
Java answer is no you can die you start
with Java I hope you like you will enjoy
the entire series we have approximately
more than 180 videos now more videos
on the way maybe I'll be adding some
more videos on the cities so make sure
if you're if you're contending with the
Java it says comes at by 10 because he
will get the latest updates and if you
like this video just click on the like
button has also that's that's it thanks
