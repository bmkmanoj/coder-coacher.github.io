so the TV video we have seen what is
exception and different types of
exceptions so let's try to implement
that in this video so let's talk about
the first type of exception which is
unchecked when you only have an
exceptions your compiler is not
specifying that as an exception but
example if I say int I equal to 9 / 0
now even if this line will give you an
exception but it will show it that on
run time your compiler will not notify
you about this exception so my fire on
this code you can see we are getting
after so you can see we got the
exception which is automatic exception /
0 if I try to print anything after that
if I say system dot out dot print and
then if I want to print by and if I run
this code you can see as far side on
this code it is breaking the execution
as soon as you get the exception it will
break the execution and it will directly
print the error it is not printing by
right so that means we are not handing
the exception in your software exception
may arrive so it is your responsibility
to handle it how basically how we handle
the exception so the way we do it is
with the help of try catch let me just
write this outside because I don't want
this inside so I will use a try catch so
tries a block where you have to put all
your critical statements example this
statement here this is a normal
statement and this one is critical now
what is why this period is because it
may show an exception if it is throwing
an exception it is your responsibility
to catch it okay so this try block will
throw the exception and catch block will
catch the exception
it was the object of exception so this
line will throw the object of exception
so you have to accept the object of
exception once it calls the exception
and the catch block we can print there
was some error I don't know what's the
error so if I run this code now you can
see ensure of printing that weird red
line
error it is giving you a black text as
error and it is printing by now if you
want this error to be in very color you
can simply use e RR dot println now what
is the are are the other represents a
door so that your output will be in red
color okay that looks good right so we
can we got another and we also printing
by but just to make it you know simple
we use out itself so we got other and we
also got by so when you try to run this
code and if this line gives you an
exception it will directly jump here it
will print by let's say if I have a
variable which is inch I is equal to
seven and then we have int J equal to 2
and this is a new variable key which is
i / j and i want to print the value of k
I will say output is and then I will
print K and if i underscore you can see
since there is no error we are not
dividing a number by zero K Advani
number by two so 7 divided by 2 will
give you 3 right the output is 3 and it
is also printing by but as soon as you
make your j as 0 what will happen is it
will when you try to divide the number
by 0 it will throw an exception as soon
as it close the exception it will not
print this line as soon as you get the
exception is in this line it will die
actually jump on cache block if you can
see this regard the output as error and
by so it is not printing this so as soon
as you get the exception it with the
active jumped into the catch block now
if you remember if you run this without
trying catch it it is flowing automatic
exception right so it can be specific
here you can say it those and elliptic
exception in shops using exception we
can also use automatic because
specifically this line is throwing
automatic exception and if you click on
automatic exception here it's a subclass
of long time exception if you can see
that again we have same dysentery right
so we have one time except I mean item a
exception in subclass of runtime
exception if you click on one-time
exception it's a surplus of exception
now if I go back here in shelf using
exception or you can also use item
exception because it throws an either
exception and if you on this code
everything works fine what if if I want
to print by ok so you know let's say if
I if I want to put everything in our try
block now will that work if it on this
code it is it is only printing error
right is because when you get the
exception on this line will die to jump
to catch it will not execute these two
lines so I want to play in by so
whatever you do is advocate a blown off
by and it will paste that line in
in extinct at itself so we have by here
and we have by here now why we need by
in both the thing is because if you get
error here it will execute the by of
cache block if you don't get the error
here it will execute the by of this
block so one should if you don't get the
error white will jump to cache block
right if your underscored it works
you're getting by but don't you think we
writing the same statement two times so
adding by here or writing by here so
this is like code redundancy if you
follow the good coding standards it says
that we should not we should not repeat
the code because redundancy is a crime
and we don't want to be a criminal right
so make sure you don't use by in two
places so what you can do is if you feel
only if you if what you want what you
want to do is even if you get the error
or not you want to print by right so we
have one more block withdrawing
catchments koalas finally block so if
you write something in finally block if
you write something here we don't have
to write it two times so what is finally
block is finally is the finally is a
block which will get executed even if
you are getting the exception or not
getting the exception so if I on this
code you can see we are getting by and
if I change the bandit to the J value if
I run this code if it is printing by so
in both the scenarios even if you're
getting the exception or not it will
print by because it is funny block so
finally block block execute in in both
the situations in the normal situation
as soon as I mean as well as in the
other new situation so that's about try
catch and finally so in the next video
we'll talk about multiple caches that's
it from this video thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
