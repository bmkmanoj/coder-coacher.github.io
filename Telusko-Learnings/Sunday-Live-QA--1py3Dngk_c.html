YouTube and I got my own message damning
even I'm going live and let me just
check if everything gets proper this set
up mic is on here okay so how many
people are watching I'm not getting any
status here so I got one like that's
awesome
so the start of the video itself I gotta
like and people just there are some
people who love me okay that's great so
we got six to seven people watching this
now and finally we have a live session
so it's been a busy week for me I was
busy with one of the training it was not
connect of training it was like a train
the trainer's so I was getting trained
from other trainers so that I can try to
different people it's also big by the
way and okay so I'm here for a QA
session okay so machine is it's fine now
okay so I can see my same face I can see
myself right okay okay that's how I
March I'm monitoring who you okay so I
got 121 people watching so I'm here to
answer all you have question today and
of course let me just give you a
disclaimer I cannot answer all the
questions right for two reasons one I
might not be knowing about the
technology second you know currently I'm
getting 125 people watching this and I
don't know how many questions will be
asking so I'm not sure how many can I
get answering this half an hour so we
are going live only for half an hour
today unfortunately due to some time
restrictions so I will try my best to
answer all your questions in fact in
some of my videos I do got some
questions which I want to address today
so I got a list of questions here okay I
don't know if you can if it is visible
if you can see the fonts that it just
ready five default is visible I think no
okay how about now
all right now okay so I don't know if
you can see that question but I will try
to read this question today and I will
try to answer this question first and I
was
go to your questions now one doing this
just to show you that I do read your
comments and I will try to answer your
questions as soon as possible the only
thing is I am NOT a writing person okay
I don't like writing I love speaking so
if you have a doubt ask me in the
comment section I will try to make a
video on that maybe a different video or
I will try to answer your question in
this type of qi sessions in fact i have
done this in in previously as well so if
you can see some of my videos those
videos are one short videos i mean where
there is no linking between the previous
videos and the new videos this those are
what you say a standalone videos now
those videos have been made from the
question itself so in the comment
section if you ask me some questions I
do make videos on that okay separate
video so don't get disheartened if you
if I don't answer your question in the
comment section okay so let me just go
with the first question here the first
question is from Tech Royal and the
question is a JSP or PHP which is better
okay this question basically is asked on
the video which is called as login
sahabat and JSP and the question is JSP
or PHP which is better to choose
building of home page as seen in cada
most people are saying JSP is little bit
slow and it takes some time to get load
is it or is it truth
okay so answer this okay so which is
best
now of course PHP is good because it is
easy to learn language and JSP is also
good if we talk about company if you
talk about the performance I will say
they both comes the same level of
performance now why people prefer PHP is
because it is easy to make is it to
build website and easy to deploy
websites so if you build a website in
PHP it is ways to deploy and the costing
and the charges for the deployment or
the hosting charges are very less but
when it comes to enterprise world
enterprise world people owned a Java
okay not only Java but they prefer Java
compared to PHP I'm talking about the
enterprise world okay see we are living
in two different worlds now one is the
enterprise world and the consumer world
so if we talk about languages like PHP
Ruby they they work more towards the
consumer market and the moment you talk
about
prize market we have dotnet we have Java
we have Python Python works on both the
both the voice you know enterprise world
and and consumer voice so and yes when
you when you load your jay-z pitch for
the first time it will take some time
but I don't know how comfortable you are
with Java so when you convert so when
you run Jaya speeds get convert into
sublight so what runs on Sabah is
servlet not JSP so you cannot say it is
slower so they're both working on same
speed okay according to my knowledge I'm
not that sure okay so next question is
can I know what was your first
programming language I mean what is my
first programming language okay so
technically I know some of the languages
I know I know Java I know C++ I know
c-sharp I know C PHP kind of not I'm not
I'm not right in PHP okay what other
languages I know Android yeah I do i but
that's not the language right that's
like technology so I know code of
languages now the first language which I
learned is of course C because C at my
point when I learned I started
programming I learned programming in
2007 that was the first year same
programming it's been ten years now
that's great so I started with C
programming because I was not having any
choice in my college that was the first
language which they were teaching so I
learned C as my first language and let
me tell you my my reaction when I
learned that language I used to I
usually have computers at that time but
then programming I should think okay
programming is cool but then when I
learn C programming I learned about
hello world i learned about addition of
two numbers and that was weird again the
C was my first language okay next
question
okay so there's there's a question from
one course - is for learning I know bit
of every languages like Java C++ PHP
HTML CSS Python extreme C is not a
programming language but anyway let me
take that my issue is how to start
development of apps see the best way to
start making apps is by start is by
making apps the problem is we
our into that loop of learning different
languages I have seen many people they
no sleep did they learn C C programming
then they learn C++ did they learn Java
then the non sheshe sharp then they go
for PHP then they go for Python they
learn each and every language without
implementing anything its of no use of
learning multiple languages if you don't
know how to build a project so what I
would suggest is start making something
I know building a big project now will
be a big issue why don't you start with
some small thing maybe creating creating
a login form creating application where
you can send messages that's what you
can do right so yeah guys if you are
commenting on the comments so if I
chatting if you are asking questions
just hold on for some time I will answer
I will try to answer from this start
okay so just give me two minutes I can
finish all this all this questions so
start building something go for a small
project and that's why you will build it
next question from for now and the
question is which microphone do you use
so if possible can you provide the link
for the same okay so I use two mics one
is this lapel mic and I use this blue
Yeti for my recordings okay so I use
this this mic whenever I show my face
okay it's because when I when I can also
use this mic when I show my face okay so
I can okay but the problem is this is
bit costly mic it is not recommended for
new if you are new to poke if you are
new to YouTube this is I will not
recommend this one because this is
costly I bought it up to two years okay
so when I started making our videos I
was not having good gadgets but now
since I thought okay YouTube the channel
is going good so it's time to invest
something right so I bought this mic
this is bit costly this cost you around
150 dollars which is nine nine thousand
or ten also two peas in India and the
cheap version is also available you can
try it we can try that one as well okay
so I use this this microphone for my
liquor for my what you say it's
currently calling so if you see my
videos well I have recorded this screen
so the audio so from last two months or
three months all the videos which which
are screen recording are recorded from
this mic
the only problem is when I show my face
I have this tendency to move you know I
cannot say stable the moment the moment
I move it's difficult to dis difficult
for this Mike and Mike to catch my voice
you know because this is not artificial
intelligent Mike right they cannot move
according to my voice this one is good
because when I move this also moves
right so this is better so this is the
rod mic this is rod lap as okay to be
specific this is rod a smart love Mike
can I get that pouch is the name is
written there the exact name is not
mentioned okay but this is the part okay
clear that can you see that this is the
pouch and this is rod Mike okay this
will cost you around 4000 apiece
if you if you can input it from us it is
dim it is cheaper there I don't know why
everything becomes so costly when it
comes to India this is good this is what
you can see you can only hear my voice
there is no noise around but trust me
there's lots of noise the AC noise the
traffic noise right if you buy a cheap
mic of initially it will be better but
if you buy a cheap mic which is 400 300
it will be good but then there will be
lots of noise trust me this works good
okay so yeah so that's the okay and if
you want links I will try to put those
links in digit in the description area
of the video which I have mentioned okay
next question has anyone noticed the
tape on the laptop camera please make a
video on this okay in fact even this
laptop has a what you say a tape here
the reason is okay and I do watch some
of the videos I do follow some YouTube
channel I do follow some some articles
and I have seen that I mean lots of
people that mentioning that in fact I
have seen this that you can spy anyone
okay so when you especially when you're
unique using Windows even I don't trust
Linux and Mac as well but if you're
using Windows this there's a high chance
that in your windows there is a spyware
which is activated and which can on your
camera
anytime I mean just imagine if you are
doing something but if you're doing some
something which you don't want people to
see of course you don't want people to
see it right and if you're thinking that
this MA this camera is off you cannot be
sure even if you're using advanced
antivirus you cannot be sure best way to
protect yourself is apply tape in fact I
do have a video on this on YouTube okay
if you can search for I don't know the
video name what the video name was are
you safe in this world something like
this right so I will try to link that
video in this video in this and the
description area okay so that's why I
have a laptop tape here okay so that's
that's the question from here and I will
try to put more videos I mean I will try
to take more comments next time okay but
now it's time to answer your questions
okay
okay before answering questions there is
one more thing there are lots of videos
coming in this week because the next
week I'm quite available I can make some
some videos mostly the videos are coming
on day ops de bops development own
operations videos like github okay I am
revealing the secret okay the videos
like get mostly Jenkins CI continuous
integration integration what else what
else introduced there are quite some
videos on in the nation this in this
week so this will be our learning week
for everyone so let's see how it goes
okay so let me start with the first
question and here we go okay so everyone
says hi hello hi a hi everyone
okay I can see we have 181 people
watching this I can this is the
benchmark I have not have not never
caught this many this many views what I
have across 200 yet I don't know so we
got 182 people watching that's great you
know in a particular time if we have 183
people watching that's an awesome number
thank you so much everyone for joining
and but I can see only 76 likes what
happened come on guys if you are if you
do like this type of sessions do click
on the like button I what you say it
motivates me to do these type of
sessions a lot
okay so okay everyone says hi hello hi
oh because 190 views that's great okay
so question from red sheet ROG so please
start a Python classes the only thing is
I know Python a bit okay I'm not an
expert in Python and I don't want to
teach anything which I'm not good at
okay I don't I'm not a kind of person
who learns and who teaches okay I want
to so I do learn different technologies
like I recently I learned Jenkins
I was not knowing about Jenkins before I
was knowing about the concept but not
the actual implementation so now first
of all I will learn Jenkins then I will
implement Jenkins then I will teach it
online okay that's how I do it Python is
not in my list as of now because there's
no such requirement for me I have across
200 views yay so we act up okay we got
200 people watching this awesome okay so
next question why English why not Hindi
okay there are multiple reasons why I
don't talk in Hindi here first reason is
I have the audience throughout the void
okay because everyone every country has
an add up take this language right so
then you should have thought of making
videos in Hindi but then my audience is
worldwide okay I cannot so from us so
okay let me give you my stats I get
around 70% views from India that's
that's awesome right but I also get
views from us 10% views are from us from
UK as well from Australia from Egypt
what else
South Africa Pakistan Bangladesh Nigeria
so all this I get views from all these
countries so that's the one way that's
the first reason why I'm not making
videos in Hindi second reason even in
India if we talk about Indian languages
there not a lot of people then they're
not all people know Hindi right
especially if you talk about south
engines they are not quite familiar with
in the even if we talk about the Middle
East Eastern country strange straits
I I feel they are not also comfortable
with Hindi language but everyone is
comfortable with English
sec third reason is if you don't know
English you have to learn English you
don't have a choice right if you are
into programming world of course right
when you write program
you write programming in English
language right you never say we say
public static void means like you never
say what you say public in Hindi pop
live in Hindi no no not log okay that's
that's class is okay so even if we try
to convert each and every one in but
what our programming in Hindi that
doesn't make sense right
since programming language are built
using English language so why not learn
let's learn in the English language
right that will be the first way to to
learn English there is one more problem
when you join a company you cannot
expect people to people will talk to you
in Hindi right so learn English right so
that's why English okay next point what
should I learn in Java
don't Java in Java okay so start with
core Java so Java has different sections
we have core Java we have advanced Java
so start with kochava so if you can go
to my playlist I have a video for we
have a playlist called as Java tutorials
for beginners follow that playlist and
once you are done with that you know
kochava then then you can go for Android
then you can go for it once Java then
you can go for big data so even if
before going for that start with core
Java that is something you should learn
now okay so next question from John what
about DevOps okay in fact I'll be making
a complete video what is DevOps means so
we we know two terms right we know
development and we know operations but
what exactly this DevOps means so
something they've development and
operations combined as far as DevOps
initially it was not that scenario now
you know every company due to this get
the concept of gate Jenkins continuous
integration agile methodology everyone
want a DevOps team so initially we used
to have development team and operation
teams now we have DevOps team but only
what exactly it is how they work that
will be coming in a completely separate
video so in this week we can accept that
expect that video okay now a question
from wished-for not what we are going to
discuss we are going to discuss nothing
it it's all about your questions and my
answers so okay why not
don't be that that question okay what
this life session is about okay I guess
we got lots of new subscribers this week
and they don't know what I'm doing here
okay just to give you a quick update
every Sunday in fact not exactly Sunday
every weekend maybe Saturday or Sunday I
go live on YouTube just to answer your
questions I know I cannot answer every
questions but then I try to do that this
is the best way to connect with you
right okay so the thing is I I do have
lots of videos on YouTube but then there
are some people they want to connect
with me to know some questions which are
not there on the videos so this is the
best platform so you can expect videos
every Saturday and Sunday right so Oh
Saturday or Sunday no it's answer it
okay next question where to learn
ethical hacking course no idea there are
lots of in fact I have not learned I
think of acting so I cannot recommend
you anything there lots of platform by
the way you can learn it online you can
learn it offline online you can go to
udemy there lots of courses available
and I'm not sure which is the best one
so I cannot recommend you anything
oh okay next question raise the question
okay what should I study to become as a
dog web developer so to become a web
developer first you should know score
Java which is Java to SC so once you
know Co Java once you know how HTML CSS
works then you can learn serve it and
JSP so if you want to get into a Java
web development code Java HTML CSS
JavaScript servlet and JSP that's time
but if you want to go for in the
advanced framer you can learn spring and
hibernate okay next one next question
okay so question can you recommend some
good books to learn Java okay I do have
multiple books I don't know I can I
cannot show you now but then I do have
lots of books here that's fine that's
fine
let me just name some books so I can see
I have Java 7 programming a black book
not that
one yeah so my favorite is headfirst
Java I can see that in the list so the
my favorite is headfirst Java okay this
is a comic book for Java if you love
comics books the kid should refer
headfirst Java the second one I love is
Java complete reference you know that is
not for learning you cannot you cannot
you know go by page by page but if you
want to refer something you can you can
look at it for that book the Java
computer sense then you can also there
for certification both but I would not
recommend you that just keep that so two
books at first Java and complete
reference but go for the ninth edition
is your ninth edition okay so next
question from mine Frank so do you like
football kind of I'm not a big fan of
football but I do watch some games I
don't know any team name but then when I
get time because I have some friends who
like football so when I go there in
their places they watch football so I
watch football but nothing I don't hate
it
at least I'm kind of neutral for
football but I love cricket
I love wicket as a game okay so next
question hello sir you are amazing oh
thank you so much on KITT okay next
question next question after learning
code Java what would what would be the
good options Android or Java II I'm
having difficult with frameworks okay so
you have learned code Java and now you
want to learn about now you want to go
for Android or Java EE so you're saying
that you are finding it difficult to
learn frameworks see others I think
codes are what to do that completely
depend upon what you want to be in
future if you are sure that you want to
go into mobility of course go for
Android but if you're not sure if you
want to go into mobility if you want to
join a big company then go for it go for
it one Java because if you join in any
big companies especially banks ok banks
then the oil based companies if you are
joining any of these companies you have
to know Java you don't have a choice
right even if you don't know Java now
once you join that company they will
teach you they will train you on this
technologies but having that
knowledge free hand will be advantage
right so if you are sure that you want
to go into mobility go for Android
otherwise go for advanced Java and yes
it will be difficult for you to learn
frameworks initially but crush me if you
know one framework you can learn other
frameworks as well okay I can see we
have 232 people watching this okay I
guess this is the this is the ultimate
one have you crossed this number before
no right that's great
so we got more than 230 people watching
this that's an that's an amazing
benchmark and if you joined it now just
click on the like button guys okay next
question okay it's like you are going
amazing or thank you Manoj okay question
forms such in which is the best for
databases I mean you're talking about
which is the best DBMS the best DBMS now
is Oracle of course it was what actor
was best is best and it will be best for
future as well if we talk about
relational databases right but if you
talk about no I scale it up is I will
say MongoDB maybe there is something new
as well I'm not sure so we have a
relational database Oracle is best I
prefer my scale because all my
applications are not heavy data usage
databases so or not every data database
is what you say the my applications are
not data ups AV you know so I prefer my
school it works perfectly fine I also
prefer posedness so masculine postcodes
I prefer what I cuz is something which
is used for big applications so like if
you talk about telecoil telecom
companies if you talk about what has
banks they need Oracle because they have
huge amount of data to work with so but
nowadays we have big data they all work
with big data so don't worry so if you
want to learn or if you want to learn
the DBMS learn Oracle maybe Maskin
because if you learn one DBMS you can
learn another one very easily okay I'm
not saying the boat they're all the same
but then it is what you say if you learn
Oracle you can learn math scalable
easily okay so sizes have computed
watching your 184 videos in Java I would
like to do an internship under you you
are
like Java will you allow me oh I would
love to draw I love you take to love you
to take love to take you as my intern so
what happened what's happening with me
okay so first of all palm glad you have
seen all my codes our videos Drake the
thing is I don't I'm not hiring any
interns as of now because I'm quite busy
with other work so what I do is in from
December from so from December to May I
get some free time so I can plan for
internship at that point but as of now
I'm not having any intern but if I'm if
I want any intern I will surely let you
know on YouTube so do follow the channel
because I may upload a video for
internship but as of now for next 3
months there is no intention maybe after
that I can find out okay so should I
learn Java or Python it's a bit see it's
all depend upon what you want to do in
future time being I would say go for
Java because yeah if you want to join a
big company where you want to work on
enterprise software go for Java if you
want to get your big data of course you
can learn Java and Python as well but
knowing both the language is not a bad
thing right so if you're confused learn
both the language would learn both the
basics right and then you will realize
which one you love more okay so I would
suggest go for both Oh a question from
doo-doo-doo rajput OHIP internship at
telesco eyes up now at the same thing i
am not having any interns so a question
from John what about DevOps what about
the what a future of DevOps I would okay
let me answer that
so DevOps has a good future now because
there are lots of come especially if you
are if you are if you are joining a
service based companies there's lot
there's a lot of a lot of opportunities
for type of people okay so due to this
agile methodology is due to this
continuous in the integration everyone
want to have a DevOps team is instead of
having a development team and efficient
teams separately they want DevOps team
so it has a good future okay so I'm
learning Java by your uploaded videos
thank you oh great
are you are enjoying that awesome okay
third of already says how to start where
at once Java so to start with advanced
Java first you should know Co Java so
learn complete core Java okay when I say
complete core Java and I'm expecting
that you should know at least till
multi-threading and correction right
once you know that you can target them
to advanced Java in advanced Java start
with servlet and JSP now once you know
that thing you will get to know the
other stuff as well very easily so start
with saw it on JSP ok quite a point from
ok next next next ok
ok next question okay question is web
development
/ software element / machine learning /
it assigns C machine learning is future
okay there is lots of opportunities for
machine learning in future if you have a
choice of learning machine learning now
go for it learning machine learning good
so if you have a choice of learning
machine learning go for it
okay so I would say machine learning is
the future so go for it
okay so next question where is the
question okay so is it important to use
different IDs to use different languages
of course if you are using different
language you have to a different idea
example for Java we have to use eclipse
or IntelliJ if you are using C sharp you
have to use Visual Studio if you are
using PHP you have to use quote ignitor
yeah for C we have to over c plus CC CC
ide so of course when you learn
different languages you have to dip in
IDs
and I would prefer we to learn a new
language go for notepad but then after
some time also learn about IDE as well
that's how you work in industry now
should I learn Python okay
okay so can I get your number I need one
app if you want to create it for me okay
for this cook for this question to help
you have two answers can I get your
number no okay
and can you create it for me in no I
would suggest if you want to make an
application why don't you make it by
yourself right that's how you will learn
and if you have any questions see the
packet see the thing is packed it is I
want to help everyone okay my intention
of quitting this channel was to help
everyone but it is practically
impossible for me to answer each and
every question okay it's virtually
impossible because that is I have other
thing as well to do right so I don't
know should I get some calls from people
I don't know from where they're getting
my number
and trust me I try to answer their
questions but it's almost impossible for
me to now for me not to answer all the
questions maybe I will change my number
soon okay so from booba and ok question
is do you and now tell you go I do know
that ago I understand it perfectly and I
can I can I can talk I'm not learnt
intend to go because I am bought and
bottom in Mumbai all my friends they
speak in the Marathi so I know Hindi I
know Marathi a Koi up okay I can say I
know Marathi I understand Marathi but
I'm not fluent again Telugu yes kind of
okay so question form or when I saw any
upcoming batches for Java and it was
Java so this month I am go to the pack
even if I plan for next batch it will be
coming from 10th September so do connect
it with the channel and on our website
okay so I just want to say hi to you
because I'm such a good photo of you oh
thank you so much I need I thought just
a question okay
great Daniel thank you so much okay so
next question angular was is react which
is better I'm along I guess I'm a long
person twice of this because I don't
know both of them okay
so okay do you know a a ji GAE which is
Google App Engine a point not much okay
okay next question

get certified or maybe you have to learn
data sign okay so what you can do is
there are there some web sites like
Coursera Udacity just go there and
search for data scientists there are
some paid courses but that's fine right
if you want to learn something like

question from kotodama
can we start a sideways set which is
similar to udemy which includes only
videos of Indian tutors first of all we
have lots of channels like you damn you
time is not the only platform there lots
of other platform as well in fact I was
going to make my own platform and then I
realized why to make a new platform why
to reinvent the wheel when you have
other other platforms so yeah but you
can do it you can build your own udemy
okay so you can try it out ok so five
more minutes we are talking from last 25
minutes I guess so five more minutes
guys okay so I'm from automation testing
and want to move to Java I have
experience I have six years of
experience I'm good at Java and learn
everything from your channel so please
tell me where to start
ok so if you want to get into Java well
now so first of all talk to your boss ok
because in your own company if you are
testing software's of course there will
be someone who is building software's
right so talk to your boss talk to your
team talk to other teams search for the
opportunities there the second way of
doing this is get certified the third
way is by making some projects because
you have to prove yourself right this is
a world we all need proofs I mean there
are some people who don't who who get
the news and you know there are lots of
people they believe in Hawks but then in
this world if you want to prove if you
want to show something you have to prove
yourself so build a project and that's
how you start okay next is mask you'll
work learning of course it's worth
learning
ok ok
water difference between SC JP and ocjp
oh hold on SCJ piano cg p they are
almost same the thing is s e-g P stands
for Sun certified Georgia lapa or Java
programmer and ocj P stands for Oracle
certified Java programmer when Oracle
bought Sun nowadays ocjp so initially it
was I see JP and in terms of
multi-threading
it's not about ocjp on SCJ pages about
the version in balance 1.7 we got lots
of updates related to multi fading we
got coin currency API it's quite updated
in Java 8 now we got destroy API so the
things change depend upon your version
not about the exam it's not about exam
it's about the versions okay next next
next
okay which is the best combination is it
for MBC is the JSF spring MVC our starch
- I would recommend you to go for JSF
and spring MVC that we'll debate on ok
last 2 minutes and let's see what answer
I can take okay so you want me to make a
video on mavin versus gadelle okay
that's a good point I can I can think
about it great
okay last one
it's java enough to get into IT world
yes it is enough but okay when I say
enough you can also learn about
different things like so make sure you
learn JavaScript as well because
everyone is short is talking about
JavaScript nowadays so lunch are sweet
as well I've never thought I would
recommend you I was good before but
whenever I go I always say JavaScript
anybody everywhere soul on JavaScript as
well or JavaScript because there are
lots of frameworks which are built on
JavaScript so go for that so yeah that's
