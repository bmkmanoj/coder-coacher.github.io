talk about JMS so the purpose of
learning JMS is to understand how eg be
in which you have massage human beings
work so wait awkward message g1 beans
they are responsible to send a messages
from one bean to other bean and it is
achieved with the help of JMS so J was
transferred Java messaging services now
if we talk about JMS so it allows the
component to post messages for other
components are synchronous other than
synchronous because we have to focus
more on earth synchronous is because we
don't know when the message will arrive
and it uses it is also known as
something else mob now mom stands for it
is message oriented middleware it comes
under it has two basic models one is
point-to-point and second is published
publish and subscribe so point-to-point
is more like peer-to-peer network or
peer-to-peer communication and
publish/subscribe is like when you like
a newspaper so when you send when you
like Times of India they publish a paper
and then we have thousands of our
billions I can say millions of
subscriber who read those articles so we
talked about point-to-point is like 1 to
1 and the publish/subscribe is like when
too many what does JMS to so it has some
basic functionality so it's like a java
api which is used to create send and
receive messages or you can read or read
messages so in any way in your sister in
your mind if you are imagining this as
an email so let me tell you is not our
email it's like a new system ok so it's
like you can create you can send you can
receive messages and you can even read
messages now it has two models first is
point-to-point so when we talk about
point-to-point let's imagine you have
two clients one is client one and Klein
- so clients want want wants to send a
message and this message will be
consumed by klein - so in order to send
all this
just you require something called ask
you here so this queue will collect all
your messages and it will give to this
client - so basically you're Cuban not
send a message it's Klein - who will
consume the message it's like more like
a pull type of messages so queue here
will not push it will disk line - will
pull and so in point to point we use
something called a skew so point to be
remember in point to point we use Q in
publish/subscribe we have one sender and
multiple receivers it's like one-to-many
relationship so client one will publish
a concept of sending and publishes
almost say the only difference is in
point to point we have Q and in
publish/subscribe we have this topic so
in this also what you do is you
subscribe so initially you have to
subscribe so that you can you will
receive those messages so if you not go
for one-to-one you will use a queue
if you want to use one-to-many you will
go for topic now again we can achieve
two things we can achieve synchronous or
we can achieve our synchronous in
synchronous we have to use a receive
method in earth synchronous we have to
use a interface called as message
listener so if you are familiar with AWT
and swing in java so you might be
knowing something or less event
listeners so it's not a event listener
it's a message listener here so it will
act or it will receive a message when
you listen for a message so in order to
implement a programming model of this
JMS the these are the things you need
you require so what you need here first
you need a connection factory so once
you got the object of connection factory
you will get a object of connection now
once you got the object of connection
you can create object of a session now
once you've got this session then you
can create a message producer and a
message consumer so this message
producer is responsible to create a
messages
and this consumer responsible to receive
the messages so when you write a code of
Jim as you have to concentrate on all
those things in fact in the subsequent
tutorials I will be writing some codes
for this so for that codes I want you to
remember all this all these steps so
that is from the theory of GMS so now
you know what is message UN beans you
know what is GM s let's try to create an
application in which will will
demonstrate this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
