is not in 20 and in this series of
tutorials we'll choose a topic one topic
in one episode and we'll talk about the
introduction of the topic we talk about
what is the technology why to use the
technology and where to implement now if
you see this tutorial it will help you
to increase your knowledge so you make
sure you subscribe the channel and watch
the video SQL Lite just remove that L
there we just have one and so we have s
Q and I te now with ask you will talk
about why break what what ask you why
requires skill and where to use it right
so we talk about the first question
which is what what is SQL light so
basically I ask you like a software in
which you can write SQL queries okay
it's a lightweight no network access and
embedded type of SP software in which
you can write SQL or execute SQL queries
second question why be liquid ask you
now this is bit tricky we already have
masculine we have political we have post
waves
then why we require yet another DBMS or
our DBMS the thing is if you talk about
math skill Oracle and Postgres this are
client-server what you say DBMS and if
we talk about SQLite is a stand-alone
DBMS now the problem is when you talk
about this world now so we are moving
towards void which is called witches
which will be walking with i/o T which
is Internet of Things so everything
around you will be internet enabled
maybe your fans your cube light your AC
your French via mobile phones your
anything you have in fact your watch now
you can see Apple watch we have Samsung
gear so we have all this devices which
are created with internet right and
somewhere these are intelligent devices
in which you have a small amount of data
so example let's say if I enter a room
and if I if you have AC so AC
temperature
which depend upon the person right if a
person let's see if I entered the loop
so I will be having a different
temperature if my friend is entering the
room he will be getting a different
temperature though I did we are not easy
we both are not in the same room at the
same time or the different timing so
your AC need to have something called
some data to calculate this thing right
and those data will be stored in a DBMS
now for the AC you cannot have masculine
stores you cannot have what actually
installed so you can have a SQLite DBMS
which is installed which is lightweight
right so you can have a small database
inside those ACS and that's why we
require SQLite then so first what your
skill line is just a software in which
you can just you can write SQL queries
why require is because all these
different DBMS they work with client
server that bulky to work with now the
third reason we're going to implement
this now this official documentation
provided by the SQLite team and they
claim you can use SQLite anywhere
provided that website awesome that thing
doesn't have huge amount of traffic
example even you can use SQLite to build
a website now you can do that but the
problem is if your website is getting
around thousand 100 or 100,000 visits
per day that's okay but if you are going
beyond that it may give problem if your
website has a concurrent operation you
should not use SQLite okay so when we
ask your life so we can use SQLite for a
minute's office so it let's say if you
are building a project for embedded
system so let's say you're building our
project for our
maybe 34 system maybe a sieve or a
switch so you can use ask you like there
when you are building a and your
application if you want to save huge
amount of data you can use mass cure the
server-side but if you want to save a
small data from your Android you can use
SQLite as a database
so when to use we can use an embedded
surface we can use in websites provided
you are not getting huge traffic you can
use it in
Android and all these small embedded
devices so that is what SQLite is that
is why what is pure light why requires
good night and when it is used so if you

talking about different technology in
the coming sessions so thanks so much
