different oyster learnings and in this
video we'll talk about boolean algebra
because there is something called as
true and there's something else false
right so many when I say I'm wearing a
black shirt today false I am looking
good today true right so that's that's
that is called as boolean algebra again
those those things will change for you
right as well so so when I talk about
boolean algebra what exactly it means so
there was a guy called as bully or
George bully and here's he came up with
the concept of true and false so in your
system in your computer instead of
having just burning numbers which is
ones and zeros we can also have some
some more values like true and false if
you want to take any decisions because
he when you talk about a computer
computer is a computer because it can do
two things it can calculate and it can
also compute and when I say computation
it's also about taking some decisions
right and decisions are possible based
on true or false example let's let's go
out and play but then they thought there
is a train there so if you say rain rain
is there if it's true
let's not go for playing and then if it
is not there let's go for a place so we
always go for true and false right so in
your life we always take decisions with
the help of true or false and that we
can implement in computer as well with
the help of boolean algebra now so if
you are the if you're putting for any
complicated exam this video is important
for you and another way also if you if
if you just a programmer and if you want
to learn about boolean things again this
video will be helpful so what we are
going to do here is we'll talk about
some boolean operations when I say
boolean operation let's say we have T
and we have F now what all operations we
can apply here so basically we can apply
three operations the first one is called
as all operation the next one is called
as the end operation and then we have
one more call as the not operation so we
have all and and not so what is odd so
all says if you have two two conditions
and if one of them is true so if you
have two conditions and if one of them
is true the ultimate answer will
true so it's me repeat or says if you
have a condition so let's talk about all
here if you have two things if you have
true and if you have true if both the
conditions are true I can you will get
true but if you have one true and one
false so if you have one condition which
is true and the second condition is
false the ultimate answer will be true
because at least we have one true if we
have false and true it will be true and
then if we have both the conditions
false you will get false so if you have
both true if you have at least one
condition true it will give you true so
in this scenario you can see we have one
flow here we got one true here but then
the last one we both I mean both they
were both are false so it will be false
the next one is let's say we are working
with and so in and let's talk about this
two inputs okay this is your input one
and input two let's talk about the
Israel 21 so this is your or so this is
your or operation for this - let's go
for the and one so if I say this is and
so in and if you have any one of them as
false so when I say any one of them
false so the answer would be false okay
something like this we have TT which is
both are true it will give you t we have
one T and one false it will give you
false because at least we have one false
false and true will give you false and
Falls and Falls will give you false okay
so here we have T and T which is P so
this will be and now to understand so we
can we can we can remove this odd normal
you know we get confused because this
normally we can represent this T with
one right so this T is one the F is zero
in that scenario we can say one because
we represent all with the help of plus
symbol
so normally will have been F or odd with
plus symbol so all this plus and so on
is plus and and is dot now this dot is
also multiplication so we can also use
star or we can use dot here for all the
use plus operator so when I say one plus
because one is true 1 plus 1 will be 1
because P plus T is T so 1 plus 1 is 1
ok this is this is a bit confusing when
it when you talk about the binary
numbers and boolean algebra saying
binary 1 plus 1 is 0 in boolean 1 plus 1
is 1 ok so don't get confused with this
so in terms of binary we have 1 + 1 0 in
terms of boolean we have 1 + 1 as 1 so
maybe in your exam if they ask you about
if you have two conditions if both are 1
and if you're applying the or operation
so you should not say 0 it should be you
should be saying 1 right so you cannot
imagine this one as 1 you have to
imagine this one as something and 0 as
nothing okay so when you say something
and nothing they go something like this
so something plus something will give
you something something plus nothing
will give you something
nothing plus something will give you
something and nothing plus nothing will
give you nothing so if your remote in
this way so if any at least you can have
one something so something plus
something will give you something
something does nothing will give you
something nothing to us something will
give you something and nothing does
nothing will give you nothing right so
that is that is one logic and you can
remember for odd but for and the same
operation is not not applicable right so
here we have 1 dot 1 is equal to 1 1 dot
0 is equal to 0 then 0 dot 1 is equal to
0 and then 0 dot 0 is equal to 0 okay
and that's logical right 1 dot 1 is 1 so
everything is else is 0 so we can apply
dot operation there and here we have to
apply plus operation so don't imagine 1
as one imagine 1 as something so
something plus something is something
right so that's why we can apply and and
know and allign and
now we all one will be half women
operator which is not so how not works
now so when you say not which is not so
when you say not T it will give you F
and if you have not F it will give you 2
so whatever input you give it to it it
will reverse it so when you say it's
true not we'll say it's false if you say
it's false not as there is true right so
we can represent not I think we can use
a - before the value or
we can also use a bar so I can set T bar
we can say F bar so T bar is F and f bar
is T simple so these are the three
operations we have in boolean algebra so
we have our and and not okay so we can
perform some operations with this in
fact we have some algorithms which you
have to remember not algorithms but you
have we have some theorems do you have
to remember and we'll see those theorems
in the next video we'll talk about
different theorems you have to remember
and again you have to remember all those
theorems because if you are going for
computing exam if you are if you are
going for you maybe most people
competition exams it will be important
so they were both here remember the
theorem which is coming the next video
so do subscribe and like the video if
you liked it and thanks so much for
