sponsoring this chocolate today we will
continue our Python notorious okay
particularly on something called as
fight and variables so what is variable
variable not nothing but reserve memory
locations to store some values this
means that when you create a variable
you reserve some space in memory
location okay based on data type of
variable the interpreter allocates
memory and decides what can be stored in
reserved memory okay therefore by
assigning different data data types to
variables you can store in freezer
decimal characters in these variables so
whatever I said is just I will show you
suppose I have two variables one is a
which words five another is B which
holds Swapnil my name so what happens
whenever whenever we compile whenever we
run this then at that time interpreter
assign or allocate some memory space in
RAM okay so this is nothing but this is
the basic Fordow variables okay so now
we will start our Python very was that
how do we deal with Python variables how
do we write program so our Python
variables okay so if you have configured
your Python so ahead and install start
your Python ideally and I have my Python
I really so what I will do I will just
create a variable I will say suppose I
want to store my age is 20 things so in
memory in memory our interpreter has
assign or loop units of space to that
variables whenever I want to see that
variable the value which is that holds I
will simply say in each now say so I can
see the well same way they want I want
to store some age 15 like ABC
but no you can see you cannot store you
cannot just dream like that you can
store if you want to store integer
values at that it will simply write each
signify for whatever but at the moment
then you want to restore some pain you
cannot restore like you show you again I
will say ABC okay this is the understood
that so we have to say see so now I want
to see the store in mind please
I can't able to see each facing each so
like Python like an actor it is like so
I'll use the company loosely coupled
means loose coupling tight coupling I
will explain it promise we'll see it
when more example of any fun to sing
I said so they if you have ever been any
programming languages like suppose C C++
Java or any programming language at that
time you have to be very specific okay
but in Python you can take values of
that you know to find it I like type as
the Raven is going through the stroke
that is nothing but kinda loose coupling
at runtime it is lies and it had assign
value to now variables okay so this is
the basic of variables in next next
tutorial we'll learn something called as
multiple assignment and maybe more
fundamentals of variance
