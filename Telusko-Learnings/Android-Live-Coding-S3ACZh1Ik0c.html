that we are going for the first live
session on Android so okay so great so
how many people are watching this I
don't know let's let's figure it out let
me just go to my life coding and let's
see who are watching this okay so I can
see seventeen people are watching that's
great and okay so okay so there's only
so many messages here
okay that's great and okay I don't know
if I've shared that video with on
Facebook or anywhere for maybe one bite
might be okay so that sounds good and I
hope everybody's excited here and okay
so yeah good evening everyone
okay so there's one more thing I want to
I want to tell you that the first thing
is I have sent you the what do you call
it as okay if you can see some a dark
background is because I'm using my
webcam the laptop at the Mac webcam
which is not that good compared to the
lab mobile phone the second thing is ok
so I've sent you some 30 videos to Hort
I mean I've sent you the the
prerequisite videos right so if you
understand this session only if if you
have seen all those videos because see
I'm not going from the basic this is not
Android session this is not something I
will teach you and what this is
somewhere if you know these things you
can implement that okay so the main idea
behind this video is I have already
built some applications so I wanted to
show you how we think okay I'm not
saying I'm one of the best programmer
just does that whatever I know I want to
share with you so I hope you have the
correct expectation here okay we'll be
doing on cotton as well but it will take
some time so make sure you will start
with Java and then we'll do the same
coding in cotton as well let's see how
that goes and if you want to contribute
you can do that as well okay so by the
way I just want to ignore my screen now
I want to say I don't want to show my
face anymore I want to show my square
into you
so now you do is I will add my face
that's drawn let me just share the
screen now and here we go okay so I am
sharing my screen
and okay just do one setting okay so I'm
shutting my screen now and here we go
let me also start the recording so the
session is getting recorded now where do
we where you will find this session now
so the we are doing the live session on
that is called learning but the recorded
session will be available on so the
recording session will be available on
on telescope row okay
and luckily I just made the disc upload
as a free channel okay because I'm still
figured out a few ringing figuring out
how do I make things work because there
are lots of countries where well
Francisco I mean the approach and the
subscription model is not there for
YouTube so that's the issue one of
that's one of the issue I'm facing and
as we know that I'm getting lots of and
I have all my subscribers throughout the
world it's not just India or US so I
would think about that as well let's see
how it goes up let's see what I can do
in that case ok so as you can see we got
128 views for the video that's great
okay so what I have done till now
so as I've sent you some views to watch
right I have talked about okay so I have
asked you to watch a video on what is
what is your what is Android then how do
we get objects in Java how do we use
expandable list in fact this video so if
you have not seen my earlier videos this
will so they will find it will it will
be difficult for you to understand again
that's great shape hello aliens this is
nothing ready and today we're going to
talk about a live project I thank you
for that update
Steve okay so let's go for the requisite
what we have so what so I've already
done something in my environment and
before before continuing with this let
me just show you what we are going to
build of course with of course why we
cannot build it the entire application
in one go right so okay so let me just
go back to my output window this is what
I want to do okay so if I expand this so
this is okay so we we want to achieve
this thing which is a spring so I want
at least here where I will show lots of
codes and if I click one of the
link here which is Java in Java we have
lots of code zero ID if I click on
Fibonacci okay the actual output which I
want here is to get the code I want the
Java code for Fibonacci I want the Java
code for inheritance but then we will
not be doing that today we'll be doing
half part today and we'll be doing our
part tomorrow in the next session okay
if I click on this inheritance this is
what I want to get this is this is the
power curve I want to get now this is
this is almost the same a live session
which which I have done in my theory
which is which I have done last year in
my one of my video so I want to make
this this lag session as a benchmark for
the next video or for the next slide
session which is coming soon
okay now question arise how we can
achieve that so first of all this is a
expandable list view where I have a
valleys language if I click on one of
the element here it will pop up now this
this thing here are called as a parent
elements and this the inside part is
called as child element so this is a
child and this is the parent now for
this palette we can use a good term
which is called as so we can termed as
group so this is group so Java is a
group here and this all these things
they are called as child so let's get
started so what I've already done is I
have written some code so don't worry
you you I mean I don't know if you find
it difficult to understand here but then
let's try to understand what is going
behind the scene okay for that it will
do some setting here sounds good okay I
can see some people are saying just came
here just hold on I'm doing some setting
for you okay
so what we are going to do here is we
are trying to write a code so that we
can achieve this so this is the final
output we want and now you find on this
code you can see will be not getting the
output which you are expecting so remove
the code so that I can type this code
for you okay so is that is that
okay so as you can see here this is our
code oh you wanted to increase the font
size okay that's the issue now how do I
increase the font size here because I
was searching for the thing here it's
been a long time I worked on Android
studio because I was I was busy with
some other things
okay so font font font it's here okay
it's not giving me the option to change
it okay that's weird
time to edit that things I was not
giving the option to save it and so this
cancer that is not giving me any option
anyway so what you can do is you can
just make sure that you are watching
this video in a high resolution oh okay
I have to create a new profile there
let's try as you can see people are
saying create a new profile but then
when I do that oh that's great
so let me say sixteen it will be my to
write sixteen we record I guess oh thank
you thank you so much Oh who's that it
was giving me the answer for that it is
claim bid for that's Dutch thank you so
much okay great
so what do I do now is I just want to
make some okay so don't let me show you
what we have what I have done in the
inish in the before the before this
session okay so we have to get to this
layout so what how to get this layout
it's very simple just go for a new
layout of first of all credo project
okay let me repeat this is not a session
very where you will learn about Android
this is a session will we'll talk about
how to build a project okay okay so what
I will do now is okay so what I've done
is we have created the project and in
this main activity of course when you
put a new project you get this activity
by default and in this what you do is
you have to use of okay so we have a
linear layout inside that you are using
a frame layout we have to make sure that
we are using a expandable list view
again you might be thinking from where
to get this it's actually very easy when
you go to design tab somewhere you'll be
getting expandable least view here if
you have any physical scroll down so
container expandable list view against
that we have expandable list view there
this is what you have to drag on the
screen okay
get on the screen so that you will get
so you will get this list so what we
have here is we got this relative layout
and then we got a frame layout and then
causal expandable list now if you are if
you are wondering how will you get this
code don't worry once the session gets
over by tomorrow
I mean one or two days I will be
uploading this project or or this code
on the github as well and you will be
having the axis for the kicked-up link
where you will be having all the talk
where you will be having the entire
project with you okay now question
arises where you where you will find
this or you will find this on so we have
a that is called group so if we have a
group on Facebook or asterisk or like
project you have to make sure that you
are a part of that group so yeah so make
sure you have that you are using you are
a part of it or escape route because
that's where you dis you will find the
link for this for this code and okay and
the recording of this so this is the
live session the recording of this
session will be available on the disco
Pro so make sure that you subscribe the
channel also because that's where you
will be getting the advanced videos okay
so this is expandable view and once
you've got once you got that this is how
it looks now the name of the name of the
expandable view we are using here is lv
e XP again that's doesn't matter was it
means it's simply it simply means list
view expandable okay and then I have to
also make sure that the data is coming
from the group of data is coming from
the from the from the from the internet
right okay now close your eyes from
where I'm getting that data as you can
see I am getting that data which is on
the its here which which is not here
because as you can see have recompiled
this and I have written I have removed
all the code is blank now so from where
I will getting that reading that code so
I have already crater that link and I
have done that on the server side oh
goodness
search for bad ways the length is a
length let me just get that link for you
let me show you what it returns so this
is the link I am just copying that and
let me use one of the browser I will use
Firefox because as the only browser
which is not busy with other things
other browsers are busy with of some
other things
okay now where is my life coordinates
here okay so as you can see what I'm
doing here is the 5 sake controls by you
if I set pace okay this is the plank now
on the server side if you have ever seen
my java light session we have done this
right we have created these lengths
which is one of this link is get T
name's Jason now it is what is what is
it doing its what is what this T named
Jason is doing is to understand that let
me just go to my website which is the
which is my website be still calm and as
you can see we have a code page so on
the website as well we have a code page
again designing is not that good because
we are still working on our designs and
okay so in this java tab can you see
that we are getting all these names so
we want the same names okay this is what
I want to achieve in app as well if I
click on Fibonacci I should get the
figure I should get the video for
Fibonacci and I can decode I don't want
the video in the in the mobile app but I
want the code so I want this code for
Fibonacci on or while phone right so
okay what do I do here is if I click on
this job or if I click on so I want this
list now this is a website right so I'm
getting this data from the from the
database for for angle as well I have go
to this link which is called as get
teenage Jace and if I say enter you can
see this is the data we are getting this
is the same data this is the same data
which I am using here so as you can see
we have a spring MVC we have Java then
we have JDBC we have some like this is
the same data right so but then what is
this format now if you can observe
closely we have done some weird stuff
okay now as you can see this is the
topic if I if I expand this size I hope
you can see that as I can see some
people are saying not visible okay so
this is the length so this is the thing
which you are getting is topic so this
our main topics spring MVC Java JDBC and
serve like these are the main topics as
you can compare with this
with the main topics okay this is also
increased I just reviewed okay so the
main topics are spring MVC okay what's
happening why he's not getting any mies
okay so main topic is spring MVC java
then we have JDBC and services our main
topics and inside this we have some more
topics example we have do get do post
addition right so we are getting this
topics here okay let me just check if
everything is working properly here okay
so these are the main topic JDBC servlet
and this topics are the sub part of that
now if you compare this with this if you
compare the same thing with our website
which is this is what you are getting
from the website this is what you are
getting from the link so you got this
main topics or spring MVC Java JDBC
servers are the main topics now if you
can see this is now being here now okay
we have done some what you say of what
you say in India v sage whole right so
so this is a flowchart thing here a
frugal think here which simply means
that this is my headings here and in
this array we have all our topics
example in this two-dimensional Arabic
we have two-dimensional array here which
is this and this one and that's right
that's why Fehmi it's Jason so we
basically we are using Jason here okay
so this is what we are returning in a
JSON format okay I can see we have a 113
viwers but I got only 45 likes that's
weird
come on guys if you if you like this
type of sessions do click on the like
button okay so yes so what I do now is
so yeah this is the two-dimensional
array now in two-dimensional array the
first added here the first Anna here
this is your blank arrays because in
spring MVC I don't have any codes now if
you see my database in my database in
spring MVC we don't have any code okay
for job are we have lots of quotes for
Java we have so this
the second ad is this is the first time
which is blank the second a day it's
getting over somewhere here so be happy
when I keep you happy I think oh we have
inheritance we have multi-level and for
JDBC so that's a third topic for Jenny
we see we have this added here remember
this thing because we'll be talking
about this int area as well and okay and
then what we have is a we have the last
one which is which is which is sublet
and solve that is here this is your sub
it code so do get do post addition of
two numbers right so we are sending two
things we are sending the headings and
we are sending the child elements I just
want to fetch this element and remember
this link link is called asterisk or
comm slash get T names json dot HTM you
can try this in your machine as well
just try the same link you will get the
same data so that you can refer and that
I would suggest that or what I'm doing
is I will be sending this I'll be okay I
will say copy and I'm pasting this link
in the chat window so I pressure that
ending in a bad window so you can access
that link and you will get the entire
data format okay
now this data is sent from the server
side okay so on the Java side on which I
have written this code and I view into
if you want to know how I had done that
so in the next session we'll be doing
the Java code as well for this one that
will be tomorrow on your tomorrow let's
see how that goes
okay so jr. James says a question is
from Jame is is Jason some kind of
format in which data is sent from server
to client yes that's same thing so Jason
is a database is coming from the server
side and it goes on the client side and
vice versa you can also send data from
client to server okay and Jace okay
James says what is CSUN or that's we've
never heard about that before anyone can
can you just help me with this what is
CSUN come on google it okay so let's get
back to this so we got this link here
and let me just go back to my under
studio which is here this is my n goes
to here is that it's here okay so how do
I fetch and assign the value here not to
assign that value first of all I need I
expand able view
and okay now how do we use expandable
view here one more thing since I'm
fetching data from this server we have
to make sure that you are giving the
internet access so when you get this
application this is your this is your
permission so we have assigned a
permission here okay yeah so this is the
this is the internet permission I am
giving so because I am requesting to a
server so you have to make sure that
when you write a code you are giving
this permission for the internet which
is used users permission Android and
then Internet and if you're thinking is
this app is already available so yes
this app is available on in Play Store
so let me just share that link as well
okay so just go to Play Store Android
Play Store and search for the disco we
already have at the disco app this is
the new version this is this has some
extra features we already have a version
1.3 this will be version 2.0 so by the
time you can do for that time you can
download 1.3 okay now question arise how
we can use expandable list so we have
this main activity the first object I
need here is expandable dish adapter now
why do we need adapter again I have sent
you the video as well
the Pyrrhic wizards so expandable least
ListView works with adapters because
scene expandable list view we have to
send some data right we have to fill up
the data and the way you can fill up the
data is with the help of adapters again
we have different of sub adapters
available one of the adapter is this one
which is expandable leashed adapter now
if you are thinking this is a into glass
no no no this is this is the class which
I have fitted here I will show that
class in class to you in some time okay
so first of all we need expandable list
view of course because we are using
expandable list view I want to I want
expandable list adapter for obvious
reason I am using I am using I want to
feel data here so I want to fill up all
the data next thing is I want the
headers now what is headers
if you know the output in the output
window we have that code right we have
code we have I mean we have that Java
MVC those things are our headers here
and the child's are this one now if you
can see for headers be I'm using this
because that makes sense why these are
these top topics we have Java spring MVC
but why I'm using hash map for the child
it's because I want to use a seats think
about this if you have choice we have
four different topic we have different
choice right we have two child I mean
for for Java we have ten child's for for
sublet we have two child so we have to
specify when you talk about those charge
it belongs to some topic right and
that's why I'm using a hash map where I
will say okay for Java what I've done
for Java so topic name Java so that's
why using hash map right label and the
key value pair so when the key when the
key is Java the values would be will be
subtopics of Java when the value will be
sublet the least would be subtopics of
this servlet right that's why we have
this list data child and these data
hider okay okay just let me know
getting everything in the I mean you
just use your chat window to let me know
that if you feel getting this stuff or
not guys if you're watching this life
okay so yes so what we are doing here is
a yeah so we have we have a my activity
right where you have all these things
okay why I am using this log or we don't
need this lock anymore let's remove that
I will return that log there doesn't
matter and then we need to context now
while you need a context because I want
to feel the data right so I will
referring that data using are using
excusing this expandable least adapter
okay now Coachella is how that
expandable leash adapter works okay
first of all what I'm doing here is just
I'm filling the I'm just creating the
objects for that as you can see I am
declaring it here I'm not defining it so
of course we're to define it as well
right okay so you want me to repeat this
lease data header okay so this this data
header is simply the name of the topic
this example we have Java we have we
have Java we have spring MVC right so if
you if I go back to my thing so this are
my least headers these are the main
topics and the internal part this is my
child so this entire Java code belongs
to Java topic right this topic so this
is the key so Java is the key here and
this one till here is a this is your so
that's the least and that's a key and
this is a value okay so what I will do
now is I got this objects right and
don't worry I'll be sharing this Cody
with you or you with the github link and
you will find the github link on our
Facebook group and if you don't know
about the Facebook group let me just
share the link in the chat window so I'm
showing that I'm putting a link
check the link in this chat window about
of the Facebook group so this is the
group valium your very will find the
link for the github for the gate for
this project okay now once we got this
thing what I want is I want to fill up
this data right now I want to feel this
data which is expandable ListView how we
can do that how we can actually do or we
can fill the data to do that we have to
first create we have to first create
this object of least adapters you can
see we have not initialized it yet okay
now how do we initialize this okay so
what we'll do here is we'll say least
least adapter equal to
okay let's at least adapter now how did
I get object of this now to create an
object we need to create object of
expandable least adapter okay now where
you will find this class as you can see
I have created this class which is
called as expandable list adapter and if
you might be thinking we got so many
things here right I don't worry I have
already created the video for this I
don't know if you have seen that video I
have said some prerequisite for this
session I just hope you have seen that
video everyone so this is that in that
video I have talked about how to use
expandable least adapter okay still I
will try to I will try to upload okay
just let me just dock this guy is
mahajan okay a block pickpocket don't
worry everyone I just blocked I use
Mahajan don't worry ignore that just
focus on the code so yeah what we have
is we have expandable this and up top
which is X which is extending Base
expandable adapter and trust with this
one of the this is one of the most
difficult topic and this is one of the
most difficult topic in android okay if
you are finding it difficult that's okay
this is one of the most difficult topics
a okay so what we have to do is this
base expandable you should have ties
this is the inbuilt class okay so you
don't have to worry about that it's just
that when you create a object of
manipulator constructor for expandable
you should have tog you have to pass
three things now why those three things
first we have to specify the context now
while context because it specifies which
version you project you're working with
right the next thing we have to mention
here is okay my official says adapter
class is hard it's not exactly hard but
then if you are new to programming you
find it difficult to understand adapter
design pattern but if you are if you
have some development experience adapter
is not that difficult it's just that
when you when you learn a programming
for the first time of course you will
find it if you get to understand that
okay so we have to pass three parameters
the context the least the least of
headers and this hashmap
okay so we got list off headers and we
got hash map here this will be this hash
map will be child and Easter Fighters
would be the topic main topic and I'm
just assigning this values now if you're
thinking you ever type this code by
yourself don't worry everything here
from here to here it will be given by
your eclipse okay
let me show you the not Eclipse IDE if I
cut this part if I cut the entire part
and if you can see we are getting an
error here you simply have to get a
class which extends basal expandable you
dr. and just about this if I see this
there might be okay is that as I it says
implement methods just click on that
okay
okay oddish calmly what's happened you
can't hear my voice yeah exactly
so this is following a java adapter
pattern so as you can see we can expand
we can get all this clock all these
methods here and you get all these
methods right you just have to change
the code of it and we also have a
constructor too if you want to construct
a jury just right click all you can also
say okay if you're using a Windows it is
all all you insert if you're using Mac
it is a command and simply say oh okay
what we have been a constructor here
significant constructor with all the
three variables and Rickon okay you can
see everything is given by your IDE you
don't have to worry about this okay but
I will not use this code I will write my
how to be written the code here to
understand this better I would recommend
you to watch my video on expandable so
if you are watching this video offline
just make sure that you're watching you
have seen my expandable least expandable
least view Android video which is
available on YouTube okay so so all this
data the same code is available in the
video as well so I will not touch this
video I bought I will not touch this
code here let me just close this okay
let's get back to our main activity and
we have to pass three parameters here so
in this expandable least adapter have to
pass three parameters I will say enter
the first parameter you have to pass is
gone
the second okay I have to do that before
this I have to say con equal to main
activity this before here so over here I
give you have to pass con then we have
to pass the object of leashed header and
then we have to pass least beta charge
we have to pass the Z parameters because
that's how it that's how it gets it and
once you got this we have to set the
adapter now how we can do that it's very
easy we simply have to say okay how do
we do that we say e XP it is exp dot
least we thought there is a method on a
set
set okay with that okay we have to say
set adapter when this we have to pass an
object of leisure adapter the moment we
do that the least expandable ListView
will get all the data right so whatever
data you your expandable lesion of this
providing you will get all the data and
that's where the problem starts
Coachella is how you are expandable the
adapter will get all this data right
that's the real problem here now to do
that okay if you want to achieve that
what we have to do is okay what we have
to do is we cannot do this thing here of
course why we cannot we cannot do this
thing here we have to do this thing once
we send a request to the server and once
we get the response okay now how do we
do that how we get how we how you will
get the response here now anyways you
want to send a request to the server and
face the data we all know there is one
important thing okay what is that
important thing and I guess we have to
use something called as a sync task now
question is how do we use async task
before continuing everyone just if
you're watching this if you have just
joined this session we are doing a live
Android coding this is this session is
getting life and this is the live
session this is not a pre-recorded one
and if you are watching this later of
course you will be watching the recorded
one but the recorded one will be
available on Telescope our channel and
if you have not seen this video I have
not click on the like button yet Duke
just do that so that I will know that
you enjoyed this session okay I will be
having saving a the streaming is will be
saved on the disco flow channel so there
is hope your channel link is available
in description description as someone
has pointed out okay so we have to use a
async task here now how we do that it's
very easy actually to use async task
it's just that async task will be your
what you say it will be in a class for
this so let's say public or opera before
people go for private I don't want
anyone practice this from outside
yeah we can also use what is ivory but
we have not seen that I have not used
that yet we have retrofit yes we have
lots of base I'm staining of old days
now I'm still using async tasks if you
can help me with this guy's drag and
Remy if you can provide me with a with
the code okay see I'm keeping this open
for everyone that's one of the reason
why I'm doing this live after this code
if you feel that you can you can do this
code much better I completely understand
that because it's been a long time I
have not into Android now because I am
focusing more on the enterprise side so
it's been a long time have not worked on
Android I might be working with the old
technology if you know the delay - one
of this do send me your code and that
will be very definitely very helpful for
everyone so if you have already worked
on this if you have some beta code just
send me the code and I will replace my
code with your code okay so if you have
any better idea then this will be using
volley or using okay Ashish calmly if
you're not understanding this that's
fine I guess you have not seen the
earlier videos but don't spam this chat
window please it's you know otherwise
have to block you please okay so okay so
give me up code which is better than
this and trust me I will make okay I
mean it will be helpful for everyone
okay great so what I do now is I will be
using async task and if you have a bit
of code just tell me that I will be
making one more video with that new
thing okay okay so I will use async task
use I will say for private class I will
say get Jason beta okay you can use any
method in that's fine I will use get
decent beta and when you want to create
or async task simply say exchange class
with async task which is
I will say async task now it takes three
generic type the first type ok let's
let's see which ended touch it asked for
it says whatever parameters you will be
sending I will be sending a string type
of parameter I don't want to see any
progress I will say void
I want a result in a boolean format how
to call the data or not okay so let's
say I want me talk with of type
genrich's so the parameter type would be
string the progress type let's avoid and
visual type would be of type boolean
again we kids we could okay that's it
little boolean and once we do that okay
this is done weeks if we don't know this
is generics this is generates okay we
specify whatever beta I want to use now
of course your async task also has some
uninhabited methods we have to implement
that as well right so let's click on
this and say implement methods and okay
by default you get this only one method
which is undefined we just do in
background right now so doing dialog
take some parameters now when you say
dot dot dot if you are not familiar with
this a dot dot dot means where arcs in
Java like if you don't know what where
arcs just search for where arcs in fact
I have seen lots of developers who work
on Android
okay so I have seen people who are
working on Android from a long time but
still they don't know what is this dot
dot dot so I mean last week I realize
this they don't know about this so I'm
not saying if not everyone knows about
this but then some people they don't
know so this is called as we're also if
you don't have about this just go to my
channel and search for a video on red
herbs you would understand this how this
dot dot dot works its well all's okay so
okay so what I do here is into
background okay with this in an async
task we should be using two more methods
one of them is pre execute and post
execute because before the executive is
I want to have something and after
executing this I want to have something
right so whatever you do here is a yeah
I forward
mentioned that right yeah this is this
is this is actually a this is actually a
added so this is this patterns is
actually an array you can send multiple
parameters the okay okay so yeah so we
have VP to more thing or we can also use
all probably update yes we can do that
but for this example I'm not using that
okay I told you right if you if you have
something better just tell me that mail
it will be better okay so I want to use
one more method here which will be which
will be method which is called as
protected avoid on pre execute or giving
with the option on pre execute now what
I do on this pre execute is I want to
set some data I want to set something
example when the when when you are like
sending a request to the server it will
take some time right so it will be
taking some time for this to get load
right so for the time will be will be
giving that circle you know will be so
you showing that loading sign and for
that I will be using a progress dialog
will say focus dialogue dialogue and
let's get optic of this somewhere here
so in this I will say I will say that up
equal to let's get object of that with a
new probe this dialogue and for which
activity you are working with its own
specific black key because on that it
will be showing this dialogue so I would
say main activity address Oh
yeah so once we got that one sets data
let's say if I say dialogue in fact you
know what I will do I will not do this
now once we complete the code let's
let's say this important or not timely
let's not do that and let's not waste
our time on that and if it is not that
important okay so let's get work with
doing background so what I will do here
is first of all whatever could I would
do I think it will make mate Rosen
either/or and at the end of course we
have to save it and true because I want
to make it work so since it might one
exception I will say I will order it I
will of course write this exception here
which is strike as an exception it might
throw an exception let's print back and
the shortcut for this is out and let's
print e okay so okay now in here first
of all I want to send a request right
now anyone to send a request we have to
use a we have to use certain codes okay
so instead of typing that code here I
will simply copy paste that code okay
because it takes lots of time so for
connecting with this server this is the
code which I want to use so let me just
copy that code from somewhere and let me
just paste it here okay so yeah so first
of all you this you need this URL
because in this URL you can specify what
request you are sending okay I guess
this is also our thing okay so this is
the URL which you are say requesting and
then once you say open connection the
request will be send the method will
show which we are using okay the
connection will be done here the method
which we are using here is get because
we are fetching data you can of course
use get post put any with any HTTP
method which we want and so yeah so once
we fetch the data of course we'll be
using buffer you know to fetch the data
so once we got no Fido object here let's
fetch our data there now once you fetch
it where do we store it so we store that
in a addition so we say Jason equal to
and
fetch the data how we can do that we can
simply say bufferedreader God will say
read line will say read line that's it
it's a buffer you don't read line we
will get our data okay and we just have
to make sure that this is not null okay
so whenever whatever we do now we make
sure that is not null okay yeah all
programmer all programmer and the
copy/paste from Stack Overflow that's
why but I am NOT talking take an atomic
stack of long I have already had this
code now I don't know where I got this
code because this code this project is
actually built by my ink tones so so
that's that's how they do it okay so
what we are getting here is see if you
see the output we are getting this stuff
right so what I want is I want to store
this data somewhere else which is in one
of the least and I want to store this
data in maybe not least of least as you
can see this is two dimensional array
right this is a two dimensional array or
you can say it is a least of a least so
we can refer this one as a least and we
can refer this one as a least off laced
so your top the main subject name is
list and the topics inside that it is
the top them the topics here is least
top list so we need to we need two
objects here we say least I want a list
object so I will say list of string okay
I will end this as maybe our topics I
will say this is subjects and subjects
piece of type as it is so it's a new
ArrayList
okay the next thing we need is least off
list because that's a list of list why
so it's a list of three stops playing
and this will be your topic so topics
would be new at the least okay now once
we got that we have to check if my Jason
is not equal to null because sometimes
you know you don't get data from the
server it will give you null value we
don't have to do
we don't want that okay so how do you
face the data now so what I want is
first of all whatever data you are
getting that that is not in a proper
format right because as you can see I
have done some frugal thing here which
is I'm fetching the least and then I'm
fetching the data in the same Jason and
I'm stopping submitting that jason with
the help of next year which is n a n n
VA AV v iinn okay this is just a fluent
thing this is not the actual way you
have to do that in real life this is not
how we do it
okay we do it with some good good thing
I'm just using the fool thing here but
how do I separate that data so what I
want is first of all I want to create
two different string not one some say
string Jason one I will get an array
here I would say I would say no added
here we'll say the data will be coming
from so I want to put it to string so
usually we have one beta I want to
separate into two parts and the
surficial should be done based on my
name so this is split split with n a n n
a a VV iinn that's how that's what we
are getting from Excel right so now what
will happen is this string will be split
into two parts this part will be one
string and this part will be second
string so in total it are getting two J
sighs okay so but once we got this to
Jason let me let me convert that into
Jason okay how do we do that now if you
print this jason of one and jason of i'm
jason of zero and jason on one you will
get a string format
I don't want string format what I want
is yeah we can also use Jason format
here that's our Jason debo but the
problem is I'm using adjacent library
here and I guess there's some issue with
that in the next in the next session I
will be working with Jackson okay so I
will teach you how Jason walks on that
video
so we're also talking about this in the
next video guys don't worry
again once again if you are watching if
you have just drawn this session and if
you are very hopeful for this type of
session just click on the like button
that's what motivates me to create the
next video right so okay so I'm
seriously even I need okay what is
Jackson Jackson is desirey so the baby
okay so okay what is Jackson now see we
are working with Java right and we have
to convert our Java object into Jason
and get to convert Jason into Java
object so we can do that with the help
of some some libraries one of the
library is Jason which we'll be using in
this project we can also use Jackson so
on the server side amusing Jackson on
the client side I'm using gzip
okay so how do I convert this into an
least your retrofit will be best right
and that's what I'm saying just give me
the project so cut so take this project
I will give you this project by tomorrow
and send me the project send me the send
me the project in one or two days I will
use that okay oh yeah so what I will do
here is I will copy at least I will say
subjects equal to now how I get me
something so I want to get this subject
from base and zero so Jason one zero I
mean Jason one of zero it has a string I
mean this is a string which has all the
topics which I want to send in the list
we cannot do directly we have to use a
converter here so we have to convert
this we have to convert this Jason or
string into a list we've got a question
from critique what what to do if a
server sign is PHP masculine that's fine
in fact in PHP as well we can create
Jason so jason can be created with
everything J with PHP with Ruby whatever
some technology we use
my laptop is not getting charged let me
connect the charger that's done
yeah with that we can do a debug that's
right so we can create a web service and
we can fetch the Jason okay so all these
things are in planning stage now so soon
I'll be soon I'll be making videos with
rich KPIs and how to fetch the Jason and
everything so don't worry everything is
on the way okay so not something coming
on the way and most of these videos will
be uploaded on telescopes but I'm say
okay and as you can see this session is
getting recorded and the off okay if
you're new to the session the the
offline session so once we got over the
offline session will be recorded or the
operation will be available on the
telescope your channel okay oh that's
great and yeah that is Coco's okay and
that is Coco is just okay I just made
that channel free okay don't worry
time it is free channel now so you can
subscribe there for no charges and if
you have already subscribed please
subscribe the channel don't worry your
money will not be detected deducted so
don't worry about that okay so what I do
now is I want to convert this right now
how do we convert this so if you want to
convert this we have to use a library
and the library which we are going to
use here is called as Jesus now
koshinage do I have this library in
built-in miss in my system
yes what I did is I have added one of
the one of the dependency which is
called a Jesus so as you can see it says
compile this is a barrel dependency I'm
adding this dependency which is Jason so
Jason is possible to convert my string
into into Jason okay so not not string
into object so the way you can do that
is by saying moo-hoo gisun so let you
get on with a decent
and which decent object has a method
called as for from Jason and you could
pass this thing here okay but have to
also mention what it returns it returns
at least is that simple
now whatever Gator you have in Jason it
will be converted into least
automatically you don't have to worry
about that the same thing can be done
for for topics as well so I will copy
this code will paste it here and stop
saying subject this is topics and this
is array one and I think we got this
list here he is that simple now once you
got this list what do I do is okay now
we have to write some advanced code so
just be with me everyone the code I want
to write here is okay now how do we
fetch see we have our data in subjects
and topics right we don't want our data
to be in subject in topics we want our
data to be stored inside this least
header and these two the least data
child so in head on I have to put I'd
theater okay so how can we do that okay
so we got a question from a personage do
we have videos on Jason no I don't have
videos on Jason second question is why
least and not at least yeah we can also
use a delicious just that whenever you
create a reference you should always get
references and object of object of a
class that's one of the design pattern
we further in Java
again it's not composite we can also use
a list okay that's fine okay so now I do
now is I want to fetch data I want to
assign those values in this so how do we
do that so to achieve that whatever I do
here is I will use a for loop and I will
say stretch one one value from subjects
so from subject which is subject or sub
: drunk subjects to fetch one one value
and let's assign that value in the least
idle so it is a leashed
data header dot add and let's add the
data via sub so whatever what
subjects you have here this is at least
right and you have to fetch one one
value
okay so monkey says do you have study
nearly cost college yes
I was a student up because College in
Mumbai in recording by any chance you
are my classmate okay yeah so I am
fetching the least here and I'm
assigning that least in this header and
what night I want if I want to assign
the child values as well now this is
this is the difficult understand just be
with me how do you fetch the child
values we can do that by saying first of
all see okay now okay so just be with me
guys it is difficult to understand if
you talk about this topics if you talk
about these topics here as you can see
we have so we have B we have at least
here inside that we have one more list
right so to specify we want to fetch
this list here how do I do that so to
maintain the count I will use one of the
variable here called as int count and of
course why it be count variables which
start with zero that's how we always
work with okay so we say int count equal
to zero and here I will maintain that
count and went in that count I will say
least of okay I would say one I will
fight one one string of the times I was
a nice top string and we'll say this is
P named the topic names or will say no
topic names will say yeah we can say
this is a pic of the key names equal to
we'll say a whatever say topics dot and
particular a days so we'll save his
bench count so at one time it will fetch
b1 entire added right for that subject
you can fetch one particular array okay
okay so once we got this list and I will
say least beta child dot foot okay and
here I will put those two things first I
will mention the topic to mention the
subject right so because say for Java so
subject will be Java and then we'll be
having topics for that and those topics
are actually stored in p names in i have
those topics right i do that i just have
to increment the counter operator and
our job is done do you think it will
work
let's try we just have to do one more
thing if you remember i told you that
this thing will not be here this should
be somewhere else so this thing should
be inside one of the method called as
post execute because once we have
completed completed the execution here
here like shear so please call her as ah
um ticket and this i have to say it pays
this so once we have completed dystopia
once we have done little loading at that
point i will create my list adapter at
that point i will say set adapter are
done with this I hope it will work now
so I don't know how many of you think it
will work
let's try okay let's run this so by the
time it clones everyone this is a like
session if you okay alright because lots
of people are joining now so this if you
want to read watch this session you have
to make sure that you go to the disco
pro because that's where this video will
be uploaded by tomorrow evening so this
is the live video or this will not be
available on the disco learning it will
be available on to this code to disco
training oh there is copper oh okay and
I can see there's no this is not working
why
let's run this once again and we are
getting error is it there's an arrow
here okay what's wrong
can you see any problem here guys I
can't see any mistake can you just
figure it out for me what's wrong in
this code everything seems good I have
set at the data
oh I'm not calling gee decent oh my
mistake so I should be going to Jason as
well right how can i how can i forgot
that so we had to call this Jason
request as well so before this okay
before calling what do we do here is I
will say a new get Jason beta god I will
say execute
I'm already given the permission is just
that because I'm not sending requests so
I could send a request for this
particular URL so let's copy that URL
and let's paste here so it's HTTP colon
slash slash paste but already highly
should you pee that's weird and let's
say that's it oh it should work now I'd
run this code it's running it's running
it's running okay can you see that we
got our thing this is what we wanted
right so if I click on this okay we got
the list as well when then this click is
not working oh this click is not working
so what we'll do is we'll make it work
in the next session okay so we have only
done with the permission for me a
permission thing good so this is working
so we got this list as well right now
the next thing is if I click on this
ternary operator it should pop up an
interpreter or you should give the code
and that's we'll be doing in the next
session yeah hi monkeys yeah I know
about pathless or his amazing amazing
teacher I know him okay
so yeah that's it guys so that's it from
this session in the next session we'll
be doing this on will be doing will be
working on this clicky one so this
project will be available on github I'll
be sharing the link in the group so you
have to make sure that you in a part of
Facebook group and you will find all the
links you will find all the links in the
chat window or in the indica in the
description area okay so where will be
next and okay where and well will be the
next video the next session will be in
this link itself let's see maybe on a
Saturday somewhere and or maybe Monday
so let's okay maybe Saturday let's try
with Saturday and if the code will be
available on github are you sharing the
code link on the Facebook group okay
great so yeah so do let your friends
know about this channel everyone and let
them know about this channel let them
know about what we are doing here so my
main idea is to teach as many people as
possible because that's what I want to
do from my from my college days in fact
when I was in recast college let me just
do some description in there so when I
was in because college at that time
itself I was thinking about teaching
people I was a project leader there so I
love to teach people so so yeah so I
want to teach as many people as possible
so do share this video with your friends
and if you are new to this session just
click on the like button so that they
will know that you enjoyed this session
and okay so let's answer some question
by the time so you can stop the
recording here so we got some puke we
got some questions here the question is
now you want me to put the link in the
in the in the description here okay
let's let's see how it works a second
what I do for learning okay okay I am
NOT a full-time youtuber actually I am a
corporate trainer basically and I'm
doing corporate training from a long
time so I do visit different companies
what some of my clients okay I work for
Polaris JP Morgan then Accenture so I
should take training there
so that's what I do for I do for earning
so that's my main thing so I'm a
corporate trainer having experience of
more than five years now so that's it
that's what I do so and I also conduct
online training from there that's one of
the way I earn but then this is YouTube
is something where I will you know I
love to do it it's just that I wanted a
flow channel because some serious people
will be dead in the channel you know I
want people because on YouTube title is
called landing we have so many people
you know I wanted some people to be very
specific for these things so that's what
I want you to go for let's see how it
goes now so that's it everyone I hope
you enjoyed I can see only one one seven
likes this creepazoid button guys come
on hit that up button ok so that's it
signing off everyone see you in the next
live session</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
