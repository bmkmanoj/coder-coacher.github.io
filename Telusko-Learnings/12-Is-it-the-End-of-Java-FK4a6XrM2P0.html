today we'll talk about a question
basically we discuss a question here and
the question is is Java is about to end
and the answer is no now in today's
discussion maybe I will hurt someone
emotion maybe people who love Python or
C or maybe other languages the thing is
this we you know we talk about a new
program or let's say you are doing comm
science or maybe any field in IT so the
first language they will teach you is C
and then we move towards C++ and then
you will learn Java and then they are
these are trendy when you learn
different languages right so we have
Python we have Haskell we have Scala and
this people they claim that Java is
about to end now how a language you know
if you talk about this word we have
eighty percent of mobile market is
captured by Android and Android is based
on Java think about the future
technologies when you talk about which
technologies it's all about cloud so we
used to have a pig we are not based we
have those days when we manage to work
with desktop so we have desktop in that
we have Windows right we have Linux we
have Mac then we are going for a world
of mobile phones and in future all these
mobile phones and desktop or laptop will
be based on cloud now think about cloud
sector so if you talk about cloud now
all the cloud servers all the cloud are
technologies they are based on Java now
you might be knowing about this hadoop
technology right or you can talk about
Big Data now if we talk about banks
financial sectors or healthcare centres
we they all need tools to work with big
data because we are living in an age of
information or sometimes we can say it
is as information age so in this age the
most important part is information right
of course so to process those
information will require something
called as a big data tool which is
Hadoop and
do please build on Java so think about
it we are saying it's about to end and
all the future technologies are based on
Java now I'm not saying Java will be
there for next 50 years but for next 10
years is there okay so now if you change
if you check all the indexes where you
have the ranking of programming
languages Java is still on top if you
compare with this your 2002 so in your
2002 the market share for Java was 25%
and current market share is 15% but
still that 15% matters because in the
last ten years we have lots of languages
like we are coming with Haskell then we
have Scala so we have lots of language
to compete with right but Java still
holds a command now there are some
people they will claim Java is very in a
bulky very where you can work with
Python it is easy to learn but hold on
when you run a Java code for to print
HelloWorld Java code run faster than the
Python code again this is this is you
know this is proved by some programmers
you can also do that you can you know
you can you can monitor your performance
by using some tools but if you check for
the hello world of course my job will be
faster when it when it comes to file
handling you know to handle a file in
Java yup right around 12 amps of code to
handle a file in Python you applied only
two lines of code yeah that's the
advantage of using Python all right but
if you talk about the enterprise they
will software's let's say let's talk
about your creating a software for maybe
banking sector so for that they need a
big software maybe enterprise level
software and all this enterprise level
software they use Java because it is
stable it is robust and it can handle
multiple transactions all right now if
we talk about the cool part of Java when
you say code Java so we don't have a
much updating codes our except that
functional programming where you have in
Java 8 but if you talk about the
advanced framework so in Java we have
hibernate we have spring now also about
head you so all these are based on Java
so we have a
in a really good future for Java so I
hope you know this this video will clear
your doubts about what or why to choose
Java I know you will be having some
question why to choose Java and why not
to choose Java right to go for other
languages so I'm not saying don't learn
Python I'm not saying don't learn Django
I'm just saying
Java is there okay it will be there for
next 10 to 15 years so that is one this
video if you still have any problem you
can just comment it so that we can make
a new video where you can discuss all
these problems so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
