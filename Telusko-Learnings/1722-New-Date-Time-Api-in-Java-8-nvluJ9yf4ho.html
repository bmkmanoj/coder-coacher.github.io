different toys for learnings and in this
video we'll talk about date/time API I'm
at the new date/time API in Java 8
before Java 8 we already had data API I
always used to wonder you know why the
earlier date and time API is so weird
and try it if you can see in my complete
playlist I don't have any video which
talks about date API but since in Java 8
they have updated the date API which is
which is way better than the last one so
that's why I'm taking taking this video
here now why what was the issue with the
earlier earlier date/time API the first
issue is if I want to create the object
of date if I say date D equal to new
date and if I want to import the package
can you see that if I if I simply get
the solutions you can see date API is
there in two packages SQL and util so
SQL package date deals with the date
format which is suitable for MySQL I
mean for any database and this Java
Packham in the Java package date deals
with the Machine machine specific date
or human specific date so instead of
having I mean it always creates some
sort of confusion right if you import
the first package it will give you the
error for the second package if you
write the second one so I always used to
hate that part that the first problem
the second issue is so the first issue
is the same classes in two packages the
second is even if you want to format
let's say if you want to do some
formatting on the date format I mean the
date we need to we need to import one
more package which is import Java dot
txt so this was the package which to
which is to have all the available which
all the classes which is used to format
the date so that is the second issue the
third issue is all the date packages I
mean the date classes those are not
thread safe okay when you say thread
save it simply means that you know it is
not so but if multiple threads are
walking on the same date object and if
one thread is work if one that is making
the change
the other thread will suffer right so
that's that's the issue with uh with the
old date/time API so the new date/time
API in Java a the first thing it is
immutable okay which means you cannot
change I mean even if you're changing
the existing value it will create a new
object for you it is more simple to use
so let's see how to use the new
date/time API now to use it first of all
you need a JDK 8 in your machine I mean
JDK 1.8 if you are using 1.7 it will not
work so the way you use it is let's talk
about the first class I mean we'll talk
will not talk about all the classes here
we'll talk about one or two classes the
first one is local date so local date
these it actually deals with the local
day time in the system define date will
say local date which belongs to a
packaged Java dot time so no more you
kill package fought for daytime API we
have a special package for this Java dot
time ok we'll name this object as deed
self equal to new now we don't say new
is because we don't want to pay the
object here what we'll simply do is
we'll say local date dot now so now is
the method using which you can you know
if you try to print the D value it will
simply print the date because earlier
when you have to print when you have to
get object of date and when you want to
print the date it used to print the date
and time when I'm asking for date why
you're giving me time that's weird right
but if you use the new one it will give
you only date I'm asking for the date it
is giving me for the day it is giving me
the date you got the date here which is
21st 10 2016 the today's date here okay
so that's how we use the date we can
also mention the particular date if you
don't want the today's date what we can
do is we can specify the date here and
to specify the date we have to use our
off method where you have to mention the
e or I will say the e o is 1989 I will
say month is August which is 8 and day
of the month is 20 that's my birthday ok
and if I learn this code you can see we
got in 1989 8 and 20 but hold on is it
this 8 is August
this 8 is September because the problem
is if you are starting the number from 0
then that should be September right but
if you are starting with one that should
be August that's the biggest confusion
so to remove the confusion we can also
use a month of class called as month
which has a which has all this what you
say all this month see I will use my one
which is August if I go to month oh it's
not a class it's a enum so in this yom
we have all this elements here so we got
month of august a file on this code we
get the same output this is 1989 0 820
but how about if I don't spend in August
if I say February ok that's weird
February and if I mentioned let's say 28
will it work
and it should work there's no issue but
as far as I make it 29 you can see it
will give you some bad words now because
1989 was not a leap year so that's how
it is that smart so that's how we used
local date we can also use local time
let's say if I don't want to use local
date let me remove this part let's use
local time so how do we use local time
can simply specify local time which
belongs to our package Java dot time
again we'll say T equal to local time
that's local time dot now so it will
give you the local time here let us
print the time we'll say print T and if
was on this code now you can see we got
the current time which is 5/6 57 and 591
milliseconds ok that's how it gives you
the local time here ok but you can be
specific I don't want the local time I
agree you can specify the time I mean
you can specify the time here let's say
if I say this is off and if I say this
is 1225
10 seconds and 999 milliseconds and if
all on this code you can see we will get
that particular time here ok so we can
also specify the time there
okay so we can use a local time or local
date and you can be very specific here
you can also specify the time zone let's
say I don't wanna take current time zone
I want if I say now it should it should
show me the time zone of us because when
I provide online training it is a huge
problem right because when I take online
training I have some of my students from
us some of my students from India some
of them after Singapore and from London
so I have to manage all those time right
I mean I forward all this talk all this
time so when I say I have a live session
at 9:00 p.m. today in ist I don't know
about about them right what is the time
zone for them I mean the time for them
so I can specify that I want a time zone
for so I can specify this zone here I
can specify this zone
ID dot off and okay when I don't know
these zone IDs how would I get design
ideas
okay before that before doing this let's
see how to fetch all the zone IDs when I
don't remember the best ways you can go
to Google and fetch all these own IDs or
you can do it by yourself here what I
will do is I will simply use can you see
let's see
zone ID has a method called as get
available zone ideas can you see that we
have this method gate of any available
zone IDs and this method here returns a
set that means if I use our enhanced
for-loop here to print all the elements
let's say string s :
zone IDs and if I print all the values
it will print all the zone IDs here can
you see that we got all these own IDs
okay and but the thing is it is giving
you not in a proper sequence it is
because it gives you all in weird
sequence but that's okay for us let's
fetch one of it let's say I want to
fetch any of my student in other place
or let's face with Qatar can you see
Qatar Qatar Qatar yeah quit let's say I
want to see the time in quit now so we
copy this and I will I will and I will
undo this part now
and here I will mention this this time
zone and if I print if I pray and you
can see the time they're the first line
so in in couette the timing is 2 p.m. is
it I'm not sure I'm not sure but the
system is saying that time so it should
be correct quite enjoy we can do one
more thing we can tie a let us say GMT I
want the current GMT so it will give me
the GMT there and if I run this code you
can see we got this is the current GMT
time which is 1140 in fact we can so
this is the human readable time right we
can also use the instant class so we
have one more class here which is
instant if I say instant instant dot now
it gives you the GMT I suppose if I say
I if I run this code ok it also gives
the GMT with date so it gives you date
and it also gives a dmg and you can see
that the time there it is 11 40 42
that's the GMT it is giving you ok now
this time is not human variable this are
for this is machine variable right so we
can use instant for machine readable and
we can use time in fact we can also use
date time so we can mention date time
okay for that we have to import the
package now date time will give you both
date and time and I suppose that it will
give you the same output you can see we
got the same output by the only
difference is this doesn't end with Z ok
that's weird
I know so we have machine readable time
and we have human readable time because
if you don't mention this zone here it
will give you the current time and
instant will give you the GMT so this is
human readable and this is machine
readable so these are the new date time
available is available and Java 8 so you
can explore more you can just do some
experiment and you will find some new
things so yeah that's it from this video
in fact you can also compare that so
there's a method called as is before you
can also try that and you can compare
the age you can form you can do
formatting so write out let me know your
what what what are the experiments you
have done in the comment section if you
have done some you have found out some
new ways of finding dates just mention
in the comment section and let me know
if you are liking my videos or not do
subscribe like my video and let me know
in the comments section what is your
thoughts about it
thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
