different skill set right so for
different different domains we have
different depend skillset example if you
were walking in a banking industry we
acquire banking skill set if you're
working in software industry software
skill set right but then in all the
industry there is one thing which is
common and that is presentation skills
because in your lifetime you'll be
having multiple opportunities where you
have to present on stage now maybe you
are you are you know in your polish or
if you are walking somewhere you have to
present now you can take it in a two way
one you need to present all you are
getting an opportunity to present
because sometimes it doesn't matter what
you know what matters is what you show
so you have to you can demonstrate your
skill set by presenting now maybe you
are into software industry where you are
working on a project what's important is
how can you impress people you have to
build a great product and you have to
also present it well because if you
cannot present it no one will buy your
product I mean not just buying means you
have they will pay for it but then you
have to impress people by your
presentation now same thing is
applicable if you if you are in any
domain you will be getting a chance to
present on stage or on the in the
meeting room you have to you have to
crack it right but then personalize how
you give a get great presentation so
this video I will help you to give those
great presentation
so welcome back aliens I'm now enjoy
different things for learnings and in
this video we'll talk about how to give
a great presentation so to give a great
presentation we'll go out two things
first I mean we have to understand two
things first what to do before
presentation and second what to do
during presentation
now when I say before presentation I'm
talking about the preparation and trust
me to give a great presentation you need
to prepare a lot I mean is they doesn't
matter who is giving presentation even
if you talk about two jobs before
presenting on stage I mean they used to
practice a lot of thing not just two
jobs if Mark Zuckerberg everyone if you
if you see a great presentation there is
huge amount of work being done before
the presentation right so you have to
prepare a lot but then what to prepare
then how to prepare first of all you
have to prepare a great content now okay
not just a great content you can say a
good content so how to how to get a good
content so once you once you have chosen
a topic let's say film if you've got two
topic from your from your college or if
it is your product which which you have
bailed in your company so that's that
will be your topic you have to do lots
of this search okay
you have to go to google you have to
search about the product you have to
search about the project or you have to
you have to understand how your product
works
that's about the research you have to do
lots of research when you are doing this
thing because if you don't have a good
research you will not feel that
confident so first you have to build a
great content second you have to create
great presentation okay when I say
presentation you know lots of people
they they imagine PowerPoint yes I am
talking about PowerPoint but then we can
also use some other tools PowerPoint is
not the only tool if you want you can
just take it out plays it calm so it is
PR easy I dot-com you will find amazing
amazing way of getting fifties I don't
know if it is available now but then it
was there I mean when I checked it but
then so we have PPT is all we have crazy
so you have to put it even if you are
using paper T you have to build a great
PowerPoint
now when I say great is not just about
content okay what what people do that
they take the entire topic and they put
it on the on the presentation on the
slides and no one want to read it trust
me as an audience we don't want to read
your presentation we want to hear it
from you and that's why you're on stage
right if you want your audience to
look at these slides and then you are
saying something that's the worst thing
you can do never read your slides
because when you read your slides what
happens you are you are showing your
back to the audience right and no one
will like it right so you have to when
you up there's anything you have to have
to give you you have to do face to face
right that's why you cannot don't give
lots of points on the PowerPoint you can
use one simple line now I'm a big fan of
stews orbs and if you if you look at one
of any of the presentation of two jobs
this is how it looks I mean you just
have one slide guy can you see that one
slide will have only one DITA one line
of data or one point it will not have
the entire but I'm an entire staff there
right so when you create a presentation
make sure it is sweet and short don't
fill up your slides with lot of content
then you need to practice you need to
practice your presentation but then how
would you practice there are multiple
ways you can do that if you have your
family members if you have if you have
your cousins what you can do is just
prepare yourself and present in front of
them but then you will you will say you
will we will feel shy and I know you
have all those things so what you can do
is you can present in front of a mirror
now that's a very old example of
presenting in front of middle-right but
nowadays we have this amazing device
which we all carry which is called as a
camera like a mobile phone which you
have a camera and nowadays we have a
trend of buying a good mobile phones
when I say good mobile phones having a
good camera so what we do we buy phones
which has a good camera right so what
you can do is you can take a tripod and
you can shoot yourself not that should
but you have to you have to you have to
shoot yourself and then you can observe
your presentation right so example I
have this experience you know I'm making
lots of videos and I observe my
presentation skills how am i doing in
this video what to improve what not to
improve in fact last year when I used to
make videos I should do this I don't
know why but I should do this now I am
controlling it so when you when you
watch yourself what you are doing you
can control your body language right so
give presentation give big I mean make
your make a video of yourself and you
can watch what's going wrong right
that's where what that's what you have
to do before the presentation what do
the
presentation so during presentation you
have to start the presentation in such a
way that you are hooking your audience I
mean that's what this hook so you have
to grab the attention of your audience I
mean there are multiple ways of doing
that maybe you can ask a question right
I mean if you watch amazing amazing
speakers standing on stage what they do
they ask a question because that is one
way you can grab the attention of your
audience even if you are feeling nervous
ask questions that is one way that is
one way you can get the bond between you
and as a speaker and the audience ask
questions but make sure you ask a
question where audience want to answer
don't ask them a big answer okay so if
you ask I mean how you feel about this
or you couldn't that's not the question
you have to ask maybe you can ask a
question which has answer which is yes
or no because by this you are getting
their attention I mean instead of saying
saying yes or no they can also raise
their hand because that is something
they are they are showing their interest
I know and trust me you as a speaker
when you get some feedback from the
audience you will get that confidence it
doesn't matter how nervous you are the
moment you get your first feedback from
the audience you will feel confident so
start with questions or you can start
with quotation you can ask you can quote
something I mean you can just go to
Google based on your topic search for
the codes and throw that code so bye-bye
so as say I mean Shakespeare what is
what's what's that in name by
Shakespeare so you can give those codes
based on the based on your topic I mean
don't give any code your code should
match your topic that's how you can
start these you can start because the
start and end is very important I mean
why start is important because that
start will hook your audience for the
entire for the entire for the entire
presentation and that anger will make
them I mean so if you end your
presentation a good way they will
remember it for a long time and that's
what you want why do you want to make a
lasting impression on your audience
right so start and end is very important
in between you can do some gimmick but
then start and and should be perfect so
start with the question and end with
interesting now what next you have to
look presentable so when you go onstage
you have to look presentable I'm not
saying you have to wear it for moles but
then whatever you wear you should know
how to carry it okay you you can wear a
jacket you can wear anything you want
but make sure you are feeling
comfortable by wearing it okay now what
next see all your audience they are busy
people okay they are damn busy maybe you
are giving your art you you're having a
meeting with twenty people everyone is
busy so they just came to see your to
see your stuff right don't take much
time if you are if you if anyone given
you a time you know you have just ten
minutes you can complete the
presentation from ten to fifteen minutes
so if you have ten to fifteen minutes
always take ten minutes okay no don't go
beyond the time always take minimum time
so if I give you you have a time to
speak for two to five minutes take two
minutes you have to make an impression
in that two minutes okay don't waste
your audience time by taking full five
minutes okay and while you are talking
make an eye contact because the moment
to make an eye contact they will feel
okay this guy is watching me I have two
such trade I have to be comfortable so
that's where you will grab the attention
of our audience again because if we
don't do I contact because if you don't
do eye contact when you will look for
you look at the ceiling you will look
look it down and that makes that looks
weird right so you have to make a
perfect eye contact and the last one is
your hands use your hands properly I
mean gestures are very important okay
because when you are saying something
don't come and don't take your hands on
your face that looks weird right I mean
if you if you read what I mean with
gestures to have so you can just go to
google and you can see textures so there
are lots of lots of post we say is don't
don't put your hands in your pockets
right don't don't take your hands back
off view and then don't put your hands
on your face that's loose veers right
but then if you are confident you can
you can put your hand anywhere I mean
even if I am putting my hand in my
pocket that looks comfortable why
because I am confident if I am NOT
confident that will look bad so you can
you can have any gesture I can say I
take my hand on my face that's fine you
should you should just look comfortable
because it doesn't matter where you I
mean what is the objections if you feel
confident with that gesture go with it
I mean there are people they feel
nervous with this gesture and they feel
their hands shake so that doesn't make
any sense right so you can have any
gesture with you are feeling comfortable
okay so but but before doing that make
sure you watch yourself again you can
you can take a video of you and then you
watch which gesture suits on you example
I guess this gesture shoots on me and
that's why every video starts like this
welcome back aliens because I feel this
suit did suits on me there are some
people this suits on them I mean you can
have any gesture you want right so make
sure you have your own gestures because
we all are different and we all have a
different way of gestures right there
are some people they take a photo like
this because they like the photo like
that so I don't know which which gesture
you will like so yeah that's about
that's how you can improve your
presentation so this presentation is not
about the content it's about how to
present on stage and there's one glass
step if you feel that when you go on
stage and you your body she was the best
one best the best way to avoid dot is
walk on the stage
in fact I cannot do that here because
I'm getting I'm getting recorded here
because the moment I go out you can see
I'm out of the frame now so I cannot
walk here but then you can do that on
stage you will be having a very big
stage there and you can use the entire
stage because the moment you move your
audience eyes and they're the phase are
moving with you right and it will grab
their attention so yeah that those are
the tips for presentation I hope you
liked it if you life you want some more
tips like this do let me know in the
comment section and that's a thank you
so much for watching and do subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
