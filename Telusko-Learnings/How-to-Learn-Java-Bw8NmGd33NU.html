20 and today we start with a new series
of Java tutorial now we have already
already have a playlist on Java and you
know you can lurch out from anywhere so
you can use books you can refer to
online websites you can refer different
video series from udemy or Udacity right
there are lots of websites but still you
prefer to learn Java from YouTube that's
great but since I already have a
playlist why I am creating a new list
and we already have lots of videos from
different trainers on YouTube then by
again I am creating this videos now I
have seen lots of comments on my channel
about what is the best way to learn Java
how to master in Java how to be
motivated to learn Java so then we just
have to learn same tags we should have
to learn the logic if we can implement a
software using the using Java language
and you're done right but still you
prefer you you want to do master you
want to you know you have to achieve
something that's internal confidence you
need to when you learn a new language
how to get that you know first you have
to change your attitude the problem is
if I talk about different fields of
Education so let's say if you are doing
basic physics if you are doing maybe
commerce if you're doing management so
we have different different topics right
or different areas to learn I am NOT
saying those are not difficult I'm just
saying we've equal a different attitude
when you learn different things in fact
I love physics you know I love physics
from what you say if it says my passion
example when I say some motion some you
know if I see some accident of train
akhtar I I can do it all those with
physics or no I love physics so it's my
attitude towards physics so you have to
learn programming you need that attitude
with you now as that attitude so first
our this question to yourself are you
are human if you answer is yes then my
friend you have to change your attitude
because to be a programmer to
in this IT world you have to be an alien
that sounds real I know let's go with
the example now so let's say you have
this pen okay so if you talk about this
pan this is we can write something right
so if you have to take this pen and you
have to write something so the main
feature of this pan is to write now the
problem is if you keep this pen here and
you have to say you have to write
something pen will not move it's because
science right it's a nonliving object
you cannot be body for it will not move
itself so you have to take this pen and
then you have to write right so this is
a pen which is not nonliving objects you
have to take this pen and you're right
so if you talk about this let's say you
have a matchbox or why we have a
matchbox here so if you talk about this
matchbox again you have to take a match
take and then you have lighted right but
if you talk about this pen drive okay we
have a pen drive here now if we talk
about this pen drive what is the main
use of this pen drive you can store data
of course right now let's say if I have
a mobile phone
this mobile phone is my mobile cover I
don't have a phone right now so let's
our form there which is recording this
video so let's say I have a phone and I
have a pendrive so in this pendulum I
have a movie maybe a new movie maybe a
movie 3d8 so I'm on my favorite movie so
let's say I have a movie in this
pendrive I want to move this movie into
the mobile phone ok so can I do this of
course not right it's because to to use
this pendrive
I need a electronic device maybe a
mobile phone or a computer wow this is
OTG pendrive for that matter so I can
connect this OTG pendrive to my mobile
phone and I have to press some commands
why we need
commands to work with pendrive can we
just open this better and take out take
out the movie is it possible of course
not it's because this pendrive doesn't
exist why it will not work in real world
it only works in virtual world so
basically we live in two worlds the
world and virtual world ok so if we talk
about this pen it's below
to real-world the matchbox it belongs to
a real world what about this pendrive
now you can you can touch this in real
world but it only works in virtual world
now it's a virtual world so so we have a
boundary here so in this side we have
all real objects on that side we have
all virtual objects so to work with
those virtual objects required or the
operating system like Windows pause we
have Android over so this on your
operating system so those are living
object in virtual world so we are living
object in real world os is a living
object in virtual world so to interact
this with with this pendrive we have to
communicate with OS which is a living
object in virtual world and that always
will work with this pendrive perfect
right now question arise who create that
oil because oil is itself a software
right and to build a software which is a
living object in virtual world we
require programmers now programmers
always think in virtual world right so
you have to change your attitude by
default you always think in real world
now since you want to be a programmer
you have to think in virtual world so if
you want to be the best program in the
world you want to create your own
technology something very different from
this existing things we have to think in
virtual world ok
that's the attitude of your change and
anyone who lives in virtual world will
not be called as human they are aliens
so my friend from today you people will
be aliens if you are not alien just try
to think like an alien I'm not saying
change your hairstyle change your don't
apply that to an tonight on your head
I'm just saying anything I'm just asking
you to change your thinking so from
today you are alien so I have to start
with tutorials so I will suggest watch
my videos make our dummies software
teach others you know that's the best
way to learn learn something implement
it and teach others to change this
attitude you can watch some movies you
know I have changed my attitude by
watching movies so you can watch this
movies again you can find those movies
in my description oh yeah that's it
that's how you can change an attitude so
completely series makeup we make makes
them to make some software and teach
others so thanks for watching and do
subscribe for other videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
