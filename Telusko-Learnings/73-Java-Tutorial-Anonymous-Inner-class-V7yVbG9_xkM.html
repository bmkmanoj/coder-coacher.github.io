so in this video we'll talk about
anonymous class now what exactly this
class is so before that let me take an
example here we say Class A again I'm
taking the same example of Class A in
this class a let's suppose we have a
medical a show and which prints so let's
say it friends in a show so if you know
if you know this code it will I mean if
you call the method which is show so we
have to we have to get opposite of e
right for that we have to say okay dot
show and we know in this code we got the
address inch in a show right and this is
what we know now let's say I want to
call show but it should not print in a
show it should print something else
let's say it should find I am the best
so if I fall show it should print I am
the best
for that either you have to change this
source code but it's I don't want to
change a class then what you do is you
have to create one more class which is B
now this class will extend a and even
this class will have a methyl as public
void show and this show will print I am
the best
okay and now if I create the object of B
you can see if I call show it will call
it will execute and the best right so in
order to change the existing method made
me to override that method right and
that but that's what we have learned in
method award writing so I want I don't
want the definition of a I want a
definition of B so I want a new
definition that's what we have that's
that's why you have done it so if you
observe this class be the only purpose
of this class is to override a method of
air rights that's the only purpose you
have in this scenario when you when you
when your only purpose is to override a
method you don't have to write this then
question arise if you don't write this
how we can achieve how we can achieve I
am the best
so what you can do is you can say a
before this semicolon we can provide our
curly brackets open and close now when
you say a new then the class name and
curly brackets open close even this
becomes a class now so this class here
will replace the class B so we can write
this method which is show method inside
this a I mean the object itself so we
don't have to create a be class there so
this is a new class now so this
is a class which doesn't have a name
which is doing the same thing which is
done by B but now it doesn't have a name
and that's why this class is called as
anonymous class so this is a class which
it doesn't have a name so if the only
purpose of your class was to over tie
this method we have done that here so
when you provide anonymous class and
when you try to create object of it you
can see this is a class and we are
trying to create the object of that
class this is called as anonymous class
and now this class scope is only here
you cannot reuse this class so if your
intention is to create a class only for
one-time use you can prefer to use
anonymous class here so do the anonymous
class it's a class which is which
doesn't have a name so how to create
that we just have to create an object
and just before the semicolon provide
the implementation so this is the
implementation of a class and if you on
this pod you can see we got the out
press and the best so when you call show
it is not calling this show of it is
calling this show of the anonymous class
so it is that simple that's how you use
anonymous class in Java that's it in the
next video we'll see how to use
anonymous class with interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
