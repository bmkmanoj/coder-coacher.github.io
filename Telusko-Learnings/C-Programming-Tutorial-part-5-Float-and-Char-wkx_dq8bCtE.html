about addition subtraction
multiplication and division of integers
what if I want to add two numbers like
one is 15.5 say one is 15.5 another
there is 5.5 now in order to add these
two numbers int will not work it's
because when you say 5.5 its two
different numbers one is your mint it's
your before a point and after the point
right so int only supports integer
number it doesn't supports real number
to work with real number C offers you
one more data type is called as float so
5.5 will be also a float and the
addition of both you have to say plus
the addition of both will be again float
and then we can say the addition so the
addition of this number and this number
is this I'd say this is num1 num2 and
result but hold on where nice when i
when i first started with this person
design i have told you that it works
only with int and yes person D only
works with end in order to work with a
float we have to use percent F and F
that may represent float and Knifer on
this the addition of 15.5 and 5.5 is 21
right again we are getting some zeroes
is because float gives you the size of
load is 4 bytes so it will try to cover
the remaining part in thought in those
zeros so this is how we have to work
with float variables so now we know what
is int variable and and we know what is
float variable now let's change the
example of it let me just instead of
this let me go with a new file so new
file will save it as a demo dot C now
there's one more data type called as
character so we'll see how to use
character now so we will say hash
include a study IO dot at
and hash include' come on IO dot H and
we'll say main function and this main
function we will use our character
variable will say Godsey now as this gas
cat means it supports only one character
at a time and the size of car is one
byte which comes out to be it's eight
bits it comes out to be eight bits okay
so now when you want to assign a value
to character you can diagnose and value
as let's say we'll say a C equal to we
want to say C equal to a is a character
here but when you work with this
characters you have to enclose your
characters in single quote for string it
is double quote for integers and float
no need of double quotes or single
quotes but when you walk with character
you have to mention single quote then we
have to clear the screen so it's likely
your screen and somewhere down the line
we have to say get CH so I get C and in
between I will print the value of C now
so how to print with use print F and
here we have to mention something and
the value the variable we have to print
is see if your see if it is int we say
person D if this is float we say % F
ever this character we have to use
person C person C represents character
I've run this file the output is a but
let's say what happens if by mistake if
I type D here so it should give me an
error right so we are expecting an error
here and when I run this oh it's giving
me a value now why only 65 why not some
other value let me do some prediction if
a is 65 what if what about B then
oh it's 66 if we can see some pattern
here if I say obviously if I see C it
should be 67 and bingo we are getting 67
that means every character will have
some type of value and this values are
called as
ASCII value now what ask is transfer it
is American so is American Standard Code
for information interchange that means
every character will have a key value
okay
now what if I have instead of capital C
if I have a small a now if I put in the
value of C it will be 97 because the
value for small C is 97 so your capital
value starts with a capital letter
starts with a which is 965 and your
small a starts with 97 so this is how
you have to work with characters again
and further will write a a code which
will print all the ASCII values of all
the characters for that we have to cover
lots of things that we'll see in the
next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
