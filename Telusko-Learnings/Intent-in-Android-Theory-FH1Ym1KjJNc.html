ready from 30 spell earnings and in this
video we'll talk about intense so if you
have or they talk about how to set up
your lender studio we talked about how
to add two numbers in Android how to
design your layout and all those things
right now in this video we'll talk about
intense now why it's so important let us
say you what you are building one
activity and then you want to call the
second activity the most important part
here it comes intent right so you have
to understand how intent works so that
you can call this second activity from
the first activity right that's how
that's what you want let's say you're
creating a login application after login
you want to create an you all look you
want to call our next active activity
then we can use intent now what are the
what is intent so intent is used for
communication between your system and
your application right so if we can use
it for in three ways so we can use it as
activity so you can start an activity
from using an intent you can start this
service so you can start in a service
using intent and you can deliver the
broadcast using intent so it's very
important right so you can start an
activity you can start a service and you
can deliver the broadcast using intent
so those are those are the uses of
intent then we have different types of
intent so we have two types basically so
we have different types so the first
type of intent is explicit so this is
explicit intense we have explicit and
the second one is implicit okay so we
have two types of intense now it is
explicit so let's say you want to call
an activity so from your application
your from your activity of calling the
other activity in your same application
right in this scenario you have to use
explicit because you know the name of
the second activity right because you
are clear you are creating the activity
so let us say we have activity activity
one and then we have activity 2 so you
are able to call activity two from
activity one is because you know the
name of the activity - that sounds crazy
right
so that is X plus set intent one is
implicit intent so let's say you don't
know so let's say you know in your and
what in your Android you have lots of
apps right one of the app is let us say
location app
and then on in your app you're locating
some-some person and suddenly when
somebody clicks on that now you cannot
show the actual map in your app so what
you do you take help of Google Maps so
you're sending messages from your
application to Google map application
and you don't know the name of Google
map app that sounds crazy right so
that's why we have to use implicit
intents okay so just to demonstrate that
how to call an activity which is
explicit intent to call the activity so
let us say we have two activities here
we have activity one and then we have
activity 2 so this is your a 1 and a 2
so we have two activities here in order
to call the second activity which very
simple just have to create you just have
to use a method which is start activity
this will do things for you so you just
have to create you just have to call a
method which is start activity but hold
on which activity in your application
you might have 15 activities which one
to call so here you have to mention
which activity but you cannot mention
activity name you have to mention the
object of intent so let's say my object
of intent is I so in order to call the
activity we have to create object which
is I here but then Keshava is how to
create I so we have to say intent I and
then we have to sin equal to new that's
all we do right so we have to say new
intent and in this bracket so in this
bracket you have to pass two parameters
right this is the first parameter is
from where from where your current
activity the second parameter is which
activity to call so the first one is a
one so we are calling from a1 to a2 so
we have to pass two parameters here so
again to start the activity so we are we
have to use intent to call the second
activity so we have the method name is
start activity in which you have to pass
intent object so again it is a class in
Java or in Android Android uses Java
so we have to say intent I equal to new
intent you have to pass two parameters
the first one will be the activity from
which you are calling the second
parameter is the activity you want to
call so in this you have to mention the
object
of a1 which is object dot this that this
and the second one we have to mention
the class name why class them because we
have not created the object yet so when
you call o to or a2 dot class it will
create the object entity you can see the
activity so that is intent for you there
are multiple uses this is one of the
simplest use of intent so in the next
video which is the practical of intent
individual will be we'll see about how
to use intent how to call an activity
those stuff so that's it from this video
if you have any doubts any questions you
can comment in these comment section if
you have some recomm if you want to if
you want some other video you can just
comment in that section and that's it
