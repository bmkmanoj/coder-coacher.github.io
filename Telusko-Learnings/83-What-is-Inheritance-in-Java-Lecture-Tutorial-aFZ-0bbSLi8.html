talk about something called as
inheritance now see in last tutorials
you have seen what is class what is
object right now let's suppose if I
hundred plus let's suppose I have a
class a right I have a class a now in
this class I have a method called as
show so you you know object knows
something object does something so what
object knows is variables what object
does is methods right so let's suppose
this plus a has a variable either method
called as show okay so now in order to
use in order to call or below first show
will go for some some logical will go
for some add method okay so we have we
have a class a in which I have a method
Wanda's add okay so it means this class
provides me a feature of addition or it
may be a dish of two numbers it may be
addition of two float numbers depends
right I have a class now in order in
order to use this method I need a class
or the tester class you might be doing
it so we'll say I have a class with
limit as main plus if I main plums
okay and in this main class I have
public static void main so this is my PS
p.m. Pollack static void main okay okay
now in this main function what we need
is in order in order to call this add
method what I need is object of a so I
will say a obj equal to new a right now
once we have this object obj then what
we can do is we can say obj dot add
right simple right so using this object
using this object I can call our add
method now let's suppose you have a
client and you have tonight ask you
paulo software small software in which
this is an object in which it should
have one feature but as
pigeon you say okay you have a class
called as a you have played you have a
metal goddess and you will create object
of a and even if you will give it to me
right so it his wish how to use that
object right it's so simple when let
suppose in future it comes to you and he
says I need one more feature in the same
object now the same object who needs one
more feature it's something like buying
our food with one feature and in future
you say I want some more features in
this phone it's not possible right the
same for let's suppose if we talk about
s3 like in Esther you don't have a
gesture feature you have this gestures
feature in Espoo right so you cannot say
I want textures feature in s3 alright
awesome so guys there's three if you
don't know what I'm talking about
talking about phone so I have Galaxy
series right so you have there are some
features in SD and there are lots of
features in Espoo so those features are
coming in the new phone that means in
order to get some new features you need
you need new objects right so what I
need is in in future if we ask you for
one more method or one more huge feature
what we can do is we can have one more
one more method here right you can add a
sub subtract material right so in the
same class you have two methods now but
the problem is let's suppose this class
was created by someone else okay and now
you need to create a new class because
you cannot make changes in this class so
this is not possible for you so now this
is not possible for you okay so this is
the previous class you cannot change it
so what we can do is we can create a new
class called as B okay we can create a
new class plus B in which my customer
needs a object of two methods right two
features first feature should be add
give me a second okay
so my life of my client Li two methods
right first method is add second method
is select so what we can do is we can
and one more feature called as supply
here okay now he's a bleeding object of
a advocated object of be we show fading
object of a everything object of P and
now if I say obj dot add object is of be
right in B we don't have any method
Wallis and the problem is I am assuming
that B has a method for a sub a has a
method for this ad by B don't have a
method for this and what is I need to
fetch I have to fetch everything from A
to B okay so that is possible if B
inherits a now what is in Agence so when
you say you have to inherit it means all
the features from a comes to plus B okay
and that's the concept of inheritance
right so it's something like a parent
and child relationship so if you're if
you have a phone you have phone if your
dad's have a food you have a food right
so your your phone is your phone your
dad's phone is also your phone so we
have a parent-child relationship you
okay so in order to implement in Athens
in Java what you to do is we have to say
Class B and we in to say extends a so it
will take all the features it will take
all the features from A to B right so
your ad goes to you now if I create an
object of B I can access both methods I
can access ad I can access subtract so
this is how you can implement in items
now so there are some types of pages now
go for some now we will go for some
types so we have Class A and Class B
okay so we have two classes Class A
Class B if plus B extends plus a it
becomes single level inheritance so we
have only one level right now let's
suppose if I have plus C so Class B
extends Class A plus
see extends to us D so all the features
from Class A comes to Class B all the
features from Class B comes to Class C
so this concept is called as a
multi-level so you have two levels right
so this is single level this is multi
level
okay so we have two them now we have one
more scenario we'll have one more
scenario so let's suppose you have plus
a and plus B and you have a new class
for the C C extends a and C extends B
okay so one class is extending two
classes right so this is your parent
class this is your choice last
parent-child so we have two parents one
child and this concept is called as
multi well inhale so we have three types
basically we have single we have
multi-level and we have multiple okay so
in this we have some names for this like
so we have the three we have single we
are multi-level and we have multiple
okay and in Java multiple is not
supported again why we will see in
behalf subsequent videos for that okay
now now what next we have some names so
we have plus a we have plus B so if
Class B extends Class A this plus is
called as parent plus this plus is
called as trial class so other names
this class is called as super class this
class is called as surplus okay this
plus is called as base plus and this
plus is called as derived plus okay so
we have multiple names so this is what
what images all about okay and we'll see
some more videos in subsequent tutorials
so if you have any doubts please come in
and do subscribe for these other videos
thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
