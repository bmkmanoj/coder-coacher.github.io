from that is called Logging's
and after this successful completion of
core java we are moving towards one of
the amazing technology which is android
so in this series we'll learn about
Android programming now who does not
know about Android right everyone knows
Android think about this mobile phones
all these phones are based on Android
Android OS while I'm talking about the
good phone cept are talking about
iPhones and Windows phones and so all
these devices they work on Android think
about watch now so we are we are using
both technically which is called as
Android well we have TV we have tablets
all these things works with Android 83%
of mobile market is captured by Android
and as far as saga Google 1.5 billion
devices are running Android it's a very
good number right 1.5 billion and so
what will the advantage of using Android
first so basically if you talk about the
Android is a mobile OS wide and everyone
use phone so if you are making a Android
app as a developer you are making an
Android app so just imagine your life
after doing Android so if you lined up
developer you can build apps and all
this apps your apps will be working on
Android phones because even as a user as
a normal user not as developer but as a
normal user we use apps we never use
words okay I as Android user never use
Android OS I always used apps example I
want to chat with someone I will use
whatsapp I want to I want to take a pic
i will use camera right i want to listen
to a music i will - i want i will be
using a music app so as a user we always
use apps we never use android right but
those apps are big or based on android
OS right so you are that person will be
building those apps now so just imagine
you are building an app and you are
deploying that app on Play Store so
there are approximately 1.5 billion
devices even if one person okay but if
one percent of the mobile users is using
your app which comes out to be 15
million people not a small amount
right so even if you get 15 million
people just imagine
what you will have after that the first
thing you will be famous
of course the second video money it
doesn't matter right the third important
thing is you will get a confidence that
doesn't matter who you are maybe you are
working with a company you are a student
and maybe you are a jobless person what
you can do is you can just learn
technology make your own apps for a
student it will give you confidence or
you got very good even a very big
confidence what about a job this person
you will get a job because there's a
huge market for Android now if you are
an Android developer you will be hired
if you are a skilled Android developer
to be very specific I determined if you
are doing a job in other technology you
can switch back to a switch to a
technology called as Android because all
these companies they want their own apps
now okay so I think you all are set for
the Android series so you make sure
subscribe the channel so that you will
see all the videos on Android and all
the worst</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
