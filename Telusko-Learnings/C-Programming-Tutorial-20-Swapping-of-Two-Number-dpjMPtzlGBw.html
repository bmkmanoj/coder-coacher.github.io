two numbers in C programming now when
you say you want to swap two numbers so
let's take values which is X equal to 5y
X we'll take a and we have B which is
equal to 6 so now we have this two
variables a and B the value of a is 5
the value of B is 6 and if I print the
value of a and B so that let me print
the values so let me say a : % d 2 print
the value and we'll give a comma b :
person d and then we'll comma and then
say a comma b okay so we are swapping a
we're just printing the values without
swapping so if I run this code now the
output is a is equal to 5 and B is equal
to 6 we want a new line so we're getting
a as 5 and B is 6 now we want to swap it
and let's check the value after swapping
so let's say I want to print the same
statement but after swapping now to swap
so we can simply say a equal to B and
then B equal to a right that's how we
swap two values and if I run this code
now you can see initial value is 5 and 6
but after swapping both the values are 6
and 6 this isn't for this when you
assign a value of B to a the value of B
is 6 and now the new value for a is 6 so
we lost 5 there so nobody no no one has
a value which is 5 so we got both the
values as 6 and 6 and the new value for
a is 6 and that's why the value of B is
also 6 and both the values are 6 and 6
so before assigning the value we need to
save that value somewhere so we'll take
one more variable and we'll name this
variable before that let me tell you one
more concept what happens if I create a
variable here I want to create a temp
variable can I create a variable after
print F so if I say equal to 6 let's
imagine we are assigning a value to 6
will it work so let's run this
okay now you can see it says there's no
error here but in actual C programming
this line will give you the error so I'm
using an advanced editor that's white or
advanced compiler that's why it's not
showing the error if you try to do this
in turbo C++ or any legacy software for
C it will give you the error okay and it
should make sure you should always
declare your variable at the start so we
have a variable which is temp and we say
temp equal to a so the so the value of a
is preserved somewhere so we are saying
that value in temp variable and
afterwards we can assign the value of
temp to be simple and now if we run this
you can see the values are swept so now
the a value is 5 B value 6 after
swapping a value 6 and D value is 5
right so this is swapping of two numbers
with the help of third variable so we
are using one more variable here now the
problem is of every variable or a
village - let's do one thing let's let's
stop the video it's here itself we'll
we'll continue with the swapping of two
numbers without using third variable in
the next video and bye why we need to
you why we why we should not use third
variables because we are wasting some
bytes
now how much bytes we are wasting how to
swap without the third variable that we
say in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
