about ASCII so ASCII is the number
representation of a character so let's
say on your keyboard you have lots of
keys right
so every key will be having a unique
ASCII value
so normally ASCII range starts from zero
to the number which is 127 so what we'll
do is we'll try to print all the ASCII
values is it possible to print all the
ASCII values let's see so let's start
with the for loop because we want to
print all the values so we'll say int so
initial value of I will be 0 so I want
to print from 0 to 125 so I will use a
for loop I will say I equal to 0 since
we are mentioning it is 0 here we cannot
we don't we don't required two expansion
there will go to 127
so we'll say equal to 127 and then I
plus plus and what if I print if I say
print F if I say print F and here I will
say % D space comma I so if I print all
the integers and if I run this you can
see we are getting all the integers here
cool but you don't want to print
integers we want to print characters
right so what will do should I print in
a new line how would that look like
okay let's see if I give slash T now
slash T will give you a tab big space so
if I run this you're getting a big tab
space here okay so now what I will do
here let me also print let me print this
instead of person D let me print % C
format so if I put pinches in person C
format and city magic able to see all
the characters this is visible so this
is 0
oh it's not 0 okay so it's not printing
the top some some values and what are
those values will also bring in a
particular number for that so we say
person D and will give one more I so the
first I will print it
but the second I will print the value so
if I say run this so you can see four
zero is not able to print four why it's
not able to print I guess four three it
is heart-shaped so these are your car
symbols so we have hard we have dime and
all those things and we have something
maybe some new line here so the main
thing which is visible it starts from
here so 23 is exclamation then we have
double quotes you can see from 65 we
have capital a 66 is B 6 to 7 is C it
goes on till 90 so 90 is your Z then we
again start with some special characters
then from 100 from 97 we have small a it
goes to 122 which is small Z and then we
have some sums characters and as the end
let's try to pray in till 129 let's see
do we have any special symbol after that
yeah so 128 129 they are giving some
numbers what are these numbers so if you
print what let me print 256 or 255 let's
see what happens here now if I print all
those values it is only printing the
numbers now why we are getting numbers
is because this ASCII value is the base
system of 127 or 128 based system which
simply means the last number of this
base system is 127 if you go beyond 127
the next number is 200 okay so I hope
you know the number this what is a
number system so we have money system we
have decimal system in the same way we
have 128 based system so if you go
beyond 128 you will get 200 or 1.7 you
will get 200 so that's how you print all
the ASCII values so we can print ASCII
values till 127 and this was the output
we got in the video okay so this is your
output so that's it that's how you have
to print ASCII values so thanks thanks
