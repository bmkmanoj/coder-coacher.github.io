all these values which are six seven
values seven values in the list and we
tried to put it on the first first
divisible number first dvz by first
divisible number by 5 so which is 20
here so so what we have done we have
done apply the filter which filters
filter out all the elements which are
not divisible by 5 and then the
remaining elements which are usable by 5
will be mapped to multiply by 2 it will
find the first value now if I do the
same code with the help of a normal for
loop let's try to do it with normal
father will say int I : values and and
this first way to check if if my value
which is if I mod 5 is equal equal to 0
so if it is over 5 then I would first I
have to multiply that number by 2 we'll
say it is I equal to I into 2 and then
break okay because we want to stop it
and then we can just print the value of
I want to print the value I cannot say
value I would say in result equal to 0 I
cannot say I into 2 I can simply say it
is result into two like for on this code
and if I print here result result here
and if I print it now the both both the
code should give the same answer which
is 40 right so both are taking the same
value now if I check the number of
iterations this loop is taking and the
number of iterations this this thing is
taking so let's start with this so the
first value of I is let's say the I is
12 let me remove this code since we have
done with this okay so the first value
of I is 12 history I'll use about 5 no
second y is 20 as it was about gives
equal by 5 yes and there and you will
get the break so only two times this for
loop is incrementing what about this
stream this frame is working with
all the values then we have removing
this we are taking only far for values
20 35 55 and 75 and then for values we
are applying a map and then you are
finding the first if you know 20 is the
only element you want then why we are
applying all the operations with on this
20 550 575
so this stream here is wasting like time
by by you by filtering all the elements
by mapping all the elements and then
finding first so if we talk about the
efficiency this code looks more
efficient right but is it stream is a
new API which was introduced in Java 1.8
so is it less efficient and for loop of
course not it's a new API new features
and it should be more efficient than the
for loop then question arise how it
actually works now if we talk about this
method like filter and map this are
called as lazy methods or lazy functions
they go for lazy evaluation now what is
this evaluation is when you say value
stream this stream will say okay I have
done my work which I have converted all
the values into stream then you say
filter now it's your work filter all the
elements filter will say okay done then
you will ask map map filter or map all
the elements map will say okay done
once you say find first now this find
first here is not a lazy method
it's a eager metal you can say it's a
terminal method it will tell me if you
go to do you find first you can see it's
so this
our terminal operation which means when
you say filter filter all the elements
he will say done map will say done find
wash will say okay if you are done with
your work give me the first value map
will say okay I am NOT computing my
backyard first let me map it and then I
will give you math will ask the value to
filter filter will say okay let me do my
work and I will give you that means once
when I say filter it will not filter it
will just say I have done when I say map
it will not do his task it will simply
say done it's like a it's like you're
lazy people when you asked to do
something they will say okay done but
they have that they have not done it
when you ask why result then at that
time they will do it still something
like your assignments if I give you
assignment for one week and at the end
in between if I call you and ask are we
done with the assignment and the answer
you you will give is of course yes right
I have done with the assignment but if I
ask you to send me a pic of that
assignment it will take you five hours
or ten hours to send me the pic it's not
because you are taking the pic for ten
hours you're writing the assignment at
that time so map is like a lazy lazy you
okay but fine first is me I'm asking you
the result
so find first is a terminal method so
this to here they are lazy then question
is how it exactly work this find first
will ask a map that I just want only
first value then map will say okay why I
will map all the elements I will map
only the first element then will ask a
filter filter will say okay map will say
see I want to give only one element to
find first don't filter all the elements
will find the first element which is
divisible by five it means this filter
will take only one value and map will
take only one value so let me run this
there are same then how to prove my
point
now to prove my point I will use some I
will define some methods here but how
exactly I will write those methods that
we'll see in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
