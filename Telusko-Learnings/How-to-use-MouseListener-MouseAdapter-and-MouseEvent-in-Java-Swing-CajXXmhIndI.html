listener so to demonstrate Mouse
listener let me create a class called as
XYZ and since we can we can create
events on a jet flame so we'll take
we'll say extends it is jframe in this
jframe or in this class let me go with a
public constructor so it's a public XYZ
now let's say I need a Jane flames or
what what we can do is we can simply
write those blocks or quotes or those
quotes
oh it's not swing demo it is swing code
tab so this is what we have created in
our code templates okay so this is these
are the four lines you had to write
every time you work with your J frames
now once you learn once you define our
main function in your so it's it's a
main function in this main function I
will create object of XYZ to exercise by
X Y that ik obj equal to nu X Y Z and
now if I run this code the output will
be no output you will see here is a
frame right now what I want to do now
whether when I click if I click here it
should pick up a position so let's say
if this location is 0 comma 0 and this
is 400 400 so this should be 100 per 100
somewhere here if I click here I should
get an output as on this console called
as 100 comma 100 now how to achieve that
first we need to add a listener to your
mouse because whenever you click here it
should listen to your event now when you
say you want to listen that means we
need to add a listener and now to our
there is no we have to say add way to
add a mouse listener so we say add mouse
listener you can see it ask you for a
mouse listener object so let's go here
and if I say new mouse listener okay and
we can define oh now you can see a
little one thing let me just give the
constructor and a bracket if you go to
this mouse list now you can see it has
lots of methods it has mouse click it
has mouse
it has mouth Willie's mouth entered and
mouse exited now the only method what I
need here is mouse press right but to do
that we cannot use Mouse lessness
because if you use Mouse listen you have
to implement all the methods we need
only one method so instead of using
Mouse listener we'll use something
called as Mouse adapter so again mouse
adapter is a class in its own interface
in Java which lets let's go to Mouse
list okay it's a abstract class in which
it has implemented all the interfaces
and you can see we have mouse click
mouse release so instead of declaring
issue of implementing we'll just
override that method so in my if you use
mouse adapter so we have to work with
only one method the method you want to
wish to work with and the only method I
want to work here is Mouse public void
it is mouse pressed and this mouse
placed method will ask you for object of
it is Mouse
oh yeah it is mouse event and we'll say
it is e simple so same party package now
every time you click this mouse plate
will call and it will a it will execute
this method but as mousepressed and we
need to print the values will say in x
value x value will be the x position of
your pointer so we'll say e dot get x
and we'll say into y equal to e dot get
y so using a using gate X will get the x
value using gate wide will get the Y
value and will just print the value will
say X then in plus will say double
quotes comma plus y now if you print
this the output will be getting is x
value comma Y value we can also use some
space here but the thing I am doing here
is I am taking a J flame in that J
Freeman I am adding a listener using add
Mouse listener it will ask you for
object of Mouse listener you can use an
object of
of adapter and you can override any any
method you want so we are using here
mousepressed now if I if I done this if
I say run so let's click here so if I
click here somewhere it should be
hundred yeah so I'm always near it is
ninety five hundred let's say somebody
here okay I'm almost near yeah and here
so this is hundred comma hundred right
and this position will be phone around
four hundred and this will be zero comma
zero so this is how you to work with
your mouse listener</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
