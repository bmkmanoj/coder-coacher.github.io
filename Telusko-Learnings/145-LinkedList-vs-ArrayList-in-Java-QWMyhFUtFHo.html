ready fantasies for learnings and in
this video we'll talk about linked list
and Adil eased okay so not exactly the
theory of both but we'll talk about the
difference between linked list and
ArrayList right now
first some similarities both are the
implementation of list interface so in
Java if we talk about collection API so
we have lots of interfaces right we have
laced interface we have set interface we
have map interface and if you talk about
linked lists and analysts both are the
implementation of list interface so they
have they belong same family right but
still there are some difference now
let's say we want to work with linked
lists all at least the main agenda here
to use this is you want to add values as
per your requirements example if you use
a DS what happens it add is with with
Alice is you have you have a fixed size
of an added right so let's say if you
have a adding of five elements or six
elements you can only have six to seven
five to six elements right you cannot go
beyond that so we want to create a
dynamic array here and to create a
dynamic array we normally use a de least
right because in add relationship can
add more values as per your requirements
you can expand the size of analyst you
can shrink it you can you know you can
you can do all those stuff with analyst
right the same thing is possible with
linked list we can do the same thing you
can add an immense and you can remove
elements the differences the difference
is their implementation so added list is
implemented with the help of a concept
of dynamic array
and link list is is implemented with the
concept of double linked lists now what
it means so let's talk about dynamic
array so how have you stored values in
dynamic array is you have a D in which
the initial capacity will be 10 okay so
the initial capacity of this array will
be 10 elements so even if you add five
elements you have a capacity of 10
elements if you go beyond 10 elements it
will increase the size by 50% which is
it will increase the capacity of our
till 15 so initially it will be 10 then
after it later it will be 15 capacity
right and then it can go beyond that
also so what it does so let's say you
have elements which is let's say 5 then
you have 7 then you have 8 or then let's
not write in this way let's have an
element in sequence so let's say we have
5 we have 7 we have 8 we have 12 we have
21 we have two we have three so let's
say we have this seven elements here and
what we'll do is we'll try to assign
some index number right of course you're
added is false with index number so this
index number for five is zero so then we
have two three four five and six so this
is your index numbers right so for every
element here we'll be having an index
number so what happens when you add the
element in between so let's say we have
0 we have 1 &amp;amp; 2 so let's say I want to
add an element between this so let's say
before after 12 I want to add an element
here so let's say if I if I add element
which is let's say 16 so I want to add
16 after 12 and betwe or before 21 so
what we should write so we have to
specify that this 16 will go to an index
number 4 right so 16 will take the index
number 4 and the other other values will
take the next index numbers what it
means so 16 will be here so this 21 will
go down this 2 will go down while so
this becomes 16 this becomes 21 this
becomes 2 and then we'll be having 3
with
the index number seven right so if you
add any value in between it will update
the next element so it we have to change
the index number of every element right
so it is time-consuming right you are at
you're adding elements later so it will
of course it will take some time so it
is time-consuming right so that is a
problem with added list
there is one more problem if you remove
an element so let's say if you remove
this element eight now so as soon as you
remove eight all this elements will they
will go up what it means
so eight is now three or eight is now
two as soon as you remove eight twelve
becomes three or twelve it becomes two
then we have so all this next hour will
shift off right it will takes again it
will take some time so when you talk
about data structure we use this a Big O
notation right so we specify one it may
specify and so if you add element if you
if you want to add and remove elements
so it will affect your time right so Big
O notation represents your time
compositive I so added list when you add
elements in between it will take it is
time consuming right what about linked
list since linked list follows the
concept of double linked list in which
every element you add so let us say if
you add element which is five so this is
the starting elementary of so I this
will start with five as soon as you add
that night is here so we have five as
soon as you add the element so what it
will do it will make a note of it so
this is your node in this node you will
be having two things one will be the
next node and one to the previous node
so this is P previous node and next node
right then if you add seven in between
so if you add seven here so if this is
seven it will have two things it will
have P and n right so this 5 will
mention that the next node is this 7 is
the next node right if you have seven
the next element is let's say 8 so this
is 8 here and then again will be having
two things will be having so this is 8
will be having next node and previous
node right so first seven the previous
node is 5 right and 4 7 the next node is
that's oh that's n so next note is 8
right and previous node is 7 now as soon
as you add element let me write one more
let me just for the demonstration let's
take 12 year so we have two P and n we
have 12 and this next node for 8 the
next node is 12 and the 4 for to all the
previous node is 8 right now as soon as
you add an element right so if you add
an element in between let's say after 7
&amp;amp; 8 I'm adding a new element which is
let's say 32 so I want to add this
element between so let me just write it
22 here it will be having two things P
and n right so as soon as you add this
new element you just have to change
something what that something is instead
of this next element which refers to 8
from 7 you have to refer to 32 now and
so on 32 you have to refer the next
element to the 8 the previous element
for 32 is this one and the previous
element for 8 will be 32 right so just
we are we are just changing two objects
here are two nodes this will not affect
the number of nodes you have after that
and it will not affect the number of
nodes before that okay so it is very
good when you want to add elements in
between because linked list follows the
concept of double linked list and as it
is follows the concept of dynamic array
okay so in this situation who wins of
course linked list right because when
you add elements in between linked list
is much faster than add a list right so
this is fast if you want to assign the
value in between this is slow when you
want to assign the value in between okay
now next next cat criteria now let's say
you want to fetch some values I don't
want to add values now you want to fetch
values whenever you want to fetch value
you have to use index numbers right so
in a de least you can specify the index
number so it is very easy to search but
in length less it is difficult to search
right so in case of searching this
becomes slow and this becomes fast okay
so it's all depend upon your
requirements so if you want to add
element so again the question will be
which is better which one to use so it's
only requirement so let's say if you
want to add elements in between of
course you will be going for linked list
if you want to just fetch the values
depend up on the index number you can
use a list and majorly we always use
additives we don't use linked this much
in the project but if your requirement
is you want to add elements in between
our time is very important at that time
always go for linked lists okay again we
have the practical for this again you
can search for linked lists practical in
my channel so you will get that video
okay so that's it from this video that's
the basic understanding of how linked
lists and lists ArrayList works and
their comparison so thanks for watching
and yeah so question for this session so
the question will be which company yeah
so Java belongs to which company now so
name the company of Java belongs to okay
so that's it from this video thanks for
watching and do subscribe for further
