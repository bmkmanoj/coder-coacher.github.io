with this while loop what if my value of
I is Levin that means the starting value
is Levin it will go down here let me
just run this and you can see we don't
have any output is because the value of
I here is Levin which means let me just
run this low okay so it's the value of
ice eleven and then it will go here now
in violet we check if my the value of I
is Levin is levels less than ten and the
answer is no so wild up gets a answer
which is false since it is false it will
try to jump out at and that's why it's
not printing any value now what if I
want to bring this value once doesn't
matter or if the condition satisfies or
not what we can do is we can simply say
it says do and then we can check it
afterwards so we'll say I less than
equal to ten now I can see the value of
I is 11 that means the condition is
false but still if I run this code if I
if I underscored the output is hello one
time right it's because let's let's
let's load on this if i press f7 f7 now
it will jump on to and from do it will
print it doesn't matter if it satisfy
the conditions or not it will jump on I
plus purse and then it will go for the
while loop and obviously in value
between the condition is false and then
you come out and that's the advantage of
using do-while loop and the next type of
loop is the for loop now to understand
for loop let's go back to our code the
initial code let's say it was while loop
it was a while loop here and one thing
if you observe in do-while loop we apply
a semicolon after a while but in case of
while loop we don't apply a semicolon
now let's again come back to 1 and the
output will be getting here
is obviously it's ten hellos right
because I have changed the value to one
now if you can see here we are going for
three statements one initialize the
value or what if what if I remove this
and if I say I equal to one it will give
the same output right so the steps are
it will initialize the value it will
check for the condition and increment
right so instead of writing this these
statements in three disappearance
separate lines what we can do is we can
write those statements in one line and
for that we have to use something called
as for loop now for loop allows you to
write all this this statement one in one
line so we can say I equal to one a
statement then I less than equal to ten
a statement and then I plus plus so I
can write all these statements in one
line and it you have to make sure that
after every statement that stays the
semicolon here and now if I run this
you'll be getting the same output right
so ten hellos so these are we can use
our for loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
