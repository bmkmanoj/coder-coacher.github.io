talk about the second part of inner
class which is nested in a glass now how
to use nature in a class it's very
simple if you make your class as static
which means now this class becomes a
static class inside a class that means
in order to use this entity which is B
we have to use a class name so instead
of using a here a means an instance of a
a class what we'll do is instead of a we
can simply say it is B but the problem
is we don't want a in the case of
instance we want to refer this a when
you create object of B so that means we
have to you use a on B side because this
is a static static class now so anyone
use a static class it is normally called
as mr. class obviously no one use it or
it is not used in general purpose
applications but still Java provides
your features of static class so in fact
in my project I have never worked with
static class so but it has some some
features so there might be some
programmers who are interested in this
static type of classes so this type of
concept is called a static class okay so
one of the inner class type is member
class the second one is nested class
let's move towards this anonymous class
now what exactly known as class is let's
just run the code just to see what
happens when you go to this project file
again or this folder you can see again
the name is same it's a bounded with B
that means this this class has a name
called as B which is bounded with a
that's why $1 be okay but let's say I
have a class let me just change the code
a bit let me remove the static and show
off in a class then you move this class
outside so I have a class here
the class I have deleted it's cut and
paste so now we have this class outside
let me just format the code okay so now
we have a Class A and Class B for time
in let's remove this class a because I
don't require it so let's let me just
able to decrease the number of lines
okay now since I don't have a Class A
here let me just remove this class a sec
okay now we are just focusing on Class B
which is inside a class called as inner
demo now this is how you create object
right and now if I call this show it
will go to the implementation which is
it will print a message which is hello
but what if I want to call show but
instead of printing this hello message I
want to print hi message now the only
way you can do it you can just either
you have to go to this B class you have
to change this code from hello - hi
but let's say I don't want to change the
code in this class because this is pre
build class I want other users to have
the same output but when I create
instance of B I want a different output
so one of the way you can do is you can
create a new class called C in this C
class you can just extends with B and
you can define the same method here
which is public void show in writer you
can say probably white show is your
painting hello will print hi and we'll
create our object of C and obviously now
if I don this code it will print hi now
this is the concept of polymorphism
right but I don't want to do this just
to just a sake off to print hi how I'm
creating a new class policy exchanging
would be why to do all those things now
if you focus on this line here this is
creating an instance of V classified so
when you when you create instance of V
class it will jump to the class for the
implementation it will check for a
method called a show it will print hello
but what if if I say when you create
instance don't look for a class called
as B the implementation for this
instance is next its
directly next line that means instead of
jumping to this this implementation here
it will jump to this implementation okay
and this block will a clerk class now
which means I can define this method
there so I can just say copy and paste
format the code so this is you can
directly define the implementation next
to your object or next to your instance
and here let me just call hi so now we
have an object of B but instead of
calling B object or instead of instead
of calling this show I am defining the
implementation of B instance here only
and that's the advantage of using
something called as anonymous class
because why it is anonymous let's run
this code again the output you're
expecting is high and the output you got
is high but that's how I look at this
class here let me just reverse the code
now if you can see this line here which
is a dollar base the old one let me just
delete it fine let me do it all
everything so that you will see what
other new files which are created so
then OH
although you just compile the code it's
okay it's run Oh what am I saying I
should not really do it all this well
let me delete this two files because I
need I need I may define main file to in
this code okay just run or what's
happening with the code okay let me just
oh yeah I should have recompile this so
let me just clean and build the code at
me and it's going up okay
go to that folder you can see we have
lots of classes and we have all the
classes okay
it's rebuild okay done
and at MIT on this file with this
project on now we can see we have a
Class A B here we have a class in a demo
and we have getting that a and B class
so if you can see here we have in your
class this one this is in a class this
is and this is the file which I'm
talking about when you talk about inner
class it creates a file you can see here
I am creating a B class all anonymous B
Class inside a class called as in a demo
so instead of waiting a new file it is
creating a dollar one which means we
don't have a class name right so that's
why we are using this numbering and
that's why this type of classes are
called as anonymous classes simple right
so this is called as anonymous class
here now now the next type is your
lambda so that we'll see in the next
part
thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
