on political happenings and in this
video we'll talk about why string is
immutable and how exactly we can benefit
from that now they talk about mutability
there is one person who has by a lot and
he says mutability is a crime and I we
all are criminals right we always change
a change those data right so when you
say mutation it means change right so
let's say if you have an object and you
want to change the values then you are
doing mutation so we need to make sure
that we are doing something which will
not mutate it so there are certain
things if you want to increase the
performance of your system
make it immutable right so make an
object as immutable so logically it will
increase the performance so string of
the strings are immutable because we
want to increase the performance right
now let us see how to how to do that so
what happens is normally be like this
straight way which is string STR equals
to let's say if I write my name which is
Naveen okay make sure it is I okay
people normally search me with nav ee en
it's not that is na VI n okay so if any
VI ends ready don't use W then now let's
say we have this name which is a string
STR equal to Naveen now unless we have
what so this is a string right so what
happens is inside your heap memory we
have something called as this small let
me let me take a big area so inside your
heap memory will be having something
called as what it is called as string
pool so instead of heat memory will be
having something a string pool so now if
I say string STR equal to Naveen okay so
this will go inside this and there will
be a variable there will be a value
called as Naveen okay and now this
mapping will have a unique address like
name it as 1 to the 1 now what will
happen if I create a new variable as
string str1 equal to the bean okay
same the same object now okay so we have
the same value but we have gr one so
what will happen and this it will always
create new object now inside your string
pool since we already have Naveen it
will not create new object both of this
which I put to the same object right so
there will be a stack movie right
normally if you want what happens is
whenever you take an object you use two
memories one you use a stack memory
right and then you use the heap memory
so objects are normally put it in
sidekick memory and the reference which
is STR and str one is a variables right
which will be inside your stack memory
and somewhere here you mentioned that
this is STR right and you will mention
one zero one and since HDL is 1 is also
1 0 1 so now we have two variables which
are pointing to the same object
now what if I take STR ok this is with
the first variable and if I say STR
equal to ready if I change this now what
will happen will it change the existing
name of course not right because if STR
is changing to ready if I change this
one till ID 1 0 1 that means it will it
will also affect STR one right so that's
touched not a decade right that's why
this will create a new object here and
the value of that will be ready and
later this is 1 0 3 now 1 0 1 will be
replaced by 1 0 3 that means you are
changing this value of the reference but
you are not changing the actual value
and that is what makes strings as
immutable you cannot change the value
okay so once you have defined the string
you cannot change it so this is the
object which are not changing you are
just creating your object so every time
you change the value of STR you are
actually changing the address but you
are not you're actually creating the
object but you're not changing the
existing value ok
and that's why strings are immutable but
then question arise we have one more way
of feeding string right we can say
string s1 equal to new string and in
fact you can pass Naveen
anyone you can do this right venule
thing when you use new keyword that
means it will not use ship memory code
it will not use string porn otherwise it
will create a new object here and that's
the address is 2 0 1 okay so it because
you are saying new so new will not take
the the memory from string pools it will
use the memory of sheep here we are not
using any new keyword that's why we are
using string pool right so this since we
are using new it will use the object
here which is the inside people you will
be having an object and that object will
have Naveen
but although that's not the case every
time you say Naveed it will actually use
the memory of string pool ok - that is
if it dependents easier so this moment
will be also coming from this Naveen
here so of course you are using you are
using a string pull memory indirectly
okay so this Naveen will be coming from
string pool
so this STR here will have a memory
address which is 1 0 1 so that's the
does the problem with all the stuff so
even if you are saying I mean that will
use a string pulse memory but then
question arise how to make it mutable
and so can we make string new table yes
we have two ways of doing it the one way
is using string buffer and the another
way is using string builder of course we
are we have the practical implementation
of those in the industries so this is
the PD of wire string is immutable ok it
so first it it increases the performance
of the system
second every time you create a variable
because to to reference can share the
same object right this is actually
called as flyweight pattern so in design
patterns we have a concept of flyweight
which means if possible we can actually
reuse the objects I mean to reference
are using the same object so that's
about why string is immutable if you
have any more questions you can come
into the comment section or just ask
just upon our announcement we are the
website is up and up and running you can
actually give tests on websites on my
websites now which is the disco calm you
can also download the Android app which
is there on the Play Store now you can
search for
go to play store and search for
periscope app and downloaded try to I
mean use it there might be some bug
reports news view if you find any bugs
where you can resolve it and that's the
type of watching and do subscribe for
