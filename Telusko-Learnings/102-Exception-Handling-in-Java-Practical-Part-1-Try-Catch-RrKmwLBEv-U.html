implementation of exception handling now
to demonstrate this let's let's create
an exam let's get a class and we'll name
this as a demo exception we could have
we should have been using remove this
it's wrong hata
it's nothing to ID yep so let me remove
this part okay now what I want I want to
put this in package so we'll say package
let's say X for exception again by
default to my class belongs to default
package I want to move that file to this
package so we'll say move class to
correct folder I can see we have a
package here which is X and in this we
have demo exception let me minimize this
okay let's go for full score now now
what I need let's say I have a main
function here and as you know exception
sort of three types right oh is it C no
the main class nope if we talk about
exception let me use notepad here now so
there's a class called as throwable
class now through our class is used to
handle order all your exceptions right
all your errors and exception this
throwable class is extended by two main
classes for his exception and others now
what are exceptions exceptions are
something you can handle errors are
something that you cannot handle like
example your memory goes let's say your
memory is leaking of your JVM or your
CPU is not working all those practical
physical errors comes under this error
but what about exceptions exceptions are
something you can handle
now if we talk about exceptions we have
two basic types one is checked exception
and we have unchecked exceptions now
what exactly check means it's something
like your NetBeans will that means we'll
say hold on you have a error here and
uncheck tears
even that means don't know what is this
exception is all about okay now when I
talk about checked we have two types
again or two basic exception comes under
this in fact there are lots of exception
but these are two famous one is IO
exception second is SQL exception this
this comes under checked exception
I mean unchecked so all your runtime
exceptions runtime exceptions comes
under unchecked so what you have you
have throwable in that this variable is
extended by exception and error this
exception class is again we have two
types we have checked and unchecked in
checked we have this two in unchecked we
have this runtime exception and then in
runtime you have lots of lots of lots of
classes like adding the sort of bound
exception then file not found exception
then we have we have lots of lots of
exceptions we will see those exception
in this example which I took our maximum
of it okay so now let me start with the
code so let's say I have a variable int
I comma J comma K so have three
variables here and the value for my I is
5 we go for some let's say is 8 and J is
2 and let me just print the value of K
and what is KK equal to I divided by J
and I can simply print the value of K
right now you can see there is not there
is no error specified by your JVM or
NetBeans ok if I run this code obviously
the output will be getting is 4 right
simple but what if by mistake if what I
did 0 now you will say 8 divided by 0 is
infinity but in programming language
then nothing called as infinity so
anything divided by 0 in programming
will throw an exception and you can see
if I run this file you are getting an
exception and exception is arithmetic
exception right now whatever you do all
these statements here they are normal
statements and this part here this is
critical statement
so all your critical statement should
belongs to try block that means here
you're not sure this is it it will give
me an either or not so we have to say
let put it in try I don't know if it
will give me the error or not so you
have to write a try block and then if
this statement throws an either you have
to catch the error so depend upon the
error type you have to catch it now
exception is the main class so we can
handle all the exception using exception
class all the all the exceptions using
exception class and will print the
exception here simple and instead of
printing II let let let's print first E
and if I run this code again you can
still see we are getting and either here
but we are also printing this part I was
the error ok might not be high
initialize whenever you or whenever you
put your assignment in a block make sure
your declaration will assign a value
it's because there are chances that this
statement might not be executed and you
are writing your K here right so let me
just let me run this now if you can see
that it is an error or exception the
proper format not in either color and
the output will be 0 is because after
the error also since it has throw the
thrown the error we have handled it and
then we are printing the value so your
execution will flow which will not stop
abruptly but what if you want to print a
normal good like something in this way
cannot divide by 0 I feel on this code
instead of printing those a weird
message we can print simply say cannot
divide by 0 and this will be
understandable by for any user let it be
a user is from a management diagram or
is for management team still he can
understand what exactly that error means
right and that's why you should always
handle the error using try and catch and
this exception here is unchecked
exception I
it again what exactly checked exception
means that we'll see in the next part of
the tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
