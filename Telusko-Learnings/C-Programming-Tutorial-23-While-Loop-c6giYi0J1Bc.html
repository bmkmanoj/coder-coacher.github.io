execute some tasks multiple times so
let's say you have a particular task and
you want to execute the same task for
multiple time we can use something
called as loops so let's say I want to
print here a statement which is high so
I want to print this statement high for
the file I want to print higher for five
times right so to bring the two print
high five times we have to use printf
five times as we have to say again
printf and here I'm going to define in
the Bokashi we find high again we have
to write hot printf high printf high and
twenty five four five times and then
when you run this code you'll be getting
high for the four five times right so if
you can run this you can see we have
high and high but if you'll do the same
taste repeat same things repeatedly we
can actually use a block which you want
to execute multiple times and this block
will be called as loop so loop can be of
three types it can be while look it can
be do while loop or it can be a for loop
so how to use while loop so you have to
mention while and inside while you have
to make a clear you have to mention a
condition so if you mention condition as
one which means it will execute this
loop for infinite time because it will
first check the condition you are saying
it is one one Schmitt's true it will
execute this statement it will go back
to the while condition it will check
okay it is still true it will execute hi
again it will go back with for the
condition it is true it will print hi so
it will print hi for infinite time now
way to mention I don't I just want to
print it for five times so what we can
do is to count you want to count it for
only five times right so we'll require a
counter so we'll use I as a counter or
give you starts with one so I will act
like a counter here the initial value
for I is 1 so when till when we want to
print we want to print it for when your
I is less than 5 if your I exceeds the
value of 5 it will be it will stop
printing so now it what will have us
it will first assign the value which is
one it will check for the condition if
your check condition is right it will
print hi but unfortunately if you run
this loop it will again go for an
infinite loop it's because the value of
I is still 1 right even if you execute
this printf multiple thousands of time
you're not changing the value of I so
what we do is we need to increment the
value of I after every high so once you
print high you need to increment the
value of I again when you print high it
we have to increment a value of 5 so how
it will work the initial value of I is 1
it will check ok 1 is less than 5 yes
true it will print high it will
increment the value of I and we'll make
it 2 then it will again check 2 is less
than 5 yes it will go on high three
three thousand five yes it will print
high it will go for four it will check
over four thousand five yes high plus
plus now 5 5 is less than no it's equal
to 5 yes it will print high it will make
it 6 go back
6 is less than get it less then equal to
5 and the answer is false which is 0 so
it will come back come out of the loop
and it will cut it will return 0 and
then your function will be ended right
so if I run this I just want to print on
a new line so will you slash in here and
if you print this you can see we have
high 4 5 times so point to remember when
you want to use a while loop fish which
use a counter so we need to start with
the initial value which is the
initialization part so this is called as
any session this is the condition and
this will be your increment or we can
also use thick ribbon okay so this is
initialization this is condition and
this is increment and decrement so
that's how you use a while loop so in
the next video we will talk about
do-while loop so stay tuned and do
