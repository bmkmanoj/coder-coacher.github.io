basically we will be doing this project
using a concept less agile now I don't
know how many have you know agile so
basically what happens is normally in
software industry we use SDLC right we
use SDLC so whenever you make a software
you have to follow SDLC which is
software development lifecycle we can
use agile here the ball of it the
problem with the waterfall model is if
let's say if you complete your course
speed and if you go to the second stage
what will happen is if there is some
problem with the second phase or the
maybe if you are going to use fourth
phase and if something goes wrong with
the third phase you cannot go back and
the client requirement is never fixed
client might change the requirement so
what you have to do is you have to make
sure that whenever a client changes the
requirement you have to add up those
requirements so whenever you use agile
model it will be easier for you to to
adapt that changes and hit that's how it
will go
okay so we'll be using agile here so
what we do is every week we'll try to
complete at least one module so this
week will be focusing only on the
feedback module so what I get is from
the entire project so basically we are
building my websites of vr3 designing
that is called a telesco website so we
have two advantages with this the first
advantage would be we'll be having a Z
designed website is quad-core
and the second advantage would be you
will learn how to make a simple project
okay I'm not saying this is a very
complex project this will be a simple
project but there are lots of people
they don't even know how to build a
project and while doing this will learn
different technique Knology how to use
github how to how to deploy application
on Google App Engine and all those
things okay so the using agile video our
next the database technology we are
going to use here is mask you'll and the
language the programming language of the
using Java because I am buddy with Java
so I was using Java here and there is
one more thing which you will need here
we need a framework for Java and the
framework we'll be using here is spring
MVC oh that's that's great so let's
let's try to implement this so we'll try
to go with the coding of coding step so
normally what happens is we have to go
insert instead
example first of all you have to create
a database then you have to create a
design and then you can make the backend
pattern back in part right but what we
will be doing is we'll be first creating
a database and not the entire database
the only table which we need now and
then later will be going for so after
that will be going for the coding part
will be building application using
string and missing and then okay so
we'll be deploying that on Google App
Engine so today we'll it will be one our
session so 15 minutes already done so we
still have 45 minutes let's see how how
much we can do today so that the
remaining thing will doing it tomorrow
okay so we got some questions there do
we need Java Script here yes the
knowledge of Java Script will be
important because my focus here would be
to make it back in part lies with you
the designing would be so I will need
designing help from your side so you
people will be submitting the design I
want some new design so if you can help
me with the new design new format I will
show you the columns we need today or
also show you the database part and how
to do the java parts but I would need
your help
and the in the imitation of the design
implementation or new design so yeah so
the database with the using master here
we can also use for scripts but then the
place we are actually deploying this
website is Google App engines where it
provides you master database so it will
be easier to understand mask feel now
and you can also implement that in post
with that's fine okay so it is go to so
the soft side will be needing here is
called as first of all let's design
database so what do I do here is I will
open my so now to create a database i
will be using master workbench and in
this system I don't have my ants cure so
I have a master database on another
server so I have already or one more
laptop with me with the address so that
means chronic with a database so the
address the IP address for that machine
is one eighty two dot one sixty eight
dot one dot two this is next just next
to my machine and the username is root
and the password is also root click on
OK
so okay so this is mass cure database
here
so we can create any mass we can use any
DBMS but I am using mask you'll hear
what I do is I will create a new table
here first of all as you get a new
database I will say okay how do we get a
new database video so I can use a query
string I will say create a knife it is
visible so we say create database
physical so that's my database I will
click on run so out of the database I
will say use the disco I just hope you
know SQL before hand I will say one so I
got telescope and now I will say create
let me get a table so putting up my task
would be to create a feedback form when
I say feedback form I'm talking at
you're talking about this feedback form
so let me just open so just go here and
if I click on this feedback this is the
page we actually going to create so
we'll be creating a design a page where
it will ask for the name we'll ask for
the email address we'll ask for the
initiative name or will not will not go
for Institute name we don't need that
now since we are doing some changes with
our database okay and we need ok what
else we need here we need a message so
into the message and then we don't need
all this things we are regarding good so
we will only go for one star the overall
rating will not go for specific one will
not go for knowledge into innovations
will only go for the overall one and
since I'm not good with design I will
not be building this star pattern so
also using simple numbers there ok and
then we can click on someone to click on
Thermage which is work it should show
the a tiny database that's what we'll be
doing ok so what do I do now is let me
just okay so we build in the same system
what kind first of all the object will
be today's database right so what I'm
going to do here is basically table here
I will say create tables
feedback and this feedback table need
certain columns so the first column is
name and name would be of types webcast
I
say maximum length would be 30 provided
you're not stopping in here then we'll
go for regarding what so normally what I
want here is when I go for should be I
want feedback for different things I
want feedback for my youtube channel I
want feedback for for my online training
so I do online matches as well right so
I want feedback for that as well okay so
since I go for corporate training so I
do ask them to send me a feedback so I
want I want figure I want feedback for
different things so I need feedback for
YouTube channel I need feedback for
online training I need feedback for four
batches corporate ventures so it's a
returning with a Val can and will fit 10
because we so will okay let's not use a
vodka let's use change now why ain't is
because we'll give different values so
one would be conveyed to any also one
would be YouTube second two would be
online training and three would be
corporate
okay so we got regarding and then we
need a code so we need we also need a
code now what is code here so let's say
so that's the last week I went to a
company and if I want a free bag for
those from those people how would I know
if those people have so much added
feedback so what I'm going to do in the
batch is I mean if I go for the training
if I go for the corporate training I
will ask them okay this is your code and
you have to spend a feedback with that
setup code so that will be a foot again
will have a clear picture of code once
we start with the coding part will go
for all its ten and and then last you'll
be rating rating would be from one to
five how good I am in the training so
this would be 8 so this is my database
here okay and let's let's try to execute
this query okay so you can see I got my
table now how do I verify what this
table so let me say describe of feedback
and if I love this query right so I got
all this columns here okay
so we got our table here and now let's
insert the data okay just to have the
default values so if they insert into
feedback of values and let's say I would
say this is okay the first datum would
be the name I would say feedback is
given by the means I will I will keep
feedback to myself I will send the beam
and I will use an email ID which is envy
and rdy okay I don't have it is not my
melody okay this is I'm using a fake ID
here and then we'll be using a it should
reduce the font size of it so next thing
we have to mention the message I will
say message is good I mean you can have
a little message there regarding so I
will take a number of years regarding
one which is YouTube videos and then the
code now if we don't have a code for
YouTube videos right because the code is
only for the corporation what do we do
is I will fix it free for the corporate
and I will use a code so let's say the
company is like the Microsoft so they
will use a phone call it micro
1:01 so let's say the batch number is
one - the one they will use micro 1:01 I
will give this feedback I will give this
feedback - I will give this code to the
batch or do before giving the feedback
and then I'll be rating so let's say
rating is 4 so this is the data I want
to insert I want if I buy this query you
can see it says inserted let me just
verify because input it or not with this
select star from feedback and if run
this query you can see regard our data
so we go to our first show here ok
so we have we are building a database
here see we because the database right
now let's say if you want to provide a
feedback of course you need a page to
give the feedback right and if you want
to create a page and when you send a
feedback that feedback will going will
be going in database but then we cannot
connect HTML to database right so we
need a language and that would be a Java
language will be using Java to connect
your database and your UI so data so
let's say if you send a feedback that
feedback will be coming in the UI and
that data will go to the java part and
then Java will insert that into database
why
and do this what were you doing what
we'll be doing is we'll be using some
software now when we use Java we have
different software's to work with I mean
different idea is to work with we can
use we can use IntelliJ we can use
NetBeans we can use Eclipse and since
for Java I will be using a spring
framework here they are different
frameworks available for Java we have
stores we have spring we have okay we do
have different frameworks but then one
of the best framework now is is a spring
so the using spring MVC here okay so
either so for spring MVC again we can
use Eclipse here but then to go with
spring MVC I will be using a special
software called as STL now F still
stands for spring tool suite if I open
that you can see this is it stands for
spring - straight and it is basically
used for spring projects so it is
getting open let's wait for some time
okay this is our this is our software
now I don't know if you have experience
in excess before but anyways anyway you
create eclipse project or you might be
wondering we are using STS then I'm
talking about Eclipse they are same
actually so when you use eclipse you are
actually using I mean when you're using
STS are actually using Eclipse okay so
let me let me just change this to so I
will use my own workspace so let's
create a work pit clothesline so again
what is the workspace so you can create
all your project in one box space right
so I will click on this and you can see
my STS is getting open so I got nicety
of here so what we're doing is first of
all let's try to understand how to
create a project so our main focus today
is not to type the actual code let's try
to understand how to get a project first
right that's it is that is important so
first of all let's create a project here
and then we'll see how to go ahead so
let's try to implement a project now if
you don't know about spraying guys you
can just go to youtube and first of all
search for the videos of search for
spring videos so just go to or just go
to youtube and search for that
called spring and you can see videos
there okay so why we are using thing
because it is so whenever you build a
project using some cream well it will be
easier for you to maintain it and if you
with you I mean it is easy to is it
easier to make the project is here to
maintain and it creates some layers if
you make some changes in one of the
layer it will not affect other deals
it's not compensated to you spring here
but then using sting will give you
better because I will say it new and so
will create a mobile project now people
who don't know about now and you also
have to learn level first okay so
whatever I do is so what so see after
extension what you can do is just watch
the video once again and be with the
flow because from the next session you
have to build your own project I mean
let's say in two sessions if you
complete feedback form in fact in this
week will complete feedback form so from
the next week you have to submit the
code to me right so you have to submit
your code so you will understand that
once you see this session so I will
click on the new but new here and then I
will go for an event project now when
you create a mement project it will be
easier for you to build a project right
because mavin gives you all the required
dependencies normally when you create a
project we also need some dependencies
so for this you should have a knowledge
about Navin as well so it is a slight in
some way what are things you have to
learn first so first of all you have to
be very good with Co Java
okay and then you have to learn about
servlet and JSP update I mean basics of
this of it and JSP then you should know
about spring MVC because we will be
building the project using spring MVC
and see my main focus here is not to
teach you all the technology my main
focus is if you know all this technology
how to build a project right then you
should know about Navin how to build a
project using Navin and the awesome
thing is I do have videos on this on
YouTube so do learn this because it will
be helpful and the the type of sessions
which you are doing now will be doing
this type of sessions are lots don't
worry if you are not good at this things
today make sure you study all the same
in one week I mean you can do this way
when you have when you have something I
mean if you have something in your mind
if you want to achieve something it is
easier to get it even in one week it is
possible okay so when you create a maven
project I want to create a web project
here so I will say event of type dev sub
app so when you want to create a web
project so it's going to create a web
project just click on this
mavin outside web app if you want to
create a cool project you can create a
maven archetype click start but since we
are building of a web app so we'll go
fall over back here which is M have an
outer web app the advantage is it will
give you it will give you the project it
will give you of web project so we'll go
for that now it is the also a strip of
the blooper you know basically the blue
piping so whenever you create a project
every project belongs to some companies
right so let's say as at a disco so I am
working for the disco now so in the
disco we have multiple projects so all
this project will belongs to one group
and that is called a telescope so the
group ID should be unit and the best way
to make your group ID unit is by
reversing your domain name if your
domain name is the discourage comm just
reverse it to make it converse a disco
and you're good to go
then you have to mention the artifact
idea which is artifact ID basically is
your project name I will say the project
name is task in fact I always believe I
mean I'm doing this purchase of a long
time so I also for this project as tux
project and then we mentioned this
version so I will say version is one
point zero and then the package name so
packaging would be the group ID that's
your artifact adding ok and then click
on finish and you can see we got our
project so we got our project here where
is the project is coming so you can see
it's downloading everything from the
internet so we've got our project can
you see that we got task project but
then how to connect this to tower
because the very very clear whenever you
create a web project you have to make
sure that you've connected to your web
server with our with a majority of web
apps with our web server now we don't
have web server here can you see that we
don't have any web server
so we have a server tab below and it
says no servers are available so first
of all you have to add a server so what
I do is I will click on this no server
available and then of a click on Apache
I will create a server I will use tomcat
8.0 we don't need any bulky so over here
and then click on next it will ask for
the Tomcat installation so I don't so
first of all you have to make sure that
you do have talk and installation your
system so download Tomcat you can go
through you can say Tomcat downloads ok
so it will take you to the official
website of Tomcat which is ok so depend
upon which machine you're working with
if you are using Windows machine you can
pick up one of this if start of a 64-bit
if you are using a Linux based machine
you can select our dot said now I'm
using Mac here so I will be using
towards there you have to click on this
and you have to unzip or you can keep it
anywhere you want okay so a planet is
saying that we should be using JBoss we
should be using JBoss if you are using
some enterprise sank a tomcat will do
for my server
I mean type of project we are making
tomcat is enough for that in case if you
want to build a server when you want to
provide some EJB applications enterprise
there will services then we need JBoss
other than that we don't need your boss
here but then we can also use tables oh
yeah you're right upside down cake is
not a full Java EE server basically
Tomcat is a web server and it doesn't
support EJB but we are not using EJB now
projects right so that's why I will be
going for Tomcat ok I'm getting lots of
suggestions in the chat window that's
great ok so whatever you do is I already
have a tomcat in my system which is
downloaded and unzipped so I will go for
browse and you can see I already have
Tampere in downloads folder so in my
downloads
I have Apache Tomcat which is already
unzipped
so we click on that click on open and
click on finish so you can see we got
our Apache Tomcat EO our guys like this
can you say start ok and you can see
target says Tomcat started now you have
to link your project with the store
get now how do we do that so right-click
on the project and say raise the
property so we'll say properties and we
select on target runtime we sent on this
which is Apache Tomcat 8.0 click on OK
and you can see we got our project
connected with the Tomcat server like
the recorder our project here it is
connected to Tomcat server there is no
edit now so error is gone so now what
what what's next so if you open this
maven dependencies now the advantage of
my own dependencies if you need any jar
file mavin will give you all the jar
files so like mavin is like or Santa
Claus
you just wish wish for it and now when
he will give you those job boys right so
just close your eyes and say hey I want
things libraries mavin will say ok I
mean yeah but getting sensations here
for my team ok so ok so if I open this
pond XML file you can you can whatever
jar files you need you can just mention
that I will give you the jar files
otherwise because not using maven you
have to download all the Java files for
yourself and that trust make is very
it's a pain you know where so ok so if I
go to this for minimal file and you can
you just have to add a dependencies here
and I'm sure your this point is not
visible to you so if you change the font
size and just good to hear I search for
text and fonts I want to change the
basic settings for the text font edit
and let me just make it from 11 to 14
with the coder I guess ok so what is for
minimal file Poliquin file is basically
a file with it which stands for our
project object model so p om stands for
project object models of anyone you need
any dependency you just have to add the
dependency in this file ok so what next
everything seems good now we have to add
a spring dependencies like so to
download this spring dependency first of
all let me just go to the official
website of
to show you what is spring exactly is so
if I go here you can see this is a
spring official website which is spring
dot IO and it is managed by PI Wooten
and if I click on project here so you
can see the Spring Framework and if I
click on this basically is using Spring
Framework here and okay so we got ok
this is the latest version of spring
which we can use all other versions of
snapshot version will be going for the
current version which is four point
three point seven and this is the okay
this is a dependency we want this is the
office of a sort of spring but we want
spring MVC dependency right so normally
you can get a dependency from the
official website of seven which is
managed repository and if you can search
for a spring here so it's a spring MVC
but what a time it gets that will be
comment is it App Engine require
subscription yes you have
so App Engine is not free for it is it
is free for one year and after that you
have to pay for the services and even it
is free for one year but you have to
give your credit card details okay so
even if you are even if you are wanted
free you have to insert your various
packages that's the only drawback of
Google App Engine I mean most of them we
don't have credit card details right
okay so we will click on spring web MVC
okay and we'll go for four point three
point seven and click on this copy this
and we'll paste it here the moment I
have pasted it can you see that look at
it dependents demand dependencies here
you bought all the dependencies your
regard we got all this thing here so we
can see regarding Emily's web and with
me record a opine ago are being so all
the syllabus are required for your
Spring Framework
okay I got some pushes vo from baby -
why'd we don't use AWS it is free for 12
months even Google App Engine is for
free for 12 months I was facing some
issues with a depressed but I'm still
figuring figuring out how to
use AWS for our project videos art okay
so now males they swing as it is a frame
well what about spring boot so spring
boot makes your positive element bit
easier so many people also convert our
project in spring boot later once we
figure it out how to make it work on
Google App Engine but I mean we are
focusing on spring MVC okay for opener
ships server
we can also use open ship some of the
problem is OpenShift server has closed
there's free subscription you have to
pay for that and when you want to pay
why anyone will use open ship so when
you want to pay pay for it
a SS is much better than open shapes
right so that's why we are using I mean
Google Abbot is also good okay listening
is paid version can vm o 1.9 is
releasing on the paid version I don't
think so Java would ever go for paid
version has no idea about it let's see
okay so we got some a dependencies here
why so we got all these dependencies and
okay what's next
the next thing would be required here is
to configure our spring MVC so two
points think of this for support we have
to mention that we are using something
every see now how do we mention that
okay so I already have some cheat sheet
with me I will use that cheat sheet here
I got my cheat sheet so in this WebEx in
this very web actual file which is there
in the web minor you have to mention
that you are using spring MVC and all
the requests should navigate to spring
and to do that we have to add a subject
I'll so I will just copy that thing I
already have that thing with me here and
just paste it here so people who have
just joined this session do click on the
right button so that I will know your
anointed session because people are
coming and going I can see that okay
okay why is not copying from the local
repository because I guess I mean if it
is copied from the local repository so
that was
for so fast otherwise it would have
taken some time to download this thing
right okay you want me to share my cheat
sheet I will do that okay so you can see
I have I've specified that for all the
requests you have to send the request to
discuss of it and that's how spring MVC
works right okay my again my intention
here is not to teach you staying busy
okay my intention here is to teach you
how to make a project so I am as giving
that you already know spring MVC and if
you don't know that just go to the
channel and do launch thing everything
okay so what's next so once we once you
specify that all the requests will go to
disperse servlet what it will do is it
will okay so whenever you watch this
thing every see we have to avoid my doll
folder we don't have a Java in Java
folder here let me get a job folder you
can see we have directly resources
whatever I do here is I will say new I
will create a package with the package
okay Oh another package but a folder I
want to I want a folder here inside SRC
main so it's been new a folder okay I
want to folder inside main and the for
your name need to be Java because all
your Java file should be inside this
folder okay so if it is not that do
mention that okay so question what about
Gator when you introduce that later so
we talked about github later time
because you are focusing only on spring
and base we will see everything stages
take a step by step see I might not go
in a sequence the sequence which we
should follow but then since we are
doing it for the first time we'll do it
as we don't we don't up type okay so
what I will do here is I will say new
and I will create a class and I will say
this class as now since this is our
first course I will say index controller
now it's not complicated use of
controller at the end but it's always
better to use controller at the end of
the controller okay don't worry all the
session is getting
okay we got our controller here and if
you want to use a controller we have to
use and annotation to make it a
controller and that spring edition is as
controller annotation okay and okay why
does not getting imported so I will say
control space
okay the package name should not be a
test it should be con dot to this code
dot tusks that's what I want to package
them to be so I will just replace this I
will say click on this and move to calm
dot that is coded stuff I don't want
this earlier package right click and did
it okay so what text here well it's try
to okay so let's make it a method here
so for to exit all the requests will go
for public voice okay will say public
strings hope that some of homepage right
so whenever I use the request for the
home page will show the home page
unfortunately has not stated any GSP yet
but if we do that let me create some
jay-z pages here what I will call index
dot JSP so that man tends my home page
so whenever the user calls for a home
page I will call hello world not hole
avoids I say so that's not that would be
my home page will say welcome to telesco
learning's okay and we'll also provide
our H self for the feedback page so we
say a H left if I use a one to provide a
feedback I will do that later okay let's
do that later so we've got our we got
our index page and whenever I use a call
for the home page will return index dot
JSP but for which requesting of the
causes so we have to use a request
mapping so we'll say a great request
mapping and in here you have to mention
slash so whenever you use a call for the
home page when I say opposite mean slash
so slash represents home okay we'll say
control spaces okay so whenever the user
calls for the home page you have to call
index dot JSP next verify B is working
and okay let's right click here we'll
say run as run on server which is
already or Tomcat server for us let's
click on finish we shut the server
okay so we got the output as welcome to
that is called learning systems as we
got the output in the internal browser
let us do that on Firefox okay in fact I
was just Papa does I will go to my okay
it should I should I should use we all
should be using Firefox here okay so you
can see I got welcome to that is
coloring so anyway you say whenever you
take place for a home page it will call
for it will call for the index dot JSP
so this flowing is working now now what
I want is I want one more controller who
will work with so let us close this
thing okay I want one more controller
who can work with the feedback page so
inadequate for the feedback page example
if I pick feedback dot HTM it should
call it should call feedback dot JSP
where a user will enter detail and I
don't have a feedback page now so what I
will do is I will just okay as we have a
feedback design here so it is okay so I
already have my HTML page here let me
just paste that in my web app I will say
paste and you can see we got feedback
wonder HTML I already created is done
this is a very simple design here and if
I run this code
okay and I got an error here which says
Elise for what file not found
okay that makes sense huh the problem
here is now is whenever you work with
spring MVC you have to also mention one
more file which is called as so in Allah
in Arabic web dot XML file we are using
this thing here right which is we are
mentioning that our service name is the
disco it will also look for a spring MVC
also - for the Disco - so outlet or XML
file again we do not have to create
everything from scratch now the
advantage of using sts is you can create
a spring bean configuration file here
and okay you can mention the file name
as periscope - soffit dot XML click on
next
now two things we need here so we need
be we need context and we need MVC
nothing else so we need this three
things click on next and click on finish
just taken some time here
by the time let us take a design which
for feedback to HTM okay if I see the
design for third the design is not
visible
okay and in this you have to mention
your jar file belongs to which package
so anybody work whispering everything up
to also mention all these things and
that's the drawback with spring abyssea
if you have to do lots of configuration
and then you use spring boot you don't
have to do lots of quantification here
when you're using boot and I don't know
how many of you actually join the
session now if you have just joined this
session do click on the like button so
that I will know that you'll enjoy the
session okay so we'll use okay so I will
also copy this so much so my cheat sheet
instead of typing it so we need to
mention this being tagged okay we're
going to type it is just popping it'll
to take lots of time so is the context
components can and you have to mention
the base package the base package is
cons out telescope dot stuff so
information where your controllers are
and you have mentioned the controller
belongs to counter to this code or test
I guess we are good to go now let's
restart the server once again it just
right like run as run on server by
restarting the application of course
okay so if I search for Oh Kate is
working now but what about feedback dot
html' so first of all we have to put all
everything inside Oh jay-z page so I
will close this and I will create a new
GHI page which is feedback dot JSP will
write next here and I want a JSP page we
leave this as feedback George ASP and
let's replace everything with JSP okay
not literally everything but then the
HTML tags okay sounds good so if you
want to call this feedback page what you
have to do is in this index controller
you have to mention so when you're going
to use the request for feedback a list
here so public strings feedback so
whenever the user requests for feedback
you've returned feedback dot JSP but
when if we should call it whenever a
request is for the quest mapping so
whenever a user call for feedback dot
HTM we have to call feedback or JSP
let's run this now let's save this or it
is running or not right click run as a
non server finish or you want to
increase the font size more if I
increase the font size boys will come
out of the grid okay so for the quiz for
feedback dot HTM and that's our feedback
page let me say that we've got a
feedback page okay so regards our name
here
okay so let's enter name which is Naveen
and the email address or I will not use
my name I will use someone else name
here I will use money
Monisha melody would be M Etheridge
politico.com website so you are giving
feedback for online sessions any code
you can use online
1:01 and then you can enter a message
will stay good and then you can select
any of the star so this is the imagine
this is one two five okay this is a
thesis column here so we have not
configured CSS yet and this is that
that's why I want design from your side
so okay when you click on submit the
data has should go for okay code should
be only number so if I click on submit
okay so okay so the most the thing is
when you click on the stuff when it
should send a request to the to the
server right and we have not put it for
that and this is what the coding will be
done coding will be done in the next
live session okay this is what you have
to do okay the design which which I was
using is varied by me so you can blame
me for that I'm not using your designs
yet I'm not good at design yet so you
can you can create a good design for
this something new with the same fields
which we want here and then you send it
to us so tomorrow we'll be having again
live session I will try to complete this
feedback module yes this is just a
trailer okay
here we were doing this don't worry we
cannot do everything in one day right so
