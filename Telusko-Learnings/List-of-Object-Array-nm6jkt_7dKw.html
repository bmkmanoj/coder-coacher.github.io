ready and in this video let's understand
this code now this code is not that
difficult but since you are a beginner
you might face issues understand this
code now this code will be useful once
you start working on advanced framework
or maybe if you are working with a
project where you have where you want to
represent some data now anyway you have
a huge amount of data we try to store
the data in an array or any of these so
that you can fetch but some time we come
across this type of this type of code so
let's not understand what this means to
understand this code lets me go back to
this eclipse here what I will do is
first of all to understand that code we
have to understand to two can say one is
array and one is list so this is a
prerequisite for this video now if you
don't know this I do watch the add a
video and the latest video I do have
that in their playlist so once we got an
array and least concept let's see why do
we create an array so first of all when
you what you want to have a collection
of elements whenever you want to have a
fixed size collection or the elements
you go with the add a right example
let's say for reforming to go for the
integer array so I would say integer and
the way you specify a day you say nums
and you say a square bracket equal to
new integer you can go with the int as
well but just to represent this example
I'm going for integer array basically
integer is a class in Java so we got
integer array and we can also have a
string added here so we can say string
names and week this would be equal to
new string and it's say the sizes are
always 5 and then we can have one more
this is of all this is also integer but
then this time we will go with marks and
equal to new integer and if I say again
this size would be 5 and I can see we
got this 3 3 adding now the problem with
this array is the size is fixed right
now the reason why we go with the laced
is because least has we can have a
number of values there now in the list
if I can at least object if I say least
obj it will show neo or maybe least
least we can have the least object equal
show neo now list is an interface
basically so we have to use a class
which is added east here to instantiate
it now once you've got the least object
in this list we can add a number of
values right example if I Sally start
add we can add a data which is of string
I can say mean I can say least dot add I
can add a number as well so I can say 45
in fact we can also add a double value
you can add any type of values
what about array so when you instance
say integer array that means you cannot
have any other type if use a string type
it will only support string if you say
integer again it will only support
integer now at least you can have any
type a value but what I want is I want
to have collection of Eric and you have
a collation of array we can cry so
example I can say if I say if I want to
be very specific here so if I specify
string using gender X so this will
support only string you can see that we
are getting either on this line so when
you say string it will not support this
part but how about if I specify the
number of ice Pesa Phi the integer array
so when you specify integer which means
at least will have only integer
collection so in this ad now I can pass
that nums I can pass nums even I can
pass marks please dot add and we can
pass marks so what it means we have a
least in which you are adding an array
so we have to add is in one list we can
do that with the help of 2d array as
well but then using list you can have
you don't have to specify the size of
the array so you can go with any number
of arrays now can I add the type which
is of string so if I say names which is
of type string this will not work right
because the collection which you are
passing a string and you're accepting
only integer now in this case if you
want to make it default you can say
object array the moment you say object
at it will support all different types
so anyway you have a condition where you
want to specify a list of array and you
don't want to be specific with the type
of it you can go with the object and in
fact you can go with the object itself
because add is also an object but then
the moment you say object you can also
have normal values example you can say
least of dot we can say 99 as well I
don't want to assign single value the
only value to support is an array so for
that you have to mention and add it now
it will be easier for you to fetch the
values as well example if you want to
face the value of
you have to use a two-dimensional array
one for fetching from the number of
least or the elements of the least and
then one once for fetching the object
array so the idea here is whenever you
have a array of any type you can say
object adding and then this is a list of
object a day so you can assign any added
here that's it
I hope you enjoyed the video let me know
in the comment section and thanks for
watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
