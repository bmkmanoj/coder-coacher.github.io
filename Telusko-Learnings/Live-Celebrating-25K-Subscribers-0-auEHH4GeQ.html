any of this when I started my channel on
YouTube it was like ok so you know i can
upload my videos on youtube people can
watch it so my main the main thing today
i'm talking live is to tell you my
journey of youtube in fact there were
lots of questions i mean there were lots
of comments and messages on youtube how
i started my journey how are you know
how i became a youtuber and then why I
spend so much of time on YouTube why you
are providing all the resource for free
and that's the biggest question right I
am providing this is for free and then
people are saying why of doing that
they might they might be some hidden
things so that's that's that's what they
are thinking okay so I thank you so
today we talked about my journey and
we'll also try to go for some QA again
we don't have much time today I'm going
for a life for 45 minutes today and
start it now 45 minutes already done
putting minutes more and because I'm
going for a movie today ms dhoni finally
admit I was waiting for this movie from
last three months and so finally a book
my ticket for that movie and we are
going there okay so what else so I think
12 people are watching we can start the
thing I guess though there's no issue
with the Lightning right okay I can see
one side is perfectly liked it okay so i
think there's no issue with the lights
nice lighting now last time in the last
time when they when we had this session
it was like with them uh it was a
nighttime so there was not not a natural
light coming from outside just just like
let's add me i have a window and you can
see some birds chirping okay so let's
start with my chutney and by the time if
you have any questions you can type on
the chat window and so that we can talk
about that also okay people are not
watching live and it hardly people the
okay so let's start with that huh so how
I started my youtube journey so so
basically when I talk about my career so
I started my development and training
career from last six years in 2010 I
started my career as a developer as a
trainer boat so I was doing both us at
the same time so I still remember when i
completed my BS CIT from in year 2010
you know I wanted to go for masters and
then at the same time I was not having
you know I wanted to have my own pocket
money you know so that when i'm doing
masters i can actually i can actually
earn at that time so that was the first
thing second when I when I was doing BSC
at that time I used to give lots of
seminars in the college because when I
was in the first year I was like not I
was not that I was not that good with
presentation skills and I I was I used
to fear talking to people okay when I
was in my first year BSC or or you can
say a junior college but once I get into
a degree school or degree college at
that time you know ways to get lots of
opportunity to present I mean to present
on stage and while presenting you know I
used to page to fear I used to when I
goes to when I used to go on stage I
used to my legs were used to shiver and
my hi sister she were so all those
things but I know I should think you
know how I can be a good good presenter
because people coming from the corporate
world I used to come to a Polish they
should present different technologies
and also think I want to be like this
guy you know the way he presents is
awesome so I started doing that stuff
you know I started presenting in college
I was nothing I was practicing I was
practicing how to how to present and how
to you know how to put your points on
stage how not to shower and then so I
learn different techniques from
different people so i used to go on
youtube i have to i used to search are
different
different people so I used to study them
how they move how they talk how they use
the complete stage and what is the comic
elements they add in this session so i
used to watch them and by that i got
lots of idea how to talk to people how
to present stuff and then i used to
teach my juniors you know in every so
when i was in my third year of BSC i
used to go to second year p second-year
people and I should teach them I used to
go to first year people I used to teach
them in their classroom size to talk to
guys to talk to their teachers i want to
present something in front of my juniors
and teachers to say okay you can do that
so that's how I started my you know I
said that's why i started the presenting
still presenting things and when i
completed my BSC just to get the extra
pocket money i used to i joined a
classes but I can when I can teach okay
now of course no one will give the
opportunity to a new new guy right so
there was one institute in vikhroli in
mumbai so that that person he given me
that fortunate e to teach people to
teach to teach people and i was teaching
to those people who are seniors to me
people who have already already working
for in companies they wanted to learn
java so i was just college dropout I
mean college graduation completed guy
and I was teaching those people so i was
when i was at that time and then just to
you know just to increase my
presentation skills organized to go to
youtube because i was knowing things i
was knowing java at that time but to
know java and to teach our student
things right so I used to I used to
think how can I teach to those people
who are seniors to me because I was
having experience of
other I guess now its proper yeah there
was something there was something wrong
with my mobile so I was offline and now
I'm live again uh yeah so I was yeah
yeah I was not drop out of the college
okay i completed my i completed my
graduation properly forgetting add
extinction extinction in in my BSC so I
was not a bad person I mean I was not a
I'm not a bad person but I was not I I
was not drop out of the college I
completed my creation properly okay I
got distinction in my graduation okay so
i was talking about i forgot the point
yeah so YouTube taught me lots of stuff
right so we have new boston then we have
direct banas then we have kaushik java
brains awesome channels wide so i
learned everything from those channels i
was working on a project so those things
gives me the knowledge on always right
but i also goes to youtube to learn how
to present stuff in fact now I can talk
to people now I can talk in front of
camera there's one of the most difficult
thing right you can talk to people
because they you can use this you can
see the feedback there but how can you
talk to a camera so you can see I'm
looking at the camera now I am talking
to a camera that's look that looks very
weird you know initially when I started
looking at camera and talking I stress I
used to feel very weird and now it's
okay now I got this so not working again
I'm offline now health is proper ok so a
youtube so you took taught me how to
teach different things
yeah so in fact uh so you know while you
are present in there are multiple ways
to present okay so I follow one of the
greatest person in the world who is not
there yet now as to jobs in fact I wear
this t-shirt you know today for the
session just to just to mimics to job
sooner Stooges used to wear this type of
shirts you know this type of shirts okay
let me check the health for this buffer
okay so this is what you say it's two
jobs t-shirt heels to wear and in all
the presentations so if you if you watch
all the okay not discolor not the gray
color used to wear that color I don't
have black color polo I am in this this
type of t-shirts so I just well I'm just
wearing this now I know so I used to I
used to mimic two jobs how used to high
used to product I used to launch
products so when you when you launch any
iphone or ipod launched you can see his
technique of launching it and I i
learned that presentation skills from
there and yes yes Michael there are
certain tutorials I mean which on
YouTube which are not easy to follow
it's just that you know when I was stood
and I used to think so as I the student
you know how you should be learned right
you want you have a ideal trainer in
front of you so when you become a
trainer you try to mimic that trainer so
let's say when i was when i was a
student in my college I used to thank
you know the trainer's which we have is
not they are not teaching that weight as
we wanted right because generation
generation changes the way of teaching
changes so I wanted someone who can
teach me the way I teach now so I try to
implement all those kind all those
things in fact I have two of my idols
real-life idols one is yogesh yogesh
contact and a safe as if sir so this
both are my gurus so I used to mimic
them also how they talk in on stage how
they create suspense in training because
you know you have to make you have to
make a training fun right so i can
always remember these two people when i
talk about my teaching style
I'm not saying that they teach like me I
just think I try to mimic them okay so
yeah so that's how I that's how I became
a trainer now then why YouTube I never
wanted to be a youtuber I never wanted
to be a trainer I always wanted to be a
as a developer in a full-time developer
in a company for at least a note for 25
years full stretch you know I just
wanted to be a developer in the company
but when I joined a company I was
working for a company at that time I
felt you know development is good in
fact I work for some quite some time i'm
in good time that someone is walking on
the projects I is to feel that what I am
doing the project I'm enjoying it but
the moment I get a chance to speak okay
sighs to enjoy that a lot okay so I used
to enjoy other pending but now I do
development but I used to enjoy training
people more than developing things okay
because I feel anyone can develop light
but it takes a it takes lots of it takes
that power to teach people so when I
have that skills why don't I teach it so
I used to go to different colleges i
used to go to different classes just on
on the weekend so that i can i can get
an experience so i used to go to
colleges and classes on weekends then
what about the other students I can I'm
clean I am teaching to those people who
only whom I know right what if i want to
teach to everyone because there are lots
of people they cannot join institutes
because of lack of money in fact when I
was my bachelors I was not having much
money to invest on Java courses and all
these courses because if you want to
learn java from an intra to do you have
to pay around 15,000 20,000 rupees to
learn java right so I was not having
much unser I was not having much money
to invest there and there are lots of
people right specially in India where
they cannot invest money for for
learning stuff so I thought I learned
everything from YouTube why don't I just
give it back so I started with the first
video in fact if you see my first video
it is very weird I don't know how many
of you have seen my first video let me
share the link if it with you again you
will laugh on that or video it's very
bearded you know it's very weird I don't
know where it is now
let's check in a shed a screen with you
I'll let the video with you okay this
this e this video is for years back okay
very old video you can see in the in the
in the comments section i have sent you
the link that is my first video on
youtube okay it was just a trial can you
can see how thin i was three years back
and it was very bad don't what don't
watch it now because you are watching me
live here you can watch it later so you
can this a chat in the chat window have
that video there okay so yeah so then I
started my so I started with that video
and then I have not got the good
response because you can see there are
some dislikes also for that video I'm
sure do we have this like oh we don't
have any dislike for this video but
anyway but the comment section
personally I was getting on facebook
that video quality was not good the
talking that you're speaking speed is
very you know it was very very fast you
are not audible properly and all the
stuff and yes so the camera was some one
of my friend was holding the camera and
we were they were just having fun okay
it was not something like I wanted to
upload that video on YouTube is just was
we were having some fun and then so
later on you know I felt you know I can
i can teach on youtube so i created more
videos so in that span of one month i
have created around five to six videos
on youtube and then i put it after that
I forward about all those things you
know let's not create videos for YouTube
now I'm not getting proper response but
suddenly someday one of the video which
is polymorphism out of those videos
gotta hit you know it was coming so if
you search a polymorphism on youtube it
was the first language was coming up and
I was like I was so excited looking at
it I'm coming on youtube on the first
leg and also I thought people do like my
teaching they'll do they do like my the
way I present so I thought let's let's
make more videos and then I used to get
some comments some facebook messages
that your videos are helping helping us
so I thought if some
one is getting help from my videos let
us create videos in my free time so as
soon as I get I I used to get some time
off from my from my office work from my
college were from a project work I used
to make one video so one day one video
or one big one video and doing that in
three years now I have around 500 videos
on youtube so doing that you know every
day or once in a week I used to make
videos so that's how I became a youtuber
and with every video i'll learn lots of
stuff and that's why if you can see my
playlist of youtube if you go to my java
playlist not not all videos are in
sequence in fact if you watch other
people channel they create let's say
whatever if they want to teach java they
will start with the first video and they
will end with the last video okay you
can see there is a continuous flow but
when i started making videos i was
making on topics so let's say
polymorphism done and capsules and an
abstraction done exception handling done
so it was like I am doing here and there
i can make i was making any any video
for that matter any video you know i
feel this this is this is this topic is
interesting let's do thats i used to be
i used to do that I used to make videos
on that but the litter I felt that I
should have all the videos right because
people if people are watching my videos
I want them to learn completely it's not
just because initially when I started
you know I used to think okay people
will find the polymorphism difficult
let's make a video and polymorphism
people might find exception handling
difficult so let's make a video on extra
handling so but they don't felt you know
why don't we create a full playlist you
know from start to end people can learn
everything and that's why I created
those those videos some videos are
created initially then some great some
videos are created later that's why you
can see my face is changing in every
video so there are some old videos where
I have very thin there are some new
videos will have a fat and very healthy
so that's why the sequence is not proper
but i made sure i have arranged
everything in a proper sequence so if
you started the first video in the
playlist and if you go in sequence you
can learn complete java that's what I
made sure that you will do that but in
between i was using some software to
remove my nose you know in surrounding
noise you can in life also you can see
so there are some surrounding noise okay
like we have
stripping here then my mom is cooking in
kitchen so you can see all those sounds
so I tried to remove those sounds with
some software and what that sound did is
it has removed the noise with my voice
okay so you can see there are some
videos where I have my voice within low
it's because of those softwares so I
learned a lot how to use difference
offers how to use how to how to talk in
front of camera how to record a screen
how to how to make videos how to make it
interesting what time to upload what
time do you know because we have a graph
here so in day time in India I get lots
of views in night time I get less views
because all the views are coming from us
okay so I don't have much USV was
compared to Indian because I get around
seventy percent seventy percent views
from India itself ok and then twelve
percent from us then five to six percent
from Bangladesh Pakistan and then asian
countries only five to six percent and
then some from France some from Germany
so I'm not a big big I mean I am not
that famous in US and waiting for that
day you know when i will get more views
from us so that's how i started my
journey then I also you know initially I
studied it only for only for teaching
people okay not to earn something from
that so when I started this thing I
wanted to give as much knowledge as
possible but they don't feel you know
when i'm making we're not doing all
these efforts i want a moba i want a
good camera to shoot myself i'm in to
record myself so i have recorded i
bought a laptop just to make that
recording more efficient because the
laptop which was having earlier that was
very slow because I used when I should
render the video is after editing it
should take lots of time so I thought
let's not do YouTube again because i am
not wasting my time I mean I'm no I'm
not wasting my time I am providing
knowledge but still you know I was not
getting much time to do all the steps so
i wanted i wanted to spend some money so
that i can buy all these things so i
made youtube monetized also i have
monetized all my videos so that i will
earn something from it so that i can
invest on all these devices okay
put on much but anything which iron I
invest all those on all those devices
okay so i think is not the main thing on
youtube for me but the main thing is to
provide knowledge so i try to upload
more and more videos i can i guess for
free okay time in i'm not expecting much
money from that it's just that I want to
share knowledge that's does the first
thing that's how I became a youtuber
second when I when you learn new
technology you know everything goes into
your gram so when you would learn
something new so let's say if I want to
learn about Hadoop now so I'm running
Hadoop now I was having a book here but
I guess I kept it somewhere so currently
i am learning hadoop okay so if i want
to learn Hadoop and I want to practice
it right because if you learn something
new everything goes into your RAM and
then you cannot you cannot remember that
for a long time so what people normal
people do is they write notes okay they
create notes or whatever they learned I
don't make notes okay I am damn lazy to
do that then how can I remember my own
learning so what i will do is i will
learn those things and i will make a
video ok so i will learn new things i
will make a video on that so that in
future if I forgot my own things so if i
forgot the old if I forgot my own things
I will make I will watch my own videos I
in fact i do that i have some videos on
youtube which something i learned and
then just to just to remember that i
watch my own videos example i have my
videos on cisco packet tracer it you
know it happens every three months i
forgot about that concept so again i go
to my videos i watch my own videos just
to make it make it understandable so
that's how that's why i make videos for
youtube so that lots of reasons are why
i make videos on youtube there were lots
of difficulties ok just to list some
difficulties first one I was ok what
difficulties I had the first difficulty
is recording yourself because someone
need to hold the camera and then their
hands may shake because if you can see
my old videos all the videos were
shaking because of someone was holding
those holding the camera or mobile phone
and all the videos which are there on
YouTube are recorded from mobile phones
ok there was no not a single
professional camera I guess one more one
video was from professional camera
which I was which I have deleted now all
the videos are recorded with him about
mobile phones initially it was samsung
then again it was Samson then now it is
iphone just to have a good camera i
bought iphone to record myself so that
was the first challenge the second
challenge was since i am making all the
videos there are some topics which are
not that comfortable with and then
people used to give lots of bad comments
some people specially from other
countries that they should talk about my
accent because we are have an indian
accent and some people in u.s. they
don't understand indian accent okay dep
dep they are comfortable with us accent
so that was some of the difficulties I
faced they should give bad words I used
to ignore those what else what what
other difficulties recording videos I
mean recording screen recordings how to
edit them that was bit difficult for me
because i am not that good with editing
videos and all the stuff those are
difficulties then so with a difficulty
as you think okay let's not do youtube
when I am wasting lots of my time a lots
of my efforts are going there and I'm
not getting much effort on that but one
day one day you know I was traveling in
bus and then one guy comes from some of
the college he was he was looking at me
for a long time and then I was like why
what this guy is watching me like that
and then suddenly he asks you have
enjoyed authority off from youtube I say
dsm that heÃ­s so so i thought okay i am
getting famous in mumbai i am getting
famous in india so at least if i make
more videos i will get more famous ok so
those are things i am are you too but
now and so this was not expected I was
not expecting to get I was not expecting
to get 25,000 subscribers I'm very happy
for that when i started with 1000
subscribers i was happy ten thousand i
was happy 15,000 i was happy and now
he's 25 25 thousand so waiting for that
day when I will get 50,000 subscribers
can you imagine that having 50-ton
subscribers with you we are like family
right we have it's not just you have a
subscribe us it is our family I think I
you know I I like to get more
subscribers so that we can increase
the family yeah so that's that's about
my you tube journey so let's start
answering some questions I hope you like
my journey if you have any questions
about my journey anything you can ask me
now today's sessions focused on YouTube
journey ok let's not do it ourselves the
first question is from bigg boss nit or
says infotech I do not want to comment
on all these things which Institute is
good it's just that all the Institute's
are good and all are bad ok so you
cannot you cannot say it's which
institute I will say the branch ok so
nit has their own branches there are
some branches which are good there are
some concepts without which which are
very very bad same goes with syd
infotech they have son some branches
which are very good there are some
tranches which are very bad so how to
choose which institute go to that branch
check who is the trainer there so let's
say if you are enrolling for java if you
are unloading and rolling for.net check
who is the trainer and if you if you
know the if you know the particular
trainer so let us say if X percent
stitching the nose is no his experience
to talk to your seniors who was there in
that institute in that branch you will
get the idea should i join this or not
if I if I tell you I nit is good but I
don't know which nit you will join
because this trance if you join a 90 at
your location you might get a bad
trainer ok so because you cannot
nowadays is not about Institute it's
about who is your who's training you so
both are good an idea is good I sit in
fatigue is good nothing bad in that is
just that who is feeling that that's
important ok yeah thank you so much for
the congratulations see I am enjoying it
enjoying my 25,000 subscribers in fact
from last three to four days i'm talking
about this only i got 25,000 subscribers
yay in fact other channels you know
other java channels are the educational
channels they have 1 million subscribers
you have two million subscribers I just
have 25,000 subscribers but I happy with
that I am NOT expecting to get a huge
number of subscribers but something is
always better right into anybody
subscribers are not a big thing ok next
question is saw from Hina
please suggest some nice project hina
when I'm talking about project see the
time is changing very fast so five years
back if you ask me which project I
should go for I would of course the I
would have saying to go for e-commerce
website because let's say seven years
back or ten years back if you say ten
years back library management software
asset management offers and especially
management software is banking all those
stuff the five years back if you say
which witch project ecommerce website
now if we talk about new project I would
say the current trend is of big data the
current trend is mobile current trend is
cloud computing so do something with
mobile phones do something with cloud
computing do something with big data
concepts so if you can embed all these
concepts you know it will be very
helpful for you okay so i would suggest
if you can go with big data that will be
enough that will be efficient for you
big data concepts like Hadoop apache
spark all this stuff otherwise if you if
you find it difficult you can go for a
cloud computing create your own cloud
servers create your own cloud
applications and trade with your friends
otherwise you can also make a mobile
application right android application
maybe iOS if you have iphone and macbook
with you now why iphone if you have a
macbook you macbook with you go for iOS
write this as this is something where
you can start with now which project to
choose so that is that technology right
I do big data those are technologies
which project to choose I would suggest
do that which dude which which or they
which is not there already okay example
if you know while going somewhere you
will always think this is something i
can improve because see if we talk about
softwares I feel software is something
which is used to solve the real life
problem right so in real life we have
lots of issues to solve those real life
issues we use we use a we use office
right in the last session I was talking
about uber right so what ever does is it
solves your real life problem with an
virtual app right
okay so should think about some real
life issues around your college around
your campus around your company and try
to solve with your own project for that
so I cannot suggest a Padula project but
think about some real-life scenarios and
try to solve that there are certain
scenarios which will look impossible but
trust me we are IT professionals and V
I'll magicians and we can do anything we
want okay so think about that think
about any project you want but choose a
proper technology i would suggest go for
big data hadoop android programming iOS
programming something which is not dead
already i mean something which is very
new okay don't go for normal small
projects I mean you can start with small
projects of course you cannot diagnose
jump on this project if you know basic
programming start with big project if
you don't know how to how to make a
project go with a small project first
and this is this is the reason why I
started online course in fact I was
providing all the videos for free on
YouTube okay all the videos were free
but then later on you know there was
some people who are saying that it is
easy to follow your videos okay they
were learning everything from the videos
but they were finding I mean some people
they were finding it difficult to
implement by themselves because loving
is very easy right you can watch my
videos and you can type it there but
doing the doing the project by yourself
it is which is something with which they
were finding difficult okay because
while making a project you have to
understand lots of concept how to how to
collaborate multiple things how to use
libraries and all those tough so I
thought okay let me teach people how to
do that I will give them assignments i
will give them project but it is very
difficult to see because YouTube is a
broadcasting thing right now I cannot
give you assignment as a broadcaster I
cannot check your assignments so let's
say if I broadcast everything if I
broadcast this is your assignment there
are some people who will do it there are
some people's will not do it and when I
say there is some people who will do it
it will be a count of thousands writes a
thousand people will be watching it I'm
thousand people will be sending the
sending with the assignments and that
would be impossible for me to do that
okay so half take out extra time and
since I am giving extra time now so I
thought let's start an online course
well I will be having limited set of
students so that I can train them
properly
I can teach them i will give them
assignments I can make them work on
project so that they will it will get
they will get a complete experience okay
so that's how that is why i started the
online course okay now what next next
question ratha mesh could you teach me
how to teach that's weird the most
difficult thing in the world is to teach
people how to teach first of all a
teaching is actually very easy okay we
just need a different way of thinking it
okay so how do you how do you learn to
teach first of all try to teach
something which is very easy so let's
say if I if I if you if you ask me to
teach you how to add two numbers okay so
what we do in schools or let's say you
know in school we used to have this
concept let's say we have there are six
apples and if you take two apples how
many apples you have there are four
apples right that's how you teach people
those are the basic things you should
learn how to how to make people
understand so how I do it okay I cannot
teach you how to teach but I can tell
you what is my thinking when I teach
people what is what I think when I teach
people so what I think about teaching
people is just hold on just hold on
there's some I have my neighbor here who
is trying to get into this game it haha
okay yeah so unfortunately i don't have
my nephew here today he is there with
his parents he we going out so yeah so
how i teach people so what I do is I I
go on again so let's say I want to teach
you any simple topic so what i will do
is first when I when I learn that
concept islands in such a way that I
should be able to teach someone which
which which will make it very easy
example when I watch you do to your when
I watch videos on YouTube I find some of
the videos are very complex there are
some some youtubers they make things
very complicated I don't know why you
wanted to even if they want to teach a
simple topic they will make it
difficult to understand to people so
what i do i replace that trainer with me
so if i am there if i am teaching the
concept I on if I am the student so I
create a clone so I am a trainer i am a
student both as a student how I want to
learn I do the same thing when I am a
trainer okay so as a student when you
want to learn something you want you
have a ideal trainer in front of you so
try to be that trainer try to try to
make try to make the concept as simple
as possible if you watch any of my
videos I have not taken big examples I
made the examples small examples so that
the concept should be clear because
there are some tutorials on YouTube they
have the just to teach you polymorphism
they create afford 450 lines I mean why
you need a code for 50 lines to teach
polymorphism why you need 100 lights of
code to teach you how to take input from
user when you can do it in two lines
okay so remove all those extra codes
remove all those extra things make it
simple okay now that's the first thing
always make the things simple second
when you teach you have to make sure
that your words ok your your message is
going into your students brain and the
heart not just plain but also heart okay
because students learn a lot right i
mean they are sitting in lots of
sessions but they don't remember
everything so you have to make sure that
when you say something it goes into
their brain and then heart how to do it
first connect with them okay connect
with your students that's very important
thing because if you cannot connect with
your students that's very difficult to
teach them so the only way in fact when
i go to different companies when i go to
different institute so let's say if i
have a training for five days if I
upgrading for 10 days first today before
first session so first day first session
maybe little before lunch I try to make
sure that i am connected connected with
them so my first job is to connect with
them because if you cannot connect with
people it is very difficult to teach
them okay there should be a direct
connection between you and your students
because the first thing second i try to
add some comic elements you know I try
to do comedy I mean I try okay not a
good comedian but I try to do good
comedy so that they can
you know they can they can connect so I
give example of real life with some
comedy element so that when they when I
give them real example they will match
okay this is in real life this is in
virtual virtual world so they can
connect plus I give them various example
I can okay so that when you give a v8
example so they will laugh of course and
then since they are laughing it so when
you laugh your brain expands your brain
opens okay and so you can feed that data
inside that's my theory that's my I have
done some PhD on that that's how I feel
you should teach okay make it simple
connect with your students and add some
comic elements now make it easy I can do
that on YouTube but connecting with
people on YouTube is difficult because i
am making a video and they are watching
it later so there is not a proper
connection there so that's the only
thing I feel in fact i have my lots of
videos on youtube which are not going
which are not getting good views so
there are some videos which are getting
on the 10 views 100 views 200 views so
that is something which d motivates me
so you can motivate me share those
videos videos with your friends you know
that i think this is two ways when I am
digging fit something for you share with
your friends I know at least then there
will be there will be lots of people who
will share those things with other
people okay so next Michael but no one
explains like you oh thank you so much I
have a different way of teaching I feel
I'm not saying I'm a good trainer it's
just that I have a different way of
teaching some people like it some people
hate it I have seen I have see I had
some comments which there are some
people who hate me I don't know right
they dislike my videos like that okay
akasha is please make some video for
project okay i will do that i will make
some videos for project i was thinking
about that from a long time but you know
it's difficult to make those videos i
will try we'll try surely i will try for
that next is nathan he will answer yeah
I've answered your question petha mesh
finally okay Nanda Kumar is it useful to
study program the advanced data
structures in order to become a good
programmer it's always a good thing okay
there are certain companies they when
they when they take interviews they will
not ask you there they will not ask you
any syntax the syntactical thing they
will give you a problem statement you
have to solve that statement with the
help of algorithms okay they will ask
you lots of questions on data structures
because data structure will teach you
how to think about memory how to think
about programming and all the stuff so
data learning data structures is always
a good thing some people are lazy like
me so we don't learn data structure but
it's always a good thing okay okay next
who was holding the camera okay one of
my friend was holding the camera for all
the earlier videos now I have a I have a
tripod here so the mobile is attached to
our tripod so I use that it takes 15
years to set up the tripod i am not that
good with setting also okay next okay
what do you think feature about
angularjs and angularjs with java so
angular JS is a view technology now and
it is getting very famous in fact i have
my video i have one of my video on
YouTube about JavaScript so javascript
is evolving now so initially five years
back when you talk about JavaScript or
six years backs for that matter
javascript was only for making
client-side programming you know make
how to make your page interactive that's
a client-side programming but now
javascript has evolved you can make line
side so i was at programming with
database everything using javascript so
there's something else mean stack so it
is mean is Mongo DB x plus GS angularjs
and node.js using this technology you
can make a complete complete thing
client sites outside everything so
angular JS is something which is works
on the view side so you can also make a
jar website working with angularjs and
it is getting quite famous now in fact I
was thinking about learning angularjs in
between but I thought okay java
javascript is not my cup of tea so i
can't be done but it's a good thing to
learn okay next one congratulations
thank you oh okay next
is he man she can you can you help me I
want to know as a fresher we need to
know frameworks or it will be okay with
co java and advanced java that's a
tricky question see as a fresher i would
not expect you to know frameworks okay i
would i would expect you to know co java
maybe some part of advanced java that's
it as a facial i don't expect people to
know frameworks but knowing frameworks
will always give always give an
advantage let's say if you join any
company and so initially they will
expect that you should know kochava so
that they can teach you on different
frameworks but when they teach you
framework they will teach you in two
days five days ten days and some time
will do it because it bit is bit
difficult to learn framework in five or
ten days if you already have the
knowledge of frameworks which is very
easy to learn at that time then and that
is the time anywhere you can show other
people that you know something right so
i would suggest you to learn frameworks
there is no harm in that but as a facial
you don't need to but it's always a good
thing to learn so what next Oh always
are the questions
only 30 by people people are watching
today not much of the crowd hey make
sure you you share these videos with
your friends so that your friends will
also know that there is someone has done
in 20 who is making videos on YouTube
you can join me tweening ok where is the
question I lost all the questions yeah
next question is from Yasin which
software is good for noise cancellation
ok you are watching from Toronto that's
good i am getting some youtube us
youtubers anyway youtube youtube us
people to watch this video ok so which
software is good for noise cancellation
i use so when i was working on a dell
machine so this is my mac now but
initially i was to work on dell machine
so in del we have so i was i have
installed some drivers and that dry what
I was having an option of reducing the
noise so i just checked it i guess i was
not using any external application for
noise cancellation i was using my
internal things only so i don't have
much idea on that which is the good
software but you can search on youtube
first for sure if you search on youtube
good noise cancelling software there are
other youtubers they will tell you for
that jason says i like your way of
speaking and your English is
understandable attached thats thank you
so much
oh do full-time g-tube bro you can go
about one lakh subscribers that's good
but if i do youtube full time how will i
earn them do not have to have to sell
everything I have to sell my house
that's not possible to be a full-time
youtuber maybe if I aren't more I can do
that Sandhya Sharma have you ever walked
on crm software no I have not got any
chance to walk on crm ok please suggest
me your best better master degree for ok
so you are doing BSC IT rishikesh I
would suggest to go for MCA MSA is also
good but the thing is after doing ms CIT
the thing is especially in Mumbai in
India especially they pre for MCA people
compared to MSC is because when you go
to the official website of your
university they will keep MSC in be a
c-section and they will they will I mean
sorry they will keep MSC in science
section I mean they will keep MCA and
engineering in technology section so if
you want to get into good company as a
developer always go for n seal but let's
say if you don't want to go for the
company you want to be a researcher you
want to be a trainer you want to go into
company doesn't matter no knowledge is
important i will go for MSC ok ms egos
gives you more knowledge than MCM ok so
depends which you want to go for so if
you want to be a developer mca if you
want to be a trainer researcher even if
you want to be a developer with more
knowledge go primacy but the only thing
is company don't click for MSC people ok
next is from i use i followed your video
thank you so much or thank you so much
ok priyanshu it was my luck that i have
a chance to learn yeah i remember
priyanshu it was july 2015 when I was
sweet whatever else when I was training
you in accenture at the same time I
bought this matchbook in when I was when
I was filling these people yes priyanshu
and thanks to be thanked to you to be my
subscriber and my trainee there
and I should remember your dance the
angel okay next is there any government
job a government exam for BCA no we
don't have any exam for the government
exam for BC and they said you can
directly go for that michael says do i
really need discrete mathematics to
improve or myself while in programming i
would like to contribute to open source
but people always mock me because oh I'm
no i don't i will not say that you need
lots of mathematical skills but
something is good you know you should
know something about discrete
mathematics you should know something
about statistics and all the stuff
because there are certain scenarios they
are certain there are certain
requirement from the project where you
need some mathematical understanding of
it because solving the real life issues
is done with the elbow mathematics okay
example if we talk about any AI software
for that matter it works with
mathematics pattern matching image map
image mapping and all those stuff so
having the match knowledge will always
help you okay you don't have to be
expert in mathematics but something is
good okay but if you don't know Matt's
it is pretty difficult to work on some
projects prakhar good way to learn
algorithm and how to how important is
algorithm algorithm is very important
Prakash very very important the best way
is learn all the algorithm and created
those algorithms okay let's say if you
are learning about bubble sort okay so
this is a sorting technique right so you
have to learn the algorithm first and
second you have to modify it modify it
for your own use and that's how you
learn algorithm create your own
algorithm for everything which you use
and good resource I don't have my videos
on algorithm but I guess New Boston may
help you or for that matter some other
channel and about good chance for
algorithms record says please provide
movie lectures on Android and the thing
is I don't know Android much the things
which I was knowing i made a video on
that i am not a big fan of
droid is just that I wanted some videos
so I made it for beginners at least if
people who do not know because the thing
is there are videos on YouTube there are
lots of Android videos on you it means
just that as a fresher people do not
feel comfortable to watch those videos
because they these people they expect
that you will know Java then you know
all the stuff sorry okay so they will
teach you from advanced part what I did
it when I made it made a video I studied
some basic and when the point I left you
in that video now i can now you can go
to other chance to watch it will very
easy for you to do that now next I don't
have macbook white what I want to do um
okay if you don't have a macbook and if
you want to be iOS developer i would say
you i would suggest you to you can
install a vmware so on Windows you can
install VMware on on vmware you can
install iOS okay you can install a mac
OS and on my quest you can do iOS
programming that is something you can do
okay but doing that will take lots of
efforts and you need a good machine for
that to work to work on virtual machines
okay so five minutes more I'm getting
late for the movie if you remember okay
I to do lots of things because my mom is
prompting me we are getting late for the
movie it up ok ok let's go for two more
questions ok I don't know why I lose all
the link for the questions ok where are
the questions okay next is I want to
make videos on restful web service oh we
have already talked about talked before
I am following year since six months I
want to make videos you want to make
videos on restaurant api's do it do it
right make your own videos on rush
Felipe and upload it i will show you
videos don't worry a
yes utica I do have my videos on YouTube
advanced java videos but not completely
some go java concepts are they're not
all okay so yeah I do have so go to my
channel you can see some some videos
there at once Java so the I have written
some play DS so if you go to my channel
there is a link there is a tab for this
playlist tab and in dip in that playlist
I have lots of playlist c programming
android advanced java servlets and all
the stuff you guys okay so question for
me know what you what I love more
working in a company or online cute
online tutor to be honest online tutor I
love teaching I love talking to people i
love this in fact i also love to be a
trainer in company so when I when I'm a
trainer I love it I don't enjoy my life
the developer much I mean I love it I
love development but if you say which
one is the high point i will say
training so i love training more than
developing so that's not oh that's it I
guess no more questions remaining
question try to connect earlier in this
session in the in the live session so
that you can ask questions because I
cannot complete all the questions so
sorry for that i cannot complete
everything but next time sure i will
make a live video soon maybe next week
