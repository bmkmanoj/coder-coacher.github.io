inventive compass for gardening and in
this video we'll talk about hibernates
relations but this will be a practical
in the last session we have talked about
the theory operate so for that watch
because what I have done here is I have
created two classes one is laptop in
laptop I have our ID as L ID and then we
have L name and for this we have get in
and setup then we have student where you
have you see we have okay
so we have this student class here and
then in our last class what we have done
is we have created this laptop object
and this student object and I want to
store both the objects into database and
of course you have to make sure that you
have am period both the classes here
which is student and laptop and then you
can simply add it can simply save the
gate vanity database you can see we have
saved laptop and save the student now
what what what's something organized
everything is perfect here let's run
this so if you London of course there
will be a table for laptop and there
will be a table for students as you can
see I'm not using any specific name for
this or table they will use student and
laptops table as I mean only so you can
see we have an ID tell name and then we
have mass name and roll number now if
I'm going to go to the mask Y and you
can see you cannot see so I have this
neon as my data base and you can see we
have two tables here which is student
and change show table we do have two
tables your laptop and student and if I
say select star from students will be
getting d t you can spot a student which
is 150 Nerine and if I say laptop we can
see the Koch 1 to the 1 and del again
van waiting for strengthen laptop
because in the theory we have talked
about these two classes again you can
continue the same example for alien
class as well which we which we are
doing from last few videos okay so what
what's new here so what I want is there
should be a link between a students on
laptop because every student will have a
laptop right what I will do here is I
will say
which lets create object of laptop here
I will name it laptop as laptop thing
and then for this property we have to
use the identity of course so we have to
say right leg with the soles which is
here and we select getters and setters
so we'll select this part and we click
on OK
ok so you can see regard it is go for
laptop as well now so student class has
a property which is laptop so whatever I
mean see we have a number we have name
we have mark and we also have laptops
which you have a lots of property right
but the last term is not on normal
variable it's an object so it will go to
the laptop class and see ok in lots of
clouds we have L ID as the primary key
so in students table will be having L ID
as the current key right let's try let's
see or before that we have to change in
app as well we have to also set the
laptop user ID so we say s dot set
laptop and we'll say laptop laptop
itself so you can see we have laptop
here in fact the necklace by missing
this thing in fact if I if I want to
change this student it should change the
all the variable C right I've seen that
in some of the ideas I believe but it
when you type if you select this if you
say if you type student all this
reference should also change but doesn't
know how to get that if we know let me
know in the comment section which ID he
supposed that ok let's continue so what
I'm doing is I am taking this laptop
student as well and I put on this code
okay we got an error because because yes
so what what's wrong here is it is not
able to define the type of laptop here
so whenever you create objects inside
student you have to specify what is the
relationship between this laptop and a
student for that you have to use a
notation which is called as one-to-one
because one students will have one
laptop now let's fly in from this code
you can see it worked
so once twenty one half one is a score
that is your one two so that's your
one-to-one relationship now if I say
show table you can see because laptop
and strength this is this this is our
old table Cystic north
laughs turbine student and if I say the
next class on laptop it will be only
laptop entry because that don't know
about the student but student know the
body table it shouldn't know about the
desktop right because in student class
we have updated with the laptop object
that's one two one two one but let's see
how to implement one-to-many here for
one-to-many water rituals let's say one
student has a laptop so of course you
cannot use normal laptop here you have
to say list of laptops
what's the list and then let's create
object here itself we say new add a list
okay let's import the package for both
we'll say Java dot util okay so we have
imported that okay it's not getting
imported for this of watch okay so since
I'm using replaced my a project to one
point six and that quite is not
supporting this diamond here you have to
specify that this feature of not
mentioning was introduced in one point
seven two of course you have to mention
here because my JDK as to one point six
okay so instead of using one two one I
should be using one two may now right
and for this you have to input the
package let's do that now what will
change is we have to change the get a
theta as well so instead of saying good
laptop with a return the list of laptop
and here will mention these of laptop as
well okay now in app in shop setting the
laptop you have a say F dot get laptop
dot add you have to add this laptop
there right you have to add this into
additives so but if it changes what we
have done as in the student class we
have mentioned about one-to-many and we
have created the list of laptops not one
laptop you have these soft laptops and
in this app what you are doing is you
are saying get laptop which will give
you the added ease and then you can say
add I don't think we work it will run on
this code
okay you can see the Gordon error is
because it is not everybody to delete
the table okay this is important because
sometimes because of dependencies is not
able to delete that
the problem here is it is not able to
digit the laptops tables because our
student table because student table has
a primary key of laptop right so you
have to delete this part they first have
to visit the laptop officer visited
student here so that it will read a new
table and it is it cannot delete because
okay so we already got so you can see
regard the third table does it do it one
by one you know this is what you have to
do is anyway you create when you will
run you have to make sure that you did
it all the extra stuff so we'll so then
delete the table and let's drop drop and
drop much once let's go to a clip and
say is one this should not be an issue
now and you can see record the output
but the change here is if you see the
output you can see we got laptop table
that make sense you got swing table that
makes sense why do we have shown in
laptop because we cannot do mapping in
shooting table now because one student
will have multiple laptop you cannot do
that into into student that's why it has
created a mapping table that you have
mapping between student and a laptop and
that's where the name is student laptop
right
and if I say finished star there if I
say select star arm
Sybil's good let's say select star from
student laptop and if I say father's
query you can see the clear because rule
number one got lotsa 1 to the 1 and if I
say student table they don't know about
the laptop and if you subscribe sub
table they don't know about they stood
it right but that's awesome right so
that's how you are one-to-many work but
well now I think
laptops should know about difference as
well because if laptop knows about the
student and one laptop I mean one half
will belong to one so and only right so
if you can create this student reference
in laptop as student and for that of
course we need cadence better let's do
that with a right click close and we'll
select cater and setter but this time it
will be for students will click on ok
because I was trained there but this
student should know
mapping their doing suppose for one
student we have multiple laptops lies
when student we have student has
multiple laptop that's what is one too
many because one student will have much
of a laptop but in case of laptop it is
multiple lots of belong to one student
so we have to use many to many to one
now why am i - one is because multiple
our table will belong to one student so
with this the mapping will be done
inside laptop table we don't need extra
table to have that
okay but before running this thing again
the best thing is to drop all the table
so that you know it will not get any
girl running table students and will
that will drop laptop as well now if I
run this code okay so you can see it has
critic laptop laptop table that makes
sense because it has la villita as
student role imagine a feedback now this
laptop table knows about this student
this laptop belongs to watch students
right and then we got Flint which does
not know about the laptop because they
have a mapping table but when you when
you have this entry in the laptop table
why you need a mapping table against the
frames of them laptop think that he is
possible to map student think that he is
responsible to map we have to mention we
have to mention here H student you don't
have to map it because this will be
mapped by and then you have to mention
that it is mapped by this variable here
with the student so he don't have to do
it I will simply specify student so that
for this time your student class will
not map it but again before running this
I have to draw all the tables let's drop
this let's draw this one and let's plot
this one as well oh it is not able to
delete the student table because there
was a laptop table and let's tell it
that is it working now
oh it says unknown table near luck
students bathtub is it the table me and
watch what's wrong there let's run this
thing up once again and can see that
this time we are not getting on new
table it's because the mapping is done
by laptop so show us how do not have to
care about that right
so that's how we use mate one so that
meant one-to-many many-to-one there is a
spot let us say this laptop has list of
students here so we don't have one
student we have I mean we don't have one
string so multiple students will use
multiple laptops like you know let's say
if you have 10 laptop enough energy up
in a college lab a computer lab and then
any student can use any laptop right
that's fine too many too many right
let's import the package for this let's
say control shift oh and we'll say this
is such let's say new array list and
this time was mentioned student ok with
input the package for this as well so
where's the analogous right and then
interesting made what made to one we
have to say may too many raise the input
package for that as well and here we'll
return the list and while spending also
we have to set the list
not one swimbot list of students right
so that's done we have created this
laptop variant where mapping is done
with the student but here in app where
we change something the laptop should
know about the student as well how do we
do that we'll say laptop dot set such
student then we have to say set student
or not the essentially should we get
student get student dot add and you have
to mention student but that should be
done afterwards somewhere here because
once you have created the student Dino
sequence you can specify that by so now
student has added laptop and laptop is
adding student so we should work now you
see we have this of students we still
this talk laptop but if you make sure
that you like may to money and here also
you have to mention many time is not one
too many
unlikely fact if I not if I'm not
I think this mapped by nature London
let's import the package for this okay
what I'm doing is in list we are
mentioning many to many to one laptop
belong can belong to multiple students
and one showing you can have multiple
laptop before running this of course we
have to do that stuff let drop which
table anyway don't we don't have that
table laughs and let's drop these two
tables okay now if I say show tables you
can see we have only agent there is no
footprint of student and laptop let's
run this let's see what happens if I
miss code now you can see it works but
how many tables we have we have lots of
table that makes mention table have make
sense lot faster and also makes sense
but why we have slid laptop when mapping
is done by laptop
why shouldn't touch do that it's because
lots of things okay he's responsible to
map it shouldn't think that is
responsible to wrap it let specify the
student here you don't have to worry
about that this is done by the laptop so
why you are wrapping it so let's say
let's again do the same thing map by
student okay let's drop all the tables
because if I say show tables you can see
we've got four extra tables there let's
drop all the tables with the drop table
laptop under school student okay let's
drop this one let's drop this one let's
drop this one and all the clips are
dropped now if I on this thing okay and
you can see the number of tables they
got laptop regard student and they got
last option and now we don't have
anything called as student laptop and if
I go to my skewer just to see how many
screens regards let's remove let's say
this is laptop student
let's party pony for laptop we got
laptop and three five equally for
students we constituent and three and if
I say
laptop strange we got the mapping as
well again one laptop can have multiple
students and multiple are talking have
watch function that's of it well right
so that is one-to-one one-to-many
many-to-one and may too many so if you
have any queries let me know in the
comment section and that's it I hope you
