today's they're going to talk about get
in fact from a long time I'm planning to
make videos on gate and then I was
planning to make some you know
curriculum or the what you say a list of
topics which are we going to cover so
that you will understand what what is
gate and how to use get but I'm getting
stuck at the first point itself you know
how do I convince you that get is
powerful again everyone talks about
gates right if you join any company
doesn't matter which budget you're
working on people might use get there I
mean eighty percent of the project might
be using kit but then why is so famous
and then you know if you if you search
different videos on YouTube you will
find you know different reasons why you
should be using it and they all talk
about this thing the definition of gate
which is get is distributed version
control system heavy terms right and
when you look at this heavy term
somewhere sometime you know you your
mind gets switched off you know we don't
want to learn get it is so difficult but
in this video I will not show you what
is good and I will not show you I mean
all the features I want to show you one
thing
now gate is famous for collaboration now
many when you say collaboration what it
means it simply means if you have
multiple people working on the same
project if they want to contribute how
they will do it now one of the way in
fact when I was in my college I do I
remember we monkish and myself we were
working on a project and he used to do
his work and we used to upload those
projects I mean we used to upload our
files on some cloud server or be used to
mail each other the Java files which we
are working on and first whitter is not
something that you want to do right and
that's why we can use get here using
which you can collaborate now what are
what are things we need here so first of
all of you need a gate in your system
in fact what I'll be doing now in this
video is I'll be using Eclipse and it
steers okay so what you need is you need
a detailed account of course right now
git is basically a system and if you
want to use that system you can use
github which is one of the websites
which you can use and so you get account
again it's a free account don't worry so
you need a git
account in fact you need to Qatar
because because we are working in
collaboration right so what I'm going to
do is I will make a project on one
account and I will really try to
collaborate from the different account
now variables write a code so for that
you need a IDE right I'll be using
eclipse
now I'm imagining that I'm I'm I mean we
have two people here one is using
Eclipse and all the other machine we
have one more active but unfortunately I
cannot have two Eclipse es I am using an
STS again STM is also Eclipse like you
can you can actually work on two
different machine having to eclipse and
to guitar records as you can see I have
a one key tech bit of account here which
is when we're ready to zero and the
another one is on Firefox was not in
Firefox which is on Safari
and this is my various code training so
we have two different github account one
is newly created it I paid adjusted
itself and the other one this is bit old
and not that you know I'm not that into
github you can see I don't have multiple
commits here we have some more commits
here ok so what we will be doing first
so the first thing you need here is
Eclipse right now what I will be doing
is I'll be getting a project here a
simple project not a complex one and we
will try some cool now what I want is I
want the other person to also type some
food and to contribute it can be so many
ways right it can be some from us from
UK from India some others of the metal
we want heater or we want the code right
so let's get a project here so to get a
project OH
before that we have to confirm one more
thing now if you want to work with gate
with Eclipse again this is also optional
terminals you can download git bash or
you can download get a good system in
your in your machine especially if you
are using math you already have get
don't worry
otherwise if you have lineups you can
install a gate in Windows as well you
can install gate but if you're using
Eclipse you have an option of each gate
by default it will be that in your I
place but in case if you don't find so
if you go to perspective and if you
don't find gate make sure that you add
get in your in your Eclipse how do we do
that it's very simple just go to help
search for eclipse marketplace and here
you can search for eat it and when you
search for it make sure that you install
it in my machine already have that so I
don't have to worry about it example if
I search for or not edit I'm punching
for stop it stop it stop it not edit are
not searching for edit I'm searching for
a gig and you have to install this tool
egit and it will be there in your system
maybe by default so you can see in my
system it is already installed now what
I will do is I will simply create a
project ok ok it's a simple project
which I'm creating here so I will send
you and I want to create on normal Java
project not know that project as of now
let's change the pulpit you to Java and
let's create a Java project so we'll go
to others why to others let's lay new
Java project and I was in this project
and you can name this project anything
you want I will say my first project I
can you can name it anything you want
right as you know so I will click on
next I got this project let's click on
finish now this is your project right
and in this project what you want is you
want to type some file again it will be
doing that in some time or maybe let's
create a file I will say new class and I
will name this class as one oh and let's
keep that one out class in there is
combat telescope package I was like on
this main because I also need a main
method right and even you could okay so
we got a file here now what I want is I
want to upload this project on github
now if you're not sure what guitar-based
don't worry imagine I'm uploading this
project on Dropbox or any cloud server
so that someone else can download right
here you can send a link to someone and
they can download the project for you or
they will download the position they can
make some changes how do i deploy this
project on github it's quite simple what
you can do is push operation minimize
all this window or you can right click
on your project and say oh wait is that
so good a team and there's an option of
share project click on this now when you
share your project you can see it is
asking for they posit 3 so many things
whatever you do is I will say create a
new repository
ok click
see we have a git folder now in this you
have to create a local file now git is
actually a distributed version control
system again what is virtual mental
we'll talk about that in one of the
video but when you say distributed what
it means is you will have a copy on your
machine as well you will be having a
local copy and a remote copy so let's
have a local copy a copy of it will say
myfirstproject as the local folder and
click on finish oh but you've got a
local file this is not uploaded on on on
github if you can go to my Chrome and if
I go to the positi you can see we don't
terminate a positive it is called as
myfirstproject because we have not done
that yet how do we do that so you have
to go to your get get perspective and
here so where is that thing so I'm not
able to find the option whatever we do
is I will go back to my package say show
view pag an exploder ok so here we have
one more option I will right click here
and I will say team and you can see this
option off show in repositories view if
you click on this because of a local
file here we got that file but then how
do you connect this to a server so as
you can see this option of remote now
this remote will be helpful to connect
your project with the github so if I
click here and I will say create our new
remote oh it's that simple now git uses
this keyword which is origin let's not
talk about that time and let's ignore
that origin click on OK
now here you have to mention you you are
URL ok so what I'm going to do is I will
go back to my github oh we don't have a
repository here so first thing you could
do is let's clear the depository I will
say this repository as did my first
project and it's your choice to have a
readme file here or not let's not put it
at this time and this all value option
of making it drive it now public is free
if you go to private they will charge
you ok so let's not get into that let's
go to go go free version and click on
'pray deposit free
now once you click on that once you
create a deposit we know this is a black
deposit which is empty and it will also
give you a step in case if you are using
command line but we are not using
command line here so this is your URLs
it is very important at this at the end
you can see we have gate so let's copy
this and this is your URL vechio to
mention the next thing we have to
mention here is the user name and the
password so whatever username password
which you are used for gate you have to
enter that here I already done that for
my previous project so I'm getting that
option so click on finish okay
everything seems good now let's click on
save and push but there is nothing to
push there we got an error maybe you can
edit some data and let's see if you get
getting that I will go back here I don't
know I've just messed up something there
let's let me type some statement here a
let's say system dot out dot println and
I will say hello now let's try to push
this so once you have connected with
this let's say team and we got an
optional push heavy okay we got an
option of coming here and what are these
files we have to commit so let's select
all now this is unstaged and this is
staged a stacked or not staged stacked
now when you want to upload a variant of
course you have to make sure that
everything comes in the tag state and it
enter the message I will say my first
comment okay this is not the main this
is not the actual way of committing
messages but then this that is fine for
this video click on commit and push now
it will ask you in which branch now by
default it will be having a master
branch again we'll talk about branch in
one of the theory video time it let's
imagine we have only one branch and is
it derived repository yes click on next
it should work I hope it will work okay
it is saying okay it is saying confirm
following yes confirm click on finish
hopefully it will be done and you can
see that it is pushing on the server
this is something same like uploading a
project on updating some folder or
Dropbox white okay I got some initial
message here earlier but
you know that and let's go like to the
project or the repository which you have
created and I hope oh we got our project
here that's great and the mother says
first commit so we have uploaded our
project on github
now you might be thinking they're doing
lots of stuff don't worry once you do
this one time I mean when you do it for
the first time it will be very lengthy
process but then once you get addicted
to this this is awesome thing to work
with and you can see this is our source
code you can actually see your code code
on github and you see that with line
numbers awesome right now what I want is
I want someone to point recruit here
Oh before that be so contribution I want
to create one more file I will say I
want to create a new why I'm getting
project option right click say no what's
wrong with this oh we are into a long
perspect you can set perspective let's
go for a job perspective and right like
say oh and get up clouds well in this
class as maybe a calculator again I'm
going for a simple example because my
main idea here is not to teach you Java
my main idea is to teach you how to use
get up and I will say public in it or
public Inc there's an ADD method which
which takes two parameters int I comma
int J and it returns I plus J okay this
is my method and I want to push this one
as well now why are you way to push this
because if you can see in our package on
the github repository we have only one
file so whenever you make changes it's
better to commit on the server I will
take team and comment and okay so it
will show you some so we have to push
this file calculator dot Java and I will
give a commit message I will say
calculator class added click on commit
and push now it will push your file on
the server on the github server which is
a remote repository for us okay let's
pick one okay
and I hope if I defense this you will
get your calculator we got that it is
fit as a god of a calculator of Java if
I open that we cause our D go to our
code
now what I'm expecting is I want someone
to contribute to this project how do I
do that so whatever we do is let's go
back to our nest years now this this is
this is imagine this is some other
machine so if you have your friend who
is using a shears and then this first of
all if you want to make changes you have
to pull that project right now you can
actually pull a project but how do we
how do I do that so there are some steps
now the first step is now your friend so
your friend has to search for your
project so I will search for the project
on github so you have to go for your
different github account okay
now this this is the if I if I talk
about the crew this is now in twenty20
okay this is the this is the place where
I've created the repository now I'm
going to Safari when I have a different
account visitors core training please
let us go and I will search for move-in
ready and oh not contain anything or 720
so is that I mean nobody really / and
will mention the project name so
normally we share our project we
normally share the project link like you
can see this is the length which we will
actually share with your friend now what
your friend will do is now your friend
has to choice she can he or she can
clone the project or the best one would
be you can for the project now when I
click on Fork it will create a copy so
it which is a separate copy from your
project it is the exact copy okay but
then this is a separate entity whenever
you change in this project you will it
will not affect the positional project
it says this for this project which is
this repository which is my first
project which is a physical training
fault from Nova twenty20 my first
project and it will be having the same
content but then title doesn't mean if I
change something in divinity now it was
afflict here okay it will it will not
die because it's like and whatever you
change here will not reflect on my on my
on my repository so what do I do now is
I will go here and let's make some
changes from so voice so I'm get observe
is it possible which flight out I will
I will click on edit and you can see we
got the option of editing this file and
the font size is very left right how do
I increase the font size here do we have
option I think so let me just do it okay
so I will enter a comment here I will
say calc class that's it either the
comment here and the moment queue change
you make any changes I will say comment
added and will say commit changes now
whatever change you have done is only
for your depository on your repository
because if I go back to my domain ready
and if i refresh you can see changes are
not reflected here with the calc class
2-z safari with is intersecting the
second account now let's make some
pudding changes right when you type up
we talk about coding we actually make
changes in STS so I or maybe in any
other IDE how do I pull this project oh
that's right word right so let's pull
that project here so I will say import
and you will you can see we have an
option of get here I will say project
from gate next I will say clone you are
I next okay it says yes a lot okay now
so where do you clone this project so
I'm going this project from I from here
so we have to mention the you are L how
do I get are you are not URL you are I
okay I can take it from here
at the end you just have to mention dot
gate that is important alright okay this
is your project so I will say copy and
I'll space it here at the end you have
to make sure that you add dodge gate now
you have to enter your username and
password so for periscope training I
have Telescope training at the rate
gmail.com
the password is star star star star star
star okay now click on next
now it will pull the project from your
repository click on next and it says it
is already there because I am working
with the same machine that's why it is
giving up caustic but if you have
different versions it will not give you
conflict
and let me just rename the file to my
project my first project 1 click on next
and it will say import existing Oh what
is that
ok next and finish nothing to select
here click on finish and you will get
your project here now this is the same
project which is they don't github right
if I go up open this if I open
calculator can you see that we also got
the comment now this is last year's the
second second machine okay now let's
make some changes
the first change I will make here as I
will say if the font is visible I will
say public ain't sub and here I would
say int I comma n TJ and let me add some
extra features right this is what the
peach I want which I want to add so
someone is contributing to my project or
they can they can use it for themselves
okay in fact you can do this you can
have your github account just from the
repository and you can download the copy
of it now I will just make one more
change in run on as well and at the end
I will say bye bye bye okay so I made
two changes in both the files and you
can see this is a arrow here okay so
which means you have not committed this
file yet okay so once you have made the
changes okay I want this to be reflected
on making on my github you can do commit
as well so you can right click here so I
will say right leg team and say commit
mmm okay so I will zoom it what this
files I went to commit but this files
and the message would be updated count
and run off commit post normally we
should write the entire description
right what is happening but then this is
fine and you can see this getting pushed
on the slower side I hope it will be
done now click on OK and if I go back to
my Safari if i refresh this page you can
see the file is updated in 1515 seconds
ago updated calc andronowich's the cut
which is the message we have send my if
I go back to my first project and okay
so if I open this calculator oh we got
these feature
but this is in this second github
account right but I wanted this to the I
wanted someone to contribute to my
server to my machine to my project right
because if I go back to my chrome and if
i refresh if i refresh you can see there
is no update here if i still open
calculate a record only one method
someone has done the work but it is not
with me now how do I merge it is it
possible
let's try so let's go back to the second
guitar account can you see watch the
options we have option of new pull
request
now what this particular says is it says
who was the order of that project which
is in this case no means Reggie is the
owner you can send an equation I will do
the chain of already I have added I have
contributed some more methods or some
more features to your project when you
merge that features with your project ok
let's try a let me how to do that so we
click on new pull request from here and
I will click on create pose a question
this pull request as updated project
with with calculator
ok and we can add our we can add some
more comment here what are the changes
you have done and click on create pull
request ok and you can see it is going
for a post request and there is no
conflict okay so it says there is no
point ignore me what happens you know
when you are working in a group and if
someone has edited the file you have to
set and you have to do that you have to
merge those changes so I get get sighs
hey don't worry I can do most of the
merging here now you are happy and you
can say ok the thing is done there was
no conflict I guess merging is done oh
you've done I guess it is updated now ok
I have sent a request from here right if
I go back to my Chrome and if i refresh
hopefully it will be a it will be there
oh it's still not there what is
happening we have done because we have
sent a request right combined you we
have only sent a
request we have not accepted the request
yet so if you go to your additional
repository so basically this is your
first get of repository and if I can use
that option you pull request if you
click on this there is an option this is
a request from some my guessing that
this is a request form that is called
training and if I click on here there is
an option of merge pull request this is
you simply have to say much and you have
to confirm the merge and your merging is
done how do I know that let's go back to
code in fact I got one more meal now
that you have but you're done with the
merging and if I open this project if I
open the package if I open calculator
can you see that in our first repository
we got the updated file so someone else
has contributed to my project and let me
tell you one more time you if you're
watching this for the first time it you
might spin it find it difficult but
don't worry once you start working it I
mean once you start working on github
what I would recommend is try the same
step which I have done here and trust me
you will understand how exactly
everything works but then okay we have
not completed the project yet because if
I open my Eclipse if I see this
calculator the changes are still not
here because it if there is no my github
servers like how do I fetch those
changes here on my machine on my Eclipse
oh that's a tricky part now so what you
can do is you can just go to go back to
your okay you can right click here and
say team give me a repository view this
is your project now how do you merge
this project so do we have an option of
merging so it is done now so the totem
was you have to write so you have to
open your remote tracking so if you can
see branches and the more tracking you
have to right-click and you have to say
much so when I click on merge it is
working now and if I open runner can you
see that the changes which someone else
has contributed is reflecting on your
project now this is one of the awesome
thing you can do in your project so
let's see if you have cows
people working now they can all work on
their own copy and they can contribute
this is called as collaboration now who
came up with this concept so there was a
person who is very famous colours - tall
wood or is a star volt as you know that
Venus is open so anyone can anyone can
contribute there are millions of people
or thousands of people you can say they
are pointing to Linux kernel and this is
how they do it
ok so it's nothing it is very important
for you so I hope you enjoyed this
session you got to know something we
were able to merge the project I mean we
were able to collaborate using github
and if you liked it click on the like
button so thank you so much for watching
