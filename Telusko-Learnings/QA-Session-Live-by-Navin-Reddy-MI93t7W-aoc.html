will see the chat window here i'm
streaming from my macbook ok
ok finally started yes and I don't know
what initially went to spread through
the first session it was with my phone
and now it is not working I don't know
why now i'm streaming with my macbook
camera maybe i had to buy this software
I'm using a trial version of bad ass off
a name this is what cast go for mobiles
and they're asking me to pay for the
full version no ok so I multiple right
or just give me ok so let's answer the
first question from roof and who says I
am CSE student but not much good in
programming so yep where is the question
so I want to know what are the fields
like testing or analyst ok so you're not
good with programming that's ok right I
t is not about programming right there
are lots of lots of thing I t in fact in
India especially we have a market of
tech support right so you can you can
work as a tech support person you can be
a tester even I feel for testing also
you need some understanding of
programming because what you will test
of course software right so i will i
will ask you even if your programming is
bad but do some you know learn something
about programming you cannot say that I
hate programming its you don't have any
option you should know the basics of
programming at least you know how Luke
works because let's say even if you are
testing the software and while testing
or software you should know that where
is the problem right and you'd
understand the problem only if you know
oh this one I'll take my
yeah so you will know only when you know
duh it just
yeah goodbye shot working here we just
wait I'm just checking you from
screaming yes okay so you should know
the basics of programming and that's
enough if you know the basics that
enough to go for any field you can be a
tester you can be okay but you're not
able to work on open so that's okay you
can be a tester you can be you can get
into tech support you can go for a data
analyst so there are lots of field you
can go for in fact you can be a DBA so
you know about SQL so if you're you can
you can go for DBA if you know SQL you
can go for and then I stopped lot of
stuff you can be a business you can work
with business development so you can be
a business business development execute
you so that is bede yeah they are not
such thing in fact i will suggest go for
any big company like you can go forward
like we can go for TCS you can go for
Infosys and they have lots of department
other than programming so get into that
get into him that company and they will
give you something which you may like or
you may don't like if you like it good
skirt if I don't like then work for six
months on that project and then you can
change your project you can ask your
managers to do that I know that I can
help you for that so there are lots of
fields available it's not programming is
not the only way to you know to be in 2i
t this is the stander over rated field
the programming field there lots of
stuff if you see if you like programming
and then they are doing then you're
doing something else then that song if
you hate if you don't like programming
then let there are lots of options to do
from you can go for okay so you can also
go
data you know I hope you have heard
about had you / admin stuff so you can
be a Hadoop admin even if you don't
don't know programming you can be a noob
admin there so you can work with big
data and although stuff yeah those
that's so i hope i have answered your
question true ok now the next question
is from british apple is greater than
microsoft what here what's your thought
ah ok ok but the thing is yes Microsoft
see Apple is basically a hardware based
company you know so they make apple they
make macbook their hardware based
company right and then they spot for
their own hardware they have their own
OS wide example for macbook we have mac
OS for apple we have iOS we have ipad
also we have iOS they have it own OS and
and further all OS they have their own
programming language like example for
mac OS we can use here for my course for
iOS we can use initially it was the
object you see now we can use swept in
fact we can also use C sharp which is a
microsoft programming language to make
iOS apps that's a hybrid type of apps
you can say but I feel when Apple makes
something they make sure it is perfect I
mean you know that they believe in
detail you know they did thing about
each and every stuff example when they
make a phone then when they make a
machine they make sure that it is no
problem in that I mean no problem if you
have used CD which is the the voice of
Apple so you can see can talk about
anything you want in fact uh yeah of
course when you when you have something
good they will charge you of course
money is the matter there so if you talk
about it companies like yeah if we talk
about the city so it's it's awesome
right you can talk about anything with
Siri
right let me show you i don't know if
you do i hope it will not do any port
for me so we can talk about anything
with cities or a city hey city i'm going
for lunch ok but is not there come
on don't do today i can help you find
restaurants if you turn on location
services like a relocation services
settings screen to see romantic tation
yeah so now next uh city let's go for
lunch that's what I reckoned Oh city
let's go for lunch I can help you find
restaurants if you turn on location
services uh city Who am I I don't know
who you are you can tell me that Siri
settings tap on my info and then choose
yourself from your contact can you see
that it's it's damn perfect what about
Cortana so if you know about Microsoft
Cortana i'm not against microsoft is
just you know last last month when
Windows 10 was launched in india not
last one it was i guess it wasn't jan
jan or web yeah I somewhere some at that
point I went for a microsoft event which
was in Mumbai for the windows launch and
then they were they were talking about
this court in now it has lots of
features and when they were trying to
work on cortina it was not walking in
fact when they were talking about open a
file it was doing something else so I'm
not saying it is bad it's just this not
that perfect because Microsoft don't
believe in power friction Apple believes
in perfection writer than say one thing
but what about Emma software so you know
one of the best software to edit a
document to to create an excel file MS
office is best no one can beat MSX in
fact not even google docs right so
Microsoft is not that bad okay microsoft
works so when you talk about MS office
they have one of the best software but
it when it comes to programming you know
they for
this universities to to follow their or
the to teach their programming language
example initially in fact five to six
years back when I was in my college in
fact eight years back when I was in my
college so they used to force the in the
syllabus that we had dotnet we had in
fact a spc sha we had everything but we
were not having the open source
technology right it because the
university follows Microsoft because
Microsoft forces them to use it right so
yeah that's that's the thing with
Microsoft so they're not making things
perfect and then they are forcing people
to use it and it is a closed platform so
I am NOT a big see when it comes to the
technology part i am with apple okay
when it comes to programming i believe
it is in open source example I'm using
Apple machine okay which is perfect and
in this Apple machine I work on open
source off for example i use i do
android development i do jogador
government which is open source right so
i'm not bound it to anything right and
even if Apple follows this closed
environment so Swift is open source now
right infra actor so Apple is also
giving that programming language open
source what about Microsoft they are not
doing that right so does it has a thing
bacchus it is not perfect right but so
you can when i say i hate microsoft
taste like just it's my opinion I don't
want you people to high create Microsoft
you should you should do what you love
right if you if you logged on it go for
it don't listen to me I'm not I'm not
bigger than bill gates of course so okay
so next question is from okay that
answers your question British and let me
add one more point with that for
Microsoft when in year two thousand of
these the CEO was Bill Gates and then
well built well Wendell gets caught down
from the CEO post we had a new CEO who
was a stew Ballmer I don't know afters
to palma the company was going down down
down because they were not doing any
newest innovation thing and no no no
more innovation thinking about Google
think about Apple think about all these
big companies they have changed a lot in
fact from being a normal company now
there somewhere what about Microsoft get
into industry i know they were here now
they are here what about google they
were here now they are somewhere else
you cannot even find ways google is
thinking about Facebook thinking about
all the companies they are going
somewhere right but I don't think Mike's
Microsoft is doing doing something who
will take a I'm in David they will go
ahead with that okay oh and let me know
if you do if you are finding any glitch
or like something okay so i'm not sure
if you are pressing any lag there okay
next year's next question is from a
multi which is i have two years of
experience in java can i change my
technology to salesforce of course you
can do that salesforce have their own
cloud software's they have there are
lots of stuff with them so you can make
a cloud-based apps using salesforce oh
there are companies who want a cloud
software the den don't they don't create
those office they will ask salesforce to
give you those cloud solutions so i
think you can go to you can go to
salesforce its all depend upon your
interest if you love web development
take two stores or learn spring MVC
otherwise if you want to change it to
serious force if you want to earn a lot
because this was is what is money now
you can go for that you can change it to
Salesforce there is no harm in that it's
just you I think you have to do a course
of Salesforce you have to get certified
by then I'm not sure about that but I
think that you need to certified by
sales force okay
okay so so this is creating some issues
much let me just check if it is
is it lagging bit
dragon great okay so i think it is
lagging a bit but i guess we can adjust
with that for today for this session
okay no no mobile streaming was much
better I guess but the problem is you
know I use this software I use this
software knife is visible for you so I
use this software which is why cast so
when i refresh it I was getting an
option of training tips mind having
ready so if I click on this streaming
starts for this session which is Q a
live in this I'm not getting that lag
here I'm not eating that option here so
that station okay so next question is
from again drama which is sales this is
for developer had good opportunities yes
they have lots of opportunities so yeah
you can go for salesforce do some
research on that on salesforce you can
you can use in factor I will suggest
there is an app called as Cora okay so
you can use skoura in which you can ask
about some questions about sales force
people who have already done Salesforce
because I have not seen any any seals
for stuff yet so I can't come in much on
that okay next question ok Jetta is it
to your internet connection or your is
it problem for my side
okay so yeah so we have a question from
to automation ah stottah mesh okay so
hello sir my question is I love
programming as well as teaching i am
quite joint in english too but my
problem is I'm not very confident in
talking in front of people over Gotham
ish I was searching for some people like
you you are the future of India come on
yet we want people who love programming
that we want people who are good at
English and we want people who are bit
confident to teach the only problem with
you is you are not that confident with
talking with front of people that's okay
this is something you can work on right
if you if you are you know is the only
thing is you should love teaching you
can you can work hard and you can
increase the confidence let me give you
some tips how to do that I'm assuming
that you are a student now okay let me
show you a student now or I mean what's
your background so that i can give you
some tips on depend upon that bleeding
base will come come to your question
don't worry just just wait for some time
let me finish the above questions ok so
the tundish is a student ok so what you
can do prefer the mesh is now since in
your college you can give seminars
initially you will find it bit difficult
to go on the stage and talk talk in
front of people whatever suggest
initially take a simple topic doesn't
matter what you take example this is my
first live session in fact before this
it was my first time stations of what I
did I took a very simple topic right I
have not gone for any qsh soil for the
first life right I've been there
teaching training tips is because I find
it easy just to get the confidence all
do easy stuff go on stage talk about
some easy thing of course you will be
nervous but make sure that is it thong
thing for you is big difficult for other
people because when you talk about that
easy thing to your to your audience they
will find it amazing and then you will
get some confidence do it on regular
basis when I want it why when I was in
my be a CIT when I was doing about
bachelors at that time I was even I was
not having that that much of confidence
so what I did is I used to give lots of
presentations a lots of seminars in fact
I hope my friends will would be watching
this and they know about this I used to
give presentations and uh I used to give
lots of presentations a money if no one
like to listen to me I should talk to my
teacher so I used to say I want to
present something so I used to give
seminars every week I used to
participate in lots of competitions in
my colleges so that's where I got
confidence itÃ­s to take sessions for my
juniors also so I so when I wasn't by a
second year BSC idea it exists for
first-year be a society when I was in my
TYB scid I was thick I should take
session for sy be a CIT when I was in my
MSC I should take a session for BSE
people right so give lots of seminars
didn't give lots of presentations you
will get the or you will get the
confidence and you will get some idea of
how to handle people right so that's
good you are good with programming
you're good with English that's two of
the important things when you want to
talk about teachers so work on your
confidence ok you can connect me
personally if you won't help to be a
good teacher you can you know you can
get into my office someday I hope you
live in Mumbai so I will you know
pinging me personally I will send you my
address you can you know come to my
office i will give you some tips live
here ok i want people like you so i'm
ready to help you petha mesh ok next is
from
okay so next question is from jitendra
what are the thoughts on learning
algorithms we are learning programming
but what about things such as algorithm
operating system compared designing
whatever to your views andres a very
good question jatinder you know there
are companies like help in india we
believe programming is more important
than other thing and that's not true the
most important part is programming okay
have I skipped any questions here let me
check I don't think so I'm just
answering question about jeetendra
prashanth I guess you're the question is
after this yeah but I spy with this
because this is my first life station I
don't know where the questions are going
so I will ask and I will try to answer
all the questions don't worry so now
what about algorithms the thing is the
most important part of software
development is algorithm not programming
because you need to understand what your
client needs and how can you provide a
better solution right example we have to
chat application in India we have hiked
we have whatsapp light we use both which
is better of course what's at right
because somewhere they are solving your
problem very efficiently either solving
your problem you know anyway in very
nice way so I feel programming is not
that important compared to algorithm so
as the student first you should learn
algorithms you should know about a data
structures that bubble sort quicksort
and how stack works how heap works you
should understand those stuff example
when I teach Java I talk about heap
memory i talk about stack memory the
problem is they don't know what is
definitely they don't know what is taken
away they don't know how to work with
tag memory so it is difficult to learn
programming if you don't know they are
called ups so I will say the difference
between a good programmer and a
programmer is one knows about algorithms
other the other one doesn't know about
algorithms right
same with the operating system of course
when you build a software when you will
just software you you know your software
will work on some type of oil so you
should know the basic understanding of
OS well when I say basic I'm talking
about how OS works what are different
features for the different services in
OS example when you talk about Java we
have our topic polish threads and inside
threads we talk about deadlock we talk
about weight we talk about notify if you
know OS properly you will understand
this topic in you know in one go but if
you don't know how was it is very
difficult to understand what is this
different topics in threads and all the
stuff so if you want to be a good
programmer if you want to be a good
developer you need to also learn about
algorithms you should also know learn
about operating system so if you are
spending five hours on or let maybe
suppose 8oz on programming spend four
hours and all this topic and then photos
on programming to be a good programmer
you should also know about compare
design thing because you should know how
compiler works maybe it's not that
important to be a programmer but you
should know you should know about all
the stuff not just this you should also
know you should also learn about nick
parking because there are a lot of
applications now if you talk about cloud
software and all the stuff they use they
use networking a lot lloyd and then the
solution for you if you're asking a
question just before you push before
your question just write a quotient qu e
as tion in capital so that it will be
easy for me to search right so let me
check it from here itself so i have next
question is
from the prashant gupta now it is so
what is more profitable building app in
android or iOS because when i see app
store in IRS I see most of games have
paid they charge but Android has more
users which platform is better for money
it's all about money right person ok let
me tell you my my my experience and
there's the thing is if you compare the
number of devices let's let's start with
this if you compare the software in
Android we have lots of free software's
in iOS we don't have that much of the
software's compared to android compared
to android right so annoyed we have lots
of free software's in iOS we don't have
much free software but the thing is we
talk about this free softwares you know
infinity software we have ads even even
in iOS we can put ads the difference is
iOS is normally used by not it is not
used much in India you compared to
android phones everyone will have
android phone right even if you have an
iphone you will have an android phone
mobile for example in with me i have two
phones i'm using iphone for daily use
and also use note 2 for backup phone
right so even if you are using iOS you
might be using android phone with you so
if you're making an app for android you
are getting a large larger audience
right so if you are getting a large
audience so you can make an appt and if
you have a huge database of users the
advantages you will be getting lots of
AD views ad clicks so you might be
adding a lot from them but if we talk
about iOS we don't have much users but
everybody add so let's say if you click
on add on Android you will get ten cents
but if you are the same user clicks on
iOS add you will get maybe one dollar so
10 ads equal to one add in iOS so 10 ads
in Android equals 21 add in iOS so in
case of ADD sector you can earn from
both the things but if you make apps for
iOS the advantages you can
make it paid off and trust me people who
use iphone they believe in buying us off
right android people then they don't buy
software hardly you know 0.2% people
they might be buying software's on
android market but others in fact I have
not bought I have not bought any
software from app store yet or not even
play store okay we don't believe in
buying software side does that's the
problem right so what you can do is make
an iOS app to earn okay if your only
concern is money I will I will prefer to
go with iOS the only thing is it is
difficult to learn Swift programming
especially in India because not everyone
uses macbook and to make iOS app you
need to use a mac OS because in my quest
you can run xcode work with iOS to work
with Swift programming you require Xcode
software and to install xcode you
require mac OS to work with mac OS you
require macbook right so those are the
dependencies so if you can invest now go
for iOS because in india we don't have
much is dollar per there's a huge demand
now so i will suggest go for iOS if you
love iOS and if you want to earn
otherwise i'm sticking to android
because i love android okay i hope thats
answer your question prashant next is
sales force is a company who provide
cloud services so example if you are if
you have a company and you want the
cloud solutions you can go for
salesforce ok so it's cheap not that
firstly ok so next question
is from a blair blaze okay so your
question is where I can practice Java a
very good question where can I back his
job on your machine of course so if you
have a good machine what you can do is
again install JDK you can install
eclipse and you can like this job up
quotes there so you can watch my videos
on YouTube you can type those we can
type those codes inside your eclipse and
you can practice that's one way the
another way is there are lots of online
tools you can you can type your code
there and you can practice but I feel if
you have if you are learning designing
like web designing HTML CSS you can do
it online but for java you should have
an offline set up doing java programming
online will not make sense right because
I in Java we have a concept of threads
we have a concept of file handling and
doing all those stuff on server will not
make sense right so i will suggest have
an offline set up on your machine
install then install jdk first which is
java development kit install trick
install then what install eclipse
install you can install netbeans you can
install all those softwares and practice
you know and you can go to my website
for in fact it could go to my website
mrs calm there are lots of this done
which is called a school so you can just
copy those codes you can paste it on
your machine and you can run it so that
you will you know we can just get the
output and you will understand the
basics of that Bonilla ok so that's
where you can practice your codes ok
next question is from what is the
effective way to prepare for java
interview so it is mother to barge to
say what is the effective way for people
in java in toys for six years experience
candidate in two months of time oh
that's weird you already have a six
years of experience in java come on both
watch you you know lots of stuff you
know you know about it so if you have
experience of 6e
does that means you know about I don't
know which domain you walked on I hope
you have six years of experience in Java
assuming that you might be knowing about
kochava concepts you might be knowing
about ok Blaize your name is your mind
so yeah your himanshu is Sony right I
have checked your channel ok yeah so I'm
talking about wealth was so if you have
experience of six years what you can do
is in your six years you have learned
about lots of stuff we have worked on
lots of stuff the first post of example
especially the coach r becomes is what
happens is when you start walking in a
company and you start working on big
project you sometime you forgot all
those stuff which is threads and all the
stops so i will suggest week you know
refer is the concept about threads and
all the stuff next if you have worked on
any framework specially if you walked on
spring framework or hibernate maybe some
new technology you need to make sure
that you are preparing for those
frameworks only it's not just you should
know about the concept you have worked
on you should also know about a concept
you have not worked on example if you
have worked on spring MVC you should
also know about spring web flow you
should also know about spring security
so having experience of six years in
Java its means you know a lot of lot of
stuff so i don't i'm not sure which
which technology you worked on java so
if it is spring you should know about
everything about spring ok ok let me
just check one more question of bird
watch ok so otherwise
with experience in development
developing MVC based application in
javis technologies better to switch okay
if you have what do you have experience
of developing an embassy sorry for that
I will suggest to go for okay mmm yeah
its all depend upon your interest if you
if you want to work on big data of
course you can go for Hadoop but if you
let's say you you still love web
development I will suggest learn
angularjs it's awesome so yeah it's very
awesome you can learn angularjs you can
learn node.js and you can work on that
also maybe you can you can implement
this security stuff in web-based
applications I will suggest work on
spring MVC right which is a new of the
teamwork of MVC so you can use that also
yeah so that's where was your questions
okay next is from British doing doing
MBS better than mca because in one often
accession Yucel MD is it are you yo yo
yo watch lots of my videos British okay
okay so okay so yeah so mca III think
I'm CS better than MBA if you are if you
want to be on technical so let's say you
want to go for if you want to be a
programmer of course you can go for you
can go for NC but it's a you know there
are some people they don't like
programming that they are not that
technical they want to go into
management of course you can go for mba
in terms of money of course mba in terms
of passion it's all depend upon your
interest so let's say if you're
interested in technology of course you
can coerce you to go for MCA but if you
go into man if you want to be a manager
if you want to go be an HR or the
financial advisor all the stuff we can
go for mba okay a in factor even if
after doing mba there are some people
who are jobless is because it's not just
you are doing mba it's also about you
should know what you are doing it all
right if you are doing mba you should
you should have that personality of mb
it if you are doing mca should do it
better right you should because you're
doing masters course the master computer
application you should know about type
of thing so doesn't matter what you do
it's all depend upon your interest and
how well you are doing it okay with ish
so next question is for
Shivan hi sir what is the future of game
development in India should I go as I'm
about to graduate in BCA we have a very
good future of gaming in fact uh we are
now we are changing the way we used to
play games now you know early of use to
play games using joystick let's go for
this first generation you know when I
was a kid when I was 10 years or 20
years old my father bought me a not a
PlayStation but you know a game device
which in Vinci can play on TV so I used
to connect my game console on the TV a
nice to play mario i used to play load
not load flash i used to play mario and
all those game rights the small small
games then try and changed then we used
to play games on mobile phone so used to
play space impact we used to play a
snake game on the black and white phones
of Nokia right and then after some years
we got we got xbox wide we used to play
a game on xbox so the gaming field is
changing a lot right it is changing a
lot so what you can do is you can start
with and then now we have as Facebook
virtual gaming which is oculus rift it's
not just Facebook there are lots of
companies they are going forward the but
reality games no need of joystick in
fact if you have gone to any mall now
recently any chrome a store or reliance
digital store on all those stores
electronic stores what you can see is it
they know there are people that taking
something in their hand and they're
playing physical games right so they
have a big screen so that's the sensors
so from the joystick we have sensors
gaming where you have to move and now we
have virtual reality gaming right so i
will suggest now if you want to be a
programmer start with virtual reality
stop you know it's
awesome so how did suggest go to Google
search for oculus rift let me type this
thing in the chat window it is oculis
left okay so i can check in the chat
window i have typed it in the treatment
of eateries oculus rift okay Oh lots of
Miss lots of questions where am I yeah
so you can go for oculus rift you can
also go in fact our sony now they are
coming with their own virtual reality
game so it suggests learn about that and
if you can learn that stop in one year
trust me shivam you will be one of the
earliest person to do game development
in Virtual Reality in India okay next
question is yeah so let me conclude this
Shiva answer go for game development it
has a very bright future provided you
know you have interest in that okay
don't just do it because everyone is
doing it if you have an interest go for
it it is awesome virtual reality will be
coming India in next two years by the
time just learning about it and go for
it okay so next question is from akshay
hello sir good afternoon can you give
some tips for students who are beginners
for sleep for C++ programming okay so
what you can do is for Sita
arming that's important right so once
you know the basics of c programming you
can go for c++ before c plus Persian
know what is object-oriented programming
concepts right so first you can go for
oops concept teach what is oops because
the whole finder of learning C++ is
understanding oops concept right because
the programming concept you have already
learned in ok let me just let me check
my trimming just trimming yeah so just
keep clear down here huh so it was I was
talking about so the basic idea of
flattening C++ is just to know how oops
works so you should know how objects how
to create an object what is the what is
the idea behind object what is the idea
behind polymorphism what is the idea
behind encapsulation all those stuff so
first teach time oops concept and
brittle zoosk oops concept teach them
the c++ syntax right and first you have
to motivate them that using C++ you can
make games right the basic game
development is done with the help of C++
right so motivate your students that if
you learn C++ and now you can develop
games and then you can start with the
oops concept ok do CCNA is good for
networking yes it is very good for
networking so let's say if you want to
get into a networking feel I will
suggest go to Cisco certification so CC
CCNA cisco certified network associate
if i'm not wrong you can go for that
exam okay so get certified in yet
working which is very awesome if you are
interested in it working then only ah
next is spaced on
okay question answer I love programming
I thought of taking comp science college
okay you are not even in calm what you
are doing himanshu currently depend upon
that you can talk about do okay so
concerned I open can I do a sandwich so
pressure on says he has a laptop which
is Lynn oh boy and he cannot afford a
machine to make iOS development what you
can do prashanth is in fact we be tried
at this stuff in our laptop so I went
off my intern what he did is in he even
he has a lenovo machine so what he did
he has installed ubuntu not you and
talking about a Mook yeah so what he had
done is he has installed ubuntu on
ubuntu is installed virtual machine and
on virtual machine has installed mac OS
okay and the thing is it works but it is
not that efficient you know you will
find lots of lag and let's say if you
are getting any error of course when you
develop something you will get a delight
well then you will be confused there is
coming because of the virtual machine or
Ray's coming because of the decoder so I
will suggest i know it is buying a
macbook is costlier of course but what i
will suggest buy a second-hand macbook
we don't do don't have to buy a new
macbook in fact in my office i have a
macbook which is new but I have another
night book for my interns which is oiled
machine so i bought it for 18,000 okay a
secondhand machine right so you can just
invest 18,000 learn iOS i know it's the
investment but to learn something very
good think about iOS you are learning
iOS right of course I should know so
doing investment of 18,000 is not a big
issue I think you know people spend
20,000 30,000 for learning of course why
not spend on automatic book
okay next question is from rahul CCNA
plus red hat certification plus echoes
of certification are good jobs oriented
courses yes they are good job oriented
sessions so very when you complete your
mcse you can you can call yourself a
system engineer for Microsoft so there
are job job opening for microsoft
certified people example you know every
company needs people who can manage
network right you can manage machines
you can manage servers for them they
need a certified people so you can
complete your graduation in any of the
ite field and then go for the
certifications in fact panel you can do
that finally you can certified industry
in this exams once you're satisfied of
course if you are good at it you will
get a job don't worry in fact if you are
certifying this thing from a well-known
Institute like oh no well not interested
you they will make sure that you will
get a job Shiva Java is the future I
cannot say otherwise the future because
Java is the present right because Java
was there Java is there and Java will be
there Java is you know on the top of the
ranking from last 10 years 15 years so
it will be there for a longer time right
so I cannot say Java is future java was
there Java is the in Java will be there
so is Robin not is just not just the
future okay but John will be in demand
for a long time okay so
next is firm pressure on the Java feline
third or PHP freelancer if you want to
be a freelancer of course PHP and of
course PHP because there are lots of
demand for PHP there's less demand
compared to so if you talk about Java we
don't have much demand for java compared
to PHP because when you talk about
realizing it all going by web developer
and bike and using PHP you can make fast
web sites in a very very quick web sites
you can make a website in one week but
not that's not the case with Java right
in fact uh with java costing increases
with PHP we don't have much cost right
hosting is not that costly in PHP and
then you know others suggest for feline
saying go for PhD but the thing is if
you are building something with PHP you
will not get lots of money with that but
Java will give you lots of money so its
all depend upon it see it's not depend
upon money sometimes pressure on this
all depend upon your interest if you
love Java be a freelancer you will get
some projects if you want if you learn
PHP go for that check what you want but
if you talk about money its PHP of
course there are lots of projects
available now if you are going for
android development then of course Java
you don't have choice there ok only 10
people 20 people are watching is it 20
or 10 because ok that's nice i got 5
likes 0 count is going down now 6likes
oh i got six likes that's good ok next
question should i go for game
development or what I'm home how much
time I'm streaming now how do you take
the time I guess it is more than 30 40
minutes that's awesome
okay okay let me just go for 10 15 more
minutes and then we can end up for today
I don't want to spend whole day doing
stations Isis under here I want to enjoy
my day okay should I go for game
development or should I go for software
development or chemung does not the sea
then it's all develop an interest first
but the thing is we have lots of
software developers available by we
don't have game developers if you have
interest in game development go for it
boy you know that's the thing you know
we need game developers ride in India
I'm not talking about bad game
developers I'm talking about good game
developers it should be very good with
that the view was a difference between
kochava and advanced java see the name
kojiro advanced java it is it is
developed by india we don't have such
thing called AZ koja advantage of other
thing is we have a terms like j2se and
j2ee so j2se is java to standard edition
and j2 is java to enterprise edition so
let's say when you work with this
concept of loops oops our threads
collection file handling it comes under
j2se which is co java what if we talk
about web programming java programming
if you talk about enterprise programming
if we talk about frameworks those things
comes on the j2ee which is advanced java
soco java is day 2 SC advanced java j2ee
so when you're learning about concepts
like threats you it comes in a cojer if
we talk about a program it from so
advanced java next we have from Rama
Murthy you have something to say ok next
how to apply for a job in companies the
good question this question ok how to
apply for the job with a company you
have to apply online you can go to the
official website submit your resume
there ok if you have any vacancies they
will call you otherwise you can go for
off-campus introduce so now just have a
sync with facebook there lots of pages
on facebook they post about the
vacancies they post about off camp off
campus on all the staff or even you can
also go you know go to go to Google
search for companies who make a software
and get the immunity of the company and
mail your resume a you know there is a
one-person chance that you will get
interview call okay otherwise you can go
for placement type of program programs
and you can do all the stuff okay next
question from so we are we are going for
the next three questions so Raja say is
how to place and how to place an
accompanying fresher again your company
as a fresher okay you know how to place
in a company I know Java and C sharp
also means or that stats but if you know
main stack frame work it is very good
you know what you can do is search for a
company who walk on this frame works
okay you know Google is the best tool go
to Google search for the companies who
okay what you're talking about my
company is it okay let me just check
your question once again o.o talking
about my company unfortunately I don't
have a company I have office is just a
small office sorry for that oh ok I
don't have a big company booty I just
have a small office I don't have any
employees I have interns okay and so in
fact this I will be closing this office
in two months because I have some other
work okay but don't worry i will be
doing streaming even if i'm busy with
some other work okay I guess I'm
some questions here okay so this is this
question from yeah so Raja what you can
do is is it good to go for web
development site for web development i
will suggest the current trend is no J's
okay which is in boom now you can also
go for Python you can also go forward
ruby on rails but i will prefer if you
are doing something new go for node.js
now it is very trendy now I will suggest
learn Python go for node.js and check
which one you love okay if you i will
suggest you few diff you love both if
you want if you ask me to choose one i
will say no Dodgers a pretty shiny
vacancy in your company sir I would love
to work under us Oh mmm now again I'm
not I don't have any vacancies here
unfortunately I am interested in
programming so it is question from amman
shoe I thought of taking BSC come to
signs I won't you learn about new
technologies because I can program
myself please advise so I'm as I'm
assuming that you have just completed
your 12 so what you can do is you can go
you can join BSC calm signs you know get
be a graduate learn about programming
create lots of projects is not just
after graduation only you can make
projects while doing graduation you can
do projects build your projects and you
can go for that if you love programming
go ahead a Manchu there's not there's
nothing will stop you
about earning through YouTube okay so
question from akshay can I can you tell
me something about earning through
YouTube okay oh it's very easy to learn
to earn from YouTube is very easy you
can earn approximately one rupee our day
okay the thing is so you know if if you
want to be a youtuber then don't think
about money so I have not started a
channel to earn money is just uh if
you're getting money than mine why not
the thing is to earn money from YouTube
what you can do is you can just you know
show not yeah so what you can do is a
creator youtube channel upload videos
create quality content so that people
will search your content on Google on
YouTube and make sure people are
watching you and once you got some
amount of subscribers maybe thousand
subscribers you can apply for Adsense
adsense is you know it's a paid google
pays you with the help of Adsense you
can create an account on Adsense in fact
I will create indicating a video on that
but there's to answer your question you
can just create a count on ad sense
which is from google and then you can
link this to you can link your adsense
and youtube and once you cross one
hundred dollars but once you start
connecting adsense we r cube they will
put ads on your videos and when people
clicks on your ads when people watch
your and you will earn from that okay
don't go for illegal clicks before
because if you click illegally on those
ads you will get blocked right and so
that's how you earn okay so
let's go for one last question okay last
question from Humpty Dumpty yeah that's
a good name but I'm not able to create
application oh it's very easy to create
an application by your own what you can
do is if you're not programming create
your own concept which you want to work
with so greater one concept okay let's
say you want to build your own app for
gaming or all the stuff you learn in
concept and start making application
initially we will find it difficult also
learn about software engineering skill
set how to take the requirement how to
analyze the requirement how to create
design how to code your design and how
to test it so its programming is not
just typing it is all extra things so
learn about software engineering stuff
which is all the all the software
engineering stuff and then you can you
know you can build application so it
initially it will find it difficult but
it's not that difficult data so one more
question from first work so I am to
confuse if I should go for Android or
iOS if you are confused then go for
Android that's the answer okay if you
have confused go for Android if you if
you are sure you want to go for iOS then
only go for iOS because going for iOS
takes lots of resources it will take
resources like time it will take
resources like money because you have to
buy a macbook and the problem is we
don't have much resources for iOS to
learn for Android we have lots of books
we have lots of tutorials on YouTube but
for iOS we don't have much of that ok so
if you are sure you want to go for iOS
then only go for iOS okay so okay so
just let me
like I I left blaze question you told
about github what is that how can I get
projects the please make video yeah
we'll do that i will create a video for
github how to use git and all the stuff
in coming weeks a tool
I'm told to lot off my friends about
this channel don't know what they're
doing okay what was your question Raja
you know there are lots of questions or
he has a fresher I told you I just go to
Google search for the companies who
implement bean stack who uses mean stack
and go to their contact and be good to
see every website every company have
their own courier so when you go to our
website they will be having a career tab
so click on that career tab to first
check if that company is working with
means type and if they are working with
new stuff click on their career tab
upload your resume at there if they like
your resume and they will call you
that's the only way you can get into
that company otherwise you can go for
the off campus but the problem is with
off campus they will they are not they
will not give you they will not give you
your the technology you want they will
give you technology they want okay
otherwise apply it going to their
particular website I think that's it for
today guys do we have one more question
