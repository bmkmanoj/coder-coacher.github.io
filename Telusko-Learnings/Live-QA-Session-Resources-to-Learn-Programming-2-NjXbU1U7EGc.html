finally I'm getting good health
ok so now next question is from okay so
let me just repeat the question from
Ireland the question is from where to
start in the playlist you can what you
can do is you can go to my my channel
which is the disco learnings there you
will go to playlist page and the
playlist page we have you will get a
playlist college art tutorials for
beginners okay and then you will find
the complete least i guess i have
approximately 171 videos and one of the
videos already getting uploaded it is
completed 982 percent is completed and
the video name is exception handling
okay so yeah so it would it must be 172
videos in my playlist so where to start
let me share let me just share this sure
the link with you where I will get the
link in fact I guess if you if you can
just search for go to youtube and search
for Java tutorials for big nose the
second link is mine I am not sure if it
is for you I get those I get that for
second link we can do that right so I
guess nine people are watching let me
know in the chat window watch is what's
your ranking you're getting there
okay so next question is from oh I was
supposed to share the link right and you
should so here's 173 videos that's
awesome Oh for long kiddies foot that's
bad that's very bad so I just shared the
link with you people also in the link
session you can in the comment section
not in the comment section the chat
window you can see we have a link for my
playlist okay yeah so okay that's for
onon the next question is from
engineered gasm this I guess doesn't
matter so I'm a regular follower I want
to know about any book for java there
are lots of books for java in fact in my
and lots of my videos I have talked
about this you can go for complete
reference the Java complete office I
don't know if I have that book here I
guess it is in my shelf no cities in my
shelf no that's okay so you can refer to
a java book the complete reference from
oracle okay it is now published by
oracle you can refer to a traditional
nitration that will do ya next book you
can refer is head first java but the
problem is the the content which is
there in head first java is very old now
they are still going for java 5 and when
we are having java 8 now okay so if i
will suggest go fight for the go for the
complete reference okay watch my video
and think of reference okay yes
yeah I get the first the first one is
the curl is the ad right so the few
search for Java tutorials on a big nurse
the first is the add the second base
from I guess the person I forgot his
name yeah programming knowledge and the
third one is mine it's all because of
you people because of you supported me
I'm getting that drunk okay next next
question is from obvious saying by the
way of a thank you so much because I
have seen your comments in my videos
you're helping people thanks so much for
that I was supposed to thank that itself
in the comment section on that video but
i forgot to mention that so i'm
mentioning here thank you so much for
that okay i hope you will help other
people also with that a primer I don't
know this job Lima fish okay next
question ivide i'm watching your
tutorials also in the book so just is
really good oh you like that book of it
that's good but i will also just use
that complete reference book because
that is also good one you can for that
okay better they still if you are still
watching this video this this is a like
button there just with the video you can
just like it there so that i will know
that you are liking this type of videos
okay so yeah so those are your questions
let me just answer some questions from
my from my earlier videos so people have
actually commented some questions didn't
just take up those questions there
okay so there's a questions from a bee
boo ready I have I three and four gb of
ram but still not getting the emulator
this question is for Android the problem
is within Android it consumes lots of
bandwidth you know I mean a very very
big not bandwidth but it will consume
lots of your damn ok it should have been
getting it done second yeah so when you
when you when you open android studio it
will take lots of your ram so I
approximately 1 GB goes into Android
studio and then when you open the
emulator that's a very difficult task if
you open the emulator you have to set up
everything after that also some time it
doesn't work because your time is not
sufficient maybe you're you know there's
some problem with the emulator so what I
will suggest if you have a very low
configuration machine when I say low
convocation nowadays is I three those
low configure machine right I five is
minimum now because if any different of
work with any development tool may be
eclipsed service tomcat server glassfish
server netbeans android studio you need
I five machine with at least eight gb
ram because we are going you know day by
day software is getting updated and we
are not updating the hardware so anyone
if anyone is flying to buy a new laptop
make sure use at least I five don't go
for I three machines now because they're
outdated for programming ok either but
it is not accepting it then go for I
three ok better than that if you have a
good budget go for I five so if you
don't have a good laptop and if you
still want to run the emulator for
android use your phone ok because your
phone will be having an option ok you
should see connection with that option
in the phone emulator option
developers more okay developers option
debugging
okay it should be with sightings oh it's
been a long time i'm not using android
phone died so i forgot these settings
thinking anyway so when you go for the
settings i don't know if it's clear to
you the problem is i am using different
camera okay so you can see everything is
reversed they're still try so that's the
last option and here you can see a
developer's gives that there is a post
option click here and okay i know you
are getting into the reverse order you
can actually use your meter okay user
mirrors to watch this video perfectly
okay oh and there's option of Isis
option this is this option of USB
debugging so I you can actually open
take your android phone and check this
okay there's option of debug click there
and connect this phone to your android
you to your laptop open the android
studio run it automatically it will show
you the you know the emulator your
mobile phone becomes your emulator now
okay so that's the thing you can do okay
oh gosh it should be it should have been
first so I'm getting it yeah time being
um if you search for Java tutorials and
getting I am coming on the second thing
that's okay and working on my co part to
get on the first page it's all depend
upon the number of number of watched I
guess it's depend upon the number of
tags i'm using zipping up on the text
captions it depends on the watch time so
the more you watch my videos it will
increase the ranking so i am trying to
try to make good video so that you will
watch it ok ok so let me just pick up
the next question
yeah by the way just the I just wanted
to make an announcement from this monday
the coming monday which is I guess 20 of
the date for Monday 23rd so from 23rd I
am starting the online sessions okay
this will not be free sessions of course
because when i make for youtube videos
it is broadcasted but if you want to
learn from I mean in a group of people
they can actually learn from one learn
from me so I'm going for the online
session soon which is on Monday it will
be it will be done using just just
follow
yeah so there was a guest in my office
anyway so I was talking about it well
where was I forgot the point I was
talking about a online session so you
can actually go to youtube and what a
talking about no not dirty tube so we
can go for online sessions so from
monday we are studying the online
sessions it will be around seven a.m.
IST which is interest in indian standard
time so if you are from us I know what
time it will be for you so it will be
seven a.m. IST ok it will be done using
teamviewer so i'll be using TV where i
will be showing you the meeting ID so
that you can learn there so if you are
interested you can actually go to my
website that is called annex there will
be a registration tab sit down ok so
soon in one are you will be getting the
registration link on my website so go to
tennis court calm and this is a show
option is I straight the coast content
is given their timing is given their
fees is not yet yet yet fixed that will
be that I will be conferring confirm you
once the I guess by tomorrow i will
confirm that so that's it next will next
four let's go for next question
okay where do I find the next question
ok ok ok
you know I get lots of questions for
android wait technical questions lots of
questions here okay so yeah there's one
more thing i have uploaded a poor kid
the estimated fees i'm still trying to
find out how many you know they know all
depend up in the number of people who
will be joining the course because the
problem is the last month i just started
the offline course i know in mic in my I
have my Institute not exactly my
Institute but I booked a class in
bhandup area in Mumbai so when I started
with that classes I got lots of requests
from people because they were they were
not able to they were not in some people
are not from embed some people are not
from India itself it's a there are some
people from you guys they want to learn
using online sessions so I thought about
it and I'm starting with that Sophie's
is not yet fixed I don't know how much
to charge for that it's all depend up on
the number of people joining ok so let's
let's let's see how many people are
interested so if you are interested go
to the website register yourself I will
let you know the fee structure by
tomorrow so maybe by tomorrow evening I
will tell you the fee structure
okay so okay the next question
yeah so there's a question from Nick do
I uploaded a video I mean besma app on
app store so my app is there on App
Store okay you can actually go to you
can actually go to play store it's there
so go to place to search for the disco
and this is how my apps look like so
when you open the app when you when you
download the app open it so this is how
it looks again you can see a middle
image there okay and if you can just
click on the view codes you can actually
okay so if you can click on Java if I'm
not I'm not able to see my friend camera
I can see everything reverse there and
if you want to know about the code of
something just click here I don't know
which what I clicked this is
multithreading right so you can actually
see the code here right for referring if
you if you are confused with the
playlist you know there are lots of
people they go to youtube that confuse
their confused with the playlist because
the videos are not in sequence so what
you can do is you can actually go to my
app there's option of watch video and if
you go here there is an option of Java
and this is hold on it's coming it's
loading so this is the complete playlist
you can just watch one by one one by one
okay so you can do that so the app is
already there in the Play Store there's
one more thing you can actually give
tests after every session if you learn
if you are learning java if you know
test yourself just go to start test you
have to log in first you have to
register for this so you have to
register for this once you register you
can actually give the test okay so yeah
polka this is reverse order because i'm
using the front camera I don't like fun
cameras with the problem is when you do
to live streaming in my app in the in
this app so i'm using a wild cast go for
this for this web casting here and it
shows me the hell okay so i can see a
health signal there it is green now but
before I know 15 minutes ago it was
giving me red symbol there which was the
videos not streaming so that's why I'm
using the front camera and as
is getting reverse but you can actually
download the app so to see everything
okay okay next question is from I have a
question about object state and behavior
but sometimes we create object just as a
remote control just for reference like
scanner input no we never we see
whenever you create an object every
object will have some methods it will
have some data right so when you say
object state it is data and when you
talk about methods it is behavior right
so every class will have data all
methods there might be some classes
there will not be in there they don't
they will not be having data they will
not be having methods if you're talking
about a scanner class if you say scanner
input equal to new scanner so that input
is a reference ok and the new scan is
the object so if I forgot your question
right objects have state and behavior
but sometimes we create object just as
remote control now if you're saying
scanner input input is the reference ok
and the new scanner is the object so we
whenever you want to use a class you
have to create an object ok there's a
book called as so pretentious there's a
good there's a book called as
programming with java primer not about
heard about that primer what's it's all
about I know I don't have any idea what
playin MA
okay so sudeep says I'm your regular
follower that's great I am bi developer
and the owner of YouTube channel okay
you have your own channel will you guide
me to some tips that I will follow to
improve my channel okay hold on busy ok
so now so yeah okay so you have your own
channel that's good to improve your
channel I don't know about the content
you take what type of content you cover
so but the quality of the video should
be good because if you if you see my you
know the old videos of 2014 13 if you
watch those videos they are pathetic you
know the voice quality I'm shout I'm
literally shouting in those videos you
know because a camera was very far in
fact i was using my mobile phone to
record my video so it was very far i
should i should think that if I shout
generally it will it will record my
audio so it's just shout but now i have
have been proved myself I'm not shouting
you can see I'm not shouting here so
make sure when you make a video you have
a good video quality and you've got a
good audio quality that's the main thing
for any video and especially content
right so i'm not sure that of course you
would be making good content right but
make sure the quality of your video is
also good so when i'm doing live
streaming quality doesn't matter because
live streaming matters even if i'm doing
HD video in live streaming it should
stream properly if you are if you're
providing HD video are not stripping
property that's that's very bad thing
right but if you are doing a video which
is recorded make sure you're uploading a
HD video because nowadays people will
see your videos on mobile phone that's
okay if you even if you have a lower
resolution video but if now we have
Android TVs right we have smart TVs of
people will be watching you on TV and TV
will be having a bigger screen so you
don't want your viewers to watch you
with a very bad pixelh8 videos right so
make sure your point your quality is
good I would also suggest upload your
video once in a week so that your
subscribers will stick to you okay
because people subscribe to our channel
the forward about you so make sure you
upload good content up
no content every week because people are
waiting for you if they like you right
so that that's how you can improve your
channel so next is from again okay I'm
itõs Jane I'm watching you from
Bangladesh oh that's awesome I got lots
of you know subscribers from Bangladesh
Pakistan that's awesome you know being
Indian Indian people watch me that's
good but people watching outside India
that's a great achievement right so
that's good maybe if i visit bangladesh
i will meet you I mythos for sure okay
so we have so deep I've worked on maybe
I tools and I'm in planning goes all
time I need to know is it worth
investing my time on that planning on
developing videos how much can expect
boom okay talking about money if you
want to earn money from YouTube see
don't create a youtube channel for
hardening okay v on I mean I on from
YouTube but not that much that it was
that yes don't you know you you cannot
expect lots of money from YouTube it's
just if you are creating a media content
example if you are making a dance video
if you are making any artful video and a
dancing singing then you can expect lots
of money but tutorials don't earn much
the reason is the lots of people don't
watch tutorial videos because people who
are interested only they will watch
there are people who are using adblocks
right so you know they got an extension
in the chrome which is adblock people
use that and every time you use adblock
I am losing some amount of money okay
because when you watch my videos there
are ads and when you click on the adds I
will get some I will get paid from
google right so I'm not saying click
that ad but I'm just saying don't use
adblock okay so people are using adblock
that's why we don't earn so don't don't
think about earning from YouTube I am
doing YouTube videos because i love it i
love to interact with people
I like I love to share my knowledge I
think should be I know I should think
about anything from different plays
example I'm doing corporate training so
that's how I earn I'm doing I'm making
my so i am taking online session that's
how I earned right so if you want to
earn from YouTube don't go for videos I
mean don't think about YouTube videos
but yes you can on so investing means if
you love it then invest okay maybe if
you if you get famous then you can earn
more than you can expect okay but maybe
people don't like like your video they
will not watch and you will not earn so
if you are investing huge amount of
money just to just to get it back don't
do that and that investment now what you
can do is start with low videos don't
invest much you have a phone you have a
microphone you will be having up your
mobile phone microphone right so you can
use that you can use a mobile phone make
a video and upload it on YouTube check
the response of the people if they like
your content they will come back to you
go for the Adsense you will start
earning and step by step when you earn
invested example I'm invested in my
iphone Ian I'm invested in my this
microphone so i earn in one year and i
invest in my in my phone right so that's
how it works ok next question is from
phuket any tutorials on graphics canvas
in java book it i was thinking about
that when I was in my when I started
with my java to do this for the first
time i was thinking about i will make
animation videos on java but the thing
is no one uses that right why why you
will create animation video using java
when you have animation software right
so what you can do is if you want to
know how to do animation I have my see
tutorials on animation you can just go
to my channel search for graphics in see
also have done animation videos using c
programming you can do that but java
java I don't have any video on that ok
so solo following you since a long time
tell us a little more about yourself
your background why you started
okay that's a good question why I
started everything in fact i'm thinking
that i will make a video when you say
the videography about myself Who am I
why what I'm doing but it will be a it
will be for sure a one odd video okay
Who am I because I talk a lot about
myself and whatever you say to do style
people and anyway so something about
myself my name is Devon droidy I'm a
corporate trainer I have a youtube
channel from last three years I have to
China's basically I have my own I have a
channel with my own name and have a
channel with telesco lettings I feel
that having channel with your own name
doesn't make that good so I've charted
the new channel with telus cod nicknames
name aside from YouTube I do training
for different companies I might weigh
now I was a trainer like a Texan sure
I'm a freelancer trainer so have taken
batches Isaac accenture polaris in july
i'm starting with JP Morgan yeah so so I
provide all I provide cleaning there so
an extension pelaez I was award winner
for JPMorgan I did I will be what I will
be a software engineer Trina well that's
that's awesome right so that's about me
I have my own office so the video
recording here is my own office so
around this camera I have my android
developers just sitting behind this
camera I have my eyes I I was developer
sitting near door and then the other
cabin I have my web development or web
developers that's about me so yeah the
question why I started making videos is
because whatever i learned throughout my
career is from YouTube okay so when I
wasn't my be a CIT so I wanted to learn
java the thing is Java is very difficult
to learn right so I thought about
joining a class but the fees was very
high it was approximately 25,000 rupees
for a course right so I have not joined
it so from where to learn so i went to
youtube
search for different tutorials and i
learned java programming from youtube ok
so that's why i thought when you are
getting something from youtube why don't
you just contribute it so i started
contributing on youtube and then i got
famous not that famous but there are
lots of subscribers i got approximately
sixteen thousand subscribers now that's
about me ok next so I'm there for five
minutes I for more five minutes ok so so
pull with you know some tricks for the
señor dash just send me those links i
know i will do some tricks for my
channel for my website ok what happened
what additional things would be in your
paid course as you already uploaded
varies the thing is see there are there
are people they want to ask questions if
you watch my videos you know that's a
good question what were we different the
content will be almost same the
difference would be i will be live with
you I can answer your questions ok we
can go in a self-paced go because in
videos in online videos I cannot cover
everything so that's why I'm going for
paid course I don't want it to go for
paid course but people are asking for
that so that's why I'm going for that I
don't know what more I will calling that
but I will make sure that i will call
each and every topic in the Pecos
ok so next quest from letting base if
you open your facebook Messenger have
send your questions Oh what's your name
the Blazer blazing Blair himanshu is
that you've
okay yeah I was yeah sure i will try to
answer your questions himanshu okay
which java book will you help me for
android development okay i would suggest
there's a book called as java for any
developers okay so i don't know i have
not referred that book but we have a
book named for this java developers for
android so if when Toby an Android
developer start with that book you will
learn Java there but i would suggest
learn java in a separate late lunch
android separately why to mix both so
learnt used computer friends learn java
and then you can strike the short with
android there is no issue with that okay
so yeah man sure i will try to answer
your question i'm making a nap i'm
facing problem with my am has many
activities so there's any way to
different in that case you can create
two projects I mean first of all
separate different modules so they cause
a question from himasha is his making a
project in which he has lots of
activities which is difficult to manage
all those activities so what you can do
is you can create a first of all I
divide your project into different
modules and try to implement one module
in one project second module second
project make it work individually and at
the end you can actually connect them so
just copy paste that's how you it will
work yeah so that's how it should do so
I guess that's it oh there's one more
question from I guess the question is
from himanshu I remember your comment on
YouTube himanshu why I suggest and what
was the comment from your side himanshu
something about authors right imagine if
you are listening to this is it about
authors why I don't like indian authors
why I prefer to use foreign authors
being an Indian you should promote India
okay let me just answer that question if
i'm not wrong it was your question
how to make an button which should be an
image so we have an image button there
so we have an Android developer just
waiting behind this camera okay so we
can use you want to see you into coming
to camera no so yeah so we can use image
buttons i just got a prom from there so
it is imagebutton soon are you making
video on that how to use image image
button right we can make me yeah are we
making a video on that image button how
to use image how do you use a mate how
to make it fun yeah something I will
make a video on that Java XML parsing oh
I forward to make that video I've made a
video on XML I made a video in Java but
not in java and xml together i will do
that for sure yeah so let me answer your
question you man show the thing is i
like indian authors ok i like in your
authors but the problem is if you're
saying that there are youtubers on
youtube example you Boston you have
talked about New bosna I'm sure right so
new bottom is New Boston videos you
don't understand that's why you watch my
videos because you understand my videos
the thing is if you if you talk about
Indians we are very very very talented
writer any every person every Indian
they're very talented white even it with
teachers because all over the world
Indian teachers are respected in fact I
got some messages on youtube and
facebook from from my us subscribers
they like Indian teachers not Indian bit
but asian teachers anyone from Pakistan
India Bangladesh Sri Lanka they like
Indian trainers what about Indian
authors the thing is there is nothing
wrong with indian authors there is wrong
with the indian publication house okay
the thing is if we talk about java book
oracle is sponsoring java book right
they are publishing it so when oracle
published something they will make sure
that each and every concept is correct
okay so they are making sure that
everything is good and thus they are
investing lots of money to make that one
book because they know they will be
earning from all over the world wide so
because they will be selling that book
all over the world and that's why they
make perfect book what about Indian
vacations so even if I want to be an
author as now enjoy d I want to be an
author I have to write a book right so I
have to set up price for that book if I
make a great book if i spend my two
years making a book and if i want to
publish it publisher will take huge
amount of money with them okay so they
will try to take huge amount of money
since they want to make a business in
India they will try to make that they
will try to set the low price for it and
since the book price will be low they
will try to you know publish it as soon
as possible without checking the
mistakes and all the stuff so that's why
if you refer Indian books there are lots
of errors in those books okay and as
Indian author we get some pressure from
the publisher that you have to publish
this book in one year or in two weeks so
we don't get much time so that's the
problem with indian authors book i'm not
saying that bad it's just in that video
i was referring that we should refer to
foreign authors compared to indian
authors okay if Indian author is
publishing a book without any publisher
example you can let's say if I'm writing
a book I can directly upload that book
on this Web this website which is Amazon
but as a publisher and if you if you are
reading that book that will be awesome
but if it's going through the publisher
then there's a problem so there's
nothing wrong with the authors it is
something wrong with the publishers it
is same like a Bollywood movies and
Hollywood movies they invest lots of
money in Hollywood they're earning it
bollywood we are just earning they are
not investing actual Indians are
something by
yeah exactly so that's the answer
Samantha I hope you liked it so I by the
way our time is already up there is one
last question from a or we'd how do you
pronounce are we is it are we saying
that's why difficult name as we're away
yeah so so this is this year I'm going
to be college I want to take computer
science so is it important to be a good
good college to be a pataga see call
this doesn't matter okay in which
college ago doesn't matter you're so
your program is not even up on your
college okay even if you have great
teachers if you don't have interest you
will not if you will not learn
programming and if you have interest if
you have bad teachers that's okay you
can learn it for yourself so don't
depend upon college doesn't matter which
college you join you can learn
programming by yourself the only thing
is if you join a good college you will
get good buddies with you good friends
because you are the average of five
people around you if you get into
college a good college if people are
smart they're automatically you will
become smart okay so that's why go to a
good college if you want to get good
buddies but don't go to college good
college just to get programming
knowledge you can learn it from anywhere
after 12 you can go for BSC IT you can
go for BSC BCA you can go for BSC comp
signs you can go for B II you can go for
anywhere you go to anywhere program you
can learn programming for anywhere don't
think that College will teach you
programming who is tech therapy what's
your name tech therapy because your
youtube name is tech therapy is it harsh
I'm not sure because i am getting lots
of messages on youtube on facebook from
harsh anyway so that's it that's the
question last question from himanshu i
use images from google in my hundred
project i would suggest don't use images
from google i guess we have free images
are all available right
icons google icons so you know you can
find the official google icons that is
for free but don't do but don't use
other people's images on in your app ok
so it is harsh so the same unser
applicable to you hush akash when you
are going to upload all the design
pattern videos akash i am very bad with
the consistency i start with something
and I go somewhere else so I've uploaded
the basics basics of design patterns did
the design pattern which is very famous
fact I mean factory what adapters I've
done that I will try to I will try to
make more videos on design patterns
let's just let it down somewhere ok I
wanted to try to do that I takacs start
with Java a last question ok ok ok I'm
just running the session in two minutes
before BP before leaving the session
just click on the like button there ok
so that i will know that you have to
like this video if you have not
subscribed the channel do subscribe it
and share this what do you think with
your friends ok because sixteen thousand
subscribers not enough light I want more
some more subscribers to get more
motivated ok so cal then i will suggest
you to go with java the thing is python
is very easy if you learn any other
language learn java tell only and then
start with python if you go with python
that it is very difficult to come back
to come back to java because if you're
comfortable with python you cannot learn
any other language then mbc sure i will
do that

and every playlist okay give me some
time I will soon have you uploading all
those videos so that's it that's it I am
