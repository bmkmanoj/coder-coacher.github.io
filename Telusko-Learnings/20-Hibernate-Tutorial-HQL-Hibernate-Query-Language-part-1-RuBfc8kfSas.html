from fiscal earnings and in this video
we'll talk about how to use
hql in hibernate now if you are
wondering about can we use SQL yes we
can
so we can use SQL and we can use SQL in
hibernate in fact we have seen that in
theory right we have talked about why do
we need hql so let's see how to
implement that in this in this project
so if you can see we have this project
here right we have this app dot Java
class then we have student class and
then we have this hibernate
configuration so I made some changes
here again I have changed my database
flow MySQL to pause glass and then I'm
also changed the student class see
instead of having the laptop object we
have removed that we have say we are
simply saying roll number name and marks
right
and let me just go to I mean I'm just
using some simple class here no arian
all the stuff let's go with simple thing
roll number name and marks so what I
want to do now is I want to save this
project into database I want to save the
data in a database so for that first of
all to use hql what I will do is I will
insert some values into database okay I
will be using some random class to
insert the values so first of all I will
use a for loop here will say insert I I
the value of I would be one and then
let's go to let's say 50 values and then
we say I plus plus that's weird
I plus plus and then here allocate
object top student I will say student s
equal to new student okay and now
whatever I do is I will set the values I
would say s dot first thing I will set
is set roll number we'll set the roll
number as I itself so as your value
increases you have you can get is the
value and then you can say this is s dot
set name I will say name and plus I so
that it will print name 1 M 2 and M 3
and then we'll say s dot set marks now I
want the mark should be random
for that I will use a random class
that's a concept of kochava gain so we
simply say random are equal to new
random okay and then we'll say what will
import the package for that
control-shift Oh your package is
imported and here we'll say instead of
maths we'll say our dot next int I will
specify the value of the max value it
should be hundred because max should not
be more than hundred right that's that's
great and then we simply say session dot
save and we save that object so it
should work right so if i underscore
there should be 50 entries in the table
let's run this and you can see there is
no error and we got 50 entries there can
you see that insert statement 50 times
let's verify let's go to a post grace
and let's rephrase this thing and you
can see we got our we got all this thing
it's because I have added this stuff
here I don't want that stuff okay let
show on this once again okay now let's
refresh and okay doesn't matter I just
that the main focus here is on student
25 if I say view data and all the rules
that's how your post this works and you
can see we got this table here with 50
entries whatever I do now is I want to
fetch these values so I want to fetch
let's say I want to fetch the massive
person with rule number seven okay I
want I want this one
okay how can you do that before that
what you can do is we can print all the
values so let's go with all the values
so for that let me remove this stuff
because the the thing is done and I will
change this from auto I mean this this
will make it update so that I don't want
a new table every time right so now
let's fire the query now how do you file
a quite it's very simple simply create
an object of query so that's a query
interface which you have in persistence
okay not in position but we'll use
hibernate so let's say control space and
we'll say hibernate and we'll say Q
equal to now how do you get a query
we'll set session dot create query so
that's how you create a query inside
this you have to specify the query now
again we are not using SQL here we are
using hql so when you say you want all
we can simply say from and you have to
mention the entity name which is student
so we say student and that's it you got
this query but hold on how do you fetch
a value now because this just this is
just a query right so to fetch the value
we can simply say Q dot list so that's
the method we have to use to face the
value so we say cute list and we'll save
this value because Q dot list will give
you least value you can see it gives you
a list so let's go back to app and let's
say give me at least there so I will say
list and we'll specify what type of
student object we want I want off I want
these top students and I will say this
is students that's we're ok students so
you can see we got a list here of course
we aren't taking put the package there
let's import the package which is Java
dot util ok package import done and you
got the least now it's C it's so simple
we are simply saying from student it is
not giving you the result set which used
to get in injera BC right and you know
trust me everyone no one likes result
set ok it is just the way because it was
there so we were not having an issue but
now instead of fetching the results that
we are getting a list of values and it
is very easy to work with latest right
so we can use an enhanced for loop here
and we can say student s :
students now once you've got list we can
use an house for notifies the value
let's print all the values let's say
print s and that's that's it if I run
this code ok you can see we got all the
data here you got roll number you got
name and you also get any marks right so
let's go to student and yes we will
record all those things right so that's
how you can use from student to far the
query but well done let's I don't want
all students I want specific student
let's say I want student who scored more
than 50 we can use where clause as well
again this student is not a table name
okay this is not table and this is the
entity name you can specify the where
clause and you can say where those
number or not roll number but marks is
greater than 50 it's that simple if you
know SQL this is very easy
and if I have this query you can see
will be getting only those records those
people who are getting marks more than
50 you can see all the records here so
regard people who got mass let more than
50 right let's say if you if you are
getting a specific value let's say I'm
not getting a list I will say marks
equal to on the low number roll number
equal to seven I want I know that it
will give you only one result in that
case instead of saying list what you can
do is we know that it will return only
student object not the least I will say
student student and here instead of
saying list you can say Q dot there's a
method called as unique result because
unique result will give you only the
unique result oh it is giving you atom
it says you have to typecast it because
it will give you the object you have to
typecast it with with student and done
and instead of instead of using for loop
we can simply print the value of
shouldn't write and that's it we can
also use where Clause here can you see
that record the data with is with with
rule number seven with name seven and
forty-nine okay again you can verify
that in your table as well right so
that's how you can you can use hql query
here can be used some more queries yes
we can we can say we can create tables
we can use join tables we can use what
else we can use your okay we can also
specify the columns okay if you don't
want the entire table you know you can
specify the columns you can say select
star from student you can also specify
the nectar from student run this query
and okay now in this case whatever do is
o star doesn't work let's use something
else let's specify all the values or all
the columns will say roll number or name
and marks now this will not work the
problem is okay so what what is that
just happening here the problem is what
is not working is when you specify the
columns it is not sure that you are
getting the actual object okay so what
it says is instead of using the instead
of getting a student object what you
will get is you will get Li stop
stirring it we will get an array of
strings okay
again how to solve this that we'll see
in the next video but in this video just
remember we can use hql queries in next
video we'll talk about how to solve this
issue okay what else we can do here in
this yeah we'll talk about that in the
next video
so that's it thank you so much for
watching and do subscribe to once the
outer soil is tall so thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
