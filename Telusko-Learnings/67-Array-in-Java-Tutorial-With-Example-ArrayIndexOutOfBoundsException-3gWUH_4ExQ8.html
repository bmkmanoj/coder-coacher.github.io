assign values to an array how to use and
M plus and how to use enhanced for-loop
now what we will do here is we'll try to
check what are the type of others we can
get here so you can see in the last part
I tried to fetch the value which is 25th
element right validation of writing 24
here what if I write 50 or 52
now since the added size is 50 right and
we are trying to fetch the value which
is of 50 third element so I fired on
this you can see there is an atom now
this error or less the exception this is
a day index out of bounds exception okay
so this is the in bill exception in Java
this is type of unchecked exception so
if you don't know what is what is
exception you can check out my playlist
on exception handling so this is array
index audubon exceptions so white is out
of bound is because the size of your
array is 50 and we are trying to fetch
the element which is 52 so what way to
do is we can simply a check here and you
are painting those are that error there
so what we can do is we can say try and
catch so that we can print a exception
with our own words so we can say a
systems order println and we can say
maximum index is 49 to specify it as 52
or 50 wittle' useful foot 49 we cannot
use 52 so it will play maximum index is
49 so if I run this code now so instead
of printing the arrow it's printing all
the values and for that line it is
printing 49 and that's that's the
advantage of using exception handling
okay anyone you can also use your array
index out of bounds exception so instead
of using direct exception you can use
our index Autobot exception e so that
you can specify this particular
so this this exception here is unchecked
so whenever you work with array it
generates unchecked exceptions so we
have to handle we have to use something
else try and catch to handle it clear so
this is what this is how you have to
work with the single dimension arrange
so in the next part we'll talk about
two-dimensional array so thank you so
much for watching and do subscribe for
the further videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
