in fact the before going for a string
comparison I wanted to show you if as if
as well just to verify if everything is
working here so what I'm going to do is
if now one is greater than num2 i will
return num1 is else if we also compared
if else is a okay so if num2 is I mean
num 1 is less than num2 in this scenario
I will return num2 and then we also need
a s condition here right so we'll say
else and it is important in expression
as you can see in expression if I don't
mention else part you are getting an
error because of course right because if
you are using expression it says if must
have both mean and s branch a so it
simply says that you should have else
when you are using expression so videos
expression I've written zeroes in case
if both are same will return 0 like so
we can also use as a in Cortland now
once you have done with this let's go
for string comparison so what we do is
we create another variables now we will
go for Val Val not Val we're and then we
say STR 1 and then it is of type string
now it's a string value is let's say
naveen we will go for one more string
here which is a CR 2 colon string and
again we'll have a string which is
Naveen now as we know that both are same
right now we need a third variable where
I will set or we will simply use if else
he or nothing else so what we do is I
would say if if svr 1 now how do you
compare to strain oh if you are coming
from Java background you know that to
compare to string we use dot equals
right so we say dot equals now in this
dot equals you can pass STR 2 so that
means when you compare two objects as
two string objects we can use dot equals
method if both are same will print same
else will range not same right that
makes sense because we are comparing
this to so if they are same of course
will bring same if they are not saying
well plane not same let's run this code
let's see if it is working or not
okay and you can see we got the output
as same here because of course wise both
are Naveen but in case if I change this
to small n now if you run this code now
we have two different values right one
is capital Naveen and second is small
Naveen here let's see what happens and
the output you got here is not same now
in case of Java we have some methods
right we say equals okay so we can we
can set the we can set the parameters
here now we can also set one more
parameter parameter we can say is
ignored if I say true now it may ignore
so if you want to ignore the case you
can see the second parameter if you set
it true let's see what happens now okay
can you see that we got the output as
same that means even if you have two
different string here I mean the both of
Buddha James truing but then one is
capital one is small now still you are
getting same is because we are saying is
a case ignored and you're saying true so
when you say true attacked means it will
not check for the case but let's see if
we don't know I do that you go for the
normal normal comparison here so this
will give you not same right so let's go
back to n capital another thing is do we
really need to use dot equals here can
we use something else what if you use
double equal to because in Java we have
to use dot equals right but in in and in
Kotlin what we can actually do is we can
say str equal to equal to HC are two
types which we can actually use equal to
symbol here and let's run this code okay
and you can see we are getting same now
but then if I use a small and now what
will happen so instead of using instead
of using you know dot equals method we
can actually use equal to symbol but
let's see what happens now okay it says
not same because the both are different
right so we have to so when you when you
use double equal to you can see we are
getting not same because we those are
those two are not same right so that's
how you can work with this that's how
you can compare to two string objects so
yeah that's it that's how you compare
strings in Kotlin so that just one this
video in the next video we'll talk about
something else
so that's it make sure you subscribe the
