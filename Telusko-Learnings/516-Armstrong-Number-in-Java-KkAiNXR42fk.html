Armstrong number
not exactly Armstrong number Earth so
let's say if you have a number so let's
start with the comment or the theory
part of it
so if you talk about a number so let's
say your number is 5 or 1 5 3 which is 1
2 3 so we have to isolate this number so
it is 1 5 &amp;amp; 3
okay now of each digit so let's see if
you have one so you have to find the
cube of 1 which is 1 into 1 into 1 and
then we have to find the cube of 5 which
is or we can say 5 cube and then we have
to find the cube of 3 so with these 3
numbers and then we have to add these
numbers so it's 1 cube plus 5 cube plus
3 cube and then once you add this number
you will be getting 1 plus 5 cubed is
125 plus and the and then we have 3 cube
which is 27 so when you add this all
these numbers will be getting 153 right
so your initial input value is 1 5 3 and
when you do this operation the output is
also 1 Phi 3 if this is the case this
number 153 will be also called as
Armstrong number let me go with one more
example let's talk about these 70 or
even you can go for 371 so if you talk
about these 70 it is 3 and 7 and 0 so we
can find 3 cube so we can I can write 3
cube which is 3 into 3 into 3 then we
have 7 into 7 into 7 and even if you
multiply 0z will be getting zeroes right
so you don't have to multiply that and
then when you find the cube which is 27
and then 7 cube which is 343 so it is 27
plus 3 4 3 is 370 right so this will
also give you a number which is 370
which is Armstrong number so once you
got the logic now let's implement the
same thing in Java now how to implement
that first with
we need a number so we can also take
this number from user so we'll name this
name this variable as n so let's assign
a value which is 1 1 53 you can ask the
same value from the user using scanner
class now I also need to use one more
variable which is 10 now why we need 10
periods because we will be doing some
operations on end so we don't want to
lose the original value so let's assign
the value to 10 because we will be doing
operation on 10 variable now are you
guys going to be doing operation on n
now what we do is first we need to
isolate our number so what we can do is
begin start with 3 so let's start with
153 so we have to isolate the number 3
now to isolate this number so we will
take one more variable variable for that
with name this variable as R okay and we
have to say R equal to n mod 10 so when
you apply this operation of n mod 10 it
will give you the value H 3 so once
you've got 3
I don't want 3 in the original 153 so
how to remove that we'll say n equal to
n divided by 10 this will give you 15 so
we have moved to 3 and the 3 value is in
this R now we will also do this
operation of adding the value by
multiplying or defining but first you
have to find the cube and then we have
to add it so we'll take one more
variable for that we'll name this
variable as sum ok we have a variable
which is sum so this says sum equal to
then we have to say sum plus R into R
into R which we'll find the cube right
so when you say R into R into R it will
give you the cube and you but the
problem is we need to have some initial
value for some will say some equal to 0
to initially V or sum is 0 now way to do
the same thing for three times so first
you have to go for three then you have
to go for five then you're good to go
for one by what that what you have to
this until we have to do this when yeah
so we have to do this until your zero is
go to the end is it is zero so if your n
is less than 0 or equal to zero it will
stop okay so we will apply a while loop
here we can also use for throw but the
for loop we have to find all three
things and while we can define on the
condition okay now once you complete
this for loop or so if one should
complete this while loop in some you
will be getting the you will be getting
this value one trip to the if the number
something different you'll be getting
some different output but in this case
your son will be 153 now how to verify
that son is one two three so we can use
if condition and we can say if temp is
equal to equal to some if this is the
scenario will print a it's a Armstrong
number otherwise in the else part will
be printing note so no wrong all right
I'm strong number simple and if you on
this code now it says it says it says
it's an Armstrong number what if I
change this value so if I make this as
155 so of course is not Armstrong number
and if I love this it says it's not an
Armstrong number simple so that's how
you find a given number in Java as
Armstrong or not so thanks for so much
for watching and do the scalp or for the
videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
