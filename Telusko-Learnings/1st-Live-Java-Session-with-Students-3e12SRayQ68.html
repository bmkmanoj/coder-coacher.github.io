instantiate yeah that's in understand
she right so in order to create in order
to call this in order to call this
method we just have to create the object
of add right so that's instantiation so
we have to say add obj equal to new ad
technically this stuff here which is new
ad is called as an object right so this
is the actual instance and this obj here
is interruptions so everything so any
every time you have a type with
something so this will be called as
variable right in this case this is
called as reference variable so this
stuff here this is an object okay and
this is a reference variable sounds good
so with these with the help of this
reference variable what we can do is we
can say obj dot add but when you want to
add two numbers we have to pass two
values wide so because then this ad we
are accepting those values and mind you
this is just our default so let's see we
can if you can just act what if we can
access that method here so we have to
pass two values let's say I'm passing
seven and let me pass nine so if I pass
these two values it would return
something right since we are writing
ain't here so of course it would have
done something so we have to store that
something somewhere so let's say it is
entry salt so inside this result we are
showing that values so when you say obj
dot add by passing two values seven and
nine it will return you 16 right so that
16 will goes into result so what we can
do is we can simply print the value of
results so we can say system dot out dot
println in black and if you mentioned
result and if we'll just run this code
so I run as java application you got the
answer 16 so what exactly is happening
here is your instantiate this object
which is in fact you are instantiating
this this class which is AD by using
this new keyword so when you say new ad
it is actually using the conscious
structor concept for initializing the
objects of any way you say what is the
use of constructor so basically it will
initialize your object and that object
got a rough stones as obj so next time
anybody if any way you want to access
this particular object you just have to
use obj as the reference ok now so we
can simply say obj dot add by passing
two values seven and nine and that
result is getting stored inside this
result variable and we are just printing
that value here right so everything that
would there with me
okay good so what next now let's say I
got a client requirement now so client
says okay everything is going good I got
the object of AD using which i can add
two numbers but let's say if client says
okay i want to add two three numbers now
i don't want two numbers i want three
numbers so can i add three numbers with
the help of admitted here and can we add
three values with the help of ADD method
is it possible
okay you're saying yes or no I mean not
getting any answer can we add three
values using this method here okay now
and so let me just answer this question
there is one way you can add three
values so let's say I have three values
79 and 80 k I want to add this to the
values so what we can simply do is we
can say seven comma 9 plus obj dot add
not this one we can say seven comma obj
dot add bypassing eight and nine you
know what is happening here so first in
fact we are we are passing this two
values right so we are calling obj dot
add bypassing two values this will give
you 17 right and then be adding that
value 17 plus seven makes sense everyone
so you got 24 so we can do that also
right so just imagine you are asking to
your client so this is your main
function will always remain remains a
client and this is a provider right so
we want to add two numbers so we are
asking this class to add two numbers so
this main as a make main as act as a
point right so I your client is doing
that stuff for you but let's say client
says okay I don't want to do this stuff
I just want to pass three values do you
have a solution for that but so as a
programmer you have to provide this kind
of solutions to your fear of provider or
to your client right so you can see
there is no method as such as as a add
method which takes to the parameters so
what we can do is we can create one more
method here which is int add this time
will not go for two variables we go for
three variables which is int I comma J
comma inch k like the advantage would be
we can simply say turn
I plus J plus K so we can now add the
values so if you can observe we have two
methods so you can see we have two
methods with the same name right by
different parameters so we have the same
name but different parameters so this is
called this this concept is called as
over loading right so we have two
methods with with different parameters
of this for us overloading so
specifically just follows method
overloading okay
okay so now what next oh but i guess
ganesh pc oh yeah okay so what next now
so what next exact actually what next
candy can we have three methods with the
same name but different parameters of
course we can buy provided you have
different number of parameters different
types of parameters we can actually we
can also add three or float values let's
say I want to add three values but the
first one would be float for example if
i say 7.7 f8 common 9 now in this
scenario the first value is not in try
this is a float since we like f at the
end this is not ain't that's float right
so when you when you try this now what
will happen the thing is we are passing
three values of different types so
number of parameters is still 3 and we
have a method which take the three
parameters then was the issue so it's
not just the number of parameters is
also the type of parameters so we have
to say add int add and we have to also
remember the sequence the first one is
float okay we can have any name doesn't
matter the second one we can have J and
then we can have K right so we can have
one float and two integers since we are
on the client side we are doing that
right we are passing one float and two
integers and in this scenario we can
just simply return f plus i plus k a
simple right but there is a catch and
what's that oh it's not I it should be J
right and there is a problem here any
any guesses what is what this problem
could be
okay so connection lost whatever others
are you facing an issue that
okay right so are you facing and you
should anyone okay great so so how much
you lost i don't know
is it still lagging
okay I think it should be perfect now
okay great so what we did is since we
are passing three values one is float
and the second one is int and and so
again if you are facing any lags here
let me know and what's that because
anyway since you're facing lag i will
not be getting the get i will not be
getting your messages on our team leave
work right so to make sure that you send
the message on whatsapp yeah so since we
are passing three values one is flow
10-second other two are ain't right so
here also we have to make sure that we
take one float and two integers but
there's a problem here any guess what
was the problem i'm adding three values
but it's not working okay let me just
guess was dish what issue can be exactly
right because we cannot write int add
because where we are adding a float with
an integer an integer so when you add
these three types of course the output
would be float right so this here should
be float because we are redoing a float
value now okay makes sense right
and from here we can just pass three
values but unfortunately now we cannot
accept a int value because we are doing
to float there now what we can do so
there's one one choice we can actually
take float doesn't matter which method
you call right even if you are calling
even if you are calling the integer
method which is seven eight nine so this
will call the second method wide we are
returning ain't but you can have integer
value inside float that's much possible
right so that's one way you can do it
the other way other ways we can keep it
in ok before returning we can actually
convert that float value into it so even
if you are adding float value where we
can actually turn the integer integer of
it ok
everyone okay so let me just run this
code now and you can see we got the
output is 24 even if you are passing so
let's find 7.7 f now and let's run this
so you are getting again 24 because as
soon as you return by casting into
integer if you will note that you will
lose that point seven okay because we
are casting it that side
ok so I'm like I'm recording this
session I will be uploading this on
youtube so if you want to revise this
session once again you can just actually
go to youtube and watch this video ok
everyone and you have to do one more
thing well when you watch that video on
youtube you have to also liked it so
there's a thumbs up button that you just
have to like that button there ok like a
decimal point but yeah I will not get
decimal point you can see that we are
getting 24 but it's a you want decimal
value what what to do right Sonny
guesses what we can do yeah i will give
you this thing in pen drive but you have
to also make sure that you like this on
youtube ok so let's measure let's return
to float ok and what des with the
problem here so again this end we can
just make it float right so that will be
the win-win situation about the side and
if we run this code now will be actually
getting the value oh but hold on I guess
we lost something because we are
returning we are costing it with H by
now we'll be getting 24.7 makes sense
okay so let's say now this is something
which you have so you have a client who
says like I want or if you're doing okay
we have a question if you don't want to
put any float value I mean inside this a
droid southern I mean if I they move
that point value what will happen it
will work because if you're adding all
integer values it will return you ink
and float is ready to accept integer
values so that is implicit conversions
so whenever you cast you go for explicit
conversion so writing int in brackets
that is explicit conversion so anybody
go for from float to int it will be
explicit and from int to float it will
be implicit okay yeah it will be giving
you the value as 24.4 in this scenario a
24.0 because we are accepting a float
value right so it will add extra zero at
the end no at the receiving end since
you are passing we are passing seven it
will not call the float method it will
call the ink method here so this ain't
will take only seven not 7.0 Robbie okay
okay let's imagine you have a new client
now and client says okay everything is
going good you are add as working
perfectly everything is working
perfectly but the issuer's we got a new
requirement and we don't have the source
code now so the new requirement is they
need one more method which which can
actually add double okay so since we
cannot make changes in this ad is
because we don't have the source code
here of this we just have a class file
okay we don't have the source code so
what we can do is let's imagine we don't
have the source code we just have a
class file so what we can actually do is
we can create a new file and we'll name
this file as add extra because it
provides some extra features so what
extra features it has us it has a method
okay which is one more method which is
which returns you the double value let's
let's make it float of what we'll do it
will take the method name will will be
added it adds all the flawed characters
on its edges float f the float g1 and
then float k is it effective it's f h a
whats after gta3 h right and let's
return so let's return f plus g plus h
ok so we are calling this method which
is an by passing ok that's extra right
so now we got a new method which adds
three float values right so in this gap
should i create object of a dedicated
object of add extra of course we want to
access the third method why the the
methyl which takes three parameters
which is float but unfortunately if
you're creating object of add extra you
can add all the integer values right of
course because even if you pass integer
values it will accept here because float
actually accept integer values but let's
say i want to call i want to call this
float itself
I want to call what I were to call
methods of Alec and also so in order to
access those add method in this add
extra we can use the concept of
inheritance what is in items using the
existing properties right so it can
simply say extends add so now in this an
extra we got three methods the first one
is ad which thick which takes three
integer values the second one is ad
which takes one floatin two integers and
then we got the third method which takes
in fact in ad we have already that we
have three methods right so in total we
are getting four methods in add extra
three coming from ad and one is here
right so this concept is called as
inheritance because we are inheriting
again the audience lock audio is lagging
okay let me know if or when it comes
back
so everything so I multiple now guys
okay great oh so now so now what we can
maybe they are the problem is from your
side yes Ann has a dream and has three
methods one which takes two integers 1
which takes three integer values and one
which takes one floats and two integer
values and an extra is one method here
so in total in our next up we have four
methods three coming from add and one
form add extra right so if you can
create the object of add extra we can
use all three methods make sense right
so that's the concept of so that is the
concept of watch method overloading and
we are also using in a tense here so let
me add one more twist let's say I am not
passing three values I'm just passing
two values if i add these two values
which is seven and h which method it
will execute of course from ad right so
in add via we have method with two
parameters it will execute this method
right so the logic here as we are adding
two values which is int and end so it
will return you the value which is so
exactly let's say if your power 7 and 8
equal to two new 15 right let's say my
client says okay i want to add two
numbers but I don't want to return the
actual addition I want to return the
addition with extra value so let's say
the addition is 15 I want to add one
extra so that means if user says seven
and eight the addition is 15 so the
output should be should be 16 so since
we want to change the existing behavior
see see what happens is we have the
object of addicts to our right which is
this class here or let me just provide
the division
so if you can see here we have we have
addict straw in which you have only one
method which takes three parameters
right and then we have this method here
which takes three methods which in which
you have two parameters why so this
object obj is the object of add extra
wide which is here so now when you call
I think this should be on this side
right that will make more sense I guess
right so here so this add extra has only
one method so now when you call ad which
takes two parameters so in an extra we
don't have any method which takes two
parameters wide so it will go to this
one but this will this will give you the
actual addition of two numbers so if you
pass seven eight it will give you 15 but
the output I've on now is 16 but I want
the new logic so what we can do is we
can actually override the concept so
what is the word adding here we can say
int ad which will take two parameters so
that say that is int I and J so it takes
two parameters and it will return the
addition which is I plus J but it will
also add one extra so it is I plus J
plus 1 now if I run this code let me
just come in this section tell me if i
am there is what will the output
make it quick what what what is the
output if I if I run this
anyone 15 right because it will go for
normal edition here but let's say if I
if I pass or if I if I uncomment this
what will happen now now we have two
methods which takes two parameters so
which one will get the preference is it
D is it this class which is ad which is
also called as super class and this add
extra will be called as subclass so we
will call this subclass method or
superclass method it will call subclass
white and if I run this code we are
getting output as 16 is because we are
calling the method of subclass so this
concept of so this concept of calling
are giving the preference to this
subclass method is called as over with
dividing so we this is two methods with
the same name but different parameters
is called as overloading two methods
with the same name and same parameters
but two different classes linked by
inheritance is called as over providing
right so this concept of overloading and
overriding which is Method overloading
and method of avoiding in combination it
is called as watch so that's a question
for you it is in commission is called as
watch anyone
date the question is this concept of
overloading and overriding in
combination is called us I mean what you
name this concept no this is called as
polymorphism okay this combination of
this too is colors polymorphism okay so
this is a question there's a question
from Costa white is white gives
reference to the subclass it's because
subclass is something new right so it is
new it is the newest implementation
right so so it is a new implementation
and the object you're creating is of
subclass so it will always give
preference to itself then if you don't
have that method in your class then only
it will give preference to a superclass
let me good example here again that's my
fair example so let's let i was when i
was in my 10th standard you know when I
was in my 10th standard I was not having
a phone and some of my friends they were
having a phone right and then they used
to ask me which phone you have okay this
is the very public typical example so
whenever I teach this concept of
polymorphism I use the same example from
last five years okay so at that time
people when people used to ask me which
phone and a half I was not having a
phone so of course I used to get
embarrassed right I don't have a phone
they they were having a good phone you
know at that time there was there was a
very awesome phone which is the first
smart phone nokia or double six double
zero if you remember the oval shape
phone so everyone i have lots of people
they were having that phone it was here
2005 am not if i'm not wrong
yeah actually have an iphone now but at
that time I was not having a phone right
so people used to ask me which one you
have so i should say i don't have a
phone but you know after some time you
know I used to think y 2 y to give this
answer that I don't have a phone so my
father had a phone right so he has a he
had a phone which is nokia i guess it
was double to the rich bony hand i guess
it was double three i forgot the number
it was somewhat double 320 it was the
color phone not the smartphone it was a
colorful so so when people used to ask
me which one have a i have so i should
say i have double 310 right so it was
not my phone it much it was my father's
fault so when you don't have a phone
your father's phone becomes your food
that's inheritance right everyone so
when you don't have a phone your
father's phone becomes your phone so
when you want to call someone you will
use your father's for father's phone
right but let's say in fact after two
years in my 12 standard I got a new
phone i got a motorola see 168 it was
not see 168 it was see 18 so after once
i got a phone and now people used to ask
me question which phone i have so which
phone i would refer is it nokia TT 10 or
nokia motorola c18 of course motorola
right that is that is overriding so my
phone overrides my father's phone right
so it is that's why this all it will
always always give preference to the
subclass not the superclass make sense
now
okay but let's say if I if I lost my
phone I'm traveling pain train and then
I lost my phone what what will be my new
phone now so which phone i have i have
now again I will have to go back to the
superclass method which is nokia CC 10
right so that is what's that is what's
happening here if I if I comment this
since I don't have a method so I find on
this code now it will call the
superclass method
ok
okay why's that I got there
you should know this comment also seems
perfect right so any any questions here
guys
okay so I guess there is no question let
me just continue the topic so yes are on
this concept
okay this is very very famous concept so
let's say you are you're using some
maybe you're doing something where it
could be used I guess we just have to
pause the cause that question will try
to answer that later once we start using
some api's so instead of answering that
question now let's answer that question
when we actually go for this concept in
real life okay there are lots of topics
coming on the bay which which will clear
your concepts on body let's just
remember let me give an example let's
say you are using an API so somebody has
built a class and they are providing
some features so let's say you are using
some someone's class and you're
extending that some you're on exchanging
a class which is created by someone and
that someone gives you five methods okay
so you have so you can use five methods
of that class but you think what you
you're thinking now is out of those five
methods for methods is good for me but
the one method is giving this giving me
some problems I want to use those four
methods but not the not the fifth method
so what you can do is you can actually
override that trips method so you can
have your own implementation of that
fifth method now there's one more
example then you when you when you buy
an android phone you can actually use
launchers right for different UI so
you're actually overriding the existing
you I make sense
and if you remove the new UI if you
remove the launch oh it will you will be
getting the old launcher yeah exactly
always watching also that's a good
example for that okay so that's the
method overloading and overriding right
so let me just make one more twist here
okay let me just just give me
okay let me just make one more change
here so what if if I shift this addicts
joy in another package okay let me do
something let me just move this to
another package how to move this so let
me just create you can actually use if
you just greater one let me get one more
package here and that's how you create a
package will name this package has calm
dot extra because this is the package
will be having all the extra files and
let me move this to extra package okay
and you can see the impact so this
method which this class which is that
which is add extra goes to extra package
now and we got an error and the error is
we are not able to access this method
add why we are not able to access it any
guess
it's because we have a default access as
soon as you shift your package so as you
shift your package you cannot use the
default methods right so that's why you
have to make this as public and as soon
as we make it public it goes off right
so that makes sense
okay so that that makes sense but let's
say if I don't have this method if I
comment this section now what even now I
cannot access that because this time we
are not accessing this method amex is in
this method so this should be public so
I just have to make this public so now
it will work so now my question to
everyone if I'm making this method as
public okay can I come here and if I if
I make me public it will work of course
what happens if I make this as private
will it work again eclipse is giving you
the answer this will not work okay you
cannot so you cannot see if you can see
the text there okay let me repeat my
statement on even if I remove this there
will be an issue this is your superclass
method is public and your sub class
method is not public okay it is private
and it is not even gravity this is this
is default right and you can see there
is an error here the other is because if
I go to this line now it says cannot
reduce the visibility of inherited
method that means you can expand the
disability but you cannot we cannot
narrow the visibility so this is a very
important point to remember whenever you
go for overriding you cannot reduce the
you cannot reduce the visibility you can
only increase the visibility ok so again
we have to make it public so that's why
it is always better to have all your
methods as public and yes a public
classes can be accessed from any package
and that's why for every for every class
it is recommend that you create a new
file so if I cutting a class addict
strong create a new file okay
so public class can be accessed in any
class okay see there's a question from
Sodom public class can be accessed by
any class why new file okay new part is
because you can have so if you are
creating a public class I mean each okay
even if you are creating one more class
that can that class cannot be public
right example if I create one more class
here let's name this class as be can we
make this class as public no right
because if you make this public there
will be an error in one file you can
have only one public class and that's
why you have to create new file so make
sure you have your files in New if you
have your classes a new file yes one
file can have at most one public file or
one public class make sense everyone
okay oh now there's one more concept of
for abstract classes what exactly are
shot glasses are so if you have so let's
say this ad we are providing the
implementation right so let's I don't
want to provide the implementation we
can actually declare methods okay if you
don't want to provide the implementation
you can declare methods right and
whenever you declare the methods so this
is this this concept is also coming from
a c++ and in fact C so anybody whenever
you use methods in see we have to go
into in three steps right we first we
have to declare the method I mean
function you have to first declare the
function then we have to define the
function and then you have to call it if
you remember first declare it define it
and call it right so that is that is
what happens in c programming we can
achieve the same concept in java by
writing abstract methods so we are
declaring it here so we are making
public int abstract which will be public
abstract and so the fast should be
modifiers then it should be written type
okay you have to remember that thing so
we are declining this stuff here which
is public so we're declaring this method
which is public aspect ok when you I
declare a method which is a semicolon
here
we just have to make it abstract the
thing is if you have an abstract method
in a class that class forcefully becomes
abstract class so you can have abstract
methods only in abstract works now
question is can we create object of
abstract class so let's say if I try to
create object of and here you can see
there will be an error which says
there's an error right you cannot get
object of abstract class right so we
cannot do that but you can actually
extend up abstract class here you can
see we are extending an abstract class
and in this class you have to provide
the implementation right so this is
abstract here and this is the
implementation if you fail right if you
fail to define it there will be an error
if it says the type add extra must
implement the inherited abstract method
because if you feel then unfortunately
you cannot accept it I mean you cannot
you cannot make this class so this class
also becomes abstract so if you are
failing to define the methods this also
we cannot becomes a sprite and again
then you cannot create object of
abstract class you can see the other
here you cannot instantiate the type
Alex draw at snap strike but I don't
want to do that I just want to make it
public and non-abstract so we can define
it so whenever you have a class which
extends an abstract class which provides
the implementation so this kind of
classes are actually called as concrete
class okay so a class which extends an
abstract class and it also provides the
implementation will be called as contd
class so I guess everything makes sense
now yes
okay perfect so that's so let me just go
for one more concept here okay so let's
say in this abstract class we don't have
any extra meters we just have one
abstract method here so you can see we
had just one abstract method and your
class here exchange one abstract class
right well let's say we have one more
abstract class for a change okay let me
just create one more abstract class and
this class is let's say something AAA
doesn't matter watch the class name and
just what the simplicity of this code
let me just move this back remove this
class to this package so that everything
will be in one particular package so
that I can access this class and let's
say this is all so let's say this is
normal class is not an abstract class
here and this I want to act so this add
extra we want to extend both the classes
I want to extend add I want to exchange
a can we do that can we say add and ay
ay ay we cannot do that right because in
Java we cannot have multiple inheritance
right that's not possible so what we can
do is we can actually use a concept of
interfaces so what if we can simply make
this class as interface okay if you just
make this class as interface the
advantage would be all the methods and
interface are public abstract okay we
don't have to write public abstract
keyboard there and to work with
interfaces we don't have to write extent
so whenever you use interface we
actually implements so we have to say
implements add
right and since we are implementing edge
so everything everything will do okay so
that's the concept of interface in which
you can only declare the methods you
cannot define it so you cannot declare
you can only you cannot define methods
only declared this concept is available
only till Java 1.7 as soon as you go in
1.8 we have some different concepts so
again in the weekend will be having a
session right so on saturday we have a
session where we're starting the session
with how can you define methods in Java
H okay so you can just create out that's
that question there right people
okay so that's that's an interface for
you we can have abstract we can have an
interface with one method we can have
multiple methods no issue well there's
one more thing we can actually create
the reference off interface an object of
a class okay that when that will do this
class is not doing anything that's this
will just for the example right let me
move this stuff so we can actually
create a reference of interface we
cannot create the object of interface we
can only create the reference of
interface and we can create the object
of a class I hope that makes sense okay
but this is one there is one drawback
here we cannot we cannot call we cannot
call the add method of addicts draw by
passing three parameters that's not
possible any wife is not possible why we
cannot call why we cannot call this
anyone why we cannot call this
now because it's a reference of
interface and interface don't know about
a method which takes three parameters
right so you cannot access that so
exactly so that's the revision session
we had so this is what we have discussed
in last in two days right so in fact
Saturday and Sunday and we have four we
have covered everything in one our
that's why I love online sessions we can
cover things very quickly again since we
know lots of sessions right yeah that's
what that's that's good right so what
about what about others do you like
online sessions
yes we can I mean we can call this it
will work since we are calling see this
ad is interface right and we are saying
obj so obj dot add it works if I
underscored it actually works say this
the output is 16
so yeah so time for feedback so how was
the session I mean you're getting the
points online I provided if you ignore
that audio lagging and video lagging
everything is perfect right
yeah sure sure i will upload i will be
uploading this video on youtube now
itself I mean now title and one half an
hour you can just watch it they're also
looking that you can also i will shed i
will share this in pen drive on saturday
with you people
okay then that's it we'll see you on
Saturday we are we are remembered with
an assignment while let me give an
assignment questions for which we have
to which you have to submit on Saturday
right to let me just to open my word pad
ok so the assignment would be you have
to create souley first assignment create
a calculator ok with four basic
operation
second question would be how to do the
same stuff but using using the
implementation using inheritance concept
because you have to create a focal in
fact you have to create for classes one
for addition the second class with
second class can only add and subtract
the third class can add subtract and
multiply the fourth class should be able
to do all this stuff okay so you have to
create for different classes okay
oh yes each class contains only one
method so let's say the first classes
add again that will be having add the
second method method will be adds up so
adds up will extend add writes on again
you'll be--you'll to getting that method
there which is the ad so the third class
which exchange second class and so on so
this is the assignment you have to
complete till Saturday okay since we
have not completed for loop if
conditions although stuff I cannot give
you more assignments because much of the
assignments cover cover using operators
right so next week we'll be getting lots
of assignments so that's it that's it
from this session see you on Saturday
since we have so let me repeat my last
line Ravi since we have not covered a
fells for bloop we will be doing those
stuff on saturday so that i can give you
more assignments next week that's the
supplies cause the topics are always in
supplies right okay I'm shutting it down
or if you have any questions you can
just use whatsapp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
