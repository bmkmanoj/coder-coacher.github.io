a notification as well I don't know how
many people are watching this
let me show you fight okay so five
people a watch singing about life
yes I'm live and I can see myself on the
screen and I don't know one no how many
people got notified about this and my
song is proper so let me just remove my
headphones and I was testing my voice
there it's coming good I'm not using my

check everything is working great so
people are sending a lot of messages
that's great everyone so first of all
welcome everyone to that is kolodny and
let's see so okay today we have a topic
which has been different not exactly the
topic which so we'll be doing some
questions answers but then today I'm
going live not for much time probably
for 15 20 minutes max I have so many
things lined up today so I was a bit
busy but then I thought okay - today's
Sunday so we should be going live so may
not be for much time let's spend 15-20
minutes max so today's topic will start
with the topic itself and the topic is
Mumbai meetups and finally finally
finally it's here we are going for a
meet-up now normally what happens is
normally I wanted to go for a meet-up
when we have you know having a seminar
kind of things you know something a good
place where I can book a room where if
people can come for the seminar I can
talk about different stuff in the
technology and something from your side
just to have a professional meet up but
then I thought let's start with a casual
meet up so this will be a very casual
meet a girl will with all me if it is
possible for you because the thing is
the meat of the pic tomorrow in Mumbai
it will appear acidic new Mumbai which
is washi station
okay now the thing is it is Monday
tomorrow so of course people will be
busy for sure they will busy with the
office work some people will be pleaser
with the you know with the
as office work and some people will be
busy in the college's so that's we know
that's weird I know I should have kept
it in the weekends but then tomorrow I'm
going to a college in new Mumbai so I
thought okay let's have a meet-up there
so I'm going to Kargil for for a seminar
and then after that I'll be available so
I thought okay let's have a meet-up so
it will be to our situation I don't know
how many people are so if you have a
number so you might be knowing about
water stations right it's an awesome
station so just outside the station if
you come so our amount that from now on
when you so it is somewhere near around
the Galena mall so we have a good space
there or next to station where we can
meet and I don't know how many people
will be coming one too so I don't know
let's so far the best so even if one
person come that's fine with me
okay so this week we can have a meet-up
there and something was saying lag is it
lagging I don't know if it is there or
should I change my Wi-Fi network is it
lagging everyone no okay so yeah it
seems good it's same skirt okay so
that's about meetup so so again once
again the timing so you can see that is
description area where I mentioned the
timing so it will be around 2 p.m. so I
cannot be confirm about 2 p.m. it can be
1:45 it can be 2 it can be 2 15 because
I'm going to a seminar and when I take
seminar I don't I I'm not sure about the
timing never so so that's the thing you
know the timing is not confirmed but yes
1:45 - or 2:15 this is the around time I
will be there
so yeah that's good so that's one thing
that is one announcement I killed 93
people are watching this and so come on
guys like you don't like button if you
enjoy these type of sessions yeah so
that's about the meetup so let me know
your thoughts about meet up if you want
home by are the available I mean
are you even able to join me there or
something like that so good occasion is
was changed and just see the description
area that into description you have the
meetup location and the timing as well
okay so
change the time the thing is I will be
available so see the thing is I'll be
forgetting free by 1 p.m.
from Karger so it will take
approximately half an hour to come from
cargo to washy so that's what I'm
planning now so let me know your timing
so that I can you know okay now how do
we how would you coordinate with me on
watch me that's a good question you know
if you reach there how will you contact
me so whatever you do is once I reach
there once I reach at masa station I
will share my location the GPS location
or my location on Facebook page that
should be a good point right so I will
share my location at Facebook page all I
will send I will upload a photo where
I'm standing so you can join me there
yeah okay so okay so that's that's one
that's announcement and let's go for
some questions since we only have 15
minutes to go so let's get started okay
so there's so many questions on the way
okay so which thing to learn for all
front-end developers okay for front-end
I would say the best one is go for
javascript javascript is used to you
know create those interactive pages you
can you have to be good with HTML CSS
there are so many things you know
they're not difficult but then there are
so many things to learn first of all I'm
not that good with front in technologies
for why a specific reason I feel fronted
technology are for those people who are
creative so if you are creative in
nature I would say go for front-end I
would otherwise I'll now back-end
because I'm not that creative but I feel
I'm good with logics so if you are good
with logic the best thing would be go
for front-end or back-end the back pain
development and if you are good with
creativity you know it's not just about
making a page it's also about where to
have that image and if you happy upload
if you put image on the page what should
be the background color where should we
have a button so it's all about
creativity
how about knowing about color
combinations so there's so many things
is I'm not saying it is impossible or
difficult it's just that you need that
mindset to work on it
some people can learn it but then I
never went into that zone of content but
I would say if you are good with
creativity if you think you can design
something good
okay this product is not also about you
I
it's also about you X it's about whether
user comes to your website or the web
page or to another application how
comfortable they feel to use your
application it took you very very into
you
so that's how you do it so still if you
talk about technologies I would say go
for CSS HTML Javascript Jake Jake we did
not I guess I could be very specific on
front-end you can use angularjs we have
vue.js we have react.js there's so many
things okay so this is you have question
answered I'll be uploading a video or
today let's see so what are the
situation after getting a job in
pressures Oh getting a job so after
getting a job company will be giving you
trainings as so as a corporate winner
but when I go to training so what they
do so they hire people and trainers like
me we train them because what you learn
in colleges is not up to the mark what
you learn is the basics in the industry
we do you have something new so it is
always possible to train you on those
technologies so that's what you get on
when should a company not every company
provides training some companies don't
do training they want you to learn so
they will provide you some you know some
access to their internal website where
they have all the resources available so
you can learn from there it's all depend
up on the companies ok so some school
champion say is easier is YouTube your
full-time job
no as of now YouTube is not my full-time
job but I'm planning to make my youtube
as my full-time full-time thing because
I I want to educate as many people as
possible that's why I'm uploading all
those videos if you can see on the
channel I started with 3 CDs now with
retainer structures
savage ASP and kochava so everything is
available for free I'm still able I'm
not able to figure out how can i
generate revenue from that so that I can
invest in the in my in myself and then
it's a gadget which I'm using the
internet connection which also needs
some charges right the light take take
some charge so yes I'm so I'm trying to
go to YouTube full time but I'm just
struggling with the revenue model here I
was yesterday I was planning to make
videos which I cancel on on some
platforms like udemy or website but you
know something I don't feel comfortable
selling things because not everyone can
buy thanks
so that's the thing okay some people are
getting so to chasse some people are
getting job in fake experience that's
right some people are going for a job
with fake experience if I have caught
some inquiry online on my emails on on
Facebook they were asking they are not
in job is it good to have a experience
okay there are you can get a job using
fake experience that have not a big deal
but then the only thing is if you are
joining a company by giving a fake
experience they will expect that you
have experienced and you will be ready
to work on a project on day one and
there that is where you will struggle
because you don't have a Perkin
experience and then you're giving a fake
experience you will struggle you will
struggle in completing your project you
will struggle you may struggle okay I'm
not sure you will struggle but then you
may struggle in completing your project
you may struggle in getting a good hike
because you cannot perform well right
you may not perform well if you if you
don't have experience so there are so
many consequences of giving up
experience I would say go forward I mean
getting the gate experience maybe in a
small company or a big company initially
you know I always believe we should work
to learn and then you should work to
earn at least for one or two years
doesn't matter how much you are getting
paid even if you even if even if someone
says work for free that's fine because
additionally if you have that skill set
you can earn a lot in future trust me
idling is not the most important thing
in the in the life it what's important
is how big you are I mean are you
improving yourselves so start with smart
start small and make it large yeah
that's what you do
and that's why people go for internship
they work for free maybe you can work
for one year for free if you there's no
financial problem that's what I would
recommend but don't keep it experience
it might affect the entire career I have
seen some people they got affected with
this not everyone get affected okay
maybe maybe fifty percent think if they
feel comfortable they make fake
experience I don't feel good about it
how to identify figure opposed with very
experienced ask about the last project
you know if you if someone is faking
their experience ask about their
projects and if they are not able to
talk about their projects that means
they don't have experience
okay and they don't even know how
corporate culture works right so talk
about corporate culture with them if
they can answer corporate culture
questions then of course they have
experience language is important for web
development which language depend HTML
CSS JavaScript and for back-end we can
use PHP Ruby Python Java sisha sisha
with ASP HTML javascript will be good
for the open year that's great that's
how are you I'm good Manoj yes you are
like yes I am life Kishu say is big fans
so I thank you so much even says how
high
o odd K channel says why you always
speak in English the thing is this the
channel this channel is a global Channel
why this is not just for India even in
India we have some states where don't
even understand English Hindi so I
thought and and there's a debate you
know people are saying in these not
election language and all the stuff so
English is the best thing for everyone
because everyone understands English now
people who don't know English I would
say learn English or improve yourself
because it would have a choice if you
get into IT if you are getting into IIT
you don't have a choice you cannot write
a program in language in Hindi because
we don't have that yet in case if you
want to make a programming language it
in the that's great if I can look if I
can learn that and if you can teach that
of course I will teach that but all the
programming languages they are English
books in English documentation in
English good tutorials in English okay
so if you go to let's say plural site or
any web site where you have all the
tutorials they're in English I'm not
saying you should not be learning it in
D it's just that even if you are
learning some technologies in D at some
point you have to go in and you to learn
the English yeah so that's that's my
thought in fact I have another channel
but I speak to my audience in Hindi you
can go to I've been ready so nothing bad
with Hindi I can speak Hindi well even I
prefer Hindi when I talk to humans when
I talk to my family my friends my
everyone I talked before Hindi language
there but YouTube is not a platform
where Hindi is preferable but I mean the
the audience which we have so we have
global audience we have audience from
South they don't want to they do I mean
they're not comfortable in the
so that's fine okay please come to Nana
talocan sure sure I'm so this year I'm
planning to make a lot of meetups
especially I'll be doing some meetups in
South because I'm going to South in next
three to four months maybe Bangalore
Chennai Bangalore that's my spot
maybe Delhi Delhi I will be visiting so
let's see oh nice to see you sir hey hi
hi Ashok great so then if says big fan
of you oh thank you so much how to get
first Java job but that's difficult
okay so doing such a job and jargon
search for a job to get to work on the
enterprise well yeah so what can you
pick join any big company you might be
getting a Java job there for sure
so I'll be companies they prefer Java so
like Enterprise enterprise when you try
building Java so think about that so I
knew that say is hi champ oh that's a
new point for me Chan thank you Jaggu oh
yeah take that admin says Armand says
you never respond to my emails is it
Sonia even once again let me check the
problem is I get so many emails up in
per day you know sometime I I see that
we email I thought I mean III think I
would apply that later but we have a
pile of emails there so I could i I
sometimes I miss some emails big fan
okay when are you coming to Mumbai when
are you coming to Mumbai atom-by-atom
Baker so I let it go by always so yeah
so can you make a campus-based make a
video on campus placement okay we think
about it but teaching you teach ready
well thank you so much so I go for
Python and I just go for Python apply
this very good language it's the easiest
language to learn and from machine
learning everyone the first the first
Python at least you learn machine
learning because machines I think it's
not about programming it's about it's
about how can you understand machine and
how can you explain something to machine
how machines should think and we can use
any language there there are some
hobbies available for different
languages but if you are learning
machine language
not a barrier for you but if you don't
know language I would say go for Python
because it's easiest language to learn
if you go for Java you have to learn two
things machine learning and jeribai it
will take out of time so that's why okay
so next five minutes so Vikas says I'm
seeing your first time live you have
done a lot of videos a lot of people
well thank you so much
oh god so yes I my aim is to help as
many people as possible you know so my
my ultimate aim is the thing is menu is
okay so the ultimate aim is when I go
for corporate training I feel some
people they are not up to the mark to
join a company I mean they know a lot of
things but they don't know things which
which are actually in use in the
industry so they know a lot of languages
but they don't know how to implement
languages yeah and even if they know
languages what they know is the basics
of language some people think they're
acting a lot while coding in any
language make you a programmer that's
not the case you cannot be a programmer
just writing hello just writing
calculator and just by drinking
Fibonacci series you if you want to be a
developer if you want your programmer
build something I'm not saying you
should be very unique but build
something from scratch something where
you know what you have to build but you
don't know how to build it and when you
build it that's how the learning curve
right so that's my aim to teach people
how to make software's or not just
making software but how to solve a
problem how to solve real life issues
with what should what solutions so I'm
trying to best do that
I don't know how an please create a
meet-up in Delhi
I'm sure I'm trying to go to tenets for
some training soil to that okay my lucky
she is bangle oh okay so sure sure I
will try to come to Bhangra as well okay
so which is better to go angularjs or
hibernate there are two different things
how many it is for database world or to
connect with it apace and angularjs or
the view technology depends upon
requirement if you want to be a back-end
developer if you want to work on spring
framework with databases of course
however it is the best option but if
want to be indifferent in development go
fire Jesus or maybe lunch booth you can
be a first angle upper okay collab oh
yeah I don't do more collapse this year
so last time I did collab with shukla my
Sochi at this time I was applying I'm
trying to do some collabs with some
other youtubers and let's see how it
goes because club is a good thing you
know we you actually can actually share
your knowledge with other youtubers they
can talk about their things with you and
that's a good way of sharing knowledge
right let's see let's see how we can you
know
in fact when I go to when I get some
beans from YouTube they talk about
collapse as well so let's do let's do it
let's do it it's just that you know I'm
not able to find people in Mumbai who
can do collapse so let's see how that
goes
it's lagging
oh is it little lag okay that's fine I
guess
so so let's say is hey I'm a Mumbai Oh -
great so see you tomorrow if you are
available provided you don't you are not
busy with your job you're not busy with
your you know with your college of
course we can meet and if you of course
if you're not easily something else so
if you have any people we can show them
it tomorrow please change dying or tell
you the time which you are comfortable I
will try to make it okay all the things
are same same questions if it educator
to protect okay which place for
programming lagging here our questions
just went up is selenium good now of
course it is good so one of the best
testing tool available okay okay without
the questions
where are the questions okay everything
went up please data structure problem
logic take too too much time is it
normal Oh making construct yeah it
initially takes time you know it's not
and initially it will always take some
time to you know to do the - about
solving but you did lot of practice to
be proficient in that I'm the bath
surely okay next week
I'm also visiting and whatever let's see
if we can do a small you meet up there I
don't know how many people are watching
this from
here okay uh how can I contact you when
you arrive at Watson station our cargo
can you meet me at cargo okay so what
again what we can do is once I reach
loss the station at 2 p.m. I will I will
share my GPS location my location on on
my Facebook page I don't know if it is
possible to share GPS location but I
will try and I will also make I will
also go like that on on my situation of
a show where I'm standing so you can
meet me there and I'm doing this for the
first time I don't even know how to do
meetups surely ok this ok it's not a bad
thing to confess but then yes I don't
know how to do Meetup ok there's the
first time I'm doing that so if you have
a solution let me know if you can help
me how to do a good Meetup
ok which is better to learn Courtland
Java I would say start with Java because
Scotland is specific to it is kind of a
used in Java in Android a lot but Java
is used everywhere you start with Java
then you can don't correlate very easily
oh okay so last question and then we'll
sign off with again I will go live in

another channel which is haven't ready
that's my personal Channel having go
live there as well
so in the evening around I don't know
the timings not fixed maybe 8 9 okay so
we'll go live as well ok so what made
you learn alone for coding so initially
I take my graduation in IT itself in BX
EIT but I was not much interested in
programming because of because of the
syllabus the way people teach
programming I used to hate it but then I
started going to different competitions
intervals competitions well I started
competing with them that's how I joined
so that's how I learned programming
ok so god of says collab with Rita
Choudry
oh surely I have seen some of his videos
way back let's see let's see
will will try to do a pull-up with him
maybe he if he's and means let's see
