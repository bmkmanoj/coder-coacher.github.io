is subject today what will cook table
and today we will learn like how to
manage how to handle hit listeners how
like whenever regular he put in clip
then how to handle their those events so
i have created new project and on my
layout i have taken one button ok and i
have given ideas BTW 81 also have taken
one text view ok large text i have just
given ideas the textview 1k then like
let's go to let's go and write logic for
that so just implement that what what is
the primary step is just to create
create two variables ok one of type I
paid for 1050 n1
next to drive it X you fix to be one
okay and then here by the air like % I
think you this method is possible to
find you you have a job or in the same
way we have to find our own you wake up
without so what will say find my ID so
all da tiny dot click it one and never
say extra one funny way some hot I get
out I will submit everything error
because I have to rush this text you as
it thanks to you ok so now now this
managed us handle this button click
activity we have to implement something
called as onclick listener say on this
listener after implementing like as you
know the basic point of emphasis if
you're implementing in interfacing you
to provide body of all methods which are
they interfere so here we have something
called as get my cut hair auntie
listener so here we have all kick method
ok so what to now we have to set that
button wakeful and now what we have done
is in this design is collected all four
button is not but we have to say that it
in one God set on booties that ok so
whenever that set on a listener is going
to happen so what did you do it will
search something or less unclick hurt ok
in our this means referring to that same
class
search for on click method and it will
go there so in that method what I will
do this will simply say exw one box at a
string this is method okay to set ring
set if so I said text and I was this
simply say that that's great so let's go
ahead and let's go to AA again I'm
telling if still g devotion and or
embroidery studio is not configuring
your system just comment below success
in it an issue this comment below was a
dress shoe okay i will have it as soon
as possible or you can mail me also ok
so my email ID is popular 35 50 and it's
tomato can send email its officials or
it will comment what about so again the
griddle is bedding Burlington's again it
is fetching all require lives and jobs
and binding it together and the stuff
for binding it together it was to
execute that application in my gene you
should add jeanne motion emulator it's
so let us wait for something ok and once
it affects cute it will get something
here so now I guess my project is very
successful ok now we can see that Oh
Jeanne machine has a genie motion you
can see that my application I will
please simply click on I click on click
now you can see button is clicked again
I will close the app this there's a back
button available till it is also till
option is also available so i click on
back oh goodness still is
yeah again I will go here quoting me
know or like navigation little bit
tricky but it's okay like do not happier
than our Android virtual device so i
will again le click on mini and we have
something called as hello world yeah
system so thanks lick on it so you can
see that it's fine so this is the one
way to handle on it click events or
later prudence will understand there are
various ways to handle clicks lessness
so will exclude one by one do like this
