about this file so we have car Java and
we have a card class we have a pin which
we will have a main function then we
have bike and then we have a vehicle
interface this is our configuration file
and this is my palm to XML which is for
mavin now what we'll do is just to go
beyond the example just go out of this
let's create a new file and then we'll
name this class as tayo and this style
what will be having is we have so let's
say we have private string and we'll
name this variable as brand okay so
let's say if we talk about tire so tire
well we have different brands or maybe
MRF c8 or all different of this stone
maybe so we have lots of companies who
make tires so for this brand we require
a guitar and Seto so just take this
Gator and settle here and we say okay
now we got get a set of for this brand
now when this let me print not here
maybe okay so let's let's print our data
and so it's so so if I try to print the
object of tire I want to print this data
so I will just use our to string method
just to print the data of the tire and I
will use this which will print the brand
name now I want to create the object of
the tire in this class okay so let me
just comment this vehicle for time in
let me just use these comments let me
get object of tire now take an object of
tiles that we have to say it tire they
have to say T equal to new tire right
but again whenever you use a new keyword
its add some dependencies so what will
do is will remove this dependency and we
can simply say oh I need our tire object
so I will say context dot o ignore the
arrow
okay so context dot
get B and then here will mention I want
a tie oh wait hold on we are not we have
not mentioned this style in our XML
files so if I go to XML file you can see
we don't have anything called a style so
either we can use eigen we can define
the style using an equation based
configuration as we have done in the
last video all we can do with the help
of XML based configuration so just for
the example for this type of example for
the example what I have to explain I
will use XML for tile so how to use XML
so we have defined a pain tag in this ID
they have to mention we are working with
tire and then we have to say class equal
to and then it is calm torch knowing dot
the disco dot tire and again I know I
should not use a package name with
capital letters but that's okay for the
example okay so now I got an object here
and yeah got it - um this so let's print
let's print T here and now if I print T
so if I love this you can see output is
tire and branch is equal to null well
why not
it's because in this tire via creating a
variable called s brand in case of car
in case of bike we don't have any
variables but if you talk if we talk
about tire we have a string called s
brand then we have one more dependency
here so brand becomes our dependency
that string variable becomes a
dependency for your tire class now how
to add that dependent or taught to solve
the dependencies so we have to so for
this class which is tire this brand here
is a property right
so spring allows you to set a property
so we are we are we have a property
named as brand and then we can specify
our value so we'll say the value is M R
F so it belong it's a matter of time and
now if we run this here we go we are
getting our brand as
a model as simple as that so we can
simply specify the brand name or the
property inside a bean tag this is how
we do it in XML format simple so let's
say in future if I have change from MRF
to let's say see it so let's say if I
use see it here and now if I don this
application so if I run this it will be
blind see it simple so that's how you
add a property tag inside inside your
beam so that's what this video in the
next part we'll talk about different
types of properties so this is the
property we can specify the value next
we'll talk about the value thing so
that's it thanks for watching and do
