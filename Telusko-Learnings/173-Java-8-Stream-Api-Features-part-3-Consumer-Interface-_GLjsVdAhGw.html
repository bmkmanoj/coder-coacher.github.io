each loop actually works so to make it
simple let me remove all these extra
comments which were using earlier and
you can see now we have these two lines
which says create a list with six values
and using this for each method we can
print all the values in which I have
passed or variable which is I and I am
printing the value of I but let's say
how exactly all this works so it will
remove this command again let me just
remove this we type it again
so we'll say values dot for each now
this forage accepts a consumer interface
object so that means in order to work
with this for each method we need to
create object of consumer interface so
we'll say consumer interface so let's
import this package and you can see
package name is it is Java dot util dot
function dot consumer so all this our
interfaces which were introduced in
function package there are Java 8
features so if I go to this function
package you can see it was introduced in
1.8 version ok so if you are trying all
this code in Java 1.7 obviously it will
not work so in this for loop what you
have to specify is we have to specify
the object of consumer and we'll say
consumer takes all the integer value so
let me just go to the curve go to
definition of consumer if you go to
consumer it's a functional interface or
point to remember it's a functional
interface and it says it's the version
is 1.8 and this consumer accepts a a
type T which is if it is integer so the
type of this consumer will be integer so
for every consumer so that your values
they will provide some data so they are
they are producer and this consumer
object here will be a consumer since it
is a functional interface you will be
having only one method which is accept
and this method accepts accepts only one
object same as a type of your consumer
if your consumer is
teacher type this will be integer type
so if you don't know what exactly this
feature is you can go to my video of
generics and you can learn when you join
Rick's here so you can see we have a
method which is accept which accept only
one method or one parameter so what we
can do here is we can create the object
of consumer will say C equal to now in
order to create the object of consumer
what we can do is you can create a new
class here so somewhere outside you can
create a class we'll say the class name
is CC and CC is CC implements consumer
so you can do all those thing and then
you can you can define a method which is
except that's a feature of this
interface but what we can use here is we
can use anonymous class there is
anonymous class here you can simply say
new consumer again if you don't know the
anonymous class you can go to my
playlist of Java and search for
anonymous class so if you are family
with anonymous last please please
continue so we have consumer integer C
equal to new consumer and we can specify
the type again which is integer here we
give a bracket now since consumer is not
a class it's an interface were to define
the interface definition here because
every interface needs a definition
so either you can use the class to
define interface to define the
definition or you can use anonymous
class so this thing here we are using a
anonymous class now this consumer
interface has only one method which is
public void accept so we say accept and
it accepts only one parameter so we'll
say it is integer I
so that's your value I and now let's
print the value so we'll say s out tab
and let's print the value of I okay and
then in this 40-inch loop we can just
pass or furnish method you can simply
pass C so what it will do when you pass
C it will go to this object C it will
check okay we have accept method so
every time you call this for each method
it will fetch all the values and one by
one it will call this
accept method and it will pass the
values so initially it will pass one out
will you
then it will be to output will be to it
will go till six now
so if I run this the output is one two
three four five six clear so that means
you are this for each method here they
accepts a consumer interface can we can
we make this code more efficient now yes
we can and how to make this code more
efficient that we'll see in the next
