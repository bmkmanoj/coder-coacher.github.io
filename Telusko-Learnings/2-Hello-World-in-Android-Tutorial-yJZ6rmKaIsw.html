I believe that Android studio is stored
in your system also
jeanny motion has been configured if it
is not then just comment below I will
make another separate video or if you
are facing any issues by installing
Genie motion this is a simply comment I
will make another video that how to
install and configure Genie motion and
and already studios okay so as I can as
you can see I have already created a new
project that is hello world and just now
I just clicked on Genie motion icon I
have just started that GD motion okay
the virtual device okay so you can see
GD motion for personal use here click on
if I click on start it will start the
phone is you want to add a new phone you
can go ahead when you click on add and
after clicking add it will ask you that
what API is he wanted you want Nexus of
the only one which API is 14 17 18 19
all are available here so you can design
any so currently I have already created
one now default virtual device okay this
is 4.4 KitKat so this cancel it I will
click on start ok whenever I need
currently I just wanted to show you that
how to work with Genie ocean okay now I
will show you something called as
Android is to do so in Android is to you
you can see we have like many different
different panels and palettes available
so you can see that this is something
here you can see all project structure
is available okay and here your layout
is also you can see with two tabs text
and designs when you click on it you get
XML then you click on design you get UI
okay in the same way eros if you con
design you'll get UI if you click on
text you get the XML code okay but why
XML just to design UI in Android XML is
default which is used okay so
you should have a little bit
understanding of accent all okay you can
also do that in UI by dragging and
dropping like this is my main activity
this is my design you can see the hello
world okay so from palette you can
select layout like in which we already
wanted to design also some reject you
can select in a bit like text button is
small but I make you pretend checkbox
which buttons trouble but there are many
of the little okay some text field you
can select anything like curve what is a
name oppa number password filled
whatever so there are many option
available panics okay so you can drag
and drop simply drag and drop in your
device's screen okay so now I want you
to show you something this is the
important Oh like manifest so
androidmanifest.xml as I told you in
Android were trading blocks this is
something which binds everything okay
this is that important fight also you
can see there is this Java folder in
Java there's comrade Swapnil and there
is a me activity this is the Java class
okay
so whatever logic you have to write it
right here in the source directory if we
go
you'll go to the layout layout you can
see content main dot XML also activity
main dot XML actually your marshmallow
has released so in marshmallow they have
or change something they have added many
features so now before that if you like
before marshmallow
you should LFE any application for what
I say a lollipop or difficut or anything
so you get used to it only activity
main.xml but now they provide content
Minich separate also so for now just so
stiff like I am deleting it you will see
that what is in it impacting or not so I
will click on read anyway yeah I will go
to activity green dot XML so I mean X go
to X okay this are the by default they
are providing food bar and all so I will
simply select this
other vehicles also I don't wonder
something I don't want to opine button
also you and I just save it go to design
how I can see Bank screen okay now again
I will go to make template or Java
I just do some cleanup I don't know on
this voting button move this I don't own
this you are also called toolbar we
gender has project I just want it I
won't the second if you are not really
outdoor active its code means what it
says it like whenever you you will
execute so it will go to AA that is
resource then go to the layout and you
to lay off and then whatever you have
written here it will just display that
is creep okay so now in my to take
main.xml I will simply say sub list
select obtain text field so you can I
get it and property - good like second
so easy very easy you say it's extremely
simply incorrect contain interact with
tight
and what it can drag-and-drop words of
see that alternate no I think that hello
birdie there at this Jew ok can see
hello what is that okay so if you want
some cotton years
drag it this dragon no no you can see
that we have something called as hell
over there okay so let's let's excuse
this application and let's see that what
we are getting in output so click on
this is the red button so click on trend
it will build it will ask like which one
to select so I have my default template
also I have my engine emotion also I got
my full API 21 which is nothing but
default if a default emulator for
Android so I've just clicked on it and I
mean wait for some time it will it will
what you say that we'll call that
emulator it brings through the tablet
and it will install my first application
that and it will excuse that application
okay so for the timing just pause the
video and then we will continue okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
