video we'll talk about patterns so this
is one of the pattern we had to cover
today so we'll will try to draw this
pattern using Java so again we'll be
using a for loop so anyway you want to
print some this sometime patterns we
have to use loops right so let's see how
to do this with the help of Java so
let's go back to NetBeans and what we'll
do is we'll try to print this pattern so
for this we require a for loop of course
when you want to whenever you want to
print a pattern we require to fajn
website so we have defined two for them
save it is nested for loop and then this
will use a variable and we start with
one and then we'll finish the values
till nine right so there are multiple
ways of doing this we'll go for the
first way so what we'll do is we'll
print this part first or let me remove
this word here pattern and in Java okay
so what we'll do we'll just try to print
this first so this is your one pattern
and this will be second that's one way
we can do this or what we can do is we
can print everything with one for the or
nested for though so we'll see multiple
ways of doing this so initially we'll
start with let's try to print this
pattern and then we'll move towards the
lower part so initially we just have if
you focus only on the first row here let
me just reduce the size of my NetBeans
so that you can see both the things at
the same time so okay it looks good
right so we have this pattern here in
which will first try to print the first
block let's let's say we don't have this
block here okay we are printing only the
first block so what we'll do is we'll
take this five characters also five rows
we have I equal to 1 other than equal to
5 and I plus plus in here we have to
mention J and we start J with 1 and when
you want to try to print this pattern we
can say J less than I right or less than
equal to I so that's the way you can
print this pattern here if I say it's
out if
remove this print Ln and if I print a
star with space so what it will do it
will run a loop from so this I will
count it the number of rows so we have
five rows and this J will count the
number of columns so for the first row
we have only one column for the second
row we have two columns but the third
row we have three columns so that means
for multiple rows we have multiple
columns right or for the number of rows
they have we have number of columns so
what we can do is we can start j by 1 or
J with 1 and then we'll finish less than
equal to I and after every loop or after
every initial internal loop will print
its out and we'll print a new line so
that once it prints one star we want new
line of the two stars we want new line
of the thin start we want new line right
and if I run this code
you got this five stars or you got these
five things what about this thing now I
want to print this block so what we can
do is for the from the first block we
have printed this now we'll use one more
for loop outside again we can use I we
can reuse I because the scope of the
initial I value just was in this for
loop here we can use reuse I here I
can't believe we have a four so when say
I less than equal to four and I plus
plus okay this will count the number of
rows we want to also call the number of
columns so we'll use a int J but this
time J will be at max that will be 4 and
J greater than equal to I that's what
you have to do here because you are
going for you was right so we are we are
going for the value which is varying so
initially it will be 4 then it will be 3
then it will be 2 so as your I value
increases your J iteration will be
decreasing okay and let's print the
again let's print something here we'll
say print L N and we'll print a star ok
it will print to start here space and
here we'll use a new line to print this
uniform this code you got this this
pattern right so that's what we have to
use a pattern here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
