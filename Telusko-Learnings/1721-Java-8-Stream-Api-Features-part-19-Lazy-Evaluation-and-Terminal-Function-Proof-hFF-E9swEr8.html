that what I will do is first I will
remove this extra part okay so in this
what I will do is I will define one more
method after this method which is public
static it returns an int value and we
will say that the values the method name
is divisible will say is DV Z okay so
we'll define this method which takes
only one parameter I and what will
return is okay it's not end here I would
say it's a boolean because if you want
to check will set it ton
I bought two five equal to equal to zero
and here what I will do is before before
checking yeah
it's likely you return here and we
define one more method which is public
static int we'll say map it a map double
see the method name is map double and it
will take one value in I or what it will
return is the double of that value which
is 292 so instead of applying a lambda
expression here we can use a method
references now so we can simply say my
class name which is Java a demo colon
colon is divisible and here instead of
using again a lambda expression we can
use Java 8 demo colon colon it is map
double ok and if I run this code you can
see the same output which is 40 but what
if before this before printing before
they turning the value let me print this
let me print something here we'll say s
out is say n is divisible will you short
from here in indivisible and for the
value which is I and in this also let me
say as
out again we'll print in map double Plus
for the value of I so if you are
filtering all the elements you should
print all the elements if you are
mapping only these over five it should
print all the values equal to five right
but since it is lazy valuation you can
see it is only executing for the 12 and
20 so filter is applied only to values
and map is on the only applied to one
value so this is more efficient than the
for loop it's because this filter here
is this filter and map they are lazy
methods and fine first is the terminal
function here so I hope I have moved the
point here which is lazy evaluation
simple so this is how we should be using
a filter method we should be using to
make to call it no proper needs we say
it's a filter function a map function
and find first or or else function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
