once we have talked about objects and
how to use glasses so we have also
talked about static keyword right so
when we talk about static keyword we can
make a variable and a methyl as a static
members in this video we'll talk about
in a class now what exactly in your
class is so let me get a class here
about the monster that I will name this
class as in our demo and I need a main
function with a click on that checkbox
which will give you the main method here
so once we got the main method in a what
we can do so let me just take that down
I have a different way of writing codes
you know knob there are people there are
two tower people basically one who write
or curly back is there or some people
they write here so talking it's our
choice right so let's say we have this
main method here inside this class so
let's talk about this class here so
inside this class I can create our
members right so I can create a variable
right so we can create variables we can
create methods so that means inside a
class we can have variables or we can
have methods okay so just to demonstrate
that let me create a class here I will
name this class as outer so we have this
class class outer class in this outer
class I can create a variable so I can
say int a - that's the variable there
and I can also create a method by by
saying public void show so this is a
method right so this is a variable and
this is a method a class can have
variables a class can have methods now
the way you can call this method is by
creating the object of outer right so we
have to say outer obj equal to new outer
and now we can simply say we can simply
say obj dot show it means that whenever
you want to access a method we need to
use the object of a class right whenever
you want to access a non-static method
then now let's see we have two variables
here I mean we have two things we have a
variable and a method both can be
accessed from anywhere so a class can
have variables and methods but can a
class can have a class I mean inside a
class can I create a class and there is
possible so we inside this class outer I
can create a class inner so we can
create a class inside a class you can
say there is no syntactical issue the
code is walking so you can write a class
in a class out inside the
so this is a member variable this is a
member method and this is a member class
let's say in this class you know I have
a method which is public void display
now basically how do you call display so
for that in order to call display method
which will print something let's say I'm
trading something here I will say in
display so if I want to execute this if
I want to execute this method by
printing in display we need to create
object of inner right now how do we
create object of you know so it's very
simple just come here and say you know
we'll name this as obj1 equal to we'll
say new you know now will that work and
you can see that it's not working that
it is giving you some error other is it
is inner and inner and it is not able to
resolve it what is the issue here so it
is not able to resolve it is because we
can find outer because it is in your
scope you can find outer but in order to
find inner it's inside the outer class
right so the way you can create the
inner object is by specifying that it
belongs to the outer class now how do
you mention that so the way we call a
method by showing bike using the object
right so to access this inner so this is
a reference this is the class name and
this is the constructor so just to
remind you this is a class name here and
that's a constructor so in order to
access you know we have to use outer dot
you know okay so we can use the class by
specifying the class name but this thing
is an object right whenever you say new
inner we have seen that when you when
they are created objects this is an
object right and the only way you to
access the object is by using the outer
class object and the outer class object
is obj let me repeat
in order to use the inner class the
class itself we have to use the outer
class but in order to create object of
inner class we need to use the object of
outer class that's how it works and then
simply we can say obj one dot display
does the method range right so in fact
if I click on if I select this play
point on this code you can see we got
the output as the output it's here so
this is the output which is in display
let me just take the output down okay
somewhere here so that's how you create
the object of
in a glass why we need to create in a
class when we can create a separate
class we can also create a separate
class right you know but the thing is
sometimes this requirement that you need
a class only only for that specific
purpose example you need in a class only
for the outer class there is no specific
purpose for inner class the only purpose
is to is to work with outer class then
we have to go for inner class otherwise
we can create another class of it simple
right
now what we'll do is let's understand
how many classes we have here so in
total we have three classes right we
have inner demo as one class then we
have outer class and then we have inner
class so every time I mean the number of
classes in your file will define the
number of class files in your in your in
your file because what happens is if you
run this if you compile this file it
will give you three class files so the
name of the class file I mean the name
of the file this file here will it will
be in a demo dot class it will be outer
dot class and this file name would be
outer dollar inner dot class now since
this inner class belongs to the outer
class that's why we have to use a dollar
sign there okay so we are specifying
that this inner class belongs to this
outer class quite simple right so we got
this inner class we got this inner demo
here we got the outer class we got the
inner class and to access the inner
class we have to specify the outer class
and the object of outer class to access
the inner object we can make a variable
static right so we can have a static
variable the same way we can have static
methods in the same way we can have a
static class so the way we can have a
static method
I mean variable the way we can have the
static method in the same way we can
have a static class the difference would
be in order to access a static class we
use the same syntax for the reference
but when it comes to the constructor we
just have to use the class name no need
for an object here now since this inner
class itself is static class we don't
need an object to create the object of
it and if we run this code you can say
we got the output as in display so it
works so we have a concept of inner
classes in your class we'll have
three basic types one is the member
class so if you if you create a normal
class without static keyword as a member
class then we can have a static class
odd we can have anonymous class so in
this video we have talked about member
class and study class we talked about
anonymous class later once we talked
once we talked about interfaces abstract
classes then we talked about an
anonymous class so we have these two
classes we have member class and static
class so if you can see we have a static
class here and we can also create a
member class point a member is whenever
you create object of inner class we have
to make sure that you for the reference
you are using the outer class and for
member class we have to create you have
to use the object of the outer class to
call the to create the object of inner
class in case of static class we can
directly mention the class name there
okay so that's your member class and
static class and when you when you type
this code by yourself make sure you go
to documents and check for the file name
so you have to go to the project go to
the SRC folder and SRC you will get this
file name or maybe you'll find it in bin
so that's it from this video we have
talked about inner classes it can be
member or it can be sorry class because
we also have Animus class which we'll
see later thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
