set interface now we have talked about
at least we have talked about connection
interface right so all this comes under
collection API now set inside also we
can have elements the way we have done
with analyzed or in this right so let's
create some let's get a set of element
so we'll say set so it says set and
let's import the package for set you can
see the package for set is Java dot util
and we can also specify the generics
here of what type we are going forward
so let's say we are creating our set of
integers and we'll say values equal to
now the problem is set itself the
interface if I click on set sec is an
interface so of course on set set
exchange collection that means it's a
part of collection so if I create object
offset we cannot do that with the offset
interface right so we have to say we
have to search for a class which
implements set and that class is hash
set so let's mention that here and we
need to import the package for that as
well and that but and that class even
belongs to Java dot util and if I go to
has set it's a class where is that it's
a class which implements set okay so
that means we can create the object of
site in this way now once we got the
audit of set we can add a value 0 so
we'll say values dot add and we can sum
we can put some values we can say five
values dot add and let's say this is six
and then say values dot add and we can
have a value which is that's a nine now
if you can see it is almost same like
your list right nothing change the only
thing is unless we use list here we use
set and list we use at least here we use
has set right and we can also print all
the values here so we can say int I :
values I can use the enhanced for loop
here and we can print all the values the
way we which we come in the same way we
do with lists and if I run this code and
you got where's the output it's coming
so you got the output has five six and
nine right it is that simple
now then question arise was a main
difference between
list and set because both are doing the
same stuff right the main difference is
you can see now if I create if I add one
more value here let's say the value is 6
so you can see we have 5 we have 6 we
have 9 and 6 now 6 is repeating right so
if I run this code I mean if this set is
offset if I using list if I run this
code will be getting five six nine and
six because list works in that way in
list you can have duplicate elements but
when it comes to set set will have all
the unique elements example if I on this
code you can see we are getting on these
six I mean 5 6 &amp;amp; 9 we are not getting
this 6 again then something have to
remember in set
it supports only unique element so you
cannot you cannot duplicate elements
here and if I okay if I click on this
add method you can see add method here
returns a boolean value now you can use
that boolean value let's say let me put
all these values inside our system dot
out dot println just to see if those
values are getting added or not let me
do it for 4 times for different values
of course and we'll say this is 6 and
this is 9 and this is again 6 as we had
done last time and if I this code now
you can see it says true true true and
when you are adding this 6 here it says
false that means you cannot add to
duplicate elements so as soon as you try
to add a duplicate element it will say
false so 6 is not getting added and this
feature you can only only achieve with
the concept offset okay so that's how
your set work so inside it doesn't
support duplicate elements now what I
will do here is I will simply put some
more values let's say I'm putting 87 and
let's say 97 let's say 34 and let's say
92 right so I am putting all these
values so if I run this code now it
should it should give you all the values
and you got all the values nothing wrong
with that but can you see this sequence
here I mean while you are entering the
value you are getting the same values
but while you are fetching the values
the Citiz sequence you are getting first
97 then
for then 87 and then 92 so it is not
following this sequence now why is the
case Richard for the sequence right the
problem is you are using a concept of
hash set which which uses a concept of
hashing concept
so what hashing does is whenever you put
this values inside your heap memory it
goes you to certain locations and
hashing will do the I mean it will use
some algorithm using which the nearest
value will come first so maybe while
saving the value you are saving 97 here
to the I mean it's very near to fetch so
this it is using some algorithm using
which it is fetching the value the
sequence is not getting maintained okay
so has set will not give you this
sequence of I mean this it will not give
you value in sequence that the point you
have to remember okay I mean nothing
wrong with your collection nothing wrong
with your values is just that hashing
concept doesn't save everything in the
proper sequence right but let's say if
you want to store in ascending order so
insure of using hash set we can also use
trees set let's import the package for
that okay for inputting package you can
say control shift oh in Windows and
command shift oh in Mac Mac and if I run
this code now you can see you're getting
everything 24:34 it is 792 a 97 in
sequence so tree set will give you data
in a particular sequence and that is in
ascending order I mean you can also
reverse it you can do apply you can
reverse the values and all the stuff but
that's how you are set interface works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
