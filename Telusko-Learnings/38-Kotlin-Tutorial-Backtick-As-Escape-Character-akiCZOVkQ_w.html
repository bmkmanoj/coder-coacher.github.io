political earnings and you know when you
work with Java we have different objects
which is inbuilt in Java right example
if I go to system class and now system
classes Java class if you remember when
we do system dot out dot println when we
do system dot n right so we do use some
some objects which is n bill which is
one of the object is in right and then
we have objects like out we have e e RR
now all this are a Java or Java objects
right example if you want to take input
from users so normally in Java what we
do is we say system dot n so we have EU
we do use scanner class and then we say
system dot n right so this is how you
use this is your in keyword right now
the thing is if we talk about this in in
in Java this is an object right or
reference to an object but the problem
is in Kotlin if you remember we do have
in keyboard right that's the issue
example let's say if I create a function
and if I name this function as in can I
do that can i name a function as in in
Kotlin and you can see there is an error
it says it's function declaration must
have a name expecting a function name oh
that's a function name right what's the
issue it is not able to detect this as a
function name example if I say function
name as demo see nothing wrong with that
it is it is accepting that demo name but
at the moment it comes to in that's the
issue because in is a default keyword or
it is a keyword in Cortland now whether
we use in we use in in for loop if you
remember we in for loop we do mention in
keyword right now how do you escape this
you have to mention hey in is not a
keyword here I don't want to in I don't
want this in to be up as a keyword which
is there in coordinate so you can use a
escape character so for the escape
character we have to use you have to use
something called as a back take a back
take which is actually a this type of
symbol now you will find this symbol
just below your escape button ok where
you have so about your tab button and
below your desk a button you can check
that any keyword now so you have to use
a back take on both the side
okay before they keep on and after the
keyword so if you want to escape this
character we have to use a tick and
attack so this is a back take now I can
use this in here right and if you want
to call that you can directly call that
by using in and you can give a bracket
but the problem is again you cannot use
directly in so you have to use a back
tick and on that one
so back take n and back take so that's
how you have to call it right now do we
do we really use in keyword in Cortland
the thing is if you remember in cotton
also we can use Java code right and
let's say if you have a scenario where
you want to write system dot in you
cannot do that right you cannot say
system dot in the moment to do that it
will give you bad what you say is
expecting an element now what it means
is it is expecting an element and you
are finding a keyword of Portland now
again to escape that we have to use
single tick that's how you use it single
take so anyway you find that you are
using some quads in keyword and that's
not your intention just use a back kick
and it will solve your issue again this
is not a big thing but and then you
should know this thing right so this is
there is something as backtick and if
you see some documentation they will
find you will find a backtick there as
well so that's it from this video I hope
it was helpful I know it was a short one
but then I wanted to explain about back
take only so that's it from this video
in the next video we'll talk about how
do you take enter from user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
