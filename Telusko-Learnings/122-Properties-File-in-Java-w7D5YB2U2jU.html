reading from telesco learnings and in
this video we'll see how to work with
something called as property property
files now what exactly this property
files are so when you work on a project
and for your project you need some
initial configuration right when you
work with hibernate framework when you
work with Spring Framework you need some
property files right or you need some
configuration so you can write those
configuration in a property file so
again we have different choice we have
we can also work with XML but people do
use property files so let's in this
video we'll try to understand what is
properties properties file now so to
create a property file what we'll do is
we'll go to our project which is a hyper
demo here and do you have file done ok
so what I will do is I will create a
file out in fact we can create a file
using code also so what we'll do we'll
get a file ok now in that file what what
structure we have is so every property
file we will have a key and a value so
in one property file we can have
multiple keys and multiple values
example let's say I want to connect to a
database so when you connect with a
database you have to specify 3 things
you have to specify the URL of the
database I mean the speak I'm in the
location where you want to store
database and the second one is the
username so we'll say you name and the
password to access the database so you
can write this three things in a file
colors properties files and you can
fetch this elements later now how can
you store this values in the property
file to do that we need to first create
object of properties so properties is a
inbuilt class in Java it belongs to Joe
edited util package and if I go to
properties it it was introduced in
version 1.0 so it is there from a long
back right it is it has lots of features
and the awesome is about properties is
it extends hash table which means that
you have a key value pair so properties
is a key value pair thing so we can say
properties and we'll say this is P equal
to
new properties so does that's the object
regard so once we so once in fact if you
want to work with properties files the
external files the class them itself is
a property okay
now whenever you when you to work with
properties files and whenever you work
with data you want to store that data in
a file right off positive is a file
properties file so for that we need to
first create object of file so and we
need to store the tie into that so we'll
say we'll get object of output stream so
that we can store data outside and again
as you know that we have to import the
package for this you say OS equal to new
file output stream because output stream
is a abstract class if I'm not wrong
yeah so it's an abstract class right we
cannot use we cannot gate object of
abstract class so we'll reuse file
output stream which specifies that you
are working with file so we can have any
file name here we'll say this is data
config dot properties
that's no file daemon it doesn't matter
what file name you have enjoyed you can
also work with txt you can say ABC dot
txt you can say I mean demo dot txt you
can have anything or so we can have
properties five properties that is an
extension or they can have text as an
extension but to make it more entity
we'll we'll make it properties now once
you got the object of output stream now
let's set some properties with a P dot
set property and you can see we got a
key value pair there so we can specify
the key as let's say I want to specify
the URL first so the URL for the
database is let's say it is there on the
locomotion machine and it has a I'm in
the port number for that is three three
zero six that's the MySQL port number
and the database name is my DB so that's
my database name okay so we have
localhost colon 3 2006 slash my deep
attachment it have its name now next is
I want to set one more property I mean
two more properties one is username and
password so we'll this it will say this
is you name and this must be the
password let's say also this once we
username
I will send a beam and t3 dot set
property
I want to set password now so I will say
this is pass and I want to set the
password as let's say four zeros so
that's my password okay so they're all
this information will go into into the
file now now by default it will not go
right you have to push this data into
file so the idea
I mean how to push this file is you have
this a metabolic store
so when you say store it will push your
data I mean this properties into the
file but the problem is it is we don't
store it asking for the object of output
stream which is there you can see this
object you have to pass here and the
next is the comments I don't want to
pass any comment so we'll skip it null
and that's it if you run this code your
you can you can store data in the
properties and if you want this code
let's run this you can say there is no
other in fact they have not printed in
statement so it is not printing anything
but it's verify do we have that file
there and you can see this is our
project folder and I do have a file
which is data config dot properties and
if I open this file you can see we got
username as now in URL is this and
passes this stat simple okay so now we
know how to store data into the file
right I mean in the in the prop in the
properties files in the next video we'll
see how to fetch in fact let me just
have one more look on that on the code
it's here so you can see we have these
steps are you have to create a
properties file and we'll we have to get
object of output frame to store data
into the file and then we can set the
properties here and we can when you say
store it will it will save the property
now let's understand okay let's let
let's do it here itself okay let's try
to read the values now how do you read a
value for the properties so for that or
now see we have the values there right
now let me remove that this stuffs here
and this time I have all my values in
the properties file so you can see I
have my values here I want to first this
properties in the Java for again so how
to do that now so to fetch the value so
again you have
just right to store data we use output
stream to fetch data we have to use
input stream so with the input stream is
equal to new now we cannot say input
stream we have to say file input stream
so that's file input stream and racket
have to specify the file name and the
file name here is data config dot
properties so let me import the package
and package import it now once you got
the input stream object it is very
simple now when you do want to property
when you want to work with properties
file we have to we have to load the
property file first now how do you load
the property file I mean how would you
don't load this file here so we have to
say it's P dot load and in bracket you
have to pass object of inputstreamreader
is now when you say P dot load is it
will load all the data from this
property file in this property P object
because that's an external file right
and now let's try to print the values so
we'll say I want to print the first
value which is the you name so we'll say
P dot get property and inside get
property I cannot catch but get property
inside you have to specify the key so
we'll say I want to print your name now
if you specify you name and if you on
this code you can see it caught Navin
and if I want to print the database
configuration so we say P dot ket
property not catch get property and if I
specify the URL it will print to the
complete URL Oh skewing me an error
because I have used some extra blackett
there and if I run this you can see we
got the URL and now these things are
coming from properties file if I try to
edit the file if I make somebody plight
let's say my database name is no ma not
my DB my database name is you our DB and
if I run this file coming to eclipse oh
okay so you can see it gives you an
error so because we have created the
file from the Java code right and you
cannot change the those things
so let me just go back to the things
that's bad yeah so now let me just Oh
the problem was with our let me say yd B
now this should work there's something
wrong with the part yes it is not
accepting this last character because we
have to cancel those right because Java
cannot interpret slash I mean it will
make it as a special character right
okay let me just run this once again you
can see we've got this slashed
that's why DB and what else uh so this
is how you can save the properties and
you can get the properties in fact when
you work with a framework like hibernate
framework we got a chance of setting D
happened I mean the properties using
property files again you can use XML you
can use annotations but this is one of
the way they try to can print all the
values if you say simply cell list and
if you specify where to print I will say
system dot out it will print everything
on the console now I mean all the
properties you can see that so it says
listing the properties you name printed
the URL printed and password printed
okay so that's how property file works
so if you have any questions let me know
in the comment section I will try to
make a new video on that and that's it I
hope it you have it it helped you and
just click on the like button if you
like this video thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
