integer here now if you don't know about
big integer it's a class in Java and it
belongs to a package our dot math and as
you can see this is the Java class and
it has multiple features you know you
can you can have a bigger number to
store store and it has lots of functions
in build example for addition for
subtraction for division right again you
cannot use you cannot perform normal
operations with between big integer and
normal integers you have to perform
operation between big integers object
itself okay so before before talking
about all those things what operation
let's let's convert this int into big
integer so the input I am taking is a
big integer the output I want to send
here is again big integer right and then
even this num now you cannot compare
with zero right because zero is a normal
number and this big integer I mean this
one is a big integer so that two ways
one you can convert this number into
integer or you can convert decision to
begin teacher so I mean preferably
always convert the number into big
integer so that if you even if you that
numbers of the big number it will if you
convert it into a two it will not work
properly right so I will say big int
okay so we already have begin zero so
you can compare this number with a big
in zero so that it gives you a constant
as well so your job is done and then you
have to return one now we cannot return
one because one is a normal number so
you have to convert this into a big
integer object right so you can again
you have two choices in to a class and
then pass the parameter here again you
have to make sure that you pass the
parameter in a string format the problem
is why I mean this will not work I mean
this is one way the another way is you
can simply say dot one so again it gives
you a constant for one as well the same
thing can be done here so when you when
we have one we can replace this with big
integer one because we are working with
numbers we are working with big integer
so the advantage of the integer here is
we are returning a bigger number okay
now when you pass it also you have to
make sure that you are working with big
integer or instead of instead of
converting that here we can we can
specify this is a big integer or we
cannot do that right
then we'll convert that into big
integers so is a big integer and then we
can provide a Blackett in double quotes
of course yeah
so whatever input you have you just have
to pass that in the in big integer and
your job is done so now this type of num
here is a big integer type I guess I
have done my work let's let's find the
factors of 70 now and if I'm running
this code it will take some time to run
can you see that we got the output now
again as you can see this is a very big
number right you can see that it's a
very big number so you can find the
factorial of 70 using big integer now if
I make it a very big number let's go for
700 let's see what happens now the
moment you run this code
I hope the integer can handle that yes
can you see that big big integer is also
able to handle a 700 factorial and you
cannot imagine how big number this is we
don't even have a time to actually count
the number of digits we have here let's
go big let's make it two more zeros and
now this is this is ultimate one right
now if you can find a factor of this
number then big integer is real God for
you so let's run this let's see let's
see what happens so this is the bigger
than Hulk now and I'll record an error
can you see that we are good we are
getting an exception now this is your
favorite exception this is not null
pointer but this is a stack overflow
exception now again we all know about
stack overflow right so when you create
objects when you call a function from a
function what happens is I mean let's
try to understand what is happening here
we are getting a stack overflow error
which means that see when you call when
you call 5 into 4 factorial what we are
doing here is we are saying hey I will
give you 5 into 4 factorial but you tell
me first what is 4 factorial then you
say ok let me just first find 4
factorial that means this computation is
in two stack right then you are going
for this computation where you are
saying hey first find 4 into 3 factorial
but then so if I total say okay first
all me that means even this computation
is going into stack so you will be
having multiple multiple what you say
multiple entries in the stack and of
course strike has a limited memory right
or limited limited frames so if you are
going for 70,000
cause you cannot have seventy thousand
frames waiting for you right and maybe
it will work for some time but after
some time it will give you either in
fact even if you want to know how much
it will how much time it will give you
so just before returning what I will do
is not here before returning this value
what I will also do is I will print a
statement just to understand how many
times it is able to call that and later
how at what time it is giving you error
so if I print a hello I mean just an
hello and then also let's also print the
value for num let's try to understand
what is the value which is blending so
if I run this code you can see it is
going oh it went for a long time and it
we got effect or in fact error let's see
it till with what point it went so it
went for this number which is six four
nine eight eight that means it went for
seven thousand two nine four and six
four nine eight eight and after that it
is giving you stack overflow right it's
still a big bigger numbers right okay so
again it is it is out of sequence no is
it out of noise it is it is in sequence
so yeah so after after a long time it is
giving you a stack of light even if you
have a bigger stack doesn't matter right
we are getting an exception now how to
solve this now why what is the error
here the other is the other we are
getting here is because this fog for
this computation you need to first find
four factorial right so till that point
you are not getting four factorial this
will be done in two stack and every time
you are going for the next value it is
it is creating a stack and the frame is
going up and up what if you don't put
this computation in pending what if you
can just solve this at the same time
right so I mean if you can solve the
output at the same time your job is done
right so how can we do that
so we can do that using tail recursion
now how do you find how do you do tails
equation that we'll see in the next
video so I hope you got the idea
watch the issue with normal recursion
even if you are using big integer you
will be you will get stick to stack
overflow in the last video we have seen
int where int has a limited value big
integer has a bigger value but then we
have a limited limit
stack stack frames in the next video
we'll see how do you solve that problem
so I hope you're excited for the next
video before going for next video make
sure you're subscribed channels because
mod is more typos I mean all these type
of videos are on the way and that's it
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
