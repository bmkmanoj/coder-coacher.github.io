now we talk about Java Java is purely
object oriented right so everything
around here is an object now if you talk
about an object to create an object we
require a class so as we see in the last
of previous video so to create an object
will acquire a class so just imagine we
have a class here and now this plus we
locate object of this class so we have a
class in which you have some variables
and methods so when you get object of
this class so the only class is a okay
so let's create a object of this class
now if you are familiar with C++ that's
how you get an object so we write a obj
right but in Java that obj is not an
object it's a reference because in Java
you create object inside heap memory
right so we have a heap memory here and
in this heap memory you have to create
an object now question is how to create
at that object now in order to get an
object we have to use a key value called
as new okay so to specify a new and then
you have to mention of how much memory
you need okay and that's why we acquire
constructors so that's a and bracket so
you can see we have a obj and then
that's a reference over to there then we
have new a bracket now that new a black
eight that's of a back it is a
constructor it looks like a method but
it's a constructor okay again what is
constructor that we'll discuss in detail
later time village focus we have new a
bracket so that's new implicit we create
a object inside heap memory now that
object in Java is called as instance
okay so whenever you say object we are
actually talking about instance so we
have you want to create our instance
there okay and to create an instance we
have to mention new a bracket which is a
constructor so a bracket is a
constructor but let's say in that object
we have two things will be having
variables and will be
methods right now in order to access
those data so in order to access that
variable X in order to access that
method show we need to create other
films so that's how we say a obj so we
have to be have a obj equal to new a
bracket so that's how you create an
object so new a next object and obj is a
reference so in order to call show we
have to use obj dot show because this
obj here is directly linked with that
object
now push allies we get object inside a
heap memory but when you see our obj
now all the this reference upon is
variables so very well have to type
basically we have primitive type
variables and we have reference type
variables so this obj is a reference
type variable so there's a reference
variable and all this variable will
belongs to stack memory okay so we have
a stack memory here and that's an object
there so we have a direct link from this
value to that value but how to throw a
link so let's take an example let's say
we have int I equal to 5 so that's our
variable right so they are simple
variable so we have paint I equal to 5
now this variable I will be created
inside stack memory simple so we have a
strike in strike we have I and in the
second column we have to mention the
value which is 5 so anyway I want to
access the value of I I will simply
fetch the value from the stack memory
and the value is 5 simple okay so index
in that case what is the second column
for object which is blind right we have
to mention something there that's why we
have to mention so in this heap memory
every object or every instance will have
a hash code or some type of code so if
you have to pick up that code and you
have to assign that code here in this
type simple selection that is well not 1
so that that 1 not 1 is 0 so whenever I
say obj dot show your your point or your
reference will be fetching from the
stack memory and it will go to the heap
memory but what happens when you write
this line now you have obj equal to new
a
so we have created that reference only
once and but we are initializing that
reference two times in the first line
the second line now what happens now is
every time you like new a it will create
a new reference if you create a new
object okay so now we have two object
and one reference now since we are using
the thing call is equal to now this
value the new object is 1 0 3 so it will
replace the value of a stack so now opj
value is 103.1 0 1 so the old link is
blade and now we have a new link now
what happens if up to the old object now
this old object is ready for the garbage
collection so in Java we have this
amazing concept of garbage collection
okay so now that object which is the
previous object is eligible for garbage
collection simple so that's how you
create an object on you destroy an
object we have one more way to destroy
an object we can simply say obj equal to
null as soon as you say obj equal to
null it will just blink the link and to
assign a value for as null and then you
will be getting now this also is also
eligible for garbage collection so
that's how you get an object and that's
how you assign the value now we will be
saying the same thing which we have done
in the theory we'll see in the practical
in the next video so I think this this
was helpful so thanks for watching and
