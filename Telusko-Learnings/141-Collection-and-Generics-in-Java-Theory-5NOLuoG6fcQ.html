ready and in this video we'll talk about
collection and genrich's so what exactly
collection means so when I say
collection this in the whole video of
you on the whole series I'm talking
about three different concepts so one
collection so if I say small C so if I
say collection so this is a topic this
is a concept okay so when I say we have
this in collections and we have this in
collection I am talking about the
concept then we have capital C which is
collection it's an interface so when you
when you say you want to provide an
interface you want to create a
collection of elements that will be
yours we're talking about capital C and
then we have one more which is
collections so this is s so in the end
we have s that's a class so this is a
concept so we are talking about the
collection concept now then we have
collection which is the interface and
then we have collections which is a
class okay so now in the whole series we
were talking about collection API we
have genrich's so so we try to merge
genrich's inside collection so we have
collections here with collection we have
added lists we have said we have hash
map we have map we have comparator we
have comparable will be looking
everything in detail in this series this
video is just the introduction for all
this we'll talk about why we require
election API why we require all this
different
genrich's how to mention wrapper class
there and all those stuff right so let's
start with the first thing so let's say
this okay now if I talk about the
collection API so in that you have lots
of classes you have lots of interfaces
right so let's say we have the first one
I want to I want to have the list of
elements so I want to have at least five
elements in the list so when you want to
have five elements so the first thing
comes to your mind will be in added
right so you have to create an array so
let's say we have I want list of
integers I will say int I will mention a
bracket and I will say this is new
Android that's how you create an array
and then you have to mention a size here
which I mentioned for values so now we
have an array of four elements now the
problem with this is the size of this
array is fixed now you cannot you
not expanded you cannot shrink it this
size is fixed right and we don't want
the size should be fixed I want a array
of I need something which will be
expandable so let's say initially I want
only four value so it will be four in
future if I want five six values the the
object should expand and that's why
instead of walking with paint array we
should work with collection now how to
create a create a collection here so the
same thing here okay with with adding we
will try to make it collection so how to
make it collection we can say this is
collection okay that's the interface
here collection interface okay which
capital C and I will say this is values
now we don't have to mention any square
bracket there we can just mention values
and we can say equal to so it is
collection values equal to now the
problem is we don't have so Croatia is a
class so the collection interface white
we cannot gate object of interface so
that's why we have to search for the
implementation we have to search for an
implementation which implements
collection and that thing here is so
we'll say new add a list so what is a
deduced to you so added list is a class
which implements collection indirectly
because analyst implements list which is
interface and least extends collection
so hierarchy goes in this way so we have
collection at the top and then we have
list which is again interface so this is
interface this is interface okay and
then we have added list now this thing
here it is a plus okay so we have a
class at least which extends which
implements list and this list extends
collection which is the interface okay
now once we caught the collection we can
add values now how to add values we can
simply say it is values dot add and then
so that is a method which using which
you can add elements and then we can say
this is five okay and then we can add
let's say one more value so we'll say
values dot add we can say six and then
we can add four elements right the
amazing thing is the size is not fixed
you can
expanded you can shrink it so if we did
let's say we have 50 elements here and
you want to delete the 23rd element you
can do that and automate the a delete
operation will shrink awesome right so
instead of using a days we can use
connection sounds good so from today
will not use a days will only use
correction Holden does not the case the
thing is if we talk about the fixed
number of elements so if you know
they're in the number of elements is
fixed always go for a day because a day
is a days fast compared to collection so
if you know this size will be fixed go
for a D if you if you think this size is
not fixed then you can go for collection
where you have the option of expanding
and shrinking sounds good
now the question arise when you say you
have an added here so this the type of
this array is eight right you are
mentioning paint here so the type of a
is end what about this values we have
not mentioned any type here so by
default the type here will be object
type okay
now what I mean by that so you can in
this collection you can add any values
you can add numbers you can add string
you can add different objects right so
we can simply say it is values dot add
we can even we can even add a name here
so we can say this is Naveen so we can
add numbers we can add string we can add
all different types of values right now
I don't want that I want to be very
specific if I were if I am working with
values so I want only integer values I
want only float values I want only
student type of values so how to do that
then we have to use something like
generics to specify this we have to
mention generics how to do that so let
me just put some space here I will say
this is collection so that's my
interface now how to mention that I am
working with what type of elements so
instead of after this collection we have
to mention that we are working with
integers okay now this line will give
you an error because we have the
collection of integers so this will so
we can enter 5 we can enter 6 but we
cannot enter now we
here because that's a string right and
then to specify the genrich's on this
side also so we have to mention angular
brackets we have to say integer and then
so that's how we can mention integer
there so this collection will only have
integers now okay now why this angular
bracket is because all different types
of brackets they are booked right we
cannot use round brackets because that
is for function or methods we cannot use
curly brackets but because that is for
definitions method definition class
definitions we cannot use square bracket
because that is for array so the only
thing which is remaining now is angular
bracket so that is why they have used
angular brackets for generics okay so
you can have a collection of integers
you can have collection of string you
can have collection of student objects
so just mention the type here so in 1.2
we got collection API in 1.5 we got
generics
okay so generic was there or gendering
is there from 1.5 in 1.4 1.3 generics
was not there it was only collection and
then in 1.7 we got one more update which
simply says if you have integer on this
side why to mention integer on that side
it is it is it is we can assume that
right on the left side if it is integer
on the right side will be also having
integer so I need to mention that what
you have to mention the diamond symbol
then and just give the brackets and this
thing only supports so this type of
signature or the supports in 1.7 and
above okay so that's how we work with
collection and general X here again
we'll see the detailed description or
detail walking off bit in the subsequent
tutorials
so there's just a theory of that so that
we will understand the practical
implementation where to use it how to
use it how to implement that we'll see
in the practical session but before that
I have one more thing here so if you
talk about collection everything is
walking here right you can add elements
you can delete elements oh can you
delete elements the problem is so let's
say I want to add elements in between so
after five before six I want to add a
line element which
let's say 8:00 so if I say values dot ad
and if I say this is 8 here now this
thing will not work also it will work
but the sequence will be 5 6 &amp;amp; 8 I want
to add 8 after 5 now the problem is we
cannot even specify the index number
because collection doesn't work with
index number that's the problem right so
in order to work with index numbers
instead of using collection what will do
is will not use collection here will use
list so you can see least implements or
extends collection it has some extra
features that least works within index
numbers okay so we have collection we
have list and we can create object of
ArrayList we want to work with list or
to work with collection right now the
next thing is we have we have something
called as set so it's not fusing instead
of using list we can also use set so we
can say set of integers and we can
specify let's say numbers and we can say
new now the problem is this set is an
interface again we have to search for
the class which implements set and the
class name is has set and we can mention
the angular brackets here okay so we
have set and has set here now the
advantage of using set instead of using
list is in least you can have duplicate
values in set you cannot have duplicate
values so every element in set will be
unique so if you want only a collection
of elements those those elements should
be unique goes go for set if you want to
look at values you can go for list which
even upon you or depend upon your
requirement with which on which you want
to work with so maybe you want to walk
with list of elements or which is
duplicate elements you can go for list
if you want unique elements go for set
here ok now so we have has then too the
problem is when you work with list you
will be having unique elements right of
course so you will be having two bigger
elements and you can traverse in say
so you can start with the first element
to the last element so the order in
which you will get the elements is fixed
what about set the order in which will
be getting the elements is random again
you will see that in this in the video
and the practical video so once you work
with has said if you add the elements if
you plaintiff you fetch all the elements
you will get you a different sequence
right so that is set here so instead of
using has set we can also use preset so
we have has said we also have preset now
the advantage of preset it will give you
everything in a sorted format so let's
say if you add elements like five six a
two three nine so if you add this
elements the output you will be getting
when you fetch values from this set you
will be getting two three five six eight
and nine so you will get this in
alphabets in solid format so that's the
advantage of using preset so we have
lots of classes we have lots of
interfaces in one big package which is
collection API okay and the last point
now so we also have something called as
math now the advantage of map here so
let's say if you talk about least inside
least what you can have is you can have
duplicate elements and every element
will have a unique index number but what
about map here now the advantage of map
is map will not have a number it will
have a key so it will be a key value
relationship which means for every value
you will have a key example so let's say
if I have a value like phone number so
the phone number as pH and Oh will be
will be a key right let's say you have
your maybe if you are working with in
advanced part maybe in we've talked
about some of the JSP you have to add
labels audio you want to ad lib to the
you want to add values to the session
you can again use key value pair so
every value will have a key the key can
be a number it can be a string it can be
anything right so how to get object of
this so we can let's say my key is
integer and my value is a string so I
will say string
now the problem is so we said this is M
the problem is a map is also interface
now we have to search for that class
which implements that interface right
and that class is hash map okay and then
you have to provide the brackets so we
have two class here which implements map
one is hash map and second is hash table
one is synchronized one is not so it's
all depend up on you which one you want
to use so you you can go for a thread
safe implementation or you can go for a
non thread safe implementation okay so
it's all depend up on your requirements
so you can use list you can use set you
can use collection you can use map hash
map hash table and all this part belongs
to one packet which is again collection
API so to understand this how all this
thing works you have to watch my videos
