example which we have taken for user
input was using system dot in dot read
now once we know about this exception
class and how to handle the exception
let's try to pick the input from the
user using bufferedreader now for that
what we'll be doing is again we'll be
asking the user to enter a number but
using bufferedreader is bit difficult I
mean normally people people don't prefer
to use bufferedreader to make the input
we use scanner but should I wanted
reading about buffer heater because
using before we can't cover some of the
topics which we should want to talk
about in exceptions
now basically how you take input from
the user
so you have to answer three questions
when you talk about bufferedreader it is
what where and how okay so what data
you're getting from where you're getting
it and in which format you're getting
which is how okay so now let me create
the object of before that will say
buffered reader BR equal to new buffered
reader now that's how you could object
of bufferedreader will say before reader
now if you see this buffered reader is
asking you for the object okay which
object is asking for
so it means let me just controls sake
onto a space it you can see
bufferedreader these are asking for an
object of reader now basically it is
asking you for the object of input
stream reader that means in order to
create object of bufferedreader first we
have to create object of input stream
reader so what we'll do is we'll come
here we'll say input stream reader will
emit as is equal to new input stream
reader and now this will ask you for the
object of system dot n okay so when you
wait anyway you want to create an object
of bufferedreader first you have to
create object of inputstreamreader
then only you can you can pass that
object here in bufferedreader so you
will get this object but to create
object of inputstreamreader you have to
pass system dot n okay and all the stuff
from here and now we got the
a bufferedreader so what we are doing
here is we're specifying from where we
are getting the input so we are getting
the input from the keyboard because when
you say system dot n so this n
represents your it's represent an object
which will take the input input from the
keyboard and it will convert that into a
stream format now that stream goes to
you goes into your before and using B R
now you can take the input so let's let
me save that value in int n and we can
simply say BR dot read read line so
that's some method which we use to take
the input the only concern here is this
red line gives you a string okay so it
gives you a string what we want is int
so we have to convert this into our
integer format now how do we do that so
we have a method called as pass end so
pass ain't is a method which will take
this string so it will take a string and
it will give you the integer but the
only thing is parseint is a static
method so we have to use a class
template for that and the class name is
integer so whenever you want to convert
a normal string into integer we have to
use integer or passing the problem is
even if you enter number let's say if
you enter 45 so that 45 will be coming
in double quotes so even if you say 45
from the you site will incoming as a
string format what this passing will do
is it will convert that string format
into integer format so it was remove
this it will remove the double quotes
from a string format it will give you
the integer format and once you got that
let me just print the value will say
system dot out dot println n and I think
it should work now if I run this code
you can see it's asking for the number
45 enter you got 45 okay so yeah that's
how you take the input from the user but
this time we have used both what we do
in fact in bufferedreader if you see
this object which is I as is used only
once right so what you can do is you can
cut this part and you can paste it here
so you don't have to create the objects
operate like and now still it will work
if I if I run this if I say 78 you've
got 70
so that's how you use before we do take
the input from the user in the next
video we'll talk about we'll talk about
checked exception and after that we'll
talk about scanner class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
