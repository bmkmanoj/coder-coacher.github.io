we will learn how to use MySQL workbench
now masks you'll work bench is a GUI
software or GUI version of MySQL console
so to in order to use workbench
what we need is first we need a mask
you'll set up in your machine so you can
just verify if you have masculine so
just search for MySQL command line
client so if you don't have this
software just go to Google and search
for MySQL download so if you type mask
on download it will navigate to the
website where you can download this
setup so first you have to install this
MySQL command line so when you open this
mask will come online it will ask you
for a password now you can set this
password while installation you know
when you install this mask off I it will
go into two steps this step one will be
the setup the second step will be the
configuration so once you go for the
configuration it will ask you for a
password so while configuring your mask
is for the first time you have to set a
password which you can remember and
which is difficult to crack since I am
using this machine only for I'm using
this mask you'll only for the testing
purpose the password I am using here is
0 so if I just enter 0 and ok so that's
how that's how your mask you'll console
looks like now in this mask you'll
console we can create database we can
create tables we can insert values we
can fire lots of queries but the problem
is everything you fire here will be
console-based let me give an example so
let's say if I want to create a database
so we say create database maybe ABC so I
have this database which is ABC you have
to give a semicolon at it on the line
and when you say enter so it says query
ok a one-way affected but everything you
do here with Spencer is console-based
right you cannot edit once you have done
with the typing so there are lots of
problem here you know when you when you
walk on console sometimes we need lots
of features we need logging we need
utilities we need libraries so for that
this is not enough light so this console
level application is not enough so what
we need for that is a GUI software
something with a type of IDE maybe where
you can you will get all the features
like we have a dog here utilities we
have bug reporter so we have not
something available you so in order to
use workbench you can just go to Google
and search for MySQL workbench download
the software you can it will be easy to
go now maybe in future early making how
to I will be making a video on how to
install MySQL conferring a mask on how
to install workbench but I'm assuming
that these are very simple steps you can
follow so just go to google and you can
just download as next-next connection
when you install the software what you
do we accept you accept the agreement
which if you without a choice and then
you install the software
I didn't same way you have to install
MySQL you have to configure MySQL and
then you have to install workbench now
once you have done with the install
installation of workbench and when you
open the software it will look something
in this way maybe this thing will not be
there but everything will be there is no
same that same way the first thing we
have to do is we have to connect your
Maskell workbench with the database and
maybe you in your system will not be
having any database but by default when
you install a mask you'll it will create
the database for you one will be test
second will be information schema and
third will be form ask you so what we'll
do is we'll click on this database here
and say connect to database
now when you say connect to database I'm
getting a option of local instance my
ask you so I will click here okay and
then it will ask you for the host name
so if I say host leaf I I have to give
the Machine address here in which I have
my mask ul that I've done since I am
using the same machine for this setup
you know what you can do you can install
a mask you'll system in other machine
and you can install a workbench in other
machine provided they are it belong to
the same network so you have to provide
a local on-site ratio because here we
are working to the same machine or you
can also give the loopback address which
is 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1 and then you
have to specify the port number so the
default port number for mask ul is 3 3 0
6 you can also specify it size 7 if your
database configure
seven but since I'm using with the
default port number are we going for
three three zero six this option will be
there when you configure your mask
you'll then you have to specify the
username so by default when you install
mask you'll the username will be root
and it will ask you password later and
that's it so once you type all this data
which is all the way there you can click
on OK now once you click on OK it will
ask you for a password
now this password is same as you have in
mask your console so the password I'm
using here is zero and if I click on ok
that's how my mask you'll front looked
like simple right
so this is your mask up front
that's why not mask up front is math
girlfriend like wall pen so this is this
is how you have to use well pen so you
can see this is the list of databases
you have in your system - all your
database available here then we have
option of distance startup and shutdown
and this is the output window you will
be getting the output so what we'll do
is first we'll create our database so
you can have a you can have a number of
so you can create any database here
since we already have created a database
here which is ABC what we can simply do
is we'll say use ABC so this is the
available database I'm having in my
system and to execute this query you
know in the mask you everything becomes
a query right so if you want to execute
this query we can simply say control in
control enter so as soon as you say
control enter it will use that database
ok today it will execute that query the
second step you have to follow here is
where we have we have to create table ok
but how to get a table how to insert
those values that we'll see in the next
part of the tutorial so I hope your you
got some idea about masks um ask your
bench and how to connect your mask your
bulk bench with the mask your database
or mask you
so so that's one this video so thanks
for watching and do subscribe and keep
thumbs up that matters so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
