aggregate functions and how to use alias
in SQL in this video we'll see order by
Clause now if you if you talk about this
table I have certain records certain
rows now what we want to do is I want to
print all the records in the in the
order of marks so let's say if we have
to start from ascending order to
descending order so what we can do is we
can simply say select star from student
now if I execute this query select star
from student I will get all the rows in
this format right what I want to know is
I want to get the order in ascending
order of the marks so what we can simply
do is here we can write order by we can
write marks and if I order by a mouse
and if I print this if I run this so you
can see we have we got all the cards in
the order of marks so it is 2050 70 277
90 and 95 simple right we can also order
with age so instead of writing marks we
can write age now it will order it by
age format okay let's get back to Mark's
there so I have to say marks now let's
say I want to print the same thing and
descending order so it's very easy right
we can simply type descending here so if
you write Dec it will convert this order
into descending order and if I done this
you can see 95 comes up then we have
1977 okay so this is how you have to use
order by clause in masculine SQL okay
normally if we talk about MySQL Oracle
they all follow the same SQL syntax so
this statement will work in all
different type of DBMS so in order to
print in a sequence of any particular
column we have to use order by Clause
okay so that's it from this order by
clause and the next part will talk about
different top</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
