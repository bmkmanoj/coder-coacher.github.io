this video let's find out which is the
best language for Europe in 2018 welcome
back Aryan final is ready and let's get
started
so how do you keep the language and
choosing a language with almost same as
buying on your phone not just because
your friend is using a phone you will
not buy the same point right because you
have a different requirement so based on
the requirement you do to the mobile
phone it is same way based on the
requirement you choose the language
again language is just a tool for
software development yeah so in soft and
although we have lots of things it's all
about 12 solving so depend upon
different problems different up on
different solutions where you will
implement it maybe you want to build a
mobile solution you want to build AI
solution maybe you want to build a
enterprise solution so based on
different above solutions we have
different language to work with so let's
find out which which which one will suit
it for you again before going ahead and
let me click let me make it clear
none of the language is perfect it's all
depend upon your requirement you have to
choose so in no particular order let's
start with piping so don't be too
frightened now if you're a beginner
in programming so let's say you have not
done any programming before if you want
to choose a language I would say Python
because learning directly Java and
c-sharp is not that easy right so you
want easy language to learn and trust me
python is easy to learn next it is the
fastest growing language from last 2
years thanks to the stash of stack of
flow on github according to them python
is the fastest growing language now if
you want to go for machine learning if
you want to go for AI python is the best
option not just because it is best is
just because there are so many
frameworks and that is available for
machine learning and if you go to google
and if you search for any machine
learning course they might recommend you
Python the next one is Java now when you
choose Java it doesn't matter if you
like it or not
Java is everywhere now if we talk about
enterprise market mobile market the big
it of world everyone is using Java not
because it is best it's because it was
open-source and initially they adopted
Java
now since initially adoption was Java so
everywhere they are working on Java I
mean there are some technologies like
languages like hot line Python they
might replace Java in future but it's a
long way going but if you want to get
into industry now
and if you want to earn a lot of money
Java is everywhere right if you talk
about mobile if you like platform you
have Android so to build Android
applications we can use Python because
part line but then part is not that
efficient in terms of Android now maybe
in future it might be but if you want to
make an entire application now it's Java
or Portland again Portland is emerging
now but then we don't have much
resources available for quatrain and if
you if you face some issues we don't
have much resources right but in terms
of Java we have so many sources
available so the mobile platform Java is
booming thanks to Android in the
enterprise market if you talk about the
banking companies banking and financial
companies they all are using Java maybe
they don't want to switch all the
technologies because it's a big risk for
them so Java is there and if we talk
about the beginner world the Hadoop
framework it is which is built on Java
this is one way advantage of learning
Java you know if you know Java if that's
a base language you can switch to other
language very easy example if you want
to learn cotton in future you can if you
know Java you can learn it very easily
if you want to go for Scala if you know
Java you can learn Scala very easily in
fact I have learned Portland and Scala
maybe in one week or maybe do the
content into this and Scala in one week
just because I was knowing Java you know
could wait so that's the advantage of
learning Java as a language so those two
recap if you want to get into enterprise
small if you want to go for mobile
application like Android Java would be
the best option the next one is
JavaScript now initially JavaScript what
just event in technology right if you
want to build a good UI which is in fact
you used to use JavaScript but now Java
step is everywhere so just learn one
language and you can walk everywhere so
you can build a UI
thanks to angularjs Mooji s reactions
you can build the backend part and
node.js and you can also go for a
database in a Jaa's that's weird I know
but then we have MongoDB right and then
we have a framework to manage all this
which is expressed or experienced so
using one stack which is one means that
you can build the entire application in
fact mobile application so you can also
put a mobile application using
javascript yeah so javascript is
everywhere so if you want to learn one
language for like a thing go for Java
start the next one is PHP now if you are
sure you want to go for web program
you're not you don't want to go from
Android you don't want to go for desktop
you don't want to go for enterprise
market you want to go for web app
development I would say go for PHP easy
to learn and you can deploy your
application very easily right so we have
so many hosting services available for
PHP we have it's easy to work on and
there's so many resources available if
unique you are facing some issues we
have lots of resources on stripe or PHP
now if you just want to make it more
elegant if you want to make it more
effective you can also go for Ruby
because Ruby is easy to learn again and
it's more than again compared to other
other web technologies like Java C sharp
and a PhD now when you go to C sure what
if you want to build one application or
maybe if you want to put one and that
application that mobile application you
want to run on all different OS maybe
iOS Android and Windows Phone do we use
it really Windows Phone nowadays you
know so if you want to run your
application on Android on iOS you can
build an application using c-sharp
thanks to Sam Lin so you see you can use
sampling I can write so you shop code
there and you can go up you can run that
on Android and iOS at the same time I
mean one code awesome right now so
that's one way the another thing is C
shop is open source now in fact it
octane type form is open source and may
be different at different industry in
future will be may choose C sure yeah
and if you want to go for Microsoft if
you are sure you want to get into
Microsoft ecosystem I would say C shop
is the best thing to go for it's also a
functional programming just like Java
and Scala so now in Java 8 it is
functional now and with Java 9 we have
so many new features right so again
that's the apart but then C shop is also
functional the next one well now when
you will go for swept
now if you want to get into Apple world
if you want to get into Apple ecosystem
you can go for sweat if you want to make
be a iOS developer if you want to be a
Mac OS developer you can go for sweat it
is the best one to go for now if you
want to get into iOS and the one looks
like there's one more thing
I a swift is now open source so in
future they might be different industry
they might choose swept for the for the
future development now when to choose C
and C++ now it should be first one right
but then as I mentioned there is no
particular order now if you want to go
for get game development if you want to
go for MA
programming I would say C and C++ is the
best option so you can we can build
embedded software's and if you want to
go for game it's the best option so
after looking at all these languages
which one to sell it so again as I
mentioned it's all about technology it's
a Selectric technology first will be
mobile enterprise all web and depend
upon that choose a good language for you
and also if you can learn multiple
language like you know one language from
functional programming one language from
opportunity program it will be helpful
for you in the future thank you so much
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
