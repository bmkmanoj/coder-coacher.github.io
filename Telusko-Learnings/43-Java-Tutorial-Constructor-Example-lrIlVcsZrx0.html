so in this video we'll try to explore
more about this stuff here so you can
see this calc and the round brackets now
if you can observe closely this name is
same as the class name right and it has
the round brackets and whenever you use
a round bracket it simply means a method
right so it looks like a method but it
has the same name as the class name so
that is weird right so this thing here
it is called as constructor so whenever
you create an object so whenever you
create an object by saying new calc that
calc and bracket is a constructor and
construct is a very important thing when
you are getting the object now how that
works so just to define that let me
remove this method which is perform let
me just clean the code a bit for you let
me remove all this stuff so what we have
we have this three variables here and
now this int result is only for the
fetching the output right let me remove
this so this is your constructor now how
do we define a constructor so we have to
say calc obj equal a new calc so when
you say this calc it will call the
constructor but holdout it is calling a
constructor and we don't have the
constructor in our class how it is doing
that so what happens is Java says okay
see we know that whenever you create an
object you have to call a constructor
then why you need to create a
constructor I will give it for you so by
default Java gives you the constructor
for calc the constructor with Java gives
you only does one thing it allocates the
memory that said nothing else so the
constructor which is given by in Java
world it is only for allocating the
memory what I want is I want a
constructor who will assign the value so
let's say I want to assign the initial
value of num1 and num2 as 5 and 5 what
the value should be 5 because by default
the value is 0 right example if I try to
print the value of num1 if i say system
dot out dot println obj dot now 1 if i
try to print that the output it is
giving me is 0 right I don't want 0 I
want the default value to be 5 so what
you can do is you can define the
constructor by yourself so you can say
public calc
that's how you can define your own
constructor now point should remember
our constructor has the same name as
class name that's very important
second
doctor never returns anything and that's
why you cannot write a written type
there
we can't specify and you can specify
float even if you specify that you know
it will not give you a letter but it
will not be a constructor now so if you
want to have that feature of constructor
we should not write any written type
there so point remember constructor name
should be same as class name and second
it doesn't return any value the third
point is we don't have to call the
constructor it will be called
automatically when the object is created
so as soon as you say new calc it will
create the object for you plus it will
also call the constructor so there these
are three important points for the
constructor first one constructor need
to have the same name as class name
second constructor doesn't return any
value third whenever you create the
object constructor will be called
automatically so whatever doing this
constructor is I will I want to say num1
equal to let's say five and for both the
variables in fact for num1 and plus num2
or num2 also i want to assign the value
which is five and now if you get on this
code you can see we are getting the
output as five so the value of num1 is
five it's because when you call the
constructor here it is getting called
and it is assigning the value of 5 2
num1 and we are printing the value here
it is that simple we can also print some
statements here let me say in
constructor so you can see we don't have
to call the constructor it will be
getting called automatically so if I run
this code now you can see we got the
output as in constructor and then we are
printing the value as 5 so it will first
call the constructor then it will print
the value so that is how you create a
constructor we have some more things
with the constructor in fact we can
create a constructor we can have to
construct in the same class example we
can say public Cal so we can have to
construct in the same class provided
they have a different signature so you
can see it is giving you error now
because you cannot have two constructors
here I'm going to be the same signature
we have to change the signature now when
you say change signature does that means
change the name that will not work right
if you if you change the weight of
constructor name then it's no more
constructor because concetration have
should have a same name as class name
but you can change the parameters here
so you can say n so you can see we have
two constructors
one which is not taking any parameter
and second which is taking the parameter
so now we have two constructors with
different signature you can say one is
without parameters and one is with
parameter now what we can do is we can
say num1 equal to n and even num2 is
equal to n so instead of assigning a
value 5 so you can see ensure of
assigning a value 5 we can pass any
value here we can pass 7 now that value
7 will be assigned to n now since you
are so while creating the object if you
pass a value it will call that
particular constructor which takes an
int value and will assign that n value
to num1 and num2 and i feel on this code
you can see we are getting the output as
7 not 5 that's how you can pass the
value but it's I don't want to pass a
int value I want to pass for 7.5 how
that works now when you are passing 7.5
of course you cannot accept that in int
right and that's why it is giving you
error so we have to create one more
constructor which is public calc which
takes a double value which is double D
again we can go for any variable name
doesn't matter and we can say num1 equal
to but again no one is an integer right
we can again cast it right we can crash
through the value of double the
important thing is not the value
assigning is the important thing is you
can pass any parameter so if it's
passing specific but I'm into like 5 7
point 5 which is double you have to
accept that bit double or when you are
passing a string you can accept musing
string that is how you create a
constructor so we can have multiple
constructors but make sure that every
constructor have a different signature
if you run this code now you can see we
are getting the value as 7 only because
we are passing 7.5 let's see if I pass
nine point five and if I'm this code it
will get casted and you will get only 9
in fact we can also pass two parameters
so we have the first one as double
second is int so we can assign the int
value to num2 and for that we have to
pass two values now what is nine point
five and let's say we are passing eight
also so you can so if you are passing
multiple values you have to accept
multiple values it's just that you have
to match the signature so the number of
variables you are passing here you just
have to match the signature here so we
can have multiple constructors with
different signatures so this one is for
default constructor because it is it
does not have any parameter now why is
for
because even if you don't mention this
constructor I mean if you don't have any
constructor by default you're J your
system will give you one constructor
that's what is called as default
constructor and the other constituents
are called as parameterised constructor
again we'll talk about constructor more
when we when we moved towards
inheritance concept but time being this
is what you have to remember about
constructors so that's it that's it
about constructors in this video see you
