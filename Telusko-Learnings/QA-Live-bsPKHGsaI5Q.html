about the hell so let me check that my
YouTube life control says swimming is
good ah feeling tired today okay so we
are live from last 15 17 seconds and I
hope I'm properly visible there and okay
it's troll streaming okay I got two
likes as well okay why it's so slow
today oh oh we are not white so we are
going right so okay so I'm shaking my
voice how how it goes okay it seems
everything is good we are live so I'm
here just to answer your questions today
okay nothing else nothing to announce
nothing to talk about
because last two last week I went live
with one of my friend Abbi shake and
then I got lots of questions if we tried
our best to answer all of your questions
but then due to time constraint due to
network issues there were lots of things
so I thought okay let's have one more
live session but then this time we'll
only go for technical questions to
pushes like related to my genre or what
you say my area right so let's let's see
what questions we get today and I can
see 50 people are watching that's
awesome okay this Saturday Saturday
evening power right I was thinking about
going live tomorrow on Sunday but then
but then I got I mean I remember
something that today tomorrow is Sunday
and it's india-pakistan match right so
no one will be watching my session right
everyone will be Z member watching the
india-pakistan match so I thought like
let's do it today itself because I was I
got free from my work today and let's
see
ok so 56 people are watching and we got
9 likes that's great ok so soon I will
start with the coefficient answer just
before that I want to just check the
health if everything is going good so
YouTube says health is good we are
streaming at 720 720p and everything
seems good ok so the district one more
thing about the thumbnail of the video
thumbnail of the video is very very
weird
okay everything seems good okay and I
got lots of questions
okay so buffering is it buffering still
I don't know is it buffering now okay
that's it looks fine from my side and
what is the best tool to learn for
automation testing okay so the code this
question is from Ravi Teja what is the
best tool to learn from automate for for
automation testing
I'm not into automation as of as a thing
but then I got to know from different
people that for automation people use a
selenium software for testing I guess
there are lots of testing software
available the most of the requirements I
get for selenium in fact the online
batches which I take so these are the
people who want to go for selenium and
that's why they want to learn Java so I
don't know I don't teach selenium anyway
but then I know that for testing they
people do go with selenium as a
developer we we normally do unit testing
first so we do unit testing and then we
go for the integration testing so for
unit testing people use J unit okay so
all Georgia lapaz they use J unit and
for automation they use a selenium okay
so we got once you are two people
watching in just 10 min just 5 minutes
that's awesome that's an awesome thing
great in fact not you want 5 minutes
it's been only one and one point 10
seconds or is it - it's two minutes okay
that's great okay so what's the best
tool to learn that's that's unser
okay next Kilty hello Sergey hi Kathy hi
Jordan and Sonia kill Plata okay so we
have lots of people today - great ok so
next question is from Hersh Pandey hi
hush your question is how to develop
logics for programming ok now this is
actually very tricky you know because
how to build logic now first of all see
we everyone have a different way of
thinking right in fact we are born
different this education system just the
system of education they are trying to
change our mind but then we all are born
differently right within a different way
for every problem we have a different
solutions right now there are some
people who are good with problem solving
there are some people
not bad quit with problem-solving
because from their childhood they have
not solved much of the problems right
see logic building is not something we
can build in one day or one week it
takes lots of time so there are some
people they are they have a good logic
because from their childhood itself they
are solving different problems right
maybe because of the financial issues
because of their a friend circle issue
so there are these are people they are
solving issues the other people I mean
there are there are kind of people they
don't know how to select solve a problem
they always run away from from the
problem right so from the childhood if
you add that person who are running away
from the problem it will be very
difficult for you to solve these
programming problems I mean trust me
that that actually works in fact you
must have heard about this concept if
you are good at maths you are by default
good at programming it's because from
your childhood if you're good at maths
that means you are solving lots of
mathematical problems right you know how
to solve those equality I mean how to
how to say hence proof you know that's
how something right when you when you
were in school we used to get we used to
solve Matt's question and the ways to
have our HS l H is equal to RHS and we
should say hence proved so if you are
that kind of person who can solve any
issue the programming will be good but
then if you are not good with program if
you're not built with logic till this
point how do we improve it so you have
to work very hard so from your childhood
what you have not done you have to do it
now right so this is the best time you
have to start coding now when I say you
have to build a logic you have to do a
daily practice so when I when I started
programming I guess it was in my second
year be a beast beast BSC not BCA so I
was doing BSC IT so when I was learning
programming I used to work for 2 to 3
hours on coding not just programming but
then solving different things example
data structures one of the best thing
you know so in data structures and
algorithms will be having lots of
algorithms like bubblesort quicksort
then searching algorithms then there are
lots of stuff so try to solve those
issues now first of all learn those
concepts depend programming or different
algorithms try to implement this
algorithm by yourself that will teach
you how to think in a programming way
then create your own questions create
your own problem and try to solve that
so daily when you crack
you will get lots of stuff in fact I one
of the reason why I mean how I include
improved my logic is by participating in
competitions so in Mumbai when I was in
my college I used to participate in lots
of competitions I used to lose more most
of them in the first year but then I
thought okay let's improve my logic size
to practice I used to practice not to
achieve something but then to win the
competitions I mean not to I was not
having a lot what you say a long goal I
don't I was not thinking about getting a
job I was thinking about how to win
tomorrow's competition how to win the
next week competition and that's how I
was practicing my logic and by that
whatever whatever logic I have now or
the skills I have Noi's all because of
those competitions so participate
nowadays we have what what do you have
we have this concept called as
hackathons the new pact is there I mean
do participate or even if you lose
that's fine but do participate it will
teach you lots of things right so that's
how you can improve so it's a big it's a
huge practice the next person for Maalik
okay Maalik
can you please upload more videos about
hibernate and spring okay so so okay now
that's a good point
why I'm not uploading more videos other
thing is see a Java when you talk about
Co Java it's a very normal field where
everyone wants to learn kochava it
doesn't matter from which field you are
everyone want to learn go Java and then
I thought about you know everyone want
to learn Co Java doesn't matter which
what you want to be in future if you
want even even to want to be a tester
you have you should know Java if you
want to be a dollar per you should know
Java if you want to be a what you say
suicide programmer as well you should
know Java even if you want to be a tech
guy you should know Java so for every
one Java is very very important right so
in Java is so important so what I
thought ok let's make videos on that
let's teach people Java because everyone
one should learn Java but the moment you
talk about the enterprise world we talk
about solid JSP or no not solid is the
spring and hibernate these are what you
say a generic way or not generic field
but then this of a specific fields now
if you want to be going go into a
specific you know so I thought okay
let's do life go so what I'm doing now
is I'm doing life goes on spring and
so that's why I'm not making videos
because if you want to learn some
high-end frameworks it's better to learn
it live right or maybe some good quality
videos so I'll be making hibernate and
spring videos but then not in this
channel so I have another channel right
which you know telescope low so I'll be
uploading those videos there okay now
for multiple reasons first reason is not
everyone want to learn such as a JSP
everytime everyone want to learn
hibernate and spring right not everyone
want to learn that if you want to learn
that you can pay around 95 bees per
month that's not that's not a big amount
right so yes more videos are on the way
but that will be on that is capital but
the generic videos which everyone won't
want to learn the basics of hibernate
basics of spring and and entire code
Java it is freely available on terrace
for learning and it will be available
for a lifetime
ok so it's a win-win situation both for
both the Android that's why okay so oh
well so many questions okay I forgot
where there was I were to look for the
next question now okay so I have to
scroll up scroll obscure waste by
question yeah next is g1 ready says yeah
India vs. Pakistan yeah that's right we
have a next game as India vs. Pakistan
great so tomorrow I'm busy okay watching
match again next how would I become a
good programmer okay okay so when you
want to be a good programmer you have to
increase your logic and we haven't
already answered that question next how
to start learning artificial
intelligence and okay how to start ok
our to learn a I first of all you have
to be very specific in which field you
want to go into AI we have machine
learning we have deep learning then we
have the vortex so first you find what
you want to do Sigma R to Center is a
very big it's a huge topic right so what
I would suggest is there is there are
lots of course available on on Udacity
ok so if you don't know about your said
Udacity just go to Google and search for
Udacity it's UD a CIT y so you go to the
website and so there are some courses
for a for AI so join those courses and
you can learn a I in fact there are lots
of videos on YouTube as well but the
only problem is if you if you don't know
about you if you don't know about AI
March I would I would recommend you to
go to you
ready for AI again I guess they will
charge you for that but then that's fine
right you can pay around fourteen
thousand rupees I guess the charge is
fourteen thousand rupees for the entire
course but just imagine you are not
lying some small courses while you are
doing AI and paying put in fourteen
thousand four that is not a big amount
right okay next I'm currently learning
PHP and Python how can I start with
restful api with this okay first of all
weekend classes ok weekend lessons
that's a good good channel name I don't
have much idea about PHP and Python in
terms of HTTP is for that I would
recommend you to search for people who
know PHP so just go to youtube and
search for PHP tutorials and search if
they have restful services there because
rest is a concept which is available on
all the different languages so you can
learn restful services in Java from my
end from my channel but I'm not sure
about how do we implement that in PHP
and and Python there might be some
resources available there no idea ok
next question for from Manish a hi
Manisha so which language should I go
forward after learning HTML CSS
JavaScript and jQuery ok so if you have
learned all these things that means you
are already a web designer right so
congratulations Manish you are a web
designer now is just that it depends
what you want to do in future so if you
continue want if you want to continue
with web designing I would recommend you
to learn about a bootstrap as well try
to improve your skills on Photoshop
quatl draw because if you see if you
know about HTML CSS JavaScript and
jQuery that means you are on the front
end of the you are working on the front
end side right so if you want to stay in
front inside do also work on PHP as well
PHP or do also work on Photoshop paddle
draw because this software will be
helped to make you good images right and
good designs so but if you want to go
into back-end maybe if you want to write
server-side scripting then you can do to
learn it easily go for PHP because PHP
is easy to learn you can go for PHP if
you want to get into enterprise world go
for Java so so first of all you defined
what you want to be I would suggest to
go for Java of course because it
you want to join a big company if you
want to be work on enterprise world but
if you want to make a quick start
because Java will take lots of time you
know it takes around three to four
months to get that just into Java but if
you want to make it very quick go for
Python go for PHP in fact the lots of
job available for PHP as well right so
go for that okay so next version from
Binney hybrid aha okay so question is
how good is to learn Java in 2017 a Java
is good to learn in 2000 eighteen
nineteen twenty Twenty twenty one twenty
five thirty everywhere so Java is still
is still there in the company in the
enterprise world
I'm sure jar will be there for a long
time because see if we are not living in
a world of Android okay we are not just
using mobile phones this there is some
servers running behind the scene right I
mean think about Amazon think about
Facebook think about LinkedIn think
about Twitter do you think all these
things are working on your Android do
you think there's all these things are
only working on Python not exactly one
big server if you talk about the
enterprise server they are using
multiple technologies and the core of
all those connections is Java because
when you talk about big data when talk
about enterprise software they all are
working on Java technology so even if
you change let's say you got hot lean
now even if you think partly is better
than Java it is for Android but the
moment to talk about enterprise world
even if you think cotton is better than
Java this people then the big companies
they will not change the servers from
Java to Portland it takes lots of
efforts it takes lots of liquid
resources so they will not do that so
Java is still there it will be there for
a long time ok next question from AJ
when will start working on Android live
project yeah that's okay so when from
next week a mostly from to what I think
I'm planning to do that but tomorrow is
a match so I have to postpone my plan
now I don't want everyone to be busy
with match and I'm making a live session
just imagine you know you'll be having
two laptops together one laptop you are
watching a live session second laptop
you are watching a match you cannot
concentrate on one thing I want you to
support Indian team right so maybe maybe
if you did that doesn't matter which
country you from so you're from Pakistan
you can support your own team
then you have to support them right who
will either other than who I mean if
you're not supporting who will support
so so let's see if we can if I can do
that in bonding sessions so if you can
do that in morning live I will do that
otherwise Monday Tuesday let's see how
to do that okay next question from our
SK so can you make a video on how
portaling can be implemented with
Android application yes we are doing
that that's the license for right so
initially I will go with Java Android
and once we complete Java thing or maybe
if you done half with Java and Android
will start with cotton as well right so
it's it's on the way okay next is
someone and you are blocked my friend
which is edit so I stopped using bad
things blocked so I'll plan to block you
from the channel as well okay sir is
there is a rescission in CSI Department
is it true Oh see it's not recession
what you talking about I mean you might
have heard about lots of be lots of
companies they are what you say they are
removing employees or what you say
laying off are the only thing is you
know maybe they are not getting enough
projects recession is bit different from
not getting projects okay so what
happens is this US companies they
outsource their project to Indian
companies and then there might be
they're not outsourcing project because
of lots of these lots of things you know
what I'm talking about
so today's are not on the way but then
they are removing people who are not
that efficient the job so if you are
efficient in the job you don't have to
worry about the job okay they will not
remove you so if you have a talent even
if they remove you that's fine this is a
different company waiting for you right
but yeah if you don't like your job if
you are not including yourself then then
you can think about letting go of okay
so you have to make sure that you
improve yourself okay our next question
from Vijay how long it will take for me
to familiar with JavaScript if you are
new to programming it will take around 2
to 3 weeks to learn JavaScript but then
2 to 3 weeks only to learn JavaScript
learning and implementing so two
different things
implementing it in a proper way will
take one
two months more but if but if you know
see programming before you know how to
programming works then you can learn
JavaScript in one week and implementing
next two weeks two weeks two days in
JavaScript and that okay so one of my
one of my intern say is two weeks will
be enough two days is okay maybe two
days I have learned JavaScript in one
week because I am not that good with the
Trenton languages but then in turn say
is it is possible in two days you have
done that and that's awesome okay yeah
next question from which to choose
angularjs or angular 2
oh of course to why you will choose
angular 1 I guess they are also coming
with angular 3 now I just heard about it
I don't know much in Hunton technologies
so think about it just google it which
one is latest one and all of course
right I would go for latest one of
course right and now we got 160 people
watching that's awesome guys and I can
see only 48 likes that's weird if you
are watching this live make sure uses
you also click on the like button have
you done that lifting to click on the
like button good ok so yeah that's
that's what we call 52 likes and we got
two dislikes we got three days likes
that's bad ok so now what's the future
of a programmer
what's a future programmer future of
programmer is enjoying the life and
making money again depend so now if you
enjoy programming then it's a good you
have a good future that's a weird
question but ok a question from
Venkatesh which is better between Java
and Python both are best in their own
own own region if you want to do
scripting if you want to get into
hacking security of course pythons one
of the best language but if you want to
going to an enterprise world making
beaded applications of course you will
go for Java so both are good it depends
upon what you want to learn in future
what you want to do in future okay next
is Dennis can we screen separate
tutorial on Multi 10c multi-tenancy
what's that I don't know multi 10c in
spring boot I know spring board I don't
know it is multi 10c that's new for me
no idea okay multi-tenancy no need to
check that I will check that after the
session and let's see can you do the
form do it for me talking to search for
multi-tenancy it's multi yeah
multi-tenancy yeah search for that
please
okay next can you teach web services yes
and I will be uploading videos on web
services as well it's all the way it's
on the way don't worry
now that services will be using with the
help of REST API is it on the way but
then again I am trying to do that on the
new channel visitor disco pro so you
have to make sure that you subscribe the
channel and guys it is 95 rupees only
for the month okay don't get a big issue
for that okay so I can see it is oh its
ass
singleton see was a 10 single tenancy
was this multi-tenancy debate that's a
diva new topic for me no okay we'll
check which a twitch like that data ok
next is how to learn ionic framework how
to run an app framework ok that's a good
question
to learn on ik framework first of all
you should know how Android apps works
how do you how do you make Android
applications not exact development but
then you should know how what is layout
and how do you put buttons next to learn
ionic you should be familiar with Java
Script as well okay I'm not worked on
ionic but then I have some of my friends
who are working on a UNIX so so they are
using Java Script I guess so we have a
Java Script so ionic is a is used to
make an application using javascript so
first you should also know JavaScript
okay then you can learn ionic ok so next
question from how to stop from Vishnu a
high wish no your question is I am beat
a graduate I am good at data structures
and algorithms ok but I don't know
anything about software what solution do
you give me as a fresher if you don't
know about software build a software
okay see if you know programming if you
know data structures the best thing is
learn software engineering I mean not
the entire subject but then how to build
a software what has different phases
available
and build a small application I'm not
asking you to build your own Facebook
but then you can build a small
application right this will give you
confidence in fact I have seen lots of
people they know programming okay they
are very good with programming but they
don't know how to build us off right so
one of the reason of the way you can do
that is build a small software or you
can watch my live sessions right I am
doing live sessions on Java I'm making
my own website on on live on YouTube so
we do have a recording of a recording
available on YouTube channel so just
search for the playlist Java web
development your Java development life
or if you want to go into Android I am
doing the live session on Android soon
that's which it's on the way that's how
you will learn how to make software's
okay okay Akil says I want to know about
polymorphism akhil this is a live
session we will be having normal chat if
you don't know about polymorphism I do
have a video on that just watch that it
will give you a good thing okay next
question from up Akshay
please start teaching on machine
learning okay Akshay I don't know
machine learning so how can I teach you
I don't want to teach you anything which
I don't know see there are lots of
people what they do is they learn from
other channels and they make videos
right in fact I have seen lots of people
what they do they copy other channels
they copy other websites and they make
videos I can do that but the only
problem is you know when I teach
something I want to make sure that I
know that completely example if I teach
you about Android I have to make sure
that I know Android properly if I teach
you Java I should be confirmed that I
know Java right so I'm not touching any
of this technology because I'm not
comfortable with that
the moment I become variable in machine
learning I'm sure they will be making
more video on that but even if I do that
it will take lots of time okay next
question from Tech nap any idea for
making tutorials on MongoDB the same
thing I don't know MongoDB so I mean I
have done one or two examples are
MongoDB but I'm not comfortable in that
I just want to be comfortable before
making videos okay next question from
Abhishek how to learn Java advanced
how to learn by watching videos okay if
your question is I mean
where to start so if you want to go for
advanced Java so first you have to be
very sure that you know Co Java okay
multi-threading collections and all
those things once you do that you can
start with sublet so this is the steps
servlet JSP while doing surveys we will
also learn JDBC then hibernate and
spring so these are the steps you have
to follow right and trust me once you
know Spring Framework you will be like
Oh a golden spoon right everywhere every
company will want you if you know Spring
Framework in fact I have seen lots of
requirements nowadays if I go to
different portals everywhere you can see
we have we have this thing which is
called as spring so there everyone want
people who know spring because spring is
one of the best technology now sometime
just showing this video on Facebook okay
I'm sure you will be doing that as well
so if you want to support any scholar
thing just share this video with your
friends on Facebook and just use a
hashtag called as hash to disco so that
I can track who is sharing who is not
sharing right so just go to Facebook and
share this video so I need your support
here guys just do that I'm doing that
live on YouTube okay everything seems
good okay next question from okay Wow I
don't know when I go live I always I
always want to eat something I feel
hungry when I go live I don't know why I
can next waiting a from David a waiting
fall Android web development tutorials
series from telesco Android I will do
that game development I will not do that
okay I'm not good with gaming's
so Android will be coming gaming I'm not
good with gaming even if even if I try
if I like it then I will make the videos
because gaming needs lots of extra
things as well it's not easy to make
games right okay next money will says so
is it enough to know spring MVC and
hibernate but not mavin Oh
Madden is very important guy mavin is
very very important because when you
build application using hibernate and
spraying you should know how to I mean
if you build an application using spring
and hibernate you should know how to
build a project right so memory is very
important and Men is not that difficult
to
right you can learn mammal in two days
or one day but yes mavin is important to
learn good okay so question from
ramamoorthy any idea on Salesforce no
idea no idea I don't want to miss guide
you on Salesforce and I don't know much
about Salesforce you know about
Salesforce you're Bakuman Salesforce no
I don't know okay
you're talking about Abby shake okay
next question from Rahul okay we we have
some dps on deep lenka a hi Sandeep okay
next Rahul why DSA is important you're
talking about the algorithm DSA or data
structures oh why data structure is
important because they're multiple
reason why DHS data such as important
first reason data structure will we'll
teach you how your programming works in
the backend example in Java itself you
know in let's see let's imagine if
you're learning Java now maybe you can
learn in like any language but I know
javis I can give you example of Java
here so let's say if you learn Java and
in Java we write this statement let's
say if you have a class for less a if I
say a obj go to a new a and suddenly I
will say you know a obj Oh bitch is a
reference and new a is an object objects
gets created inside heap memory and the
references goes in stack memory I will
say that that's it now you have to
understand what is stack when what is
heap right how would you know how heap
works how would you know how stack works
how would you know how queue works right
so to understand that you should know
data structures why algorithm algorithm
is important because first you should
know what is algorithm what are the
algorithms are whenever in the world and
if you want to create your own algorithm
how will you do that right so data
structures and algorithm is very
important for your career if you want to
be a developer and even for the
interviews they will ask you questions
on data structures so on both the side
you have to learn that you don't have a
choice okay so I just share this video
on YouTube and I can see on Facebook I
can see some likes there I don't know if
you have shared that do make sure guys
just go through address bar copy the
link and paste it on your Facebook wall
okay next question
a five minutes more guys and I am
filling
right now five minutes more okay let's
go with some more questions okay next
question from a JIT info about network
topology I was thinking about making
videos on networking as well but I'm not
getting time from the Java technology
itself we know when I when I when I'm
trying to sleep in the night I always
dream about not dreaming but I think
about this thing what to make I mean
what what should I do to borrow okay I
this habit you know I guess it's a good
SAP good habit so what you want to do
today you have to plan that in the last
night so it like last night before
sleeping you have to make sure that
whatever you want to do in the next day
you have to write it down so I have a
book I always write down what I'm going
to do tomorrow right the live season was
not a part of it life since I was not
written that life is in there but then
whatever tasks I was having today I have
completed all the tasks I have also
played at my tennis today so I got some
free time but then what I do is always
make sure that I write the things which
I'm gonna do it tomorrow
so I also some time I also mentioned you
know I have to make videos on security I
have to make videos on networking but
then I think myself making because on
networking which are not that good at if
you can make videos on some other other
things which aren't good at that do the
beneficials work for people right
because on YouTube there are lots of
people they are good with networking I
don't want to compete with someone what
I want to do is I want to provide good
videos right so I always make sure that
what I know better
I will teach those things example I'm
not that good with Android again I'm
saying I am NOT expert in Android ok my
expertise is in Java in spring
technology in hibernate the enterprise
software I'm not that expert in Android
not done so okay basically we have this
two different ok I wanted to tell you
this from a long time we have two
different world you know we have a
consumer voice and we have enterprise
world the moment you talk about Android
iOS PHP Python all this basically works
on the consumer side when you make it on
website like CSS HTML so when you build
an application using Android iOS or then
CSS HTML all those things so basically
are focusing on the consumer market
right so your product will be
assume by you normal users the the
normal population but then the moment
you talk about enterprise world like
Java technology then we have server-side
scripting the networking administration
all those things comes on the business
side the enterprise side so my focus is
more on the enterprise side right so
that's why I'm not making all these
videos I want to do that from from a
long time I'm trying to plan to learn
iOS and make videos on that but due to
some other constraint I'm not able to do
that so I'm not sure what videos I will
be making in future but Java Android is
on the way
I am Not sure about the other videos ok
last two questions let's see what it
goes ok ok next question next question
ok Gousha garage say is your country
name I am sorry I'm from India brought
to be an Indian giant ok but then I love
the entire world I love all my
subscriber doesn't matter from where you
are right ok last question I just to
check which question have not answered
I'm scrolling down ok which question why
the disco Pro is not available in Nepal
ok I'm not sure about that that is Co
yeah I guess it is based on countries
from which country I want to provide oh
yeah ok ok in Nepal right I guess in
Nepal they have don't have an option of
subscription YouTube have not see
YouTube started the subscription model
from us now they are moving to some
countries in future they will be going
to Nepal as well so I'm sure YouTube is
targeting the entire world but then they
are coming step by step step by step so
initially they targeted you or us then
Europe and now they are coming to India
I guess in Russia also I don't know I'm
not sure but Nepal they will be coming
soon
not now so the moment you get the moment
you get that YouTube subscription model
on in Nepal you can watch telescope oh
let me find one more solution how can i
how can I share my videos with you as
well because I want to teach everyone
why doesn't matter from where you are so

bit tired and it's been almost half an
hour now is it half an hour it's been 20
