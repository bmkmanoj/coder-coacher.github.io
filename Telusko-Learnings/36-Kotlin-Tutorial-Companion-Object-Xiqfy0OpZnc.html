companion object I'm saying that at the
end of every video I'm saying that the
next video would become Banyon object
but what exactly it means and that does
the first thing the second thing is if
you have seen all the videos
approximately we have completed 25
videos and then since in the all the
videos we have not talked about talked
about static keyword and if you are
pending some java background we love
static keywords right we don't have to
create object to call those features and
all those things and in scotland we have
not seen that yet do we have do we use
call do we use static keyword in Catalan
what if I say okay let's try that if I
say static here okay if I say static
part name don't even recognize this as
this as a keyword and you see that it
says expecting member declarations what
exactly it means so it is called static
doesn't support in court line so how do
we achieve that and somewhere they are
saying cotton and Java they are 100%
interoperable which means they should be
right and here which not getting
supported how can we achieve static
features in Cortland because number we
have to link it with Java like so what
we do is we start with the companion
object first and then they just discuss
how can we achieve static features there
now to understand to understand
companion object what I will do is I
will create a companion object as you
can see both are the keywords here again
we have talked about object before so we
have a companion object here now what is
companion object the advantage of using
this is example if I create a function
here for this function show and if I
print okay if I print something let's
say if I print hello
okay so if I want to print hello here
and I want to call this method show from
main now of course in general terms what
we do is we create an object of a class
right so we have to create object of
this a so that we can call show but what
if I say I can simply say a dot show you
can see there is no error and if I run
this code let see if it is working or
not if I say run as our done first code
dot kiddie and okay running and you can
see we got the output so can you see
that we are able to call
the object or we are able to call the
method I agree with the other class name
now you might be wondering hey this is a
static static keyword right this is a
static method here because if you are
able to call that with the others class
name that's a static method right that's
not the case what happens you know if I
go back to run on here which is our java
code see if this is 100% compare if it
is hundred percent interoperable what I
can simply do is I can say a dot show
from here as well right so I should be
say I should be able to say a dot show
from here and it's not working can you
see that we are getting an error it is
not able to find this show method now
the reason is we are thinking that this
is static method because we are able to
call some a but this is not the case now
if you remember in the other videos
where we have used object if you are
using an object keyword you can directly
call a method name right we have seen
that so this is not a static here it is
not giving you a static behavior in case
if you want to achieve that if you want
to make this static of course we cannot
use static keyword here example even if
I try that you can see it will give you
some bad words and you say hey study
doesn't support here so if you want to
use a static you have to inform hey
Cortland I am a Java programmer and some
will have to link this code with Java so
allow me to use this method or static
the way you can do that is by using an
annotation called as a trait JVM static
if you make this show as a static by
using delegation as JVM static and if I
go back to Runner and can you see that
it is working now and if I run this code
if I say is one when is that one yeah so
here it is if I said I'm not mean and if
I run this code you can see we got the
output as hello so now you are able to
call this show with the help of class
name just because we are using this
annotation here which is called as a
trait JVM static so again if you want to
use the bit if you want to use a
features of static keyword in cotton
first of all we have to use this key one
which is added a JVM static on the on
the on the on the function name
and you have to make sure that it's a
part of companion object in the
composite' let's trial it let us remove
this thing and if I say save okay we are
getting some arrow it says only
functions in the name objects are
available so you can do that in the in
object all in the companion object okay
so if you want to achieve this feature
you can do that only in companion object
or in the object scope so yeah so
indirectly when you say you want to
achieve the static keyword remember you
have to write companion object and you
have to write ad rate JVM static so
that's how you make this as a static
keyword okay and that's how you call it
so yeah that that's how we use companion
object to use static in the next video
when I talk about what else we can do
with the other companion objects now
this is one more way there's one more
thing in companion object that we can
achieve what is what is called as a
factory pattern now again if you're
coming from Java background we have we
do have lots of design patterns right we
have factory design patterns we have
single two design pattern and continents
somewhere around they they implement
those things by default so we just have
to use some keywords and they will do it
for you so in the next video we'll see
how do we use or how do we how can we
use a factory design pattern in Kotlin
so yeah that's it from this video games
we talked about companion object where
it will help you to create those static
methods again if you don't use this
annotation which is not by default
static you just have to use added a JVM
static here so that's it thank you so
much for watching and do subscribe for
other videos guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
