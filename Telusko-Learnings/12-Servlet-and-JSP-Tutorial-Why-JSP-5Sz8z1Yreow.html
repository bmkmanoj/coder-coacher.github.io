ready and in this video we'll see why do
we need JSP till this point what we have
done is we got this form so when you
click on the submit button it will call
add and we have a sublet who is
responsible to handle your request and
it is working perfectly right so you can
see we are asking for two values we are
adding those values and then we are
printing on the page so just to see the
output while what I will do is I will
right-click here I would say run as a
non server and on the Firefox that's
what that's the brows I'm using so if I
say 4 and if I enter the value it says 6
so it will add those two values that's
it so if I click on submit you can see
we got 10 so we are simply adding two
values now let me just add some twist
the twist is see ultimately on the
client page we I mean on the client side
we are getting a page right so if I
right click and if I say view source you
can see a view source itself is this
data there is no HTML tag and nothing so
we don't have HTML tags right because we
are not building anything we are not
creating any HTML tag here and that's
fine even if you want to make a web page
you just have to make sure that your
response is of type HTML you don't have
to write any tags but what if I want to
customize something what if you want to
change the background color maybe I want
the background color to be blue here or
C on or maybe red how do I change a
background color even if I want to do
that where should I do it now if you
want to do any if you want to send any
tags because he ultimately this client
page or the client side will receive
HTML tags right so if you want to send
HTML tags have to do it from here
so that means with your text you have to
also send the HTML tag so you have to
say HTML open and you have to say head
open and then you have to say in fact
wills we can skip that part
and we can simply say body BG color
equal to in single code I'll mention the
color SC and that's my favorite color so
once you are opening everything and
inside this body or we have before word
to close the body tag and that's very
difficult you know to track or the tags
and if you make one mistake you will not
get errors you know in HTML you're good
don't get errors you don't get output so
that's one thing which is scary and how
do we close all the tags again we have
to say print Ln
in fact Brent will do and here I would
say body clothes first you have to
that's that's important right atrium of
the sequence as well so you have to
close the body tag and then you can
close the HTML tag now you will say
that's okay right we can do that so we
can simply pass the HTML tags in the
format of out dot println as a user a
user will receive all this tags in a
proper format let me show you the output
server at this server I'm using a
shortcut to restart a server you can try
it by right-click and start let's go
back to Firefox and now if I say refresh
and submit you can see we got a page
with a different color and the output is
output 10 so if I say view source you
can see we got the HTML tags as well and
everything is working fine the thing is
to create a simple page we have to write
all these tags right and it is possible
for us normally we write each tag in
different out dot println so that we can
debug later here I'm just doing some
shortcut it is working what if you want
to create a beautiful page example if I
go to any website let me just go to
Wikipedia and inside Wikipedia if I go
for any text let's say if I go for any
title doesn't matter so let's say if I
search for this earthquake okay we got
this page right and if I right click and
if I save use a source you can see that
we have so make text here and we have to
write everything inside out dot println
so just to create a beautiful page you
have to write all those things in out
dot println do you think is it flexible
of course not right and that's where the
problem starts because designing is done
by designers and the backend work is
done by della purse and so developers
sometimes don't like designing and
designing I mean designer people don't
they don't like development how they
work together because the Java
developers they will write Java code and
they will our designers hey designers
just put your tags inside out dot
println and they will not like it right
so all this designers they went on
strike they say hey send a microsystem
we don't want to use Java technology
because in Java we are supposed to write
HTML tag inside Java code that's not
right so Java says ok don't worry we
will give you a new feature which is
called as JSP in JSP we'll do reverse
you know we will write the Java put
inside HTML
oh I know you don't trust me let's do it
so what I will do is
the same thing I want to add two numbers
but this time I will use JSP nowadays
JSP J's which stands for Java server
pages now instead of using servlet we
can also use JSP to do the same thing a
sublet here is simply accepting these
two values adding it and sending the
spawns the same thing can be done with
that wap JSP let me show you how so I
click on your project and say hey I want
a JC page and I will link this JSP as ad
dot JSP we can have any name doesn't
matter
and this GSP you can see that we have
HTML tags here and then inside this HTML
we will write Java code Oh first of all
I want to change the body color right
that's important so I will say BG color
equal to I would say C and that's the
color I want and here I want to add two
numbers white so of course we're two at
the same code so I will just simply copy
this code fetch the data and add it okay
there's one thing missing now the
request object right in servlet we are
creating the are creating the reference
here in gs we don't have to do that JSP
will give you this object by default so
JSP will give you this reference
variable by default now these things are
also called as implicit objects in JSP
again we see that later so once we got
this Java code now I want to print the
data on the client page right so I would
simply say out dot println and your job
is done you don't even have to create
object of out or print writer because
that's by default in JSP I would say
output : I would say plus and that's it
so what we do in sublight we write HTML
inside Java in JSP we do reverse we
write Java code inside HTML and this is
much simpler right because you are
focusing on HTML here and here you are
focusing on Java you're not mixing it up
they're separated with oh we have we are
not separating them how do we separate
them because if I run this code as it is
it will display this content on the page
I don't want to display this content on
a page I just want to run this code in
that case you will use a delimiter so
you will use angular packet percentage
and you have to close this tag as well
so here you have to say percentage
angular bracket so whatever code you
write between these two things it is it
is it will be treated as Java code so
that's simple right so we will not be
using a servlet now let me just close
the
I will only use JSP so yeah we don't
have to send the request for added we
have to send a request for JSP name so
whatever Jesus my name is in this case
the JSP name is a dot JSP just mention
that so simply say add dot JSP it will
call this a draw JSP so no need for any
annotation nothing this should work
let's verify so I will right click here
I would say run as a nun Saba I can see
that ID we got the output here I mean we
got the page I would say 8 &amp;amp; 9 you can
see we call it 17 and oh is it really
working okay what I will do is I will
change the color I doubted some things I
think there's something wrong going on
let me shut the server I can serve I
have not restarted that's the problem
so let me just go back here refresh and
submit oh it's working so I was waiting
for this thing which is a dot JSP I know
we hate ready color it is very it's
giving some trouble to the eyes I will
go back to see on I was just verifying
everything is working okay you can see
we can see we got C on is a pleasant
color right and you can see record a dot
JSP on the in the address bar so yes
this is we are calling JSP here so which
is better
JSP right because in subject way to do
so many things we have to get a class we
have taken a class we have to get a
method which takes two parameters and
then create the object of printwriter
out and then you can do other thing in
fact in that also if you want to design
something we had write HTML tag inside J
inside Java code but initially in job in
jail it's very simple right you write
HTML code you write Java code separately
and everything everything works fine so
yes JSP is a good option but then why to
learn servlet if JSP is so beautiful why
to learn servlet so we have some reason
for that I was so in the next video
we'll see that why we still use saw it
when you have JSP you can we work with
JSP and servlets together I hope you
enjoyed this video where we have seen
why JSP came into picture and how we can
use JSP that we'll see later so that's
it from this video everyone I hope you
