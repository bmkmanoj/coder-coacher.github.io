didn't we talk about something called as
network security right so this is your
part 3 of your tutorials or network
security so in part 1 we have discussed
about the in general networks and in
general security then in part 2 we have
discussed about attacks so now you know
what is the tax point so my tax again we
have to denote X we have active attacks
and we have passive attacks right now so
if it was what attacks right if you if
you if your message is getting tampered
if your message is getting modified it
comes into active if your message is
just path if somebody's spying you
expressive somebody by checking your
mails it all becomes a passive attack
right so we know about attacks now we
know about Percy we know about active I
get the applicant type so that
everything is attacks now if you talking
about all these attacks there are so we
have to use some tools Joyce OPP we have
to use some tools now the one of the
famous tool you might be knowing is
something called as pirates now question
arises what is virus now see if you talk
about wireless in IQ world or virtual
world it's same like wireless in the
real world so you might you know about
this wireless wide you have bacterias
you have all these viruses in your body
so when you get a when you get people
when you have cooled so it's all because
of those whites white so you eat those
to eat foods you eat those back water so
if it would bleach to you how you have
some once is in your body right in the
same very awkward computer your
computers get affected it's all because
of your biases now question is what is
violence
see in AI to boil you have two things
you have a hardware you have a software
right so if we talk about a heart when I
buy something like you have a physical
entity you can touch software is
something is virtual everything is
virtual
now those virtual thing they can be used
for normal purpose or that virtual thing
can be used for malicious purpose so
this
that's why we have a term called as
malware so we have a term called as its
food is Marvel now basically we talk
about malware it's
malfunctioning software so one of the
pill form of Marvel is malfunctioning
software or second pill form we can go
for this many she is software now it is
malicious software and he is software
which affects your system on every
software is made for a specific purpose
so if you don't have a specific purpose
for a software it becomes a
malfunctioning software you wanted a
certain behavior but you are getting
some different behavior malfunctioning
or you getting uh software which will
affect your system malicious software
okay so in this malicious software one
of the part of malicious software is
called as virus nowadays virus it's a
small code depends small good for small
code so it's all depend up on the depth
of the virus if you're modest is small
virus small good big wireless big good
move biggest one is biggest code right
when some time this small code will
affect your computer in large way
sometimes big wireless can affect your
confidence small which all depend upon
the impact right
so when talk about wireless is not the
length of the violence it is about the
impact right so if you are getting a big
ones like if your if that violence is
able to delete all your system big
attack right but the problem is if you
don't have any file system what you do
delete right and but let suppose there
is a virus which will just remove one by
local system at ten point five is your
banking details right so it's not about
how big viruses what matters is impact
okay so if we talk about this virus Oh
see you you have you might have this
experience you know when you bar when
you get get up and out of your friend
right let's suppose if your friend has a
movie transformer and you want to watch
that movie now on your computer so if
you don't get that movie you will go to
his home and he will attach is your
pendrive to this computer and you will
download those movies or if you copy
those movie in your pendrive the problem
is there are some chances that that
pendrive will have some bytes if that
computer is infected with virus your
vendor will get affected if virus if
your pendrive get it get affected with
virus that Pender
come to your computer and when you
attach that pendulum to your computer it
will affect your computer but let's
suppose that computer is meant or that
virus is meant to attack your your
system the hard way the problem is when
you attach a pendrive you will not see
any impact you will not see any impact
okay so done so you will not see any
impact right so you should say so you
will know it sir so for the instrument
saying so we have some distribution by
office so come back so we are talking
about when it - right so when you when
you attach your pendrive to that
computer the problem is there are some
chances that pendrive virus will affect
your computer but you will not see the
impact at that time question others by
its because let us suppose this is your
virus so we have this small virus with
some video a type of wireless and this
is your computer and this virus is
trying to infect your computer now but
the problem is by default our system is
secure if you talk about Windows I know
below is not secure but still imagine it
was secure if you have Windows if you
have dinners if you have Macintosh this
is a matter which OS you use they are
they are like we have some level of
security let us suppose I have some
security here if in order to add in
order for this violence to attack your
computer they have to pass this this
ball or we can say firewall or you can
say of antivirus the problem is your
antivirus is big your virus is small if
that time if this virus attacks your
computer antivirus will stop it
okay antivirus will try to kill it
example if I just comes anyone will take
a gun and shoot what I want is a virus
if I am a virus I will go there I will
check the impact I will check the
security if your system is very secure
with antivirus I will be if your system
is very vulnerable I will attack what
your system is safe I still going to
attack right so what I will do
let's suppose on the wireless I am
coming here I want to attack your system
so what I will do I will check the
impact you have this big security I have
to bypass the security now I will attack
am only one right and this is the huge
file of this is the huge antivirus so
what I will do I will come to you system
and they will be awesome there will be
some file ok and I will get attach this
pilot suppose this file is NFS dot exe
let's suppose you you normally play
games so this one is your NFS dot exe so
in order to play NFS you have to click
that and if XE right so then suppose if
I am getting attached so this is my
viral this virus is getting attached to
this file this is your n F s dot e XE
and you have this habit of playing games
so what I will do I will get attached to
this exe and every time a user clicks on
this NFS I will create one more replica
of my web so one more is so now I have
two idols this Wireless will get
attached to some different files let's
suppose word dot exe so we have one more
one more file so this file as we get
attached to this file okay so if
somebody clicks on quite dot exe I will
get attached to or it will create mono
virus and this will attach to this file
right so what I am doing and increasing
my dominance ok so I am I am increasing
the uncreated opticals so why I should
have a I should attack as per load what
I will do I will create my army and I
will attack that system all right so
this is all this is what - - and when
you have a virus in your system it
doesn't means it will not harm you it
will harm you pin at some point of time
so initially it will create the
dominance it will think it will create
replicas and once you get you all this
replica it will attack your system boom
okay so so what that's that's how bias
works ok so if you talk about this virus
how much goes into different phases so
basically my talk about virus
so Wireless goes in four phases the
first phase of wireless is called as
dormant phase storm at this second phase
is provocation propagation fields next
phase is your triggering phase and last
one the last phase is execution now what
it means
dormant means it's it is the initial
stage once you get a pen drive and that
pen to have a virus it will attack your
system right it will come to your system
very strong and please
second is replication top equation is
application it will take multiple data
curves then it will go into terrain
stage okay so if it once it is once it
thought you know you get I have the
power it will try to attack your system
triggering system and large one is
execution it will be a boom once the
wires get into execution stage your
system is corrupted it's everything you
know it can delete your files if you
delete your application it will make a
system unstable that is your execution
phase so you start with dormant prints
and it will go into propagation phase
then we go to triggering phase and
allows me to go for execution phase okay
so these are the phases of viruses now
next we will talk about types of viruses
so we have some types of viruses so let
me ditch it down the first type of virus
is called as parasitic virus so first is
parasitic virus so first one is para
sweet advice second type of violence is
memory resident virus third type of
virus is your boot sector virus and
fourth one you have is your spell words
statements then fifth fifth may have
polymorphic then you have metal
perfect now what it mean so you have
sick SS right so we have six times by a
specific second type of virus is memory
resident then we have boot sector virus
then we have tell the virus then we have
polymorphism then you have metamorphic
so we'll show you the first one which is
your Pacific now this type of virus get
a stash attached to a file so you know
it is parasite it's a living thing which
resides on other living thing for the
same way
parasitic wireless is the wireless which
depends upon different pipes so it will
get attached to different parts then we
have memory acid in five now what is
memory here memory means main memory is
not your time to our vision or your
pendrive this type of memory is called
as main memory it's your DRAM so this
type of violence they will attack Iran
diagonally will attack the RAM so that
any application comes to your Ram it
will cut it then you have would shake
down nobody's boot sector when you start
your system when you start your system
the first fire of execution is your boot
file
okay maybe Ayana file so it will when
you start your computer into the effect
it will execute the boot file and that
boot file resides on the boot sector so
there will be a area in your hard drive
in which will be having all the boot
files and that area or that sector is
for this boot sector if virus attached
that boot sector everything gone you
know you can you will feel your system
is corrupted and in a medium when you
are on your computer that that was
another affect your boot sector and you
will get an error we cannot we cannot
load windows because it is corrupted so
that is your boot sector then we have
stealth wise us now stealth wireless is
like a their smart like if you know how
was how anti we take - it's every virus
will have a behavior and that behavior
is called as signature if that signature
is registered with the antivirus
so will antivirus will check your system
for that particular behavior because
every virus will have a unique behavior
so if antivirus find that behavior it
will try to stop it but what if your
virus is so smart when 90 - try to scan
it will stop the behavior
skip like so
they are smart those Delta wells are
smart now point of the wires they are
smarter now what do you do they change
the signatures every time they change
your signature it's like if first they
are giving this signature an t1 scans
they change your signature next time
they change the signature every time
they change their behavior
this is polymorphic what is polymorphic
is like one object different behavior so
take polymorphic then we have
metamorphic they are like it's same like
polymorphic but they change their
signature but they all should Real ID
code so you have to write the new virus
so this Wireless will like the new virus
so you might be invited knowing about
that movie report Rajinikanth movie so
in that movie also one robots getting
different robots right the same way
this type of virus credit defender
providers so these these are the types
of viruses
okay so cool right so this is the type
of viruses for yeah so that's what in
this video for in the next video we will
talk about worms and torrents so yeah
that's it if you have any doubts please
comment and do some scaffolding for the
videos thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
