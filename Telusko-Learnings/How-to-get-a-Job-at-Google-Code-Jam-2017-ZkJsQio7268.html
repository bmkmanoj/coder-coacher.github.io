Google and then if you are wondering how
to get there so here we are
welcome back aliens I'm the wind right
different icicle are things and in this
video we'll talk about code jam now code
Jam is a event all the competition
organized by Google and they're doing it
from last 14 years so this started in
2003 and this is to 117 now and they are
so they have this event from April 7th
so I guess it will be it will be it will
be ending on 11th August so this up this
a big event coming on the way so it so
the restriction started on 7th March and
the event will start from 7th April but
then why I am talking about this event
why it is so important it's because I
was getting lots of mail on on youtube
or on my gmail or from messages on
YouTube message on Facebook that they
want to work for Google and they were
asking me to show the park I mean there
are multiple ways you can join Google
you can get into a big University in
Silicon Valley or if you can get into
good a big energy in Mumbai or in India
maybe IIT if you are student off one of
this institution you have a chance of
getting into Google or maybe some big
Institute's but then do we have another
way because Google always believes that
it's not about colleges it's about it's
not about universities it's about skills
if you have those skills you can get
into Google and then so there is one way
you can get into Google is by cracking
the code Jam competition if you win the
competition I mean there were millions
of people competing with this but if you
win the competition
you have a big chance of working for
Google not just a big chance working for
Google Plus also you will get a cash
prize of fifteen thousand dollars which
if you convert in Indian currency it
will be 10 lakh rupees and a big amount
right so so we have to we have to a
bonus there one you can either work for
Google or I mean you will you can get
both so work for Google or you and you
will get the cash prize as well so there
is one way you can get into Google by
cracking the code Jam competition again
it's not that easy ok because there are
millions of people competing for the
event but it is not impossible I'm not
saying that you can participate this in
this I mean you will participate in this
year and then you will win but if you
can participate in this
you will get the idea how this
competition goes and how to correct the
exam so that in next to your event you
can actually participate in I mean with
full power so you can start from this
ear right so you can just go to their
website you will find the link in the
description area go to their website and
register yourself in fact I have
registered just now and you can come you
can compete there and once again I am
not have this video is not sponsored by
Google or YouTube okay it's just that I
was getting some mails and some message
on Facebook that's why I am making this
video I'm talking about code Jam so they
show yourself and try to try to cross
all the rounds because the first round
will be qualification round so I guess
it will be for 27 hours okay you don't
have to code for 27 hours but then they
will give you a timeline for 27 hours
which is on 7th April and you can you
can completely task in any time okay you
can you can complete that in that 24
hours time limit now once you complete
the qualification round it will go it
will be going for round online round 1
then online round 2 and then the last
round 2 will be the final round and that
will be the on site which means you will
be going to the actual event so
remaining thing will be online but the
last event would be on-site event and
that will be I guess in Dublin so that
will be your international tour if you
win all this round and if you go to W in
there so for me I mean I'm not expecting
you to with this event but then try if
we don't try then how will you win right
so take a first step and register
yourself and try for this event now
there is one more advantage of doing
this is because so if you can compete as
if you can cross at least one or two
rounds you will get the idea what do you
mean by competitive programming right
they will give you some they will give
you some problem you have to solve that
problem by using any language language
is not a parameter here ok so there is
no Java C or all those languages
parameter you can choose any programming
language which you want if you love C
programming go ahead with C if you love
Java go ahead with Java if you learn
Python you can use files and you can you
can use any language but you have to
make sure that you complete the task ok
so prepare yourself register yourself
and then you
when you have you still have 15 days now
I mean improve your programming skills
also improve you have mathematical
skills because the questions what they
have on the in the event is purely based
on mathematics or statistics or all
those things you have to implement that
in in programming way again to know the
last year questions just go to their
website and see for the last year
questions you will get the idea what
what they can ask in this year now if
you are preparing for the interviews so
first two rounds will also help you for
the interview preparation it will give
you lots of confidence if you can solve
those questions it's not just about
winning the event it's about
participating in the in the event and
getting that confidence so I hope you
will go to these website and register
yourself because we all want to work for
Google in some day right even I was
having that that that passion to work
for Google but then you can also go for
it and participate if you have any more
questions let me know I will try to
answer all our the other company other
members can answer this question so
that's it see you in the code jam you
when I am participating in that event
