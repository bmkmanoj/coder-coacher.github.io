ready and in this video we'll talk about
spring dependency injection and auto
wiring so we'll try to understand that
with some diagram so that we can
understand what is happening behind the
scene so to do that what I will do is I
will make a simple spring boot
application so I will say spring starter
project and by the way I'm using STS you
can use eclipse as well the only thing
is to download this app you have to go
to start dots playing dot IO because we
don't have this window in Atlas by the
way you just have to go to this website
and download the app the spring boot app
and then I will keep all this thing
default because I'm not concerned about
the name yet I'm just concerned about
the concept I will simply click on
finish now we got our project here it's
on the way so it does take some time to
download this app so we can see that we
got our project here this is your spring
boot project in which you have the Java
folder you have resources you have test
folder where you will put all your
January test cases you have my own
dependencies where you have all the
required dependency for the project now
what I will do is I will simply create a
very simple in fact I will creating a
very simple application here and I would
say let's go back to so if I open this
demo application you can see we have so
you can see we have a main method here
and inside this main method I'm simply
calling I'm simply saying run now I want
to create a class here which is alien
and the way you do that is by going or
by saying a class and this class name it
will be alien and I will click on finish
I want a simple pojo here which is alien
nothing fancy and it is alien I want
certain properties the way you create a
property is very simple you say private
int I would say a ID and I would say
private string a name so these are two
things we need in fact we can also go
for technology so every alien need has a
favor technology right so we'll say tech
and this for this three variables
I want getters and setters I will say
so's generate Gator setter so I will say
generate getters and setters for all
these three variables click on OK and
you can see we got a simple pojo now
that the idea be high
dependency injection is what if you want
to create an object of alien here in
this class in Maine so normally what we
do is we create an object of alien by
saying alien a equal to new alien so
what we are doing here is we are
manually creating the object by
ourselves by using neo but then depends
injection says hey developer you just
have you don't have to focus on object
creation you focus on the logic we will
give you the object when you when you
require it so here I will not say new
alien then question arise how will you
get this object now if you say this run
method of which is which we get by
default now this run method returns an
object of configurable application
context so run method returns the object
of this one so what I can do is on the
on this side I can say configurable so
his configurable application context I
would say context equal to because
anyway the run method returns that
object so let's hold it now once I got
this object your Spring Framework say is
simply say context dot context dot get
been so when you say context or get been
it will ask you for the type of class
type of object you want I would say hey
I want a object of eden' class and your
your Spring Framework says hey you will
get the object but can you trust it I
don't know let's try now how do we trust
it let's go back to alien and let's have
a simple method here which will which we
will execute just to see if it is
working because if you if you don't have
the object of course you cannot call a
method so I will go back to this method
and I would say system dot out dot
println and I would say in show so if
you get the object from the Spring
Framework that means yes you got and it
will it will be able to call show so the
way I do that is by saying hey dot show
so if it is calling sure that means you
caught the object and you can see we
have not done much of the configuration
here we are simply getting the object of
alien I mean we have we got a class
alien and Here I am saying context dot
get being alien got class let's run this
and let's verify what is happening now
the to run this application we have to
say spring boot app because this is not
our normal spring the spring boot so
it's a spring boot app and it's running
it's running something is happening
behind the scene and record an error
I was expecting it so we got the era it
says no qualifying being of type comm
dot example dot demo dot alien so of
course we don't have this object but why
what is happening behind the scene and
what this method is all about what is
happening here so to solve this problem
let's understand what is happening here
now spring provides you another
container so the way we have JVM we also
have a spring container to understand
that let me just go right to this
diagram this page application here what
I would say here is we have JVM right
and on that JVM we have I'm inside this
JVM we have a special container and this
container is called as a spring
container so I would say this is a
spring container
now what this container will have this
hat this will have different objects but
which object so the object which spring
specifies those are objects in fact the
object which we create here those are
called as spring beans so whatever you
have inside this will be called as a
spring bean but how do we create a
spring spring green and when they get
created so basically we have two
different scope when you create a spring
bean first is the singleton scope and
the second one is prototype scope in
fact we have in spring we have different
scopes available we also have request
then we have session but then those
things we use in web applications in
core applications we use this to only
which is singleton and row type now how
do we how do you specify singleton how
do we specify prototype and what does it
what exactly it means now if I go back
to alien here so if you look at this
alien this alien is not a spring bean
here and even if it is spring been when
it gets created so the container of
spring bean or the container spring gets
created on this line the moment you say
run it returns you the context this is
where it initializes your container and
in this container it will try to create
all the objects but which object let's
say if I have 10 classes if you have 15
classes will you create object of all
the classes not exactly you have to
specify as a developer which object you
want in this application I just have two
classes what if you have let's say ten
classes 15 classes and out of ten
classes I want to create objects only of
six classes so I want Spring Framework
give me six objects other object I will
take care of or maybe I don't even need
those objects how do we specify - Spring
Framework hey I don't want all the
object I want object only of alien the
way you do that is by making it by
writing ad rate components so we have to
use this annotation called as a delayed
component by doing this you are
specifying hey spring is spring
framework this is a class of which I
want an object now by default the moment
you on this application the moment you
sell run it will create a spring it will
create this thing for you right this
which will create this container for you
the moment using this application it
will create one object of alien here so
let me just name it as a one so it will
create a a one object for you and this a
one is of type alien so a one is of type
a land class right so you can say alien
class so the a one object here which is
object edited by Spring Framework is of
type alien dot class it will be
available in the spring container okay
we'll just it is just available the
moment you say get Ben now let me just
say get Ben your Spring Framework will
say okay developer wants are being here
of alien so because when you say get Ben
it says okay or gala per wants a bean
but of what which type that's why you
that's why you're specifying here you're
specifying here I want a lien type bean
so it will check do we have our agent
being there hey we do have it instead we
do have an alien being here it will get
connected automatically so that means
Spring Framework is injecting this
object in your application so this
object is created by Spring Framework or
spring container you will get this
object in your application that's what
we say dependency injection right now it
should work right we have mentioned calm
we have mentioned component there I will
say run as again spring would
application and this time you can see we
have not got any error
you got the output as in show so it is
working so the moment you say component
it will make it will make this as a
spring bean and it you can use it
anywhere now let me just add a twist
here what if I say get Ben once more
will it create two objects and how do we
verify how many objects we are getting
25 that I will get a constructor here
and I will say right like so so I chose
constructor with fields Oh maybe without
fields I don't want any fields here I
just want a simple constructor which
will print something which will print
which will have super doesn't matter if
even if you have super there I would say
object created that's what I want so
it's a object created so the moment I go
back now how many times it should print
object created only once right because
we are saying we are using what this
object only wants let's run this code as
a springboard and you can see which says
object it only wants what if I don't you
want try to fetch this if I say comment
this section and let's run this now you
can see we got object it only once I
mean even if you're not saying get being
you got object created because Spring
Framework says hey even if you don't
want the object we will give it to you
because by default Spring Framework uses
a concept of single-turn design pattern
which means it will give you the object
pre hand I mean you don't have to wait
for the object creation
the moment you start the application it
will give you the object okay what if I
asked for this thing two times I will
copy this code and paste it here this
time I would say this is a one and here
also I would say a one now what do you
think it will it print object created
once or two times so you can pause the
video you can answer that in a comment
section so I hope you have entered the
value in the coming section let me just
run this code and you can see it is
doing only once so we are getting object
created only once because in total it
will create only one object because by
default Spring Framework uses the
concept of single tent design pattern so
in singleton you get only one instance
how about if I say prototype here so if
I go back and if I say prototype and the
way you do that is by going to or we
have to use one of my addition which is
adult scope so the addition is an
attrition scope you have to mention what
value you are going for so we are going
for so we have to mention proto type now
by when you say prototype it means it
will be using prototype now so it will
be using prototype now which means it
will not create an instance by default
for you the moment you ask for the
instance when you say get been it at
that point will create object for you so
in total you will be getting two objects
now so in this let's run this code and
you can say it's a is object created
object created two times because we are
getting two objects now
every time you say get Ben it will clear
any object for you
okay now the point is what if I don't
even call this once I will say come in
this part now what do you think will it
print once two times or zero now since
we are using prototype which means even
if you don't the application you will
not be getting this object so you will
not get this object if you're using
prototype so this will not be there if
you're using prototype let's verify so
you can see we have not got object rated
on e one once because it is per type so
it will it will create the object only
when you say get been quite simple right
so this is dependency injection and
these are you is component but the video
is more about auto wiring what is
happening when you say auto wire
so to understand that I will create one
more class here and I will call that
class as let's say laptop because every
alien needs a laptop right and that's
how you can you can work on a project I
mean not not exactly laptop computers
also do some people write code on mobile
phones as well so anything I think any
any gadget will do here I would say
private int L I D which is laptop ID and
I would say private string brand I'm not
concerned about other parameters here we
can talk about Christ's CPU speed ram
ram conjugation and everything but then
time bin let's keep it simple right like
I would say so generate get as it is I
would say generate getter and setter
select all and click on okay and I also
need a two string method I'll if I want
to print something I would say so
generate two string and here I would
create one moment which is public void
let's say compile it's a laptop has some
compiler and then we want to compile it
and it should say compiling so how do we
do that so we say system dot out dot
println I would say company you can
write a complex code here but then just
to make it simple I will say simply say
compiling and now in alien when I say
show it should also call the compiling a
hold on how do you say compiling here
because to Paul that compile method use
your object of laptop right so I would
say private laptop laptop so regard
laptop object here and just to make it
work I also need a against before this I
would say right like right like those
getter and setter which is that getters
and setters select all click on oak
so we got adaptability as well and
nothing fancy I just want to call show
and from show I want to say a laptop dot
compiled now what do you think we need
to work because we have a laptop plus we
got a lean class inside it in class we
got laptop plus okay so we so alien
class is dependent on laptop plus now
now what will happen so if I go back to
demo and when I say show in fact I will
do it only once now because we have seen
how do we call two times and also want
to use seeing a single turn here just to
make it simple again now what will
happen so if I go back to demo let's run
this 25 what is happening there and you
can see we got nullpointerexception but
now why another point exception is
because if I go up we are saying laptop
dot compiled in fact this is the this is
the line error so if I click on this
line ok this in show and in citizen here
so you can see we got laptop dot
compiled this is the problem the problem
is the laptop is not instantiated it
because before using the object we have
to say new laptop but again we are using
spring framework right why I should say
spring laptop and your spring framework
is not even creating object of laptop so
if you want to get the instance of
laptop you have to say at a rate
component so now when you know this
application in your come in your
container you will get one more object
so I will say this is one more object
here I will call this l1 and this object
will be of type laptop dot plus so this
is object of illenore class and this
object of laptop will class and what I
want so if we call so when you say
component you will get both the objects
now will this work because we got the
object right we don't have to say new
keyword so the moment hood on this code
Oh again we got the same error we got
the null point exception but we got the
object right but this is one problem a
one object here is dependent on l1 how
your Aden object will know that this
element object available and how do we
search it so we have to connect this
tool we have to say hey alien there is
some laptop object available there
search for it how do we mention that how
do we ask a lien to search for it
automatically and the way you do that is
by simply using a
concept called as Auto wire so I will
say Auto wire the moment you say Auto
wire it will try to search for the
object in this spring container now will
it work let's go back there and run this
code and it worked you see that it
worked we got the object we got the
output as compiling so what is happening
behind the scenes so when you say Auto
wire it will try to connect because a1
has an instance I mean alien object
needs our instance of l1 or a laptop
object so it was search for the type
okay by default auto wired searches for
the type not for the name l1 doesn't
matter
in fact by default the name is not even
l1 the default name for anything is
laptop itself but with small L the
default name for this a1 object is not
even a 1 it is small a alien so you can
search my name as well but we want the
type here ok what what if you want to
search by name for that we have to use
one notation which is at qualifier
so using qualifier we can do that so I
will say add qualifier and here you can
mention what you can mention a laptop so
now it will search by name can we change
the name of the lab can you change the
name of fear because by default the name
would be laptop right you can say hey I
don't want laptop as a name I want L a
p1 can you do that yes we can do that we
can have a name now
la p1 which means the object which
spring creates here when we will not be
laptop one now it will be lap one so
this is the object name and since we are
using qualifier in the alien itself we
have to say lab 1 because we have to
search by name right so by default Auto
wire searches by type at qualifiers such
as by name so I hope you understood
something how what is happening behind
the scene if you enjoyed the type of
session because I'm just trying out
different ways of explaining your
different concepts let me know in the
comment section if you liked it because
I will making some more videos based on
this on spring so that's it everyone I
hope you enjoyed in fact I should be
doing a quick recap what we have done so
I wanted the object of alien so name is
basically a class which has four
attributes or four properties we can say
a ID
a named tech and laptop the laptop is a
special type and we have a laptop class
here and using add component it will
instantiate your object the when you say
instantiation means you want a new
object right so domain you say component
you will create object in a spring
container and using this auto wire you
will get connected with the with the out
with the with the object which is per
created by splitting framework let me
just run this code one second to verify
and it works right so try it out and let
me know in the comment section if you
have any questions and your feedback is
it good bad so that's it everyone thank
you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
