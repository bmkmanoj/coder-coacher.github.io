facebook profile guys I will start the
session in two minutes by the time we'll
study session do share this on your
Facebook profile and to also click on
the like button so that I don't know
that you are enjoying this session and
you're excited about this course
okay so we got 23 people and tan okay so
on 20 people and only 10 likes come on
guys if I fact about this back goes just
click on the like button and we'll start
the thing and in a minute now so let
everyone join on Facebook I mean on
YouTube using Facebook platforms of
whatsapp so do share this link with your
friends okay so we got Adam who is new
to this so basically we are doing a live
coding here so we'll be making an
application live and today we are going
to deploy the application on on on
Amazon Web service okay so in fact here
okay so so that's what we're going to do
now okay so
okay so let's start this session now and
we got okay so let me start the
recording as well so here we go let me
open Camtasia so that the recording will
be available later okay so let me start
the recording and I'm using this time
let's start the recording okay so do it
today I'm Oh today I'm very excited
because we will be deploying the
application whatever we have done till
now on Amazon Web service and it will be
available in such a way that anyone can
access it so anyone can add a feedback
anyone can use that URL and that will be
a public thing okay so I'm very excited
for this because this will be the first
time where I'm doing something live like
this deploying something online
there might be some issues that will we
may get some errors but that's fine
right that's a part of the process so
let's see how it goes now first of all I
want to thank a Karthik I got a design
from Karthik and Karthik we loved your
design so let me just open the design
the home page which Karthik has created
or made so let me just open that design
and this is a design submitted by
Karthik so it's full name is Kazakh
Rajendra and you can see I mean the most
important thing which are like here is
this one are playing the video while we
can see a page it's awesome design this
is and okay so what else what else okay
so I loved the design okay and this
images will be will be replaced by the
images which so we retain is
the images with the new images so thank
you so much Karthik for design oh
there's been a mistake yeah I mean
spelling mistake will remove that if you
inside the content will be changed soon
okay but where's the where is the
spelling mistake why don't you get out
okay then that's fine that's fine
oh he's still working on the page it is
not complete page yet he's still working
it may take two or three days more for
the completion I guess Karthik right but
you are seeing other people you can also
help with with certain designs you feel
if you think this can be modified this
can be modified let me know we will do
those changes okay so let us close this
so this is this is this design will be
used so as of now this design will be
using for for the home page so let me
just close this and so okay in the last
session what we have done is we have go
to this project right so let us run this
project locally so that we see what is
happening okay so what do I do now is i
driving on this project I will say run
as the non server I already have a
tumble in my machine
let's see what is it working on large so
that will continue okay so asking for
you shutting server okay so as you can
see this is what we have done and when
you say a feedback page so when you
liquidfun a feedback page will record
HTM it will ask you for the page but you
can give the feedback I was doing some
experiment with the project I hope it
does not get in an issue you can see we
got a feedback here as well right
very big trees it is so you can see this
is our feedback page again design
doesn't matter we are focusing mode on
the of the coding part first and again I
want help
design from your side right so again the
design will be change in future uh okay
so what we are going to do now is let's
create one more I will get one more link
where you can actually get all the
feedback since you know I want to also
check whatever feedback seven-league
boots I will say get feedbacks dot HTM
so when I say get feedback on stream I
want all the feedbacks now unfortunately
we don't have a feedback here you can
see we have not created anything for
this for this thing okay so now what
we'll do is let's create a controller
now I hope you remember this spring MVC
because I am assuming that till you have
reached to this point of course you
should know about something about spring
MVC right so what will we do now is
we'll add one more controller only for
affecting Billy cause as you can see we
have period of controller call let's add
feedback here okay we got an off
feedback so when you say feedback HTM it
will return feedback dot JSP
and when you when you call for add
feedback it will add the feedback in
your database this is what they are
doing that our session right so if I
open the database now if I okay which
database you're working with so
basically till now we are working with
masculine so I will open Master
workbench and I was using the nursery's
connection here so in the next book in
there next to me I have a machine here
in which our database and if I say use
finish go if Isis the next are from
feedback is it working just taking some
time well because it is another machine
okay so he's taking some time but this
is what we have done till as the class
session oh okay so now what we do is
we'll have one more method which using
which you can get all the all the data
okay why it is showing you the issue to
that once again so
be database is one ninety two dot one
dot two the password is this one let's
enter click on ok say use periscope I
know if you can see that touch that and
if on this code let's say select star
from feedback and I was one this good
okay so this on the feedback we have
added in the last session right so I
want to fret all this feedback in order
to show that those show those feedback
on the page so what we'll do now is
let's go back here and let's have one
more controller so we'll give the
controller name as a trait a request
mapping get feedback now we should have
typing the code I will simply copy paste
the code because I bought it or they
done that before so instead of wasting
lots of time what I'm doing now is I'm
writing the code freehand so that I will
be simply copying pasting it so I will
just convince this and you can see I got
so whenever you call for request mapping
ok so whenever you say when you say the
request for get feedback to this year
because this is the feedback I want to
fetch like I will go here on my stream
on my okay will not use okay I will
using Facebook we are using Firefox
white so when I say get feedback the HTM
I want to make it work now as you can
see this is not working because we have
we have provided get free size for
extreme right but we have not mentioned
what so we have mentioned that we want
to call feedback for JSP now
unfortunately you can see we don't have
a view name which is called as feedback
dot JSP so let's create that feedback
dot JSP
I will disappear here and the name this
page as feedbacks dot JSP and what do we
do here is I will simply print the
feedbacks but let's do that veto I got
the feedback page and in here I
mentioned the feedback page and let's
return the object of MD now if you're
wondering what is MV basically we talked
about playing MVC in spring you see when
you
to make a website you have two things
here first you have to return the data
and you have to also mention the view
name right so this feedback to our JSP
is your view name and you also you also
want to send a data so what you can do
is you can create object of model and
view which can hold a boat it can hold
data and do they both it is not
compulsory to use this we can also use
model object but then using this will be
much more efficient to work with right
so we'll use this and we'll say MV dot I
want to add data now I want to send all
the feedbacks right so I'll mention the
feedbacks are feedbacks and I will give
a detail now we have to send data as
well right now this data will be coming
from the database so all the feedbacks
need to be coming from iterates so of
course we have to say F now because now
what is Bao here is its entire object
right I'm just assuming that you have
seen all the earlier sessions here okay
watching you have seen all the earlier
sessions and we say get of feedbacks
I've been unfortunately I don't have
this method causes get feedbacks so what
we do here is I would say okay why I'm
doing all these things okay you are
waiting for the edge of this right but
then to make it work I also want to have
one more request right using which you
can trace the feedback so what I'm doing
that now and in this I want one more
method which using which you can
actually fetch the feedback from the
database so I will use so I have already
written that object other return that
string here so let me show you is that
so you can see I've got a method let's
get feedback so this method is already
created so what does the get feedbags I
am getting on top session now since I'm
I want to fetch all the records I'm
using up at hql here so this thing is
actually h ql now when you work with the
SQL we use SQL queries right we have we
all know how SQL query works but then is
in hibernate it provides you of
of hql now if you don't know edge cure
you can just go to my playlist I have a
hibernate videos I do watch those videos
to get the complete understanding of SQL
okay so yeah so we got we got wrong
feedback when you are fetching a
feedback you are getting all this
feedbacks here
so in this list I have all the feedbacks
which is coming from the table and then
I will simply print those and I will
also return the feedback so whatever I
am getting from the database I am
redoing that in at least format so that
least format will be going to index
controller and in this feedback label
you'll be having all those things now
what we have to do now is in your
feedback store GSP will simply use a
dollar symbol and we'll mention will
mention feedbacks
now it is possible that your e/l is not
working okay let's do that later
so let's retry yourself let's write like
this and or we'll switch to the server
now let's see if your get get feedback
is working let's go back there or not
only this go to file for let's say enter
and strings lots of time because data is
coming from another machine I guess
there's some firewall issue which is
blocking or can you see that we got
feedbacks but unfortunately we got
dollar feedbacks this is not what we
want right but you can see the console
of STS we got all the feedbacks so it is
stretching the feedback from the
database but then there is only one
issue e l is not working here now if you
are not familiar with e le l stands for
expression language which is the part of
JSP and you can actually take a notebook
with you okay so when you are doing a
session just tape a notebook and a pen
with you whatever things you don't
understand just write those things and
go to my channel and search for the
videos on that ninety person chances are
that I died I do have a video on that
concept it may happen that I don't have
a concept let me know or whatever
concept you don't understand I will make
a video on that okay so I would say
these yell ignored equal to false
because sometimes your e L is getting
ignored so let's let's try to remove
that let's go back let your son server
ok if you have judged on session don't
click on the like button let me know
that you are enjoying the session ok so
when you started done let's go back and
say enter and take lots of time ok here
you see that we got all the feedbacks
here and that's awesome we got this
method which is get feedback so HTM
which will return me all the feedbacks
now once we have done with this let's go
to Amazon Web service how to deploy this
application on AWS so I'm very excited
for this now and let's do that so step
one now first of all there are lots of
people they might be wondering last time
we have worked on Google App Engine and
now I'm moving to Amazon Web service
there are multiple reason for this the
first reason is I always wanted to go
for Amazon Web service but the problem
was you know I was facing some issues
but now there is all the issues are
resolved and now we can't work on Amazon
and when I'm working on Amazon Web
service is much easier compared to
Google App Engine right and Amazon Web
service is a market leader in cloud
services ok so given a choice or if you
can go for the Amazon Web service or you
can go for App Engine I will always go
for Amazon Web service ok so let's go to
Amazon Web service so
okay so what I will do now is let me
just go to a mess on websites websites I
will say eight of those dot amazon.com
does the official website of Amazon Web
service this is the page you have to go
to and okay so I'm going to go into this
website and my network my intention is
running base flow today I hope I am
properly audible there and you are on
high on YouTube okay anyway this
decision is getting recorded so you can
watch this session later as well by
shaking so much of time I was on web
service come on okay so you go you can
see the bottom is on web service and I
already have an account so if you don't
have an account you just have to click
on create account and reading account is
actually easier than creating a Facebook
account here the only thing is you have
to enter your credit card information
okay so you don't have a great card then
bad for you but then it is free for one
here okay at least one year you can
enjoy and there are some faded tears
don't click on that whenever you select
anything here make sure that you are
using a free version okay so I will go
to Amazon management console Amazon Web
site is my good friend solar I already
have an account it will ask ask me for
the username password I guess I hope
you'll ask me that
okay so I only have an account here so I
will say Java boy that's the account I'm
using now
so now boy I mean do I take G mail.com
and the password is star star star star
star okay this is the password you have
to use and so my interns are laughing at
Lina okay so we got a login into the
console so you have to make sure that
you have an Amazon account with you guys
before doing all those things so I've
done all the steps now in fact decision
is getting recorded so you'll be having
the option video by then okay now first
let me explain you all this modules here
so we got ec2 easy to stands for Amazon
s3 it is elastic cloud computing so any
way you want to deploy your application
this is the place you can deploy the
application in which you will be using
elastic beam stack because this is used
only for web applications ec2 can be
used for applications for virtual
servers we don't want to use voiceover
zero so we'll be going for only web
application right so we'll be using
elastic beam stack in fact it provides
lots of features it also provide extra
service if you are if you are if you are
you know if you are injured like you
jokes apart so we have s3 for storage we
have RDS for database so we'll be using
RDS here for creating the database so
two things we need here the first thing
we need is elastic beam stack where you
will deploy application and you need RDS
where you can where you will put your
database so okay which one to go for
first I mean you can go for anything
erase you can go for elastic Bane or you
can also go for RDS let's start with the
elastic pain okay and just ring sometime
so elastic beam is for deploying your
application you can see I already having
a bit I already have any application
here if you want to get an application
okay why I've done this already because
it takes lots of time you know sometime
I feel amazon web servers are slower
than my machine so it takes lots of time
to create an application to create a
database to
other tables so I have already done that
already so if you want to do it by
yourself click on the create new
application if it will ask you for the
application name I will say a task I
will not give to us will say Naveen
Upington name you can add a description
if you want and click on create so it
will create application for you you can
say this is the application and here you
have to create a so you have to get
application where you can deploy some
selecting equipment okay let me suppose
this so once you click on a great new
application you have to enter name then
to go for create new one it can ask you
for which one you have to go for I will
select web server environment now once
you do that it will create an
application for you but AR before that
you have to mention which server you
want to go for so I'm going for Tomcats
right now okay so if you have to working
on node.js you can go for that if you're
working on PHP it also provide PHP
feature like python that will be they're
going for Tomcat will select Tomcat here
and in fact if you are familiar with
docker you can also use docker here okay
but then I will be using Tomcat now once
we got a tomcat I want to upload my
application again see we have to click
on upload your code and you can upload
the courier itself but you can actually
skip this ah okay but this for this you
need a bad file that's a tricky part
right but before doing all this things
we will click is simply click on create
environment at least you will be getting
an environment where you can deploy the
application right okay okay say is no
event is because we have not added the
Val file but I will be not using this
one I will be using something which is
my own so I have already created this
one which is sample which is the name is
demo I'll be deploying the application
using this upload and deploy thing so
just have to click on upload and deploy
and you can deploy your application it
is that easy and the awesome part is
your your Amazon Web service actually
supports Java 8
so your Amazon web server actually
supposed Java 8 and that's what I loved
about it so you can use all the July
twitches here okay and you can see to
use SMS on the Ducks machine so that
will be easier to work with
okay but before you when deploying the
application you have to make sure that
we are using so even before deploying
the application how to first grade
database right so also let's create our
database so for that I will open again I
will open AWS let's go for our DL so we
have we have waiting this environment
here so we'll be doing up we'll be using
this after some time but you have to
create a database first so we'll go here
and double-click on Amazon management
console okay and if you want to create
database of course right when you deploy
an application we also had a table is
there right in fact up before deploying
I was using this other machine of DBMS
which is Maskell and now I have to use
Amazon Web Services I will giving ah DL
which stands for relational database
service okay so we click on this and
okay
question from Roger how to promote my
channel there are multiple ways of
promoting the channel this is the back
this is the most weird way of promoting
your channel budget okay so once you got
this page now you can see it okay first
of all it will look difficult for you
because they are really for the first
time but trust me once you know this it
will be very easy to work with a future
ok so I will click on launch DB instance
we click on this launch DB instance and
ok now there are different instance it
supports so Amazon has its own DBMS
which is adora
I will not use that will go for MySQL ok
you can go from ask you or you can go
for Mallya DB you can go for posters the
thing is if you are going for the Amazon
own DBMS ah
it is not free actually yeah it will you
will be getting charged for this and we
love free things right so will be going
from ask you or poor squares now I'm
facing some problem with Maskull
workbench on my system so I'll be using
Postgres SQL I guess I'll be using poor
squares here
ok and let's go to select X I'm gonna
click on select it will ask you for what
type of environment you are going to go
for again this is the paid version ok
this is the free version ok we'll go for
this one
oh it is this instance it did it for use
outside approachin or under the RDS free
use of Stratego ok so we are using free
one because you can see it just adds its
own billing information I'm very bad
with billing information so I don't know
let's see what it says so they also have
charges for this for course means they
have ok you can read this for the
charges currently I'm using free one so
let's not worry about that let's go to
the next step okay now here first of all
ok when you go for audience you have to
make sure that you select only those
things which are free okay see mind you
for to create Amazon account it will ask
you for your plate cut information right
so if you are doing something think and
do it okay unnecessary it will charge
you and that will not be a small amount
okay so make sure you click this one we
select audience fleet here so we select
will take this and okay now here we have
two so when you select this one it will
give you all default options will go for
default options since you are doing this
for the first time right so they always
go for default wha if you if you can get
the default one working you can try
different things okay you can do
different experiment besides that okay
now will ask you for your database
identifier now the database identify our
your database instance name so I will
use database name as tedisco
and then I will use master user name as
Naveen and I will set the password as
one don't um and if you can see my
password afterwards once you see the
code anyway will change that later and I
will use the same password here and then
you click on next and when you click on
itit will create your database instance
oh it is asking you for some more
conjugation now again all this
configuration let's go for the default
one will select default VPC and here as
well I will go for easy here we have to
go for Audia slash posad okay I am doing
this for a long time I'm getting errors
from a long time okay so this is this
this thing works I let's enter your
database name and we'll also give it a
terms name as that is for itself so my
instance name is also Callisto and it'll
send articles for you can have a two
different names that's fine
and anything else does the default
portable for porch list if you are using
mask you'll the port number it will give
you is three three zero six four four
squared is five four three two and once
we do this then nothing important let's
click on launch DB instance I hope it
will be it will work now and you can see
your DB in
chance is working now how do you know
how many DB instance you are running but
so if I go to instances here you can see
I have the whole shop open here for DBMS
I guess it will be 2 or 3 so you can see
I was doing some experiment so created
this mask yo called a task then I was
doing thus host then we are going to
this code test I will not be using this
one or ABCD I will be using tusk post
okay so we have created this one but
will be using this one okay B suppose
this is working and I want to do I don't
want to take any risk with this okay so
okay now it is important once you got
okay so oh we got a question from Rogers
shake her are we using a deposition of
Google App Engine yes we are using AWS
instead of using Google App Engine is
because I always wanted to go for AWS
but then I was I was facing some issues
before and now the issues are resolved
so I'm using Google App Amazon Web
service okay so so once you okay so now
how to configure this and what are
things you have which is important so
before expanding this what I want to
show you is if I go to my STS see one of
the things you have to remember when you
will connect with database there are
certain things which is important the
first thing is the Java class so we draw
the class here is calm mask your
daughter observer driver because I was
using masks ul before then you have to
mention the URL which is the desired
mention here then you have to mention
the username and password so this thing
will change depending on which DBMS
you're walking with now since I'm
deploying the application on Amazon or
web service which is odd years so when
you when you open this you have to click
on the contact which is what it called
as details so when you click on details
it will give you all this options now
most important thing here is the Erebus
name so first thing I remember is
database name I would recommend you to
write it somewhere in fact let me just
do that I will write my things here so I
will mention
my database name my database name as
okay let me just use the debits name we
just Eddie score okay the next thing
here is the user name there's all this
thing here okay the next thing is
username I will say user equal to or
Naveen and let me share the password
with you not not now which other
password later the password is one two
three four five six seven eight so
that's the password for my RBS database
in fact I should not be sharing this
password with you but then that's fine I
can do this for time beam and okay what
next okay and then this is important the
endpoint now endpoint basically means
your host name so as you know that it
will ask you for the host name right so
we say host going to this one this is
your host name okay the next thing you
have to remember is the port number so
the port number is 5 4 3 2 so this all
thing your pin number
it always me username password host name
and port number agar what's next ok and
if you have any questions let me know
guys you can use a chat window to ask
questions since we are live so there
should be some advantage of asking
questions right
okay and if you're liking this session
just click on the like button just let
me know that you're enjoying the session
okay so okay so Mohammed fair-sized
clouds are more chargeable than not
cloud not exactly I actually can
actually monitor what is happening on
the cloud servers if you don't point out
then of course it will charge you both
if you are optimizing your tears your
services then it is not that costly okay
so yeah so once you've got your database
things all this information let's
replace all this information in our code
so I want this information to our code
white
so we'll open eyes tears and let's let's
replace all these things now first of
all I am not using mask you anymore I'm
you I'm using Postgres right again that
different DBM is available right I'm
using pores ratio so what I will do is I
will replace this con dot muscular did
you sort driver with with phosphorus now
before using for squares you have to
also make sure that you are adding a
post with dependencies in your system so
how do we add a post with dependency
again you can go to mavin depository and
you can get the post with dependency in
fact I do have let me just let me just
take a dependency so can we add it from
here oh it is disabled so let's go to
palm and let's go to my man depository
to get that dependency so I will go to
my main repository I will depress this
one
also Karthik you are living 12 midnight
are you where are you now in London or
Singapore or maybe Australia if I'm not
wrong
that those are the times on which is
matching with to Allah I'm okay say
strongly watch this video later
yes this video will be available on
YouTube so this video will be available
on YouTube don't worry
so we go to man depository and we'll
search for course breaths so let's
search for course yes and we'll select
for squeals here we'll go for this
version okay let's copy this and let's
paste it here so we got a pose quiz
dependency no system and if I expand my
mind repository or is that and you have
to also verify okay whenever you do say
anything you have to also verify this
updated or not
if I open libraries it was taken some
time what's wrong so if I open my mind
repository oh my my dependencies okay
you can see in time being okay so you
can see we got a post greece dependency
here in fact I don't need my scale
anymore so I can also remove my a scale
from here so just plug it and let me
just remove mask you I don't need mascar
anymore so it is that easy to add
dependencies and to remove dependencies
suddenly my machine is running very slow
because eclipse is doing something
behind the scene so it will remove my a
scale from here
okay so we have removed masculine and
now it's time to change this values so
the first thing is you have to mention
your your drama class so Java class is
hodgiedot just Postgres SQL dot driver
the next thing I have to mention is the
URL now this URL would be so it will be
JDBC : we have to use Poor's Gris here
so we are not using masks anymore we are
using a Postgres so it's I poached this
SQL okay and then here you have to
mention your host name so i'll remove
breasts my machine is working waist low
it is sending some the elderly put I
guess remote system operation oh it is
taking lots of thing here
oh yeah and how to replace this one with
the host name
so I already have an host name in my in
my sub line so I will use this host name
you have to copy from here to here and
let's paste it this one so we are pasted
that okay and then we have to mention it
we have to measure the port number as
well so we have to give a colon and we
mention the port number as five four
three two so we have mentioned the port
number as well okay so is there any way
to remove the lag from eclipse yes we
have to make sure that you are you all
you close your background process
because background causes lots takes
lots of time and lots of scipios a CP of
course we have to make sure that you
stop all the better I don't think and it
is you can see it is still not stopping
so the best way would be to restart your
eclipse in this case I cannot do that
now because I'm live okay
so that's the first thing of dimension
then the next thing we have to mention
here is you have to mention the user
name the user name here is which I've
written here is Lee okay my
system is running slow now so it's a
Naveen here and the password for my
machine for the database there is a BA
one two three four five six seven eight
okay and what next that's it
we have mentioned everything here they
have to mention the gravid name we have
done with that we have mentioned the the
URL the I mentioned that and then we
have mentioned the password and
everything everything seems good okay
but unfortunately I don't have a data on
the server right we have simply created
the database right if you remember if
you go to Amazon Web service here we
have created only the database I mean we
have credit database right which is
table we have not created the table yet
so we have to create table now how do we
do that how do we add a table okay so to
do that you can search for the console
where you can write SQL queries so if
you search everywhere and you will
figure it out there is no console here
how can you insert a table if I click on
this there is no option of inserting
data if you click on this okay you can
see there is no option of inserting a
table from from this page so what you
have to do is you have to use some
climbs if you've got a question from
surah which Mac is this this is Apple
Mac this is 2016 launch Mac's
i7 machine I know it is I seven it is
Mac it should not lag but the problem is
I am using dual screen here I am using
multiple servers in my machine okay
after you find my machine right so okay
so yeah so what you do is you have to
use a client so you have to make sure
that you use a coin so if you're using
mask you'll you have to use mask you'll
workbench which is here if you are using
Postgres here then you have to download
p PG PG admin so you have to install PG
admin here
and all we have a setup here what I will
do is I will delete that setup
okay so first say is let's - it create
table automatically we can do that we
can do that to also monitor white we
have to be in control of the database
that's what I'm doing now okay taking
lots of time okay now this time it is
not my Mac which is getting lag the
problem is with the Amazon server
basically the problem is within it retro
connectivity here okay I think I should
lose my PG at minute advice okay we got
loll as well okay so let me delete this
thing here let me just delete this thing
that before let's do that so if you open
your PG admin now PG at MIT is used only
for space okay if you are using mask
you'll be have a different steps for
that I'm using PG admin here so whatever
you do is I would right-click on the
servers and then okay there's no tactic
let's click on the file and you can see
this option of ad server so if you look
for this option of adding server so
click on add server and it will ask you
for certain things it will ask you for
the name I can ask you for the name we
can have any name here we'll say this is
a diverse it will hope we do not ask you
for the host name and I know you
remember now the host name is your
dismay this Lentini let's paste it here
that's your host name we have to mention
your port number and nothing important
here the user name is praveen the
password is under pure five six seven
eight and then click on OK now you can
see this is getting connected with the
Amazon Web saw this of course it will
take some time because Amazon Web
service doesn't trust your machine right
signal to lots of verification and then
it will be
as you can see if you get this option
here that means you are Amazon Web
Services which is the server is
connected with your machine and trust me
when I was doing this for the first time
it took me five hours I was not able to
able to connect with this okay I was
getting lots of issues maybe I don't
know what was the issue but then I was
getting solutions if you if you expand
this database you can see we already
have a disco here so this video is
actually coming from the from the server
and even before the session I have
created I have created one of the table
okay I've done this before before the
session so that I wanted to make sure
that everything goes good on the life in
the live session okay how IIT Delhi
website was hacked
maybe someone some developer done
something like me sharing the code on
internet you know it gives the open
opportunity to hackers to hack the
servers wise okay so if I open public so
if you expand all these things inside
this public table a public schema you
will be having your table so you can see
in my tables I already have a feedback
table now by default you will not have
this if you are doing this by yourself
you will not have this table what you
have to do is you have to create this
table or tri-tip on your tables and you
have to say new table okay click on new
table and and then you have to give the
information about the table so after you
have named the table then you have to
add the columns inside table you can
click on the Add button to add the
columns right so I have already done
that or let me show you the table now so
this is my table with all these columns
you can see we have six columns or seven
or six columns here we got name email
message registration code and writing
and I will write like this and I will
say view data who is that I would write
to my table I would say view data all
the rows and actually I have I just have
one row only
okay and you've got a question from Raja
Rakesh when you have dead EBC why to use
hibernate because if you if you're using
hibernate you can actually directly save
the data inside a database I mean you
can thank you store the object in a
database directly you can simply use a
method save example if you have an
object which is laptop and you can
simply say save laptop and it is done if
you have a student let's say save
student ID it is done you don't have to
write the SQL queries does it first
advantage the second advantage is I will
not give you the advantage now just go
to my channel and search for hibernate
or playlist and watch the second last
video or last two videos you will can be
idea why hyper ticket so unfortunate
okay so we got done with it so we got
this data right now this data is not
there is my machine okay the data which
is this low is not in my machine this
data is there on this server now I know
I hope you know how to insert data you
can simply use a query tool to insert
data or if you are using pause which
then the query tool will you will find
that in tools so when you see a Tools
option you can go to edit tool and you
can fire the quad is here okay
greater is getting opened okay so we put
a question from Rakesh and it will how
it will work
yes internally it uses SQL okay this is
your query tool and here you have to
type the query whatever you want to you
want to you want to work with okay so I
want my table right I got my table I got
to record as well and this data is not
on my machine this data is on this
server okay so it is there on the audio
server so once we got that once we got
the RDS server okay it sounds like RDX
right yeah so we got the god oh so
record a database record the data as
well now what our do is you can see it
has eight connections
because I guess three connections after
impose DUIs five connections are there
from the website okay okay what next now
once we've got a database let's connect
let's deploy the application here now
how do we deploy the application is it
that easy or the answer is yes it is
actually very easy you have to go to STS
first let's verify everything is perfect
here it seems everything is perfect
nothing wrong in this code in H always
willing to verify before deploying the
application because if something goes
wrong then you have to do lots of
circles so it is o RG o Swiss SQL or
driver then we have we have that link
which is a port which has a port number
five four three two we have a user named
Naveen and you're going to pass one
which is one two three four five six
seven eight everything seems good let me
just go with this now how do we so how
do we deploy for deploying this we have
to first create a bad file okay and we
say export and select value file and
we'll create a bad file on my desktop so
on the next time I'm creating a test dot
pad okay if I go to my desktop now
desktop you can see I've got a bad file
and this viola phone is created at 554
so we just created this Val file and
we'll go to Amazon service now so so
okay just remember this is RDS where you
can create a database okay we are using
two instance here what is RDS which is
relational database service and we are
also using elastic beam stat so if you
deploy your application on Deans tag so
click on upload and deploy select for
the application so I'm selecting this
dusk bad and will give any name will say
this is task 1.0 and then click on
deploy it will take some time for the
deployment it is 16 MB
and the mountain it is very fast here it
is very very fast we take some time okay
- strictly lots of time
okay so just taking lots of time let's
roll down so by the time and getting
uploaded so we've got a question from
okay so I make a video our SPL and log4j
or let me just try that deployed is
getting deployed oh it's really based
lots of time okay it actually shows how
much a percentage has completed but now
it is not showing that okay now what's
happening here
so you lots of time or done so it says
deploying or deployment done or the time
is already done right Rajesh - recall so
using PHP using PG McQueen and I can
handle database now so we have just done
that right so you have to use the PG
admin to make P database and how we
connect with our database with ADA into
place and that's what we have done here
right in STS the URL which you mentioned
here is actually your
this thing I mean the Kishin will be
deployed on AWS and this new one is
fully database so I think it is working
not bad and you can see you can make
sure that your health is okay I mean not
your but your cell health is okay and
okay let's click on this nut and you can
see we got a public you are L so this is
the public URL using which you can
actually work with this okay you can see
we got welcome that is following will
give get feedbacks dot HTM and I hope it
will work I hope it will work and yes we
go feedback awesome now this data is
coming for database now how do we verify
this what I will do now is I will click
on it's also press this okay we have
done this way let's test it it may go
wrong but that's fine
what I would recommend your people to do
is I'm showing this link with you here
on between the chat window just give a
feedback everyone let's click on that
and provide a feedback let me just also
do that here so my name is have already
my email is marine ready to Adelaide
email calm and then I'm giving website
I'm giving preview for online courses no
code is required I'm giving a feedback
as a good and then I will great myself
as for and then I will click on submit I
hope there's no oh we got an error okay
the error is for what oh there's a
problem with the registration column it
is integer Oh oh there was an issue with
this a deal also see whatever gate
getting from the page is actually that
the thing is that page which we are
using here okay hold on on don't give
the date don't don't get cute the
feedback there's something wrong with
that if I open my feedback dot JSP
okay you can see actually I'm entering a
field so what I do is there's something
wrong with that you can see when I say
regarding it is asking for the regarding
right for time bein
I should have taken with that regarding
in integer form asteroid and we are
sending a string from here so we have to
make sure that we are sending a so I'm
just coming that out and I will send a
text
now I'm really bad with pets what I will
do is I will use a name field
Oh
we'll cover this or paste it here now I
don't want a pattern matching here I do
not want to do anything I can matching
purse snatcher okay so the I will end is
as drag and drag because I'm expecting
on number right with for regarding
reference at a number and then we'll
click on validate everything is good
okay I will say this is regarding we
have to enter one two or clean so one is
a website to is novelty and three is
online website okay everything seems
good here let's again deploy the
application
okay let's upload this on the Amazon Web
service now oh we are getting some
issues here what's wrong I guess we can
ignore this only signal that so they
ignored this on this server so I will go
back here and I will again go for
deployment this time we'll go for
watchin one point one actually so let's
make it as one point one because there
were some issues with we 1.0 1.0 version
and again it will take lots of time to
deploy let's wait for some time so why
don't I let me answer questions so we
got a question from divakaran any
tutorial available on angularjs and no I
am very bad the designing I'm very bad
with front-end part so videos on
angularjs and you can also send your
