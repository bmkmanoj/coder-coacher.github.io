need to verify I don't know I'm using a
different system today so am i able to
hear my own voice how do I check that
let me just go back to the channel just
here no I missed hold on I'm just
waiting for everyone to join can't see
people there okay so that's great how
many people are watching this 24 people
are watching this with 8 likes that's
great so I mean I came live after a long
time
ok long time actually I hope I'm Bob
property well that everyone just like
know in the comment section the chat
window if everything is audible properly
and let me just check with my own
connection it sounds good it sounds good
it sounds good
ok great so we got so many people who
are already watching this and let me
just make this fullscreen and let's
start with the topic I can I will not
check the chat window now I can see
there a lot of questions on the way but
I will not be focusing on those
questions now let me just take start
with my own topic so as you can see in
the as the title of this video says we
are live after a long time it's been
maybe four weeks we have not came live
on YouTube so yeah I wanted to connect
with you again I was trying from a long
time but just I'm busy with other stuff
or working on projects working on study
materials busy with the training so
there's so many things going at the same
time plus some some you know personal
personal works as well so I'm trying to
take our time as well as possible but
then I'm not getting much time to you
know go live
but still I'm trying my best to go live
as much as possible so today I'm live
here I was supposed to go live in the
evening but then again as unique and I
have a different plan so so I've taken
out some time so that we can I can try
it with you again and ok so I've got
some questions in last few weeks and
those quotients are repeated questions
you know I thought okay let's make a
video and let's make it clear for
everyone what so let's talk about those
issues the first issue which I am facing
is are the questions which I'm facing a
lot is where is my MacBook yeah because
all the recent videos if you can check
all those videos are based on based on
Windows I mean those are made using
Windows in fact the editing and hitting
machine which I'm using now is also be
in fact in the use I've seen a machine
I'm using a Windows machine so why why
Windows my ways my Mac okay first of all
I'm facing a lot of issues from Apple to
be specific from Mapple my so my
keyboard is not working of the machine
which I bought MacBook Pro la I bought
it last year maybe no no this year in me
somewhere
not me March ok so sometimes I bought
that machine and the problem which I am
facing now is the kyboot is not working
so I submitted my machine to the service
center of Apple or the authorized Center
so it is which is supported by mappers
and so I've submitted that on 27th
November last month and still under
repair ok can you imagine that it's been
almost 1 month and you can say this
Apple right it's not I'm not talking
about other other company it's Apple
it's been one month now and they they
have kept their machine with them so
they're saying Apple is not providing
the patch to Mapple because they are
replacing the entire and I keep entire
keyboard right so yeah so it's been one
month and I started hating Apple now ok
not apple bit but Mapple this service
center of mapper in India it's positive
because you know it's one month and when
you don't get the position because that
is my main machine you know I do have
two machines one the current machine
which I'm using but this is a Windows
machine for Windows specific views
example if I want to work on some
software's which magan's the ports I use
our users on this machine but the map
Mac is my primary machine right because
all the editing is done on Mac and trust
me it takes a lot of time to edit a
video and to edit that video on this
much
in its which weird you know so I have
this habit of editing my ups are you
doing my videos on Mac and it makes my
work very fast you know I can eat at
least two to three videos per day or if
I'm using Mac but that's not the case
with with Windows machine which I'm
using so yeah so I'm using my Mac and
that's why you can see less videos are
coming on my channel because of I'm
waiting for Mac so that once I get my
macbook back I can make more videos so
that's one of the issue so I don't know
how to raise a complaint against an
apple here because it's it's long to
keep on machine for one month yeah just
hold on that's the only source of light
yeah okay I can see my my face is not
properly right it's a lot of light
coming on one side okay so I don't know
what maybe the again just to do once I
think everyone I just need to change too
okay I hope this is cancer said that
okay so let's start with the my face
scoots okay great so let's talk about
the next next thing which is my income
in fact I am getting on up to these
questions you know they want to know
about my income and I don't know how to
answer this question how do I provide
how do i specify my income okay so it's
first of all it's not try to reveal
everything on YouTube it's a public
platform and the question is also
related to you know my income outside of
YouTube so yes YouTube
so from YouTube he does on something not
much I mean lot of people they have this
you know they have this a notion that we
earn lot from YouTube that's not the
case when you talk about UT with a good
track comfort hardening but not not what
a YouTube or tech not for teachers or
trainers YouTube is good for people who
has more than billion subscribers who
get more than billion views for per day
and I mean you know those those channels
right who gets million views per day
because the content they publish is very
judging for the example if I talk about
if I talk about is mac a good machine or
not so if I make a video only about
MacBook maybe a lot of people will watch
that video if I'm if I make a video on
iPhone so which is the best iPhone all
the difference between iPhone and Apple
or iPhone and Android then already lots
of views in that case yes we get
millions of views and since those words
are very advertised friendly words
example if I say Apple Android so those
words earn a lot of money so yes
youtubers do on money but when you talk
about when you talk about millions of
views now this is a tech platform this
is the education platform right and in
education platform I don't get much
views compared to so normally every day
I get around 40,000 views so it's only
40,000 views and the even the voids
which we use in our videos in our in our
title those are not advertised friendly
words so we don't get much money some
people say I do I'm on YouTube just to
earn money that's not the case is
because if I just want to earn money I
will upload all this content on udemy
and I could have earned 100
X compared to what I'm adding from
YouTube so yes if I the only idea of
having this channel is adding money so
you damage the best one so if you talk
about you die me there are different
elections available right I got so many
requests on different platforms for
making videos for them and getting a
good money but then that's not the whole
idea it's not only about I think money
it's about educating more people you
know I thought the motivation for me is
okay to be a to be honest I'm damn lazy
okay the thing is I need motivation to
do anything if I want to work on a
project I need motivation if I want to
work on a video I want motivation and
the way I get motivated is by those
comments those likes of you
so every time I upload a video at least
for the first one are my only job to
check the comments and your likes and
dislikes so if you like those videos I
feel happy you know I feel motivated I I
make I make more videos and the comments
you know some people do do comment about
I mean they like my videos and because
of my videos it was a man they were they
were able to crack interviews they were
able to crack I mean pass the exams so
that what motivate my me to make more
videos so income is not be thing but
then if you talk about the general
income I enough to to sustain to buy
gadgets to sustain in Mumbai yeah so
yeah I live my living so okay great so
that's my income not much okay if you
just want to give a brief idea between
my income so I'll maybe i approximate
lee ten dollars to ten thousand dollars
between this is the range you know so
you can take in you can try it out one
okay you have to give some comments some
comments that I guess
okay so last topic for today is data
structures you know I started making
videos on data structures and okay so
this is the first time I'm teaching data
structure okay I have so when I go to
industries for different training I
don't train people on data structures I
train people on Java I train people on
on databases I train people on different
technologies like cloud services I don't
train people for for data structure so I
never go to any college or for pay to
reteach data structures
so so to make a data structure video I
have to do lots of efforts it's not just
about teaching you it's about how can I
teach those concepts in a good way
because the example which I'm making in
that in that so if you if you have some
if you have seen my retoucher videos the
example which I've taken is not from the
internet or not from nowhere it is my
own example
so I just wanted to make sure that I
will make it easy for you
so yes it takes some time to know to
research about a topic to make a good
example of that and to make a video and
that to edit and again I am not using my
macbook but if the video and took I'm
using a Windows machine which I'm not
that table so it does take some time to
make a video so some people expect that
I will make two or three videos per day
on data structures in fact not one
comment I quite approximately three to
four comments and people are saying why
don't you make two to three videos per
day on data structures yeah if it is
Java I can make five to six videos if it
is any-any ciao much frameworks I can
make five to six videos but then data
structures you know it takes some time
it takes some effort because I'm also
bought one a tablet pen tablet using
which I can write on it so I'm still I'm
still still a newbie for that tablet I'm
still learning to how to use that tablet
efficiently so yes it does take some
time so maybe you can expect one video
of data structures per day you cannot
expect more than that so that's about it
of structures and now let's start with
the question so I can see 95 people are
watching this 59 likes and so if you are
liking this up sessions if you want me
to welcome live again and again I look
in the link button that's what motivates
me you know spending life on Sunday come
on we're gonna like but if you enjoy if
you're enjoying the sessions okay now
let's talk with the questions everyone
let's start with the first one
hello aliens yeah okay so big big nation
is trying to mimic me there okay imitate
me right okay so
sony says janome sony says will
when will you jump in IOT boyd okay
it's not in my list as of now I am NOT
going for IOT soon because I feel IOT is
very different from what I understand
what I learned I know the basics of IOT
but then making videos on IOT is we take
a lot of time maybe a lot of time
because there's so many things on the
line up you know okay next is from next
question is which is the best laptop
under 40 K for programmers okay I cannot
blind any company name maybe you can go
for Dell I can go for you know so all
these companies are good I would say
when you want to buy a program in that
talk think about SSDs so buy a laptop
with SSD even if you are using IFI
machine with SSD I don't know how much
it will cost but then I five with SSD
will be a good option so maybe for our a
Jimmy ran naturally the good option
right because I said these SSD will make
a lot of difference to your programming
thing because every time you want to run
a code it you want to you want to open
the Android studio if you want to open
in Eclipse
having SSD will always helpful so I
cannot be very specific with laptop now
because I've been in a long time I've
never not checked Amazon found these on
laptops
okay next raj Abbey shakes a is hi sir
solving skills from solving skills make
a video okay so you want a video on
problem solving skills okay let me just
take it down somewhere okay song skills
so to Chaussee is happy to see you again
yeah happy to see you as well in fact
everyone on YouTube is my longtime you
know it's all its it feels good to get
connected with your audience again and I
have seen you know this is a Christmas
week in Christmas weeks people don't go
on YouTube and they don't learn things
they enjoy things they take vacation so
I thought you're serving you people
again come back to YouTube everyone
where are you so okay so garage say is
hello sir from Canada it's late night
here oh hi garage so I hope you have a
good sleep after this up to the session
okay so see you something new say is I
built a website but there's no finding
me to host oh so you can go for the free
services if you have built websites
Amazon will provide you service for free
for one year so in that one year you can
you can generate some funding
then you can invest so yeah there are
some pre hosting available so Naaman
says is it okay to learn PHP in total 18
why not why not so if you want to build
websites why not learn PHP and we start
building websites it's all depend upon
your requirements you know if you can if
you want to build a website
why not PHP why not okay so now that
says we are ready let's go yeah I'm
ready as well so how do you become okay
so far from question regard is how to
become a dotnet developer learn dot
niche that's it so simple so going to go
to go to youtube and search for him and
you are done youtube don't do it for now
just after some time you know just go to
youtube and search for dot need to do
deals and watch the template project and
that will give you confidence you know
nothing is very easy what's more
important is building a project on that
so whatever you learn start implementing
it
okay so lakshmi narayan says what's new
about 2018 so okay so i talking about my
perspective okay so i want to so there
are some changes i want to do into the
18 the first thing is i want to be more
efficient in my work I want you spend
more time working than doing some extra
extra things you know we have so many
things to do in one day but we failed to
prioritize things so from maybe from Jen
first I'll require dressing my things
what to do first what to do next I'm
mixing everything you know I'm doing so
many things at the same time I'm mixing
everything what to do I'm not able to
make everything in a proper way so
that's one thing I will be changing
second I would reply to I will try to
reply each each and every comment and
get two from now not 2 not from now from
1st Jan that's why that that's one thing
I will change because if you see I don't
comment much because you know there's so
many comments in one day I tried ok I
try to come into all the videos but then
the moment I go to youtube to comment to
reply to your comments and the moment I
see hundred comments in in one day I
just go back so what I will try with why
I will try to reply as much as comments
as possible from giant first
okay so Javed says why don't you make a
video on C programming a I do have a
video I have the entire placed on C
programming just go to my channel go to
playlist and search for C programming so
I do have the entire placed on C
programming yeah I guess my simple long
videos are not getting my not getting
much views I don't know why maybe it is
not coming this search or maybe people
don't know that I have made us see
videos I do have a seen use there okay
Thomas Thomas says I would like to take
up Java EE sprinkles how much it cost
okay so the thing is I don't have any
upcoming batches Oh
one batch started this week on our
hibernate so what you can do is send a
mail on the ice core training so one
batch started off the hibernate and
spraying this week and so I was telling
reply from so I've got so many mails on
this for training from last two weeks I
will be replying those mails tomorrow on
Tuesday maybe so yeah so you can join
that batch send a mail on tennis court
winning at gmail.com okay Raja noises
come on why come on
everyone says come on we're okay see us
now say say something about Scala colors
Carla is an awesome language softer Java
the language I love is crawler it's
awesome you know scholar supports
functional programming scholar support
object-oriented programming it's a good
language so the famous like spar
framework so for big data SPARC is built
on scholar and scholar as much efficient
it works on JVM so yeah so in fact if
you want to know more go to my channel
and search for Scylla videos I do have a
Scala videos as well okay so okay what
we say is why do not use Linux I do used
enough so this machine which I'm using
it has two OS it's a dual boost machine
it has Linux and windows both I use
Windows because can't reach their
heating software which I'm using it only
works on Windows and Mac it doesn't work
on Linux so unfortunately I cannot use
Dennis waiting so that's this acetal
that's do what the problem but I use
when I when I work on a software when I
when I build software I use a Linux
okay so the whole says can you
instruction about industrial training
I mean how I do industrial cleaning or
what happens in industry so when you get
hired by different companies they will
provide you training origin technologies
because what you learn in your car in
your colleges is very different from
what is happening in the industry so
when I go as a trainer there it is my
job to train you on those technologies
which are running in the industry now
that's one thing you will get trained in
fact I also trained to the late laterals
so let's say if you are working on some
other frameworks let's say if you are a
tester and if you want to move to get up
and you've been testing from last five
to six years and now you want to do it
or it was testing so for that also we
provide so as a trainer we provide
training so yeah so that's what we do in
an initial training okay next
oh so Mack was his Windows yeah so Mack
what's this Windows that's right
anyway I hate Windows by heart okay so
if I if you ask me what is my passion I
would say hitting Windows okay any
windows never there don't get offended
but then I I don't / sale of Windows I
love Linda I love Linux I love Mac I
love Android I love iOS except meters I
hit all I love all different ways you
know except windows ok so question from
kishore c plus plus or Java data
structures will be friend yeah they are
different ok data structure concept is
saying for every language it's just that
we have a different way of implementing
because we have different syntax ok
pledge well says we want you to speak
Telugu ok I do speak the look of maybe I
will make a video by speaking Telugu I'm
not that fluent I do understand that ago
because I'm born and brought up in
Mumbai so we don't I don't speak much
Telugu here because all my friends are
Maharashtrians or from often dogs so I
do speak their language because here in
Maharashtra we speak Marathi so I do
speak but I did not not fluent but then
I I don't understand and I can reply so
yeah but well I will make a video by
speaking tell you but not understand
that's ok let me know let me tell you
one thing I have one more chunk of I
mean 20 so all those weird stuff talking
in Telugu and then doing some extra
stuff this will be uploaded
that is called on the new channel which
is live in reading so so much fun I'm in
immunity Channel or I will just paste a
link here so that it will be easier for
you to go there okay so I'm sharing my
link so see the chat window I've shared
a length of the new channel just go
there and you'll find some awesome
videos coming on the way there
okay so well Pawan says how can you
create apps using Android studio oh I do
have a videos on that so just go to my
place go to crazy stuff thanks for
learning and search for android studio
i know'd android tutorials okay so you
are looking good in beard oh thank you
so much I'm just trying to think maybe
my mom does doesn't like it but let's
see it goes hi can you tell scope of web
development using Java so we have a good
future you know for Java because all the
enterprise of applications all the
enterprise softwares they are big using
Java using spring framework or hibernate
so it's a good circuit just this is a
good scope so the last five minutes
everyone it's been lunchtime now so I'll
be making my lunch
so last five minutes so do you work for
Google no I don't know Google don't get
confused by that loco that okay
I know this you can see a logo on the
right hand side on the left side for me
okay so down this side if you see that
logo there it's not it's not a I'm not
working for Google it's a Google hangout
should I say on this side okay I don't
know maybe this is it doesn't matter
this doesn't matter so the logo there is
not it's not I'm not working for Google
it's because I'm using Google hangout I
have that will logo there he's Google
hangout for coming on YouTube so you
will get that logo as well okay so there
is a lot of difference in what you tell
