polymorphism now in polymorphism you
have two types one is method overloading
and method overriding so in this part
we'll talk about overloading not exactly
what loading is let's say you have a
class called as a and in this class you
have method called as public void show
okay so we have this mythical - oh now
in in this show let me play say s out
and say hello just friend hello that's
it so I'm in this show method I'm
printing hello
why if I say if I want to call that show
I to say a obj equal to a new a so we
need to create the object of a and then
we can say it is obj dot so right so the
only way to call the method which is
show which is a non-static method you
require an instance or you require an
object right so I'm having an object
called as obj and then I'm saying obj
dot Show right okay can I have one more
method here called as public void public
void show which has the same name and
same number of parameters of course not
it's because when you say sure it will
get confused do I need to call this show
are going to call this show there should
be some different side so what we can
change we can change the number of
parameters if I say int I so if I call a
show now it will check for the show
method which doesn't have any parameter
so it will search for this that means it
will search for the signature and the
signature which is matching as this one
right so it will not call this the show
with the parameter so we'll print here
it is it is hello and plus I so it will
print the value of I also so if I run
this code obviously the output will be
expecting yes hello writes on the end
and the output is hello but let's say if
I pass a value if I pass the value five
it will jump to this constructor or this
method which is show and it will accept
the value 5 and then it will print hello
5
the output and the output says hello
five simple so the you can have two
different methods or two methods with
the same name but different number of
parameters now is it number or types
let's say you have public void show so
this is the number of parameters so that
says like we have double D now both
these methods have the same number of
parameters is it legal yes they can have
same number of parameters but it type
should be different
one is ain't second double if I write it
as end then it will give me an error
since it is double it will work so it's
not the number of parameters is the type
is the first number and then the type if
nobody same it will check for the type
so if you are saying here we are sending
five so it will check okay this is five
it will accept the value clear but if I
say it will send five point five
obviously it will call this double
method so this concept is called as
method overloading which is also called
as in fact we have lots of name for this
this is Method overloading loading we
have one we have some name like this is
oddly binding because your compiler will
know before running only before the
execution
so which method to call it is also
called a static binding because every
time it will bind the same thing and we
have one more name is it one more name
overloading early binding static binding
it is also called as compile time
polymorphism so we have different name
but this means the same thing clear the
same name and different number of
parameters and different type of
parameters that is causes method over
loading which is the part of
polymorphism in the next part we'll talk
about method overriding so thank you so
much for watching and do subscribe for
