ready and in this video we'll try to
deploy our first java spinning
application on AWS now to do this we'll
be using ec2 will be using Beanstalk and
we'll be using code star now again when
you talk about coaster is a new thing in
Amazon Web Services and it's an awesome
thing now in fact I have already made
video on how to deploy a spring
application on a tablet but that was
only with the help of Beanstalk now
using code star you can actually make
your work easy now first of all to do
that stuff you need Amazon account again
in the previous video if you have talked
about it so you have to make sure that
you have AWS account and once you have
it let's try to sign into the management
console so when I click on that you can
see it will ask you for using a password
okay now when you click on sign in or of
course when you enter your username
password and sign in and it will open
the window for you the the Amazon
console okay now once you log in you can
see it will show you all the available
service now again this is not my first
time of using a tablet that's why I'm
getting recently visited service this is
the services I am using for my
application but then you can also so you
will get this option of all services so
you will get compute services you will
get your upper services you will get IOT
services again you know you might not
use everything in one application but
then you can you can use whatever you
want now of course we need easy to for
your virtual servers so if you want to
deploy your application you need a
virtual server so that will be provided
by easy to but then if you use ec2 you
have to do lots of confusion by yourself
you have to specify what so what you
need you have to install the servers
here the the Tomcats aren't talking
about otherwise you can say elastic
Beanstalk what it will do is it will
give you it will it will help you in
deploying the application it will take
care of these servers you need and all
those stuff right but the amazing part
is this code star so in this thing I'll
be using code star now since if you are
using code stuff that doesn't means
you're not using a situ and Beanstalk
you are using that behind the scene
right so if I click on this code start
and again you will you will get the true
power of code star once you once you see
or once you run the application or if
you make some
changes and deployment in later videos
but time being imagine that it's the
best thing available for AWS developers
Oh George Allah pers so you can see when
I click on it of this coach Tariq so the
moment you do that it will give you an
option of creating a new project so when
you click on new project here it will
ask you for the project name and all the
stuff again this is my this is the
project which I have created earlier and
since we are getting a new new project
remember this every time I create a new
project that will create a new instance
and a new instance will we will charge
you of course when I'm making this video
this is not a free thing because I want
to be using one application so if I keep
that project for one R I'm in the Amazon
will charge me for one R right so let me
just do that so so it's creating a new
project now don't mind I do that you
know can you see that you are getting so
many options we have an option of you'll
be on Rails we have an option of Java
spring we have no js' we have Python so
just name the technology they have
services for everything you can create
any application you can deploy that on
Amazon Web service you can get a static
website you can create a Python web site
and a PI that they have so many options
but then in Java itself so what I do is
if I select a java application here you
can see in Java it said they are giving
you five options now why these five
options so one is web application the
second one is verification but without
being stopped so one is with beanstalks
again without Beanstalk the next two is
web services again with Beanstalk
without Beanstalk and you get lambda
again that a different thing you can you
can see that later then we want our web
applications of a selectman application
it will give you two options let's say
first one because we want to use
Beanstalk I don't want to configure
everything by myself so click on this it
will ask you for the project name I will
say this is Teddy score demo that's the
project name I'm giving again you can
have any project name you want I mean
which depository you want for gate do
you want to use github which everyone
uses all you want to use MS on own get
service which is cool commit now since
we are using Amazon service let's use
everything of Amazon select this one and
click on next ok so that was code commit
then so it is giving you that pipe like
it see that we have the entire pipeline
here so this is a project code pipeline
again what is pipeline here is you
deploy Omega
project you deploy your project on the
server okay normally what you do is on
on Eclipse so when you make a project
maybe any IDE NetBeans NetBeans eclipse
or IntelliJ what you do is you write a
code you compile your code you create a
wire file and then you deploy the value
on the server you don't have to do all
those things what you simply do is you
create your greater project make the
changes and simply say commit now commit
will upload the project on the server it
will post a project on the server the
server the Amazon service will build the
project for you
it will test the project for you if you
are written some test cases it will
deploy your project on it on Beanstalk
you don't have to do it by yourself when
it will also help you to monitor it
money to the server amazing stuff right
and after all these things let's create
a project
now while cutting a project it will ask
you for the key if you have not done
that you can clear new new key here
otherwise I already have a key here on
ec2 yeah so I already have a key
otherwise it will give you the option of
creating a new key let's say create
project and the moment you do that it
will create new project for you it will
take a lot of time maybe a 5 to 6
minutes to set up the project I don't
know the exact timing but it will take
some time because you can see it's a
zero person complete it takes it takes
some time to do that but then after
completing this you will be getting your
project on Amazon Web service it will be
a default project again the output will
see in the maybe it will see the output
here itself so let me just pause the
video for time when let's it complete ok
so as you can see the project is created
and it giving you two option it says you
must connect to your project or positive
before you start working on the code I
guess we have done that let's see what
connecting tools we have okay so again
we'll discuss about this later why do we
need a connecting tool here right you
can connect your service with the help
of eclipse or Visual Studio or command
line let's discuss about this later
let's go back to the project and ok so
once you've got your project this is how
your project look like ok where do you
find your link let's scroll up and where
is the link for the project
the application is not up yet so you can
see we have a source here we have so it
is building the code and there's our
application so it is not so just
building the application yet it is not
completely star scared so let's wait for
some more time okay finally you can see
we got everything set so we got a source
which is which is succeeded
we got a build and record the
application everything is succeeded but
how do you access your page whatever we
have created yet now if you can scroll
up this option of application endpoints
now this is the endpoint for app for
your website so the app which we have
created now if your simply click on this
this is your first web app on on Amazon
Web Services it says congratulation you
have just created a Java spring web
application and that's why Spring
Framework is so famous right everywhere
you you by default get Spring Framework
right so now question arise how do you
change it now of course we got our first
web app how do we make the changes I
don't want congratulations here I want
my own website name periscope I want to
say design and develop an event ID and I
want to change these things how do I
change it where do I get the source code
you might get the source code when you
click on this code and you know you'll
be getting the source option here and
you can make the changes but this is not
how you do it right if you want to work
on Java you of course need our IDE so
what you will do is you will use an IDE
make whatever favorite IDE you have but
here we'll be using Eclipse now in
Eclipse we have to install a plugin and
using that plug-in you can actually make
the changes in the project and whatever
change you make in the indy eclipse will
reflect on your way to the server you
know instead just you just have to push
that's it don't have to build anything
you don't have to make a wire file
nothing just make the changes and push
that that makes sense right so in the
next video we'll see how do you connect
the odd image on web service or AWS code
start with with Eclipse with Eclipse and
how can you push the changes so I hope
you enjoyed it this video where we have
created our first web application on
Elbrus so that's it in this we'll see
you in the next video until that point
like this video and do share this video
