about variables now what are variables
just imagined variables as a container
because in programming when you have
many talk about software now software is
all about data so when you build a
software you're actually processing lots
of data right because what is IT is all
about information right so you build a
software just to store that data and
where to store the data so we have
variables now why this one is variable
it's because you can change your data so
when you when you are allowed to change
anything it is called as variable right
so imagine this container as a variable
now this container can have different
different values right so example if you
have let's say let's say I want to have
headphones okay so let's say this
headphone you want to save it somewhere
so we have multiple options so you can
have a headphone cover you can use
mobile acabo or you can use that top
cover so you can use any of this cover
right so we can open a laptop cover we
can put headphones we can open a mobile
cover we can put headphones we can use a
headphone cover to put headphones now
let's say so that covers those are
variables and your headphone is the
value now let's say we have a mobile
phone so to keep a mobile phone we have
again to the option we can we have red
phone we have we have headphone cover we
have mobile combo we have laptop cover
so we can keep a mobile phone inside a
mobile cover we can keep it inside a
laptop cover I don't prefer to put a
half mobile phone inside a headphone
cover is it possible yeah if it is a
Nokia double one doubles your phone we
can try but I do not put our iPhone
inside I had fun go and that's not
possible right so we also for different
different type of values we have
different different variables or
different different type of variables so
in programming terms if you want to
stole a number so phone number we have
this which is int okay now why is it
because it is a teacher so you can have
a value from negative range to positive
range maybe negative edge to positive
range
then we have a different type of data
which is called as float so let's say if
you want to assign a point value so
let's say five point five seven point
six so those are your point values so to
store those point values we require this
type of variable which is this time of
data which is float let's say you want
to store a character maybe five not five
maybe a B and so to store those
characters we require care so basically
we have int they have float we have care
we have one of which is called a double
now double has more size than float okay
and in Java by default all values may be
seven point five seven point six all
point values they are doubled by default
okay then we have long so we have lots
of data types right so this ain't float
those are data types which define the
type of the variable so when I say int I
so I is the variable and in is the data
type simple and so when I say int I
equal to five so that five is the value
I is the variable and int is the depth
type data type so we can store so let's
talk about this size so int take two
bites or o may take four bytes in C it
takes two bites
so int takes two byte float takes four
bytes can take two bytes in Java so this
we have different different size for
this so you can see your table there so
we have four nth we have four bytes for
float we have four bytes so we have a
desktop that is there so for different
different values we have different
different data by right so now let's say
you have a value inside end so which is
five now Alexa inte R equal to five
now you can assign the same value to
float variable that's possible because
the size of float also is four we can
have the same value to double value but
can we assign a double value to end it's
like putting your laptop inside of a
while travel so what you have to do is
we have to cut your laptop in the sign
in the size of mobile phone and then you
can put your laptop inside a mobile
mobile cover that's what happens here so
when I say we have a variable which is
we have a value which is five point five
and you want to store this five point
five
double value inside and you will use
some data you will know so point five
you will only store five simple so this
all data types are called as primitive
data type so we have something more yes
we also have reference variables I can
what is reference variable that will
discuss when you start with objects okay
so that is from variables so thanks for
watching and this is there for further
