we have talked about this activity right
in which you have create we have created
we have entered some values then we can
mention we can mention the name we can
mention the gender email id pass what I
as soon as I click on this button create
account
it will show you that message inside our
toast right so in this video what we'll
do is we'll talk about intent so why we
require intent here so let me just
remove this comment first so if I remove
this comment and a slash now what I want
I have created this activity here which
is show data activity in which I want to
show the details which you have entered
in this signup activity so if I enter
let's say Naveen so it should print
hello and if I mention gender like male
so if it should say hello mr. Naveen and
that's my email id which I enter there
and then they password right that's what
we want so as soon as I click on this
button which is not this one if as soon
as I click on this button here so it
should call the second activity in which
you have to see the details right so let
us break down this task into two parts
first we'll try to call the activity and
then we'll think about how to set the
values okay so now to work with that
activity we need to create something but
as intent so what is intent intent is it
is something which which specifies to
your Android that something is happening
you want to call an activity or you want
to set the broadcast map or you want to
work with broadcast messages or you can
you know if you it's do it your intent
basically so how to use intent so we
have to mention intent and then we can
get object of intent as let's say I and
then we can say new intent okay so that
is how you create object of intent
okay now cost-share lies why we require
intent here one getting adult fault is
because I already have this in terrible
so let me just make it intent so why the
exactly why we require this intent so
let's say I do not let's say I want to
call the second activity so I have to
just mention start activity right so we
can directly mention start activity here
so in order to call this second activity
we have to mention start activity but it
ask you so this star
activity will ask you for so if I say
control space so this will ask you for
the intent because in the intent you
mentioned that which activity to call
but hold on we have not mentioned that
right so we have to mention two
parameters here the first parameter is
from which class or from which object
you are calling it so the object is sign
up activity so this is sign of activity
god this we are we are trying to call
show data dot class so we are calling
this class which is show data so we are
calling activity we showed it up from
sign up activity it is that simple right
and if I run this code now let's see if
walking or not so let me check my
emulator now so it will reopen the app
so let us try it out now so let us let
me enter my details I will say this is n
N and mail and that we can enter Emily
ID any email ID here we can enter a
password and once you click on this
button create account so we got the
message and we also got the activity
right so that's how you can call one
page from other page you can also call
one activity from other activity using
start activity method simple right but
hold on I also want this message is
right I want to print hello mister than
Naveen and all nn2 visit for that matter
and then we can mention a mullerian
password right now to do to do that a
way to pass some data there now how to
pass data so we can simply say intent so
we can pass the data using intent so we
can say intent dot put extra and in this
you can specify the label so what we are
passing we are passing name and in which
variable you are passing name so we are
passing name in name variable right then
we can say intent dot put extra so does
the method we have to use put extra here
and we can say gender and we can pass
the dice it means later I want to print
this solut there and we need to make
sure that we use put extra not push put
extras because that is the default thing
it gives you so you have to mention put
extra
and we can say this is email and we can
send email and then last part we have to
send password right so we have to say
int n dot put extra we can say this is
pass okay and we are passing a variable
which is pass so we are sending all this
data to the show data activity so how to
first that data here right we need to
fetch those data right
so to do that since we are passing the
data in sudden intent we have to receive
the data again from the from the intent
right so we have to say intent will say
intent now in this case we do not have
to create the new intent because every
time you create new intent it will be it
will give you the default blank intent
we do not want the blank intent we want
the intent from which you are passing
the data so for that we have to say get
intent so that we will get will we will
so that we get those data here now once
you got the intent we can simply say
string we want name and from where to
fetch name so we can simply say this is
a intent dot get string because we can
also mention the type of data we have
power we are receiving so we can say get
string extra and we can mention in which
label we are passing data so that is
name and then we can enter all this data
okay
all this details here and the thing is
we have the name as string as name and
then we have also created text view so
display data so it is also name so it
will conflict right so what I will do is
I will say this is s name this is s
gender this is what s email and this is
s pass that sounds weird right but that
is that will do for us so now once we
got this data or once we got this
details that let us display that detail
on the text view and for that we need to
create object of test view right so we
have to provide the name we have to
provide the object for text view so we
have to say a text view so we'll say
this this is text what is that
so we'll say this is text view and we
can mention find vo by ID and here you
have to mention the reference which is r
dot r dot so the variable name was txt
just your name right so it is tht name
and how to check that go to your show
activity and we have this thing here
this is txt name this solut here is TX
to gender and was that does his email
and dad's password text email and text
password right so let us provide those
data here so we'll say this is let me
just reuse the code for and this is
gender okay and this is txt txt gender
so this is my what email and this is
fast okay and this thing here will be
txt one why I am typing e every time
okay then we have to mention email and
the last one is pass right now once we
got all the reference now the let's say
T data now how to set data here it is
very simple we just have to say name dot
set text and the text we have to specify
is s name here so we can specify as name
then the next one is gender so we'll say
this is gender dot set text and we can
specify s gender right and then we can
specify
email email dot set text we can specify
as email and then we can specify the
last one which is pass dot set text as
what s Pass now once we have set all the
values I think it should work now and if
I want this activity let's run it let's
do it let us run this it will take some
time to load so it is loading ok it will
take some time
ok so let's enter the value so we'll say
this is a maybe I will say n a V I will
say mail you we can rent anything we can
pass it the password as CCC and if I
click on if I click on this create
account it should work and bingo you can
see we got the output features hello mr.
Devine or nav username is NNN and
password is CCC right so that's how we
can use intent N and white so there are
multiple uses of intense but since we
are the big know so we are only looking
at the basic part of intent which is
calling the other activity so that's it
