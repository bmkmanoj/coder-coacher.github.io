application or web application on
OpenShift
now this application can be lovi
application this can be a java
application it may be a PHP application
so you can deploy a different type of
application or different of a web
application on OpenShift but before in
this video we only talk about Java
because we'll be doing a practical
implementation of 8 in the further
tutorials so we'll focus on you in Java
now whenever you want to create a
OpenShift application on you have to
deploy an open shipped application first
thing is you have to create a project
which is supported by open shaped cloud
service so before deploying you should
understand some some terminologies and
some technologies the first you should
you should learn what is mavin so to
learn mavin you can watch my video on
demand it's a big tool so I will you can
find a link in the description for mavin
so what is mavin exactly it's a big tool
so let's say you want to create a
project of a project in Java so you can
use a mapping template or mavin
archetype so it's a business of process
structure let's say you want to in your
application you want to add some
libraries so you want masks you'll
connect er you require J unit library so
you not downloading those labrie by
yourself you can ask mavin to give you
those libraries ok it's very handy tool
to use so you can find a link in
description douche make sure you watch
that video first before going for the
next video so after this we should watch
it ocean of mavin so if you know mavin
you can skip that video so yeah so you
should know about mavin the second thing
is whenever you deploy an application on
openshift
it's not just you have to make an
application and deploy you know you can
also test your application while
developing on OpenShift now how to do
that so you should know how to work with
eclipse or you can also do it with
command line but I don't prefer to work
with command line because it is very
difficult for beginners so usually we
can directly use Eclipse to do all those
tasks so let's say you have an eclipse
here and you have open ship server okay
so we have Eclipse and open ship server
whenever you make an application you
will first create it in Eclipse right so
you will make it
vacation in Eclipse wherever you are
done with the the part you can deploy
directly on open shipped so in a clip
there will be option of push so you have
to push your application towards the
server okay so it will go to the server
open ship server but hold on then when
they might do multiple applications on
open safe flight
so how to mention which application you
want to target so for that you have to
first log in to your open sips openshift
website and you have to give the
identities on Eclipse so on Eclipse you
have to install a plugin for a position
so once you install the plug-in you have
to sign in there with your username
password of OpenShift then this Eclipse
and open ship will be connected okay and
you can create multiple applications on
openshift and everything you can see on
Eclipse so let's say you are using that
application here you just have to deploy
or push the application to the open
shift server but hold on whenever you
see this there's another push so it
doesn't it will it will not take your
project directly from Eclipse to
openshift so it goes it via so first
your application which is an eclipse
will go to get okay from gate it will go
to open shipped server so you should
also learn what is gate so you the two
technologies you have to learn is how in
factory now so first you should know how
to use mavin all what is mavin second
how to install plug-ins in Eclipse
if you know if you are a beginner so you
might find it you pick up difficult and
next you should learn what is gate okay
so basically it was founded by Linus
Torvalds the same guy who has build
Linux kernel so get back a little while
install world and so you can find some
example of kids so we have github and we
have big bucket big bucket so we have
these two things you can you can push an
application to this websites so most
famous is github so you can just push
your application there and from that it
will go to open shift now you don't have
to create a git account whenever you
create account on open set you will get
a good account which will be used by
open shirt okay so folio from be eclipse
you have to push it
to OpenShift but in open shape you'll be
getting three to3 gears so it's free
right but do you really got only three
gears so in total they have many I guess
it around 15 16 years you can use three
maximum three so what is this gear so
let's say your application you want a
tomcat or maybe you require a JBoss now
yeah so what is JBoss JBoss is a app
server same as Tomcats a tomcat is a web
server JBoss is an app server okay and
JBoss supports all JSP application and
submit application now since
openshift belongs to Red Hat JBoss also
belongs to Red Hat that's why you can
either they they work together you can
also use Tomcat no issue but if you are
working on openshift
your preferable is JBoss so all your
eclipse is shown of instead of working
with Tomcat you can work with JBoss so
these are the things you should learn
before deploying the app on open shape
target this is not difficult you can you
can see all those thing in the
subsequent tutorials but just you know
be ready with your mind you have to
learn all those things
so first Madden then you have to learn
get then you have to learn Eclipse JBoss
and that's it so will deploy that app on
opposition so yeah that's it thanks for
watching and it was next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
