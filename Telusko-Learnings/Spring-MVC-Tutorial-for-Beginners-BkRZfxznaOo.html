walking on sublet and JSP maybe starts
framework and if you are looking for
some simple solution here we are so we
are talking about spring MVC so welcome
to that is the learnings my name is
Dmytro D and let's talk about spring MVC
now so what exactly spring MVC easy I
hope you might have heard about this
from lots of people let's move to spring
MVC let's learn spring MVC so why
everyone is moving to spring MVC it's
because it is damn easy to work with
ok so there are lots of reasons why we
are going for spring MVC the first one
is it is easy to learn second it
provides you that flexibility that you
can change anything anytime and third
the separation of concerns or separation
of the modules example we have different
views we have different models and then
we have different services to work with
spring provides you all those features
and if you have already worked on spring
you know the power of spring right and
this is spring MVC now when you talk
about spring MVC we can create amazing
websites using things spring MVC I mean
nothing different from what you what we
done what we do in servlet and JSP but
doing the same thing in a very effective
way right now if I remember when you
work with sublights what we have did is
you have created the socket class and
then you say exchange HTTP servlet then
you have to create a method which is
which is service right and then you send
a request the client sends the request
goes to server and that's how it works
how spring MVC works is again when you
when you learn these things you might
find it bit difficult to grasp
everything but trust me if you make one
simple application or even a small
coding spring MVC after that if you want
to expand to it it is very easy okay
so let's start with it so let us try to
understand the architecture or how
exactly spring MVC works so just for
that what we will do is let's imagine we
have certain controllers here okay so we
have certain controllers right so if you
go to your server technology every sub
let behave like a controller white and
your JSP behaves like a view so let's
say we have something control
now what controllers I'm talking about
let's say we have a login controller we
have a logout controller we have add a
controller we have multiplication
controller so let's say we have this
four controllers here from the client
side when clients sends a request
request goes to your favorite file which
is web dot XML file right in that XML
file we mentioned for which request you
want to call which controller right
that's what we do in and in your normal
survey technology in Summit MVC right
but so the problem is if you have lots
of controllers sometimes it's difficult
to manage all the controllers right
let's say we have 15 they have we have
100 controllers so it is difficult to
manage all the controllers second each
sublight will behave like one controller
we wanted something called as multi
action controller for that again the
spring MVC will help you so if you try
to convert the same architecture in
spring and we see what we can do is we
have a client machine here client
machine sends the request to this server
and server says ok now we are not using
normal MVC we want to use spring MVC
that means to handle all this controller
we need one more controller who will be
the front controller ok so with all
these controllers we have one more
controller ties your front controller
then you will think ok now we have to
provoke provide one more controller no
you don't have to do that spring MVC
will create a controller for you you
just have to create your controllers but
the front controller will be given by
spring MVC now that front controller in
spring and base it is called as
dispatcher servlet that means all the
client requests which goes to web.xml
file should know that you are using
spring MVC and all the requests should
go to your your front controller which
is your deployed which is your order
dispatcher sublet how can you mention
that so it's very simple in your web.xml
file just mentioned that for all the
requests we have to send the request to
dispatcher servlet is that simple right
again you know how to do it right you
can create a subject tag you can create
so that mapping tag and you can do that
now once your request goes to despite a
sublet then what
now despite a servlet will think okay
the request is for login I should call a
login sublet I mean I want to call a
login controller right request is for ad
so you have to call add controller
request is for logout you have to call
logout controller so despite this object
should know which one to call but there
is one more issue here the issue is how
would your dispatch a servlet knows
which controls a call now your your
dispenser which is not a Superman right
it will know everything so what happens
is when request goes to web.xml file it
sends your request to despite the
servlet now this for the servlet needs a
configuration file so in that file you
have to mention which request to call
which controller but then you will say
that's not good right because we were
very happy with servlets no need I have
no need for that extra file but hold out
spring MVC provides you something called
as annotations so all your controllers
should be annotated with the help of
controller so we have to use a
controller annotation and that's it so
with that kind of annotation every
controller will have some mapping some
mapping steps again we will see that
when we do when we do programming or the
Blacula implementation but every
controller will have a mapping right you
have to only mention that configuration
file that in which package you have all
your configuration and you're done I
mean in which package you have audio
controllers of course why these are Java
files so it you'll be having all this
thing in one particular package right or
maybe multiple packages so you just have
to mention which package you're working
with that's it dispatches servlet will
specify okay we have to go to this
package to find the controllers you
didn't have to do that it will be done
by your spring MVC okay so let me repeat
clients as a request request goes to
web.xml file web.xml file says ok we
have to send all the requests to the
dispatcher servlet and this one subject
will check the complication file and say
ok we have to send that request to login
controller now that login
Toula will do some processing of course
right when you when you call a method it
is views it is done for with the help of
it is done for the processing right so
after the processing as a client what
you need some page right so that
controller will return you a page not
exactly that controller will give you
the name of the page because it might
happen that you have lots of pages right
so when you say you are building a
website you will be having lots of views
right when you say views I'm talking
about the pages which a client sees
right so there will be lots of pages
which page to call that's a that's a
question second to see we have a page
right it needs two things first which
pays to call second what is the data now
data will be generated by your
controller but which page to call you
have to mention that in your controller
it will mention the page name it will
mention the data that data and the page
name goes to the dispatcher servlet
again your front controller you see that
it's not directly controller to page it
is through dispatch a servlet so the
controller will send the response to the
dispatcher servlet now this purchase of
it will get two things the data and the
view name it will call that particular
view okay and it will also add so your
view technology will fetch the data from
the controller make sense and then that
page goes from this first object to
decline and if you can see everything is
done by dispatcher servlet as a client
you are only interacting with your front
controller you don't even know how many
controllers you have on the backend side
right everything is done by your front
controller then you will think you know
everything is good but why do we need
yy-your dispenser that should know which
you to call it's because it may happen
that let's say for time when you are
using JSP as your wheel technology in
future if you want to change your view
technology let's say you want to use
theme leaf if you want to use maybe some
other velocity or Freema free marker if
you want to use all this view technology
just have to change the configuration
file you just have to change the
configuration file for your what it is
for a servlet right you can change it
from JSP to theme live like this change
your views and just change the
conjugation your controllers will not
even know which technology which meu
technology you're walking so that is the
separation of concern your controllers
don't know what we we are using and your
view technology don't know what
controllers we are using is that awesome
is that flexible right so spring MVC is
awesome there are lots of features you
know I feel spring MVC is like a magic
and as a developer VR magician right so
it's an amazing technology to know more
how to do all this request mapping and
how to work with the controllers how to
create this configuration file how to
get a client we already know we'll see
all those things in the practical
