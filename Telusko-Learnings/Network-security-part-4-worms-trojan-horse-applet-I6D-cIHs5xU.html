part in this will talk about wolves and
oceans and some other stuff so it is
well now see we know about website so if
you cannot see my previous video to
check my part 3 because in that we have
covered viruses right so what is virus
again it's a cool which will affect your
computer it will first propagate itself
it will deplete will create some
replicas and once you get deep when once
it get the power you will attack your
system the next the next type of malware
the next type of malware is your boom
nobody's bombs but these are the types
of pilot this is this is a type of - not
exactly but a wireless but you know it's
a different us it's been category of
virus in which what it does you know
when I talk about virus it will affect
your computer what warm does it's just
it will be created because it will not
affect your computer it would not attack
your computer it will not how do you
compute a point in the network let's
suppose if alien landed in big Network
what bomb will do it will try to
propagate it will completely it multiple
replicas so in every network it will
create multiple replicas so that your
network is so full of worms it will stop
it will slow down unit book and flitting
will come down imagine this thing let's
suppose you have thousands of computer
in your land or thousands of computer in
your company so in that company if
you're the outer gets affected with
bombs that router will send this bomb on
each and every switch and that switch
will propagate this worm in each and
every machine you can imagine your
bandwidth will go down because of this
bomb it will slow down your network so
what one does it creates some replicas
and it will have effect your computer it
will I think your network that set but
still is dangerous it's because it's
affecting your network I'm going to talk
about IP it's working on eight world
right so you can imagine if your mom is
getting a peg if your bomb is attacking
your Google services everything goes
down it's because it what goes down
Google goes down the next what we have
is true so we have what is forest
oh no this dodging house see you know
you might know about that movie of Troy
right in movie Troy you have seen that
scene that footage in which the king
sent his soldiers hidden in a big wooden
horse and that wooden horse is gifted to
some other King what are the King thinks
it's a real gift but what is there its
soldiers right so it's something like in
IQ one what you can do is you can think
it off like you're downloading some
software from internet you know you're
so happy that you're getting priests
office on utorrent they are getting free
software free beings you are getting
free movies but the problem is there are
some Trojans in their example if let's
suppose I want to I tagged all these
systems or what I will do I will upload
a movie with some erosions what you will
think you're getting a movie but what
you are getting is movie with Trojans
and what that Trojan will do it might
affect your computer it might it might
act as a spiral it will in teach or it
will affect you so what you think it's
good what happens is bad so that is what
fusion power P so ocean how this one
comes our ancient time in which they
they attack each other with the help of
this hidden things so what is Trojan
it's something hidden with some good
thing so if everything a software
company you're getting my total for free
so think about it
we do not want anything from internet
next time check it okay
scan it before you use so there might be
some tools in there so cash for your
house so you have viruses you have bombs
and you have tools and swag but the
problem is if you talk about all these
different languages you might be knowing
about Java right so in Java we have
something called as applets so it's
something with a plate then we have
something called as a 2 X X not what
what this means
see this way we don't know what internet
there is there are some components there
are some components which works on
server there are some components which
works on client side so examples are
providing
a web service in that venue when you're
writing a server-side programming you
have to use JSP a videos SBR videos PHP
you have to use Ruby
so all those languages they works on
server side client side you have
JavaScript you have the wristlet right
but there are something else component
so like when you play games when you
play online games that game decides on
server but when you want to play that
give you you download this those games
on your browser you play it and when you
say close that games can delete it
because it should resize on server but
it runs on your machine if we talk about
J's be fine if we talk about ASP fine if
we talk about PHP file this file runs on
server output you see in your computer
right but if you talk about games online
games it resides on server it runs on
your computer right so that's what touch
just call us client side components and
if you have to get kind side components
you have to use applet all you have to
use an ActiveX so update we create a
place using Java and for like t-rex we
have to use some Microsoft technologies
ok so let me change
we have Java applet and then we have
Microsoft Active X but the problem is
it's good right here
there is something on server which is
which gets downloaded a pretty cute on
your machine but the problem is attacker
attacker can use this to thing to attack
your system trances right so let's
suppose if we write some Vanishes called
any in that software and that software
gets executed on your system it might
affect your system and that's why Java
has provided one securities that applet
cannot access your system resources they
have implemented the security now but
earlier it was opened your applet can
affect your system so if you don't know
what a plate I will recommend you to go
back to your books and so you what
happen it so you you might be knowing
about surveillance so sovereigns are
something which
server which runs on server applets
resides on the server but runs on Clyde
machine so that's what we have the two
different names for it so it's still
risky lines I play the next octave XD
resides on server execute it on your
computer or your browser it can affect
your computer's weight then what next we
have we have cookies so if you don't
know about cookies cookies are something
like it's a token it's a token given to
a client so that next time the client
sends the request to a server server
should know who is that client it's
because your servers are they are
stateless now would you state this they
don't know anything about the client so
if client sends a request to a server
client need to send his details all
right so every time you cannot send
details right every time thus our will
or not ask you who are you
so what we can do is that server will
create a cookie that cookie catch
towards on your computer on your local
computer like client-side computer next
time example this is your client and
this is your so we have blind and we
have server the neck suppose client will
send a request so we'll send a response
of this is request this is response
right but the first time in clients in
the request server da never client so
what is a response but next time when
client sends a request
so what should know is the client so
what someone will do you will get a
cookie cookie in this cookie it will
have clients detail and this cookie will
get stowed on client side so that next
time when client sends a request it will
also send cookie okay so this is how
cookie works right so which is simple
yeah
so these are the time this is the type
of attack you can have so first they can
attack I can use virus
so again and I didn't use bombs attack I
can use Trojan horse or they can use
applet or they can use activates okay
simple right
so this is the this is the time this is
your first chapter so we have our fourth
video for videos on this first chapter
so first we'll discuss about first in
first video we have discussed about the
it work
so again we have discuss about attacks
in third video I have discussed about
viruses and the post will you got you
have seen worms oceans then if you have
a plate activex all those things so this
is your first chapter I will still
recommend once you just read that book
once so that my idea you will get some
ideas about my videos okay so first was
this videos to do the Deadpool okay I
took a heartache so if you hang it out
to comment so that I will tell you but
more video on your doubts so please do
subscribe and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
