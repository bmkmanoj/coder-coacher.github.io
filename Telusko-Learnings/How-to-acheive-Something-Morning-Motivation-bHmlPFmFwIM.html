Naaman Wendy and I mean in my garden
enjoying the sunlight and I was hitting
this book and not the art of thinking
clear and then I thought about like let
me give you some motivation tips for the
day so the topic is how to achieve
something so I feel the best way to
achieve something is to do it I mean to
just work for it you know there are lots
of people they only think about it they
only think about I want to do this thing
I want to achieve this thing but they
don't start with it I don't know what
are the fears they have what are the
daughters what are the fields they have
why don't they start but the best way to
achieve something is to start with it
again there are certain certain
achievements which are small which are
big even it doesn't matter the size of
the achievement it's about how you start
it I mean it's not about how you start
it is actually you have to start it if
you hold it for a long time and few if
you keep it for a long time it will take
lots of time you know there are people
who postpone the stuff for one week one
month maybe they have seen people
they're thinking about doing some stuff
from last six months but they're not
doing it
so the best way to achieve things is to
do it
okay that's one now if you think about a
lion you know lion don't think about
hunting they hunt okay
so stop thinking about doing stuff this
does just start with it in fact when
facebook if you talk about Mark
Zuckerberg he wanted to build Facebook
here so he built it I mean he was not
thinking for one month about building a
Facebook he built it right so he the
idea again doesn't matter who was who I
mean whose ideas it was to build a
Facebook but there was an idea and he
started with it so the best way to
achieve stuff is to start with it okay
so let's say today if you want to learn
something
I mean you maybe you want to work as a
student or the company employee you want
to you want to do big stuff you want to
create a new project you want to learn
new technology I mean why you're waiting
for what you're waiting for some magical
thing to happen if you want to learn
something new today to start with an
example let's say if you want to learn
Big Data now so just start with Big Data
right I mean no one is no one is there
to stop you so go to now just at this
point if you think you want to learn new
technologies you just go to Google and
search about it
look for the tutorials available for it
and I mean go to udemy go to Coursera go
to youtube wherever you want but learn
it
I mean don't wait for it I mean there's
no perfect time this is the perfect time
if you want to learn something new this
is the time you can learn okay
so yeah that's how you achieve think
that's up I have achieved things so when
I wanted to do something I just start
with it maybe there are some things
which will fail there's something which
will which will which you will get it
the most important things is you are
getting the stuff you are not skipping
the stuff okay
the more you the more you postponed it
the more delay you're getting your
achievements so if you want something
now do it today if Mark Zuckerberg
waited for one year so Facebook or I
mean I I don't think Facebook would any
I mean we will be getting Facebook right
so start with that if you have something
new in your mind just start with it
so that's it thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
