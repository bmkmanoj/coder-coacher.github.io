and in this video we'll talk about
length list in the last video we have
talked about arrays and what are the
drawbacks in a day now one of the
drawback which we have seen is once you
define the size of an array
you cannot expand it or the kana you
cannot even shrink it but in case of
linguist we can do that now in linked
lists what we can do is we can create a
collection of elements and every element
will be linked with each other okay so
let's let's make it simple now so what I
will do is let's take an example here I
will take four values let's say I want I
want to take values like twelve or the
next value is let's say six and then we
have eight and then we have three so I
want to store this four values so I want
you say twelve six eight and three I
want to store it as a collection not
individual because if you want to work
with individual values you could have
created three or four variables and you
can assign those values but if you want
to keep it as one collection in normal
way we can create an array but the only
problem is you cannot expand it so in
linked lists what we do is we use a
concept of a data and a reference know
what it means now first of all to store
this values I will not go for any any
continuous memory what I will do is I
will create this for four boxes so the
first box is will have a value 12 these
second box may be anywhere so you have a
sequential memory right you can have
your data anywhere but just to make it
simple you know just to represent in a
time it take any format I'm doing in
syllabi so we have one more value here
which is six and then let me just draw
one more here which is eight and the
last one which is three so we have we
have these four values we have 12 6 8
and 3 now what am I do is I want to say
this is a collection but then it is
possible that they are not in a
condition location there might be some
elements in between so let's say we have
12 here after that we have some element
here maybe a B then you will be having
some some more than maybe 5 to 6
elements in between maybe 15 20 elements
in between so they are not continuous
right so when I say I have these
elements they are not in sequence
example if I want to say hey I want to
fetch the third value
how can you mention third value because
you you don't have any sequence if you
want to make them in sequence what you
have to do is first of all you have to
make
the first element as ahead so you have
to make this as a header so once you
have made this head that means this is
the first element so that is simple
but how about the second element how we
do how do you like the first one and the
second one now to make it work we will
call each element here as nodes so the
elements which we are using here are
node so this is an old this is also a
node the eighth is also on node and
three is also a node and of course all
these are elements so node value is
twelve
node land your six node value is 8 and
node value is three or you can call them
as value you can call them as info now
how do you link this to ln6 the way you
link is by creating one more memory here
or one more box now this node will have
two things the first one is the info so
this 12-years info and the next one will
be the address of the next node now
every node will have an address of
course right so let's say the address
for this node is five one two that's the
address for this node there just for
this node is let's say 3 to 6 the
address for this node is let's say 1 0 1
and the address for this node is let's
say 2 0 2 so we have all this address
here now in this box this will have the
address of the next node so in our
example 6 is our next node right if you
want to have 8 as a next node you can
write the address of 8 here but in this
case 6 is our next node X you can see
the sequence here I want to maintain the
sequence you can say 3 2 6 so this is
the address of the next node that means
we have a line between this so we have a
line between the first node and the
second node so this node 1 this is node
2 node 3 and node 4 now as you guessed
it right in 6 you will be having the
address off to the I just of 8 which is
1 0 1 so this is 1 0 1 here and this one
will have 2 0 2 so we have a reference
so this is a link and even this is a
link and that's quite simple right but
the problem is what about the last
element now of course we don't have any
element after that even though even
there will be having an address but then
address of what so it will be null now
since we don't have anything after that
it is null so we have the first node
here which is 12 this is the first node
second or third and fourth node and
fourth node will be null
we don't have it anything after that
this is how you could a link list so we
have a list of values in the end they
all are linked and that's why they say
linked because they all are linked and
at least because they only this it's a
leased so once we have all this values
assigned this is at least now and if you
remember in the start of this session we
talked we said this is expandable so
when I say it is expandable how do I
start the first one I mean how do I add
the element anywhere so maybe I will
start by adding the element at the end
maybe I want to add the element here
after three so let's say in the least we
have one more value here that says seven
and how do we add seven at the end here
so what you can do is as this very
simple step just cleared note here
whatever no do you want and then the
value for this node will be seven so
this is the value right what about the
address now this is as this is the last
one you can simply put here null so you
can say this is null because this is the
last one but then we have mentioned
three as null right but then now two is
not the last element in our judgment is
seven so after three also we have seven
and this seven will also have an address
and let's say the address for this one
is one two six this is the address if
you want to link this you have to
mention after three we have seven so
what you do is you have to change this
value so now you cannot have null here
now you have to make it one to six
after three we have seven right so I
have to mention the address here and
then we can we can give an atom so this
is the seven is the last element here
after three we have seven that's how you
can simply add the value it's that
simple
or can we add the value at this start
yeah it's quite possible the only thing
you have to do is again create a node so
we got a next node here and let's say
the value 4 so after before - well as
well I want to assign a value like 5 I
want to have a value 5 here so what you
can do is you can make the value 5 here
and how do I refer so now this is one
more change you cannot refer the 12 as
the head element now so 20 is no more
the head element now the head element is
5 and of course this will have an
address so let's say 5 is at address 3 0
6 that's the address now what you will
do is in five after five the element is
12
so we have to mention the address of 12
year which is 105 1 2 so 5 1 so after 5
we have to well so that means we have an
arrow so 5 is the first element now
because that's his head and then after
that we have to well up to that we have
6 after that we have 8 so that's why we
can add the value at the start now can
we add at the value at in the in
somewhere in middle and the answer is
yes it's quite possible what you can do
is you can create one more box here did
you make a box and that box will have a
value so what I want to buy add so
between 6 &amp;amp; 8 I want to add let's say 9
so I want to add 9 between 6 &amp;amp; 8
so you can create on 9 you can have a 9
value here and then it will have its own
address let's say 5 0 6 I hope that I
just not code here so we have 5 0 6 here
I know if you can observe
I'm giving random values or random
addresses because all these values will
be stored somewhere else you don't even
know right they are not in sequence
I mean you will know bit about the
address but then they are not in
sequence so if you don't have this links
it will that you cannot fetch them in
sequence ok so now in 9 so if you have
to mention 9 comes before 8 so 9 will
have an address of 8 which is 1 0 1 so
now 9 is linking to 8 that means we have
to remove I mean if you have to of
course we move this link but then if you
remove this link what should I put here
so 6
so inside 6 will be not good so the
address will not be of 8 now it will be
off of 9 so we have to say 5 0 6 and we
have to give an adult so of course we
are not using this arrow anymore so
after 6 we have 9 after 9 we have 8 so
that's how you can add values in between
so it's dry comfortable because we do we
are not consuming data in a continuation
so we can create as many notes as
possible provided you have enough memory
in your system it will create number of
nodes and all this nodes will be
connected with a linked list now this
type of linkage which we have created
here is called as a singly linked list
because it is single linked list that
means will so we also have a doubly
linked list or the world English yes we
also have a double linked list we'll see
that in the in the in the one of the
videos in future but
this is a single linked list so this is
better than a DS right so before we have
talked about arrays and now we are
talking about linked lists so now you
tell me which is better
is it array or linked list now of course
both have their advantage and drawback
but what is the advantage so the
advantage of using linked lists is it is
expandable you can increase the size of
the links you can reduce the size of the
list right so you can say the advantage
here is expandable but the problem in
linked lists is it is slow so when I say
drawbacks it is slow in in when you
compare with array because in array
it works with index numbers now since
everything is stored in a sequence it
works with indexed numbers and you can
fetch the value randomly so the benefit
of array is it you can fetch the value
randomly right so that's the positivity
of it so let's say this is add a
positive value and the so linkage
drawback is it's slow we have to also
mention the drawback of a denied in fact
we have talked about in the in the
previous video it's not expandable so
your slinked lease is slow because if
you want to fetch a particular value
let's say if you want to fetch 8 you
cannot directly go to 8 you have to go
from 5 so first you have to go to 5 then
you can so you can go to first have to
go to 5 then you have to go to 12 so you
have to you have to follow that sequence
and then you can reach to 8 in fact we
also have a concept of Big Big O
notation again we have not discussed
that yet so we'll say big on it to
notation would be a big odd Big O n so
if you want to search for the value you
have to say Big O and again we'll talk
about it later
remember that link list to search it
uses Big O n so it is time consuming
compared to link compared to a day in
terms of searching but in but if you
want to fetch if you want to insert
value in between a link this is the best
one so I hope you enjoyed this video now
this can be implemented using any
language which we like you can implement
this with C you can implement that with
C++ you can implement with Java or maybe
Python so you will see the
implementation in the further videos so
