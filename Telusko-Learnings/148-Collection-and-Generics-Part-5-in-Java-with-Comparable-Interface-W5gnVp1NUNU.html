seen a comparator with a custom type
which is a student here now we'll start
this without using comparative so we
will use something called as compatible
interface now now think about this in
the when you sort or integers when you
sort strings at that time you just pass
this thing not the entire part you just
part you just say you have a collection
sort it now that means because this this
objects responsibility of this
collection responsibility is to sort it
right so what if this student class
knows about how to sort their own
objects what I mean is
now this the student object will come
back either the number all marks or some
different logic by itself that means we
don't require a comparator I want to
make it possible you have to implement
you have to implement of class or
interface called as compatible so it
should be compared with student okay now
since we are implementing this we have
to implement or we have to either write
a method which is public and compared to
now in case of comparator we have a
compile function and case of compare are
compatible we have compared to function
the compare it compared will take two
parameters as somebody else is comparing
those objects in case of comparable one
object will compare with other object
which means one object will initiate the
process and the second object will be
passed as a parameter so that's why we
require only one one method one
parameter you and will then define s now
how to compare the same thing we have
done in previous example we have to say
now instead of using s1 or s2 one object
is the instance which which has called
this compare to and one which is passed
which means the instance which is called
which is calling this one
is this so we can say this dot marks if
this is greater than s start marks so in
this scenario print my written minus one
else check for if this dot marks is less
than s start marks in this scenario
return 1 and otherwise we'll turn our 0
okay so this time you know for using
comparator and directly implementing
something well has compatible with my
class so that in my main function I can
directly say sort dodged toots now this
sort don't have to take extra effort to
define the logic right so if I run this
now it's still working right that means
we can use comparator or you can use
compatible now which is better is
dependable situation if you are going
with a custom class so it is always
preferable to create your own or
implement a compatible interface
otherwise if it is our in bill class
where you cannot change the we cannot
change the definition of the class that
that time we can use comparator ok so
this is how compatible and comparator
works so thank you so much for watching
