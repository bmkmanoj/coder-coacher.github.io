singleton design pattern which is the
best way so far which is with the help
of enum
so using enum you can create singleton
pattern but this will only work and in
the version which is about one point one
and one point one point five and when
more than one point five let's say one
point six nine 1.7 1.8 it will not walk
before one point five version okay so
let's start with this so for that what
we'll do is we'll we'll remove this
class ABC here everything will be
removed and then in main also I don't
need now to threats so we'll see how to
work with inner which itself is a thread
safe sink I can design pattern now in
order to create a singleton pattern what
we can do is we can define a class okay
since we are not using class we have to
use something but as enum here and we'll
define it as ABC so instead of creating
a class ABC we are defining enum ABC and
the best way to create a singleton
pattern is just to find as innum and we
have to use a keyword called as instance
that's it we have created a singleton
design pattern okay so you don't trust
right I know so what we can do is we can
just define a private constructor here
so by default whenever you say instance
it implicitly creates a private
constructor okay so just to prove my
point what I will do is I will say I
will play the variable here which is int
I and then let me just create a meta
which is public void show which prints
the value of I here so let me say s out
and let me print the value of I simple
and let me come here now I want to
create the object or the instance of ABC
so in order to create the instance of
ABC we can simply say it's ABC o VJ 1 we
can say equal to ensure fusing new since
we cannot use new is because we are
working with enum and we are using
something less instance so by default in
this
type so enum is basically it's a special
type of glass so it simply means it will
have a private constructor already so
what we can do is we can say it is ABC
dot so we can simply say instance simple
by this we are creating a single
singleton design pattern object now how
to assign the values we can simply say
it is obj one dot i and we'll say values
let's say five and let me call obj1 dot
shows so all the features we can use
that normal class in normal class we
define variables
we define methods so the same way we are
defining a variable here and we are
calling the method two broke through my
point I will say obj two equal to ABC
dot instance and here I will say obj two
dot i equal to let's say six so I'm
creating a new object and then I'm
calling obj one dot show simple so here
also I am calling hope you got one one
dot show is also I'm calling Obito it
went out sure so if you are creating two
different instance that simply means
you'll be getting output as five and
again five but if it is if it is
singleton you will be getting on so as
five and six and if I run this so answer
is five and six that means if you are
implementing singleton is on pattern
here so just a quick revision whenever
you work with this enum enum is observe
special type of class and that we have
to use something or less instance so
this instance basically defines a meta
which is public static ABC get instance
instance so this is what this instance
is all about okay and it has by default
a private constructor but the advantages
even if you are working with double
checked which is double checked locking
which we have seen in the previous video
when you talk about these you know
so whenever you work with this
realization so I hope you remember we
have to use something called a seed
object so even if your class is single
turn lead object will give you new
object and that's why using enum there's
a method called as read resolve so if
you are using read resolve it will not
create new object it will use the
current object itself does the advantage
of using enum as your singleton design
pattern so again enum only works with
the Java version 1.5 and about so it
will not work in any previous version so
that's the end of our singleton design
pattern series so so we started with the
first one which is eager then we have
gone too lazy then we have seen how to
use synchronized with threads we have
seen how to use double checked walking
and this was the last one which is in um
the best way to create singleton design
pattern so thank you so much for
