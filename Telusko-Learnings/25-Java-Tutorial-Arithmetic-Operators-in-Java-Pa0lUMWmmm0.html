operators
so just to demostrate dad let me get a
class called as operator demo and in
within which we'll be having a main main
method here how do you create how do you
use operators different operators so
basically we have different types of
operators here let me use a multi-line
comment it show you that so this is a
material comment because whatever I
write here don't want to execute that
that's why that's how we use that's why
we use comments in Java let me use some
types of operators first operator we are
going to talk about is arithmetic
operator that's the first thing then
we'll talk about bitwise operator to
relational operators logical operators
so basically we have this four tabs
operator which you have to work with so
we got an automatic bitwise traditional
and logical so we cannot complete all
the on this stuff in one video was
trying to make two videos of it so let's
start with a automatic other than this
we have some more operators inside this
operators we have some lots of operators
will not will not cover everything but
we'll cover those things which are
normally used what we'll do is we'll
start with a thematic now exactly as
many operators are so basically going to
talk about plus operator then we have
subtraction operator we have
multiplication operator then we have
division operator we also have a modulus
operator here to work with so basically
we have this five operations to work
with we have addition subtraction
multiplication division and the modulus
operator so what we'll do is we'll take
we'll create two variables one is M and
n so we got these two variables let's
assign the value for M as 6 and n as 2
we can create some multiple variables
here we can say r1 which is M plus and
which is which is addition of this tube
that's your additional operator there we
can create r2 which is subtraction
operator which is M minus n so that's
how we can we can add and we can
subtract we can create r3 which is M
multiplied by n and we can create our 4
so we got more variables here which is M
divided by n now let's print all this
values here we'll say system dot out dot
println let's print our one so that's
the first operator we have let me just
copy this code and paste
here here and here over this is R 2 R 3
R 4 so we got this operations here plot
addition subtraction multiplication and
division and let's run this code so
before running the code let me just find
out what the output I expecting here so
the output we're expecting is is 8 then
for this should be 12 we expecting 3
right so the division should be 3 here
and now if I run this code this is the
output we expecting and we got and
record the same output right which we
are expecting that means that's like
your operators work so we use division
operator here but the thing is what if I
change my value of n to 4 now if you say
6 plus 4 will be getting 10 6 minus 4
will be getting to 6 into 4 we'll get 24
but this one this one should be 1.5
right and if I run this code you have
not caught 1.5 but you're getting only 1
why is that because this division
operator here will always give you the
quotient it will not give you the
decimal values it will give you only the
question part how do you get the decimal
part so what we can do is first of all
we are using int here we we have to
change it to double where identifier on
this code now still we are getting 1.0
we should be getting 1.5 right the thing
is this thing here which is M divided by
n is giving you integer let's make it
double let's consecrate double let's try
to work with that and so when you cast
it with double record 1.5 okay so by
default the division operator gives you
integer and you have to cast it with
double now let's say I don't want the
question I want a remainder so when I
say 5 or 6 divided by 4 I'll be getting
the question times 1 and the remainder
is 2 right so if you want only the
Devender part we can use M mod and
because mod gives you the diamond oh and
if I if I print if I print are 5 now
we'll be getting 2 which is the
remainder of this tool and you can see
we got 2 so that's how we use automatic
operator here so we got plus minus
multiplication division and 4 and this
modulus symbol so modulus is used to
find the remainder in the division now
what we'll do is we'll try to find some
there are some shortcuts you have to
remember the way it comes to a let my
deck
we have let's say we have a variable N
and that lets the value of n is 5 and
then we have M the value of M is 4 now
we can add we can add M with n so we can
say the new value of n is equal to n
plus M so the new value of n is the
addition of M plus n and let's print the
value of it so let me let me just print
the value of n now and of course when
you print the value of n the value would
be 9 right because that's the addition
of MN and quite simple right now the
thing is if you say you are adding this
two values that you're putting these two
characters here right and an end so when
you have this name we repeated here you
can actually use a shortcut so we can
say shop saying you have to add n plus M
and throw it throw it to end we can also
use a shorthand operator of it says n
plus equal to M which is H which is
which is same as n equal to n plus M so
this stuff here is as is same as this
one and now I feel on this code you can
say we still we are still getting nine
now let's say if you're not you don't
want to add by M you want to add it by
three even this will work now so you can
use eight and if you say let's say 1 and
you can write this now instead of
writing 1 you can also write n plus plus
now n plus plus is same as this this
statement and which is same as this
statement I mean if you have n plus 1 so
n plus plus is same as n plus equal to 1
and n equal to n plus 1 so you are just
incrementing the value of n which is 5
initially if incremented you will get 6
now this operators are basically called
as shorthand operators or this is called
as increment operator or we can also use
decrement operator so when you say n
minus - that's our decrement operator so
if we run this code now you can see we
got 4 so from 5 we got 4 that's
decrement now since we know about n plus
plus let me just add some twist here
let's say we have n plus plus in the
same way we have plus plus n so we can
either write n plus plus or we can write
plus plus n the output is same you will
be getting 6 but then when you have two
operators which are saying we
giving you the same output why when you
wave I believe to our petals this does
that the the output now we are getting
is same right but there's one difference
here the differences the plus plus n is
called as pre-increment and n plus plus
it is called as post-increment
so plus plus n is called as
pre-increment and n plus plus is first
post-increment
now the difference between that so let
me say I don't want to print n I want to
print em now so the value of M we have
of course for right so there is no
impact on M because of n so the value of
M initially was 4 and now it is 4 but
let's say if I say m equal to n now let
me just comment this pool lines there so
if I say m equal to n the value of n
which is 5 so the value of n is assigned
to M but what if I say plus plus n is
pre-increment it means first it will
increment the value so initially it will
increment the value and later it will
assign the value the value of M so the
value of n becomes 6 now so plus first a
first of all it will increment the value
and then it will assign so the value of
M will become 6 now and you can see we
got 6 but what about if I say n plus
plus now what will happen is since this
post increment it will first assign the
value and then it will increment and
that's why D so the when you assign the
value the initial value of n is 5 when
you assign the value to M it will be 5
so value of M will be 5 and you can
understand this what we got 5 but that
doesn't means that n is not incrementing
let me just print both the lines here
both the statement I want to even print
and now so I'm printing m and N and if I
run this code you can see the value of M
is 5 the value of n is 6 and is getting
incremented but the problem is when M is
equal to n plus plus it means if first
it will assign the value and then it
will increment but when you say plus
plus and it will first increment the
value since it is pre increment which is
6
initially n will become 6 and that is
that value will be assigned to M and
regard 6 so that's how we can use
shorthand up operators we can use n plus
plus we can use n minus minus those all
comes under increment or
so you can do some extra stuff with this
you can practice your own codes try out
different combinations and check what
your answer you're getting so that's it
on this video in the next video we'll
talk about bitwise operator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
