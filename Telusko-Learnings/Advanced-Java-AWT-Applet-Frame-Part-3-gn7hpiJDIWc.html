in this video we'll talk about how to
add a button or how to add an event
right so to add an event here's what we
need we need a button right so what
we'll do we'll say button okay I will
say button B okay so let's import the
package so we have to give the memory
right so go to this label again in this
code we don't but we don't want labels
we just want our button right so well
remove the mini part to make it more
much easier so what I have I have a
button I have a layout so to create its
object button we say be equal to neo
button and we have to give some caption
right so we'll say okay so and then
afterwards I have to add this B to my
frame so we'll say add B now if I run
this right on this you can see we have
button here right so we have our button
okay here but what I want when I click
OK when I click OK it what it should do
is it should print here okay so I should
print here okay so what we can do is
first thing first thing
by default your your button is dump and
if ok so to make it - to make it listen
to your event so when you click it
should listen to your event right to
make it listen what we can do is we can
just add a listener so we say add action
listener
so by this it will add a listener to
your button so that when you click on it
it will listen so you have made not your
now your button is not tough but the
problem is if you can see on this
constructor what it will do is see you
when you use a direction listener you
have to pass an object of action
listener that means first you have to
create object of action listener then
you can you can call this right so the
problem is how to create object of
action is now the problem here is action
listener is an interface oh that was the
problem
right we
you can create object of a class can you
get off an object of an interface
directly no we don't create object off
interface we can create our reference of
interface right but here it they need
object so what we can do we have to
search we have to search for a file or
we have to search for a class which
already implements that interface called
as action listener but unfortunately we
don't have any class which implements
action listener so what we can do we can
ourself implement action implements
action listener so that means now when I
create object of my frame when I create
object of my frame I'll be getting
object of frame and I will be getting
object of action listener right again we
have to import this package so
control-shift I package is important now
now when I create object of my frame I
will get object of frame and whenever a
great object of my frame I also get
object of action is no since we are
getting object of action listener if you
pass this what is this this means the
object of the same class right now this
object or this keyword is the object of
my frame which the object of frame is
the object of action listener so we are
successful to get object of action
listener right now the problem is since
we are implementing an action listener
which is the interface we have to define
all the methods we have to define all
the methods belongs to action listener
and the good part is there is only one
method which which is there in action
listener and that method name is public
void its action performed and here we
have to pass an object of action event
okay now I actually went will see later
but time being we have to we have to
select action perform an action event
and this once I click a button you know
our code our button was damn dumped and
def right so we have we have added a
listener so that when you click on that
button it will add a listener so once it
is it
listener and you click on it it will
call action perform okay and want to do
an action perform is we have to print
okay so once again you have you have a
button right to make your button listen
to some event or some some click you
have to add a listener because by
default your buttons are diff and then
you have to pass object of action
listener since we don't have object of
action it's not because it's the
interface we have to implement that
action listener here so that when you
create object of your own frame when you
create object of you on my frame you
will get object of action listener and
that's why we are passing this year now
since we are implementing action is now
be happy to find all the methods that is
your action perform here and in that
will say ok now I'm gonna run this thank
you so you can see this is your output
idea nothing is there now when I say ok
we have ok you're right if I say ok we
have ok here that means when you click
it's listening to some event and it's
calling action perform so this is your
code for button and for the meaning will
do we will see in next with you the
meaning part will say next video and do
subscribe for the further videos thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
