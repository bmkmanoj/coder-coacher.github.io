about a two-dimensional array and this
will talked about we'll talk about Jack
the addicts now what exactly Jack dad is
are so two just to define Jack address
let me just change this value so let's
say I have this array X in which I have
four elements I have a day Y which has
two elements and half a day Zen which
has let's say three elements perfect so
now we have this three arrays with two
different sizes now if I define this
thing in this P and is it possible
because when we have defined a two
dimensional array it's an a day of Ali
which means all the Adige should be of
same type but hold on what happens if I
change the value so let's say if I
change this value to and if I change
this Y to one but it work that's why so
if I try to learn this now and it's
running it's running and it's working
you can see the size of this a dish is
not compulsory to be fixed okay we can
have we can have three rows and each row
will have different number of columns
right and this type of property is color
jagd adding but hold on oh is it that
simple since we are taking the static
values it is quite simple but let's say
if I create a adding let's say if I
create a Arabic name okay and we say new
end and then this two arrays the problem
starts here if I know the size of my
array is with four rows and maybe three
rows and four columns the other example
where you have fold all the three rows
and four columns so I was knowing I have
to use three rows and four columns each
row will have four elements but in this
example we have three rows but for those
are not fixed or four columns are not
fixed then question is how going to find
that and so just you find that
we don't know about the number of
columns lloyd remove that will it work
no error so it should so let's try now
how to assign values so before assigning
value we have to define because see in
this we have basically we have three o's
we have three arrays so even if you
define in this way we have three rows
and we have to mention the size of each
row to do that we have to say K of 0
which would represent the first show it
should be of size 4 okay
and then oh I forgot to mention you
keyboard and then here we have to say 1
equal to new int 2 and then we have to
say K of 2 equal to new end of 3 simple
so that's how you define a size of Jagd
arrays so this type of a day where you
have this type of two-dimensional array
where you know the number of photos for
sure but you don't know number of
columns so we have to use Jagd
a days so that's the digest direct
address a touches from this video so
stay tuned for the further videos thank
you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
