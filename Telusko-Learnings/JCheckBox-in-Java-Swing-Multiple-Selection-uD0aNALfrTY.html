to use je t'adore button so let me just
reduce the number of lines required for
this code you can see we have imported
each and every file so what we can do we
can simply say it is as Java X dot swing
dot star it will import all the packages
from swing back all the classes from
swing package and if you say event dot
star it will import all the files from
event package so we can reduce the
number of pack packages Vinnie review no
and this what we'll do is let's see the
output here so if we run this file you
got this is an output in which you have
a text field you have two radio buttons
and a button so if I say as Naveen
and if I say male and if I click on OK
the output is Miss should have been
right now I want to ask also ask a user
about his its hobbies so let's say a
user like singing or dancing or maybe
playing so we can give those options but
unlike your radio buttons in which you
can select only one in checkbox you can
select multiple options example if you
say my hobbies my hobbies are I like
playing I like dancing so I can choose
to write so if I if you give me five
options I might choose two options or I
might choose three options so I stop
using JDO button if you have to use
something called as checkbox now how to
use checkbox so we'll declare - tick box
here first
so after jlabel will use jade checkbox
will say c 1 comma C 2 for this
demonstration I will use only two
hobbies one is dancing and singing let
me create the object of c1 we'll say nu
J checkbox and here we'll provide the
caption will say the caption for this is
dancing and for c2 will say nu J
checkbox and the caption for this will
go for singing so now we have two caps -
checkbox when he's dancing and singing
way to add those check box also so we'll
say after the idea button will add
checkboxes will say add c1 and I say -
now once you're done with the addition
somewhere here we need to check before
displaying the name minute to check will
print in this way if a user enters a
name like Naveen and if you if you
choose male and if you choose dancing so
the text should be mr. the wind dancer
okay so what we can what we can do is we
can check so if you'll apply if
condition and will say if c1 dot again
like your radio button in checkbox also
we have to say is selected if it is
selected we'll say a paint will append
something we'll say it will be appended
by a space dancer so that once you check
with this the output will be named and
they man this mr. and this will will
have a name with this dancer again we'll
check because there's a chance that user
will select both so we cannot use
else--if so we'll say is selected and in
this will say name equal to name + in
double quotes we say singer so he fuses
and X both the output will be mr. Naveen
chance of singer if you choose one it
will be only dancer or single so let's
let's check if it's working or not so
let's say Ron and yeah so now here wait
will enter name will say name is Naveen
if I choose mail and if I choose dancing
so if I click okay so we have Mr Naveen
dancer but if I choose both it will be
mr. Naveen dancer singer if I choose on
it on a single it will be mission of in
singer and if I change this name if I
say the name is let's say
Sheetal if I say female and if I click
on singing and if I click OK it will be
Miss sheitel single simple so this is
this is how you need to chew you need to
use J
checkbox so in the next tutorial we'll
see how to
how to create events on checkbox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
