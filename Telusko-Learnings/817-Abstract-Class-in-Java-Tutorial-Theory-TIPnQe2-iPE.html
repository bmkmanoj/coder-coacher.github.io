from statistical earnings and in this
video we'll talk about abstract class so
before starting with the example let's
talk about some theory about abstract
classes so before understanding abstract
class let's talk about methods so when
you talk about methods you know the
behavior of an object is defined by the
method right so let's say you want to
add two numbers you want to check for
the login so you want to execute
something that's your behavior so the
behavior is defined by the method so
let's say you want to you want to write
our method but you don't know the
definition of the method you just know
the the name of the method and the
number of parameters it will take you
don't know the definition so what we can
do is we can declare the methods so just
write the method name and a semicolon so
if you declare a method in Java that
method directly becomes abstract so
those methods are called as abstract
methods okay so once again abstract
methods are those methods which are
declared not defined now if you have
abstract method in your class that class
becomes abstract class okay so abstract
you can have abstract method inside only
abstract classes okay so let's try to
the abstract class now so if we talk
about abstract class it's a class of
which you cannot get the object so the
first point to remember for abstract
classes you cannot create object of
abstract class the second thing abstract
class can have abstract methods okay not
that doesn't means you cannot have an
abstract class without abstract methods
so example let's say if you get a class
like a and in this class a you don't
have any abstract method but you can
make this class as abstract okay
so first point you cannot create object
of extra class second you're a player
abstract class can have abstract methods
okay now so why exactly we have this
concept of abstract classes so let's
start with this so let us say we have
three people of Ramesh Suresh and Mahesh
okay so we start with so we have M first
which is Mahesh then we have Ramesh and
then we have so range so M are s right
so let us say Suresh is Suresh want to
do some he want to make something
you he want to make a new phone and of
course if you talk about the current
generation phone we have lots of
features right we have a camera in our
phone we have music player in our phone
we have torch which is flashlight now
phone what we have else we have lots of
features right so initially to have one
of these feature you have to buy a
device let's say you want a light you
you buy a torch you want to take pics
you buy a camera now you buy a phone
which has all the features but let's say
in future you want a phone which will
have more features example let's say you
want to cook some cook something you
require a phone right so your phone will
act like a microwave that sounds weird
right but let's say you want some more
features you want what features comes to
mind let's say you want to drive a car
of course we have Google cars now so
let's say you want some features you you
want a phone which can dance you want a
phone which can charge itself so you
want all these features right so what
you will do so let's say we have so
ratio so they just want to build a new
phone so what he has done he went to
some library he took some research paper
just to see whenever you want to do
something new you have to choice either
built is something very new or you have
to refer other people papers you know if
you if you search for research papers
you have to read the article and you
will understand what new you can do and
then you can do it right so that's that
research paper so let's say Suresh is
referring to the damage of new Ramesh
research paper in which he says so
Suresh wants for three features
including phone a phone with a calling
method he needs a phone which can move
he needs a phone which can which will
act like a microwave or oven or you need
a phone which has a dancing feature but
the problem is Suresh don't know how to
do that so he is referring to the mesh
paper a mesh article and then it says
you can create a class something like
this so we have a class here in which so
let's say this class is this class as
well as phone class in this one class
you have four methods the first is
calling again second is move third is
microwave and fourth is dance okay so
what Suresh has so what Ramesh has done
is he has created this phone class let
us name it
the mesh phone in this class he has he
has defined call feature because the
mesh was knowing how to define call he
has also defined the method which is
move he has also defined our method
witches dance but his he failed to
define a method which is microwave this
microwave
so what Suresh will do now so Suresh
plus solution wicked sees his own class
will name this class as Suresh phone and
Suresh will extend the mesh phone so all
the features of flamish will go to
suresh right but if you can if you can
observe in so in the mesh class we have
a method called as microwave right which
is a semicolon so you can see there is
semicolon at the end and that method is
abstract method okay because we have
declared declaring it so if you have
abstract to the class or to the method
you can you should have abstract to the
class also so that class becomes
abstract class now
so this Suresh class which implements
also which extends the mesh class he has
to define all the methods now which
methods every abstract method you have
to define here so this method which is
microwave we have defined here that's so
if you if your class is able to
implement that method this class will be
called as concrete class but what if
switch fail to define that method again
now Suraj class will become abstract
class so any class in which you have
abstract methods it becomes abstract
class but then question arise from where
as image got this idea and if you if he
does some research in the inner mesh
paper in ramesh research paper the
reference is mentioned of Mahesh so what
mesh done asthma has created a class
adhere before before the mesh is created
a class in which you have four methods
but only one method was defined in his
call he failed to define move he failed
to define micro micro microwave he
failed to define this dance method so in
this you can see we have three abstract
methods and that's when this class
becomes abstract
okay so we have abstract class we have
abstract class and then this is your
concrete class sounds good so that's
does the advantage of using abstract
class and abstract methods
but let's say we see a real-life example
of this now so that's the understanding
right now let's let's give it up so
everything is blank now now let's start
with fresh now let's see you have this
class okay you have this method which
which which prints something so you just
so this method name is let's say this is
a config method which will so you pass
the object name example if I pass I
phone so if I pass iphone6 object it
will print all the configuration about
iPhone 6 they we have 2gb RAM we have
what we have we have 12 megapixel camera
we have iOS 9 9.3 so that's the
convention it will print if you pass the
object of s4 samsung s4 it will play
like in 2 GB RAM and octa-core processor
all those stuff so we have this method
within which you have to pass objects
right and this this this will print the
object configuration but question lies
in this method you have to pass object
right but object of which class if I
pass object of iPhone then you can only
pass object of iPhone if you specify
parameters s4 you can only pass s4
object let's say I want to pass any
object so let's say we have a class
iPhone so we have iPhone class we have
s4 class and then we have this HTC class
and all these classes they have
different configurations we have
different variables right so what we can
do instead of mentioning our iPhone
instead of measuring Samsung we can
create a abstract class class phone and
this classes this 3 classes will extend
phone class now the advantage is does
not matter which object you pass here
you have to mention phone not as iPhone
not s4 you have to mention phone because
this phone can take any object and
that's one of the best use of abstract
classes okay how exactly this can be
done with still in the practical so
