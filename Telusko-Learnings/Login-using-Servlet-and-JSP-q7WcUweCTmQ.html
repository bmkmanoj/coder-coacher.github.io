ready from 30 scholar things and today
we talk about how to do login for
servlet and JSP applications you know
when you build a website so there are
lots of things you have to consider so
you have to consider about user
requirements you have to consider about
your requirements you have to consider
about server space and the most
important thing about this is a login
application right or a login module so
let's say you're building any e-commerce
website if you are building any social
networking website if you are building a
website for your own college or for your
own company you require this module
which is login right now is it that easy
to build a login application for the
website and the answer is yes it is very
easy but if you consider some tricks if
you if you consider some some topics in
servlet it makes it bit difficult
because if you are creating a login
application for a normal software is bit
different than what what is when you do
it for website because when you talk
about websites we have web servers right
and web server works with HTTP protocol
which is stateless so let's say you are
accessing a page and after login us in
that page so you got the access now when
you go for the second page you need the
same login access right so again you
have to login what we want we want to
maintain the state of the login and then
for that we have to use some session
management ok now so in this video we'll
see how to manage the login throughout
throughout 3 to 4 pages or maybe the
whole website using sessions ok now so
let's imagine you're walking with a
where you have three pages so what is
website basically when I talk about
websites it's a creation of web pages so
let's say you want to build a big
website we require web pages right so
let's imagine the first page you have
here is login page so we have a login
page here we also have a page which is
let's say about us ok then we have a
page which is welcome page or begins a
home page and the last page we have
let's say one more we have videos page
right so when you have all these pages
in your website if you combine all these
pages you will get a website right now
from this web from these web pages there
are some web pages which requires which
requires a login acces
other other pages like about
don't need a login or don't need a login
page or login axis so anyone can go to
about us without login but if you want
to go to welcome page you require a
login if you want to go to videos page
will require login but not for login
page which is itself a login page right
so once you give your current shears
inside login page so let's say you will
are you it will ask you for username
password so let's say we have you name
and password here now once you enter
this detail of username and password now
it will verify your username password
right it will verify your credentials
now if you are what you say a normal or
authenticated user then it will provide
you a login access otherwise it will
reject you right but it's your body
login the now the page you can see is
welcome page right and in Welcome page
it will show you some data about you so
like welcome Naveen and it will show you
all the last access you have done then
from that page you will be having one
more link let's say for videos page and
to access videos we require again login
example when you go to udemy.com if you
go to my own website telesco calm to
access some pages we have to login right
and so in my website i do not have the
login for videos that's good right but
there are they pages where you have to
login first so that you can access the
particular web page now from this page
videos if you are going to this page now
if you say you want to access this so
you require login right so from login
you are going to welcome and from
welcome to you you are going to videos
so as perfect white but let's say if a
user is not login okay so none of these
three types are URL which is let's say
for me let's say my website name is
abc.com and if i say slash if I say
login dot JSP
so what which page I will get is this
page right which login page now after
login automatically it will go to
Welcome page and from Welcome page if I
click on a button I will go to videos so
the URL for videos is this it is videos
dot JSP now anyone can type abc.com
slash videos dot JSP and they will get
the access to video space right and very
where to ask for login
if they know the URL they can directly
access that right and that's what we
want to stop them that you should not
you are not allowed to access this page
without login and that we can check with
the help of session okay so there are
two ways of doing this the first way is
session the second way is cookies now
it's a big debate which one is good I
think we can use cookies or we can use
sessions now cookies are much easier to
work with because what happens your
server will give you the cookie which
you wish you have to store inside on the
client machine right so your client is
responsible to save that cookie now
since client has the cookie client has
the access to cookies so they can modify
it they can hack the server or they can
play with your server so ensure that go
for session where you save everything on
the server side which is safe for the
server right of course and why our
client will need your data ox our data
right so of course session is much
better than cookies if we talk about
login if you're talking about maybe
ecommerce ecommerce module then cookies
will be better but time being false
login session management is important
now how to achieve session so if you
talk about sublets so we have a we have
something called as HTTP its HTTP
session in sublet so whenever you
anybody log in so once you verify your
credentials of course right before so
once you enter this detail one when you
will click on this button which is login
button
so once you click on this button it will
call a sublet right so let us say let me
define a servlet here so let me remove
this and we'll be having us solve it so
let us say we have a servlet we'll name
this as verify dot HTM verify dot java
that's a servlet right so once you click
on this button you have to call this
servlet
and inside this subject you will verify
this to details right of course you know
how to fetch values from the client side
using the request gate parameter then
you will apply if-else by checking in
the values are correct
now once the values are correct you will
send a request to welcome again you can
use request dispatcher or you can use
one more thing redirect so let's say if
I am using redirect
I got the page which is welcome right so
from this from this servlet code I am
sending request to welcome but before
doing that we need to do one thing we
need to put data into this session so
what is session so let's create object
op HTTP session so I got an object here
which is called as session right so
that's my object how to create this
object we have HTTP session session
equal to request dot get session again
we'll see that when we start with the
practical so this is just a kid in
theory of this after this we were
talking about the practical
implementation so in that we'll see how
to achieve this okay so once we got the
object of session now we have to set the
value so you have to say set attribute
so that's the method we have to use so
that's a tree you attribute and then we
have to mention two things the label and
the data so label I will say this is you
name comma the data is let's say
whatever you tie you got from user name
so if user name is Naveen so it will be
nothing here if username is admin so you
have to send admin here so let's say I
have stored that data in unum itself so
the day buddy is also you name and your
data is also you name now once you send
this data to the Welcome now what you
have to do is on this page which is JSP
page so this will be a JSP page inside
this so let me remove just now so once
we got it to this page which is welcome
to our JSP let me write that page here
now so in this you have to check for
this session again so before executing
any statement from this JSP we have to
first verify now how to verify so we
have to apply if here and we can say if
session dot get attribute because of
course right once you set it we have to
say get attribute if this you name is
equal to equal to null now when you will
get this null as so let's say if user is
not login directly he is trying to
access welcome to our JSP so it is
abc.com
slash welcome to our JSP that means this
page was not visited user has not
provided the current shields directly is
trying to access welcome to our JSP in
this scenario this unum will give you
empty result
that means session dot your attribute
will be null and if this is null that
means user has not login what you can do
is you can again call login page how to
do that we can simply mention here
response which is response dot send
redirect and we can mention which page
to call will say login dot JSP ok so
once you call welcome JSP without
logging it will check if you name is
null then it will directly call log into
a JSP that means if anyone's tried to
access a web page which is a secure web
page without login it will be redirected
to login page if this is not the case
then you can continue with the example
and you can show welcome to our JSP
right now let's say in this page you
have a button for video so we are
providing a link let's say a href so we
have a href for videos now once you
click on this button once you click on
this what you say anchor tag once you
click on this video 0 it will take you
to it video space again you will you can
see all the videos on that page now you
will be having a logout quite or maybe
on welcome also you'll be having logout
and here also we have logout now what to
do once you enter logout or once you
click on logout button so let's say we
have a button here in this web page
itself or let's say in videos we have
logout button so we have a log out
button now once you click on this button
what should happen
it should also call a servlet ok so
let's create that sound let here so
we'll say this is log out dot Java now
in this what would do so when you log in
so when you when you log in for the
first time what we have done is we have
set it the set the attribute for session
right which is you name any guess what
you have to do in this in logging when
you set the data and log out you have to
remove the data right so you have to use
something called as session dot we have
to say remove attribute and then you
have to mention which is you name
simple right now once you once you
remove this and if you go back to
welcome page
the thing is in welcome page you will
get this as null and it will be right
you to log into a JSP so you have to do
this for every secured page okay let's
say in your website you have maybe 15
pages and after 15 pages five pages are
secure pages and 10 pages are normal
pages so for those five pages you have
to write this thing on every page on
every JSP page you have to verify this
is null then log they direct it in the
login page and for every logout button
it will call this thing which is session
dot remove attribute okay so that's how
you provide the or you say the login
feature but there's one more thing here
so let's say whenever you access a
webpage so what happens is on that web
page we have your browser has the
feature of caching pages now what will
happen let's say you're you're you're on
the Welcome page you click your click on
a logon you click on logout logout
button now once you click on logout it
will take your login page right I mean
you have to right here we have to say
this is after removing the attribute we
have to say redirect me to login page
right so once you write this statement
here it will take you to login page now
what will happen when you click on back
button now once you click on back button
it will again take you to welcome page
and your hacked so let's say if you are
using a website and you're you're
entered your details there and then once
you say logout you think you're safe now
but yeah hackers comes to one you take
your machine they say back they got the
access to your website right so that's
not the case so what we do is we have to
remove the cached pages or we have to
stop that cachet of the pages and we
have to do that with the help of some
metadata or meta tags again how to do
that but that we'll see in the practical
implementation so if you want to include
login in your web page or in your
website you have to follow all these
things so that's a general overview how
to use sessions instead of cookies and
we'll see the implementation in
practical itself so I hope you got the
idea about login so make sure you
subscribe the channel so that you will
