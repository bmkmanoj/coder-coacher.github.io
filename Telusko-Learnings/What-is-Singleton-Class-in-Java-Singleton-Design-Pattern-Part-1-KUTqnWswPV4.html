singleton class now let us see what is
singleton class singleton basically
means it is one that means you can
create only one instance of a class
let's say I have a class let's say m
plus a so if I if I want to create an
instance of this class first you have to
get a reference I will say a obj or you
say obj 1 equal to new a so this is your
1 instance right unfortunately I have
the same name package let's say I have a
class ABC and here also I have ABC now
I'm creating a instance of ABC and his
one instance right let's say if I create
one more instance it's a2 equal to new
ABC now I have created two instance that
means this obj will have different
values and this over to value have
different values but what if you want
everyone to create only one instance of
your class that means I am NOT allowed
to you create second instance now if you
are allowing only to create one instance
that means your class is single Tony now
you will say how to get a singleton
class the first thing will strike to
your mind is there should be some
keyword called as single ton
unfortunately we don't have any keyword
so it's it's not a keyword but it's a
concept in Java you can create a
singleton class now how you have to
remember some steps first you have to
create a static object or static
instance of this class so we'll say ABC
obj equal to new ABC now this is one
instance right so in class only I am
creating there its own instance which is
obj then next step don't allow user to
create a instance with default default
constructor what I mean by that is if I
create an instance here it means new ABC
that means I am calling the constructor
your default constructor which is by
default public what if I define our
constructor which is private
so if I define a contructor which is
private here which means now I cannot
call this ABC so this is just against
her now third star now you have to
create a method which should be static
which will return the object of instance
of ABC and we'll name this as get
instance it's not compulsory to have a
method in color get instance you can
have any name you can have get object or
some sensible name for your method
so we'll say get instance and what we'll
return here is obj that's it if you
follow these three steps that means your
create you are allowing only one
instance of your class now how to get
instance of a class
since this get instance method is a
static method we can simply say it is
ABC it is ABC dot get instance so at any
condition or at any case I am allowed to
create only one instance of this class
so even if I go if I say obj two equal
to ABC since we cannot say new a BC is
because my private McConaughey is
private so the only way I can create
instance is ABC dot consistence and
every time you will be getting the same
instance simple so this is the advantage
of using singleton class so again the
steps first create a static instance
create a private constructor and create
a static method which is get instance or
any name or any suitable name now now
with this why this object to be static
is because this get instance is a static
method which is or this starting method
and we should return our object and this
object should be static that's why we
are adding starting here and I said this
is your instance this is your singleton
class and thanks for watching and do
