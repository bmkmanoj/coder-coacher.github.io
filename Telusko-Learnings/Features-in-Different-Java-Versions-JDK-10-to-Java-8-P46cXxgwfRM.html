be used lambda expression if you are
machine is using 1.4 can use enhanced
font though if you know in which
position we got which features it will
be easier for you to understand right so
in this video we'll talk about Java
versions and in which version required
which features
so welcome back it is a very complex
kinetics and in this video we'll talk
about different Java versions so
individual questions but what features
we got and we talked about that in fact
if you are new to this channel do
subscribe so that you will get all this
type of videos in future now you know we
always thing about this we know we have
1.8 version and we learn about 1.5 volt
what difference it does because it it's
okay right Java is ciao it doesn't
matter which version we work with no
there are some things which changes you
know with every version they get new
updates and and if you walk if you are
learning some concept like you're
working with generics and what if I say
if you are if you are learned the gen
breaks and if you are using Java 1.4 you
cannot use templates if you have learn
and experiment and by mistake your
server is working on 1.6 you cannot
implement all you cannot use lambda x1
in 1.6 so it's important for us to know
in which version we got which features
do i and there are certain versions
which got major updates and there are
some version which got manner of things
you know those are just updates so 1.8
1.7 those are major things in fact they
all studies I think I think one when
they fail you know we need a witness
that maybe the language which should be
platform independent because we were
having some good language before that
when you have exceed clusters we were
having small talk I mean those are
awesome language destroyed but then the
only problem was they were not like of
independent so they wanted something
using which they can achieve platform
independence so they went for OOP
language so when the released Java the
beta version of Java in 1984 they the
naked as oh and
was good but in 1995 they wanted to go
for the communities they thought you
know we cannot go for Oh because folk is
not we cannot register the language with
open language so they went with
something whereas Java right so in 1.0
we were having some updates which were
awesome if I haven't got not not those
features which we use now but it wasn't
having some lots of features and then
with every version there were some
classes which was introduced and then
the existing classes was also dedicated
example there are lots of classes now
which we don't use because those are
deprecated example if you have ever
known to swing and in swing when you use
some methods like three methods like
show high those methods now are
duplicated so we should not use that
right in fact if you have learned about
collects in threads we have a concept of
stopping this way and we should not use
Tom with attacks what is replicated so
calculated methods are available to use
what we should not use that right now we
have played we get these things now the
current version of Java which is we are
living in 2017 right
so the current version of Java is Java 8
so everyone is using Java 8 now but what
if I say in July they're not going for
Java 9 and Java 9 is very different from
Java 8 so if you have learning Java now
you have to read on Java in form for the
next version not everything not
everything you have to relearn but there
are certain important changes which is
the making with Java 9 okay there's a
concept of monarchy which they are
implementing in Java concepts so in Java
and we'll be reading for what is idea in
Java so can also plan for Java 10 now so
into next two years we will be having
Java 10 so it turns out some extra
features as well but let's talk about
the existing features so it all started
with Java 1.1 1.0 which is also far less
4 so it was having some features but
with all the basic features in 1.1 which
released in 1997
ok amazing right so it's been 20 years
now will be part 1.1 and 1.1 they have
made lots of updates now this is a lot
some of this the least are so the first
event this is the first time I'm using
something to read because it's very
difficult to remember in which version
we got which if which one should we got
which features in fact I remember some
but I wanted to give you the exact
release to my test 1 using this so so in
1.1 they give you the concept op in your
classes now they are not technically the
inner classes we can have class internet
class so just imagine in the vanilla
version of jar which is 1.0 inner class
was not there and now everyone is using
in a class-wide maybe a normal class or
maybe anonymous inner class example if
you are working on Android in Android we
use async task so we create async task
we implement async task into the class
right so we give it a class and set a
class with we create the implementation
task and if you are working on swing if
you are working on Android also we also
create anonymous class right also we
create object of interface by breaking
all those things example in when you
work with J button is when you try to
provide the event to the J button we
also use anonymous class there but yeah
inner classes are used or not nowadays
so it was introduced in 1.1
then it was the next thing boss jarppi
so Java breeze was introduced
one major update JDBC was affected and
also we can use to now we take it for
granted right
we have JDBC but if I quite what it was
introduced and we also get one of my
favorite feature which is added by so
animals chance for jollywood method
invocation so if you don't know what a
demise if you know about our PC so our
PC is same as a divine the only
difference is we would have been added
by our PC earlier and then the
object-oriented version of our PC is
atomized so they wanted to introduce
this concept of objects they wanted to
see rise objects you can send the object
on one piece or the place they went for
a device but before we used to work with
our PC then they came up with so so that
was one point one then we went for one
point two and then thing one point two
we should say one point two and then
they also used one temples j2se so
before that they should say JDK or Java
one point one but in one point - they
came up the concept of j2se which is jar
2 standard edition right in fact with
the same thing with with that version
which is j2se they went for two more
names which is j2se j2ee
and j2me so j2se for consoles element
for normal which is gorgeou basically
the the jar j2ee is the Enterprise
Edition so if you are implementing some
Enterprise they were software will be
using j2ee
and they also came up with j2 n which is
Java 2 micro relations so now
everybody's Android at that time it was
1998 so there was no Android right so
there is - there is - well there's to
create some mobile applications using
jQuery okay so so in that in Java - I
mean in Java 1.2 they came with lots of
features one of them was they introduced
some swing swing classes so earlier
before swing they used to work with a WT
which is abstractly doing to the kid and
then in what in 1.2 they give me the
concept of swing so we can create
awesome GUI using swing and nowadays
know is using swing anyway VR is in Java
FX so before 1998 people used to work on
a double tee after that they started
working on swing and then now now
everybody is using Java effects and in
1.2 they got one more update which which
everyone uses nowadays which is
connection API so if you're using
collections you know at least at least
then we have set map all these things
were introduced in 1.2 ok so if you by
mistake if you if you in that boiler 1.1
this is no canary I can imagine your
life in Java without connection API no
line in fact if you if you are using the
concept of Android or servlet or JSP we
all use map there right and there was no
packet in 1.1 amazing
so in 1.3 so this the next version 1.3
which was released in year 2000 and the
updates were they came with a concept of
hotspot JVM server at all so there is a
hotspot Jagan belongs to a writer so
anyone you whenever you install genie
can use dedicate works on hotspot
JVM so it is still used now then in 1.3
they got one more update of gt-r digit
Java naming a directory interface so by
you know by any chance if you are
working on Java Enterprise world you
will be working on JDI so it is like
giving certain age some resources
registry idea so it was not a big update
1.3 but then it was an update the major
update then cave is one point
not exactly a big big big update but it
wasn't update its other kind of update
it was here 2002 right and I was seven
standard so into they given the concept
of Java 1.4 and again some updates were
there they introduced the concept or you
can use ipv6 in Java now and then I won
but one big update which was regular
expression so if you if you love it
expression it gave me one point for the
next next big thing is a search keyword
nothing much I mean this was one point
but then my favorite update is one point
five because if one point five I bought
something which I always wanted which is
generates now gently is provide
something much type safety example if
you walk with ten API and if you
encourage the API you can write
something like this when you say list
obj is equal to new analyze this list
elements I mean this this can have made
up of elements right it can have
integers it can have strength so there
is no type safety right so we wanted to
go for type safety and that's why they
went forward generates the gentleman was
introduced with one point five and Java
became more secure after that so
genrich's was the biggest update the
next one was auto boxing and unboxing so
because of boxing autoboxing generous
was possible right and then the next
update was where our so week in 1.5 they
came up with the concept of bear arms
now it is well our so let's say if you
are so it looks something like this if
you want to pass multiple parameters
right so if you create a method where
you want to pass multiple parameters not
one not two not three you're not sure if
I
you want to send and at the receiving
end you want to accept all the
parameters example if you define a
method with two with two parameters you
can pass in two parameters right but
then if you want to pass many parameters
you can use whether arms so all those
parameters will become one and that's
the advantage of using later arms and
this is nothing shape saying this
varrock escapes from C sharp concepts so
in fact Java and c-sharp they always
talk to each other you know so Java
copies concept of sisha sisha copies
concept on java so this concept of
Belloc's came from c sure and not just
see shop java try to copy those concept
knowledge between languages because it's
not just java every language nowadays is
coming concept other language so that
they can call themselves a perfect
language but none of them are perfect 9
is now anyway then the next update was
for each loop which is an asphalt go and
example if you have an adding of 50 a
limit so if you want to create all the
events you have to use a loop right and
loop starts from 0 again that's that's
one big headed right you have to live
about this adding all this starts with a
text of a 0 so you get to remember that
in target case of and hotspot we just
have to define a nice photo like this
and you
with that right so and then the next one
was studying inputs in fact 1.5 or the
bigger bigger biggest update I guess
they give me the general concept that
we're arms and then the static imports
example if you if you ever work with a
system dot out dot print and an inert
such a big statement what you can do is
you can import out object using studying
inputs something like this so that's
that's going to that's one advantage
you've got in 1.5 in fact in 1.5 they've
made one big issue of saying 1.5 they
went for 5.0 because it was a major
update right so 1.2 was 1.2 1.3 1.4 but
then it is not one point four is five
point zero okay so that was Jenny k5
it's like in empty in every Java version
then let it be four five six
they've also have some mini versions you
know Java version 5 we'll get one more
update which is one for instrument under
school if you if you download JDK from
internet you will understand this so jdk
1.6 under scope some you and then number
so that's an update so that those those
are minor minor updates like bug fix or
security update something like that okay
then they came up with a concept of java
6 so that you go java SE 6 and in this
they have they moved so before that
makes you say java j2se right so 1.5 was
j 2 SC 5 1 point 4 was j2se 1.4 in java
6 they removed that - and now this Java
s e so till now if you're using Java it
is Java SC you are no longer learning
Java 2 SP it is just now I say again
some name changes that's it then because
of updates we got update for JDBC food
not major of this all the opposite John
six well my lovely it's not a thing babe
but then but then one version key which
is 1.7 and like most of you I'm sure
we'll be working on 1.7 now maybe if
you're working for a company those
servers are deployed in 1.7 if you are
using Android maybe also you're also
using 1.7 then so one concept is used a
lot nowadays and it was introduced in
2011 and it was having lots of updates
the first one which is you know when you
use a switch you know when you switch
statement in Java so it is switch we can
it supports integer right but in 1.6 or
1.7 they have introduced a concept of
using strings in in switch statement
that means you get passed
you can pass frame but it also the
spring magic now then we got updating of
much automatic resource management if
you if you know that in try-catch we
also have one either way so we used try
when you sketch and we use finally now
finally is used only for this is closing
example if you are using any resource
like legacy connections
file handling sockets if you are using
any of this if you're getting any of
this objects inside try block you have
to make sure that you also close it but
then where to close that we can close
that in a finally block right so that
means we are closing those resources
what if your Java says hey don't worry
you just have to use private resources
and the closing of the source will be
done by us amazing right so that was
introduced in 1.5 again how it looks
like something like that Center or the
spread and now the smaller one when you
when you cope with collection API so we
right so in 1.5 1.6 me right
something like this we said list we
specify maybe integer then we use our
values neo equal to new enemies and that
in the I put a bracket as well going to
mention integer right but in case of 1.7
the second one is the second 20 back and
the second integer is not composite you
can remove that if you have any more
they don't count the death inside by
okay which is on the right hand side
right so that they have they worked it
and that was one point seven and I used
to love one point seven but then then
something came in 2014 which has changed
everything and that was our point for
Java 1.8 now what what new in 1.8 okay
let's go go let's go back to one point
seven zero eight one point six
can you tell you define our method
inside interface no I can only declare
it we can only have abstract methods or
interface but in 1.8 we got a new
feature which is we can we can define a
method inside interface by using
different keywords the next thing is can
be used in third iteration for
collection API
know in 1.8 record that we got one can
update in 1.8 we is my favorite for this
lambda expression right so if you have
such a big statement something like this
if you're using threads this is how you
guys thread by but then using that
expression you can you can convert that
in this format in one line
amazing quite so that's not as lambda
expression I can have a large a solution
works against you can search my videos
in the playlist this is not the video to
to talk everything about that next
version here but you can watch this in
my playlist so those are the updates in
1.8 because update are we can we can we
can define balancer interface we can use
lambda expression
can use stream API so that they can be
the positive shape API to work with huge
amount of data and that is 1.8 so from
last 3 years we are working with 1.8 and
after 2 once I did it this is March now
in 2 to 3 months we'll be getting 1.9
and let's see how that goes sure if you
want to blame yourself this is the time
avail yourself of 1.7 to 1.8 and in two
ones afterward feed from 1.8 to 1.9 so
always be updated and that's it from
