this addition of two numbers so we have
added five and two and when use when you
click on OK at the answer is seven right
in the next video we'll say and in this
video we'll talk about the same thing
but it's not one object or one button
which is add will create one monopoly
subtraction so for that instead of using
the same code we'll we'll go for the
fresh file so we'll say new Java class
and we'll name this as calc because we
will be having two features now how to
create how to create this one so let's
say we are making a calc we create a
class called as sick they will name this
class as ad and some because we'll be
having it's an answer because it will be
having both the features addition
subtraction and in this first we need to
define a constructor so we'll say add
sub now how many component I'll be
needing here so let's do declare all the
components first I need two text fields
so we'll say J text field so we need to
text field one will be t1 and second
will be t2 then we require two buttons
one for addition second for subtraction
so it's a button b1 comma b2 so b1 will
be for addition and b2 falls fraction we
require a label to show the result and
we'll say L so we have this five
components let's initialize all the
components so how to initialize we'll
say t1 equal to nu J text field and
we'll say this the size of this text
field will be 20 a 20 will be open 15 is
enough I guess so T 2 equal tonio
jtextfield and again it will give 515
then we took a rate object of b1 service
will say b1 equal to nu J button
button it will have a text here so we'll
say this text is add so we'll go for B
tune ourselves and you J button and here
will be having subtract so we've got two
buttons we'll go a label and the body
for the text here on the label should
say result so say listen okay so now we
have exercised all the elements or all
the objects let's add those objects now
how to add we'll say add first of all at
even then we'll add t2 then we'll add b1
and we'll add b2 and we'll add al now
you can see we are getting others is
because we're to add if we cannot add in
add sub we need to add this in a jframe
so it extends j-frame
and you can see when you say when you
use this swing or Jeanette beads in will
you swing and that means we get
automatically package imported but if
you are doing this in notepad you have
to say Java X dot swing dot star okay so
once you add it all the components let's
set the layout let's let's set the size
and they said default close operation so
we can use that template we have created
in the earlier tutorial scoring code and
tab you can see we are getting all these
codes
make sure you import the package with
the help of so anyway when you want to
import the package you can use the
shortcut cutters control it is ctrl +
Shift + I so ctrl shift I will import
all the packages in NetBeans I guess if
you are using Eclipse it should be a
control shift oh okay so now we have got
so we have done with the initialization
we have done with the addition we are
done with the adding components and the
layout next thing we need is we need to
add
business to both the buttons and to add
listener will say add HB 1 dot add
action listener and we'll say say this
and when you said this I can't we have
two choices either we can use anonymous
object or this initially we'll use this
and then in the next tutorial we'll use
an animus object again so we'll say
implements action listener
so let's come back to you so it says
this since we are implementing so we
need to define a method call as public
void actionperformed formed it will take
two parameter or so one parameter which
is action event a ii now here let me put
the package control shift i and the
package should be from this package it
java door a double dot event say okay
now now let's do the operation what we
need to do is we need to do the same
thing which we have done in the last
tutorial we can just copy this code will
say copy and paste it here okay and this
is a this is for addition right okay
this is for addition let's do for
subtraction also erection is no so the
the method is same and we had to pass
this but let's run this let's run this
to star we are we are forwarding one
thing wait to call we need to use a main
function use and say mean and let's call
this let's call this add sub constructor
so adds up
obj equal to new and serve okay let's
run this code now if I say run file and
you can see we are getting a GUI here
let's add let's say sex and one when I
click on add at the offense
right and now if I say oh there's not
this one let me go to calc and if I say
again run now if I click on add the
answer will be seven if I say five and
to the fact we're gonna add the answer
will be seven if I click on sub I'll
still the answer is seven it's because
we have not written the logic first
fraction but question arise very lightly
logic because every time you click on
any button maybe b1 or b2 it will
execute the same statement see this
should be same right this two lines
should be same for both the buttons but
this should change so what we need to do
is we to check which button is clicked
or there was an event on which button so
for this way to use a if statement or if
condition will check if b1 dot or we'll
say doesn't there's something well as AE
or we will ask a e so AE dot get so so
AE knows which button is clicked if that
button is b1 then it should be then it
should be this statement clear but we'll
do one thing we'll say int value well
the great outside so that we will get
the value and we'll say some value by
default it is zero so if this is the
condition this is the condition we
should say value equal to now one plus
num2 else will say value equal to num 1
minus num2 clear and that's it so now if
we find out this code if I say five and
two if we click on add the answer will
be seven if I click on serve the answer
will be three so this is how you need to
add two numbers using two different
buttons in the next tutorial we'll use
how to endure this with the help of
autonomous object so thank you so much
