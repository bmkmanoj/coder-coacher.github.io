implement or thread using thread class
it's time to move towards the interfaces
because we have seen that right if you
have a class we have and when we have
another class which which you are I want
to extend now we cannot achieve multiple
inheritance so what we can do is instead
of using extends thread we can also
implement an interface and that
interface is runnable okay so instead of
using exchange thread will be using
implements runnable so we will say
implements renewables both the for both
the interfaces of about the both the
threads now if I go to the novel
interface you can see something amazing
here it's a functional interface and as
soon as something comes as soon as you
hear functional interface something
comes to your mind with lambda
expression right so it is a function
interface and it has only one method
which is run so your learnable interface
has only one method which is run so if I
go back to my thread demo and so instead
of using thread class we are
implementing enable right but there's
only one issue here the issue is if you
talk about this obj one dot start see we
don't have start method inside our own
class
we don't have start in in run able I
mean we don't have started runnable from
where you will get start because earlier
when we use threads so thread was having
start method right run even doesn't have
a start method then what it is giving
you some which is giving you an error
right because we don't have any method
like that now what we can do here so
so what we can do is instead of so
instead of calling start using obj we
just need to call start right so what we
can do is we can create a thread object
here we can say thread t1 equal to new
thread so we can say thread t1 equal to
new thread and then we can create one
more thread here which is which is for
t2 so we got t1 and t2 thread and
instead of calling obj 1 dot start we
can say t1 dot start and instead of
calling
obj 2 dot start we can say t2 dot start
the problem is solved right because we
just wanted we just wanted D thread we
just wanted to start method right so we
have graded the threader but will it
work now it's because we have created
this thread objects and if you if you
call start it will call the run method
of thread right it will not call the run
method of our class because if you're on
this code is doing a thing because start
will call run because it will call one
the method of thread itself it will not
call the run method of our class now
what we can do is what we want to do is
we want to link this object with thread
now luckily if you if you if you expand
this if you expand the constructor of
thread you can see it is asking you for
the object of runnable that means if you
pass obj one because that's an object of
runnable right because your class
implements runnable so when you pass the
object of obj one here it's an object of
with enable so obj one is runnable
object right even it is high object is
actually runnable object because instead
of high here you can also write runnable
right because you can create you the
reference of interface and you can see
this
whenever's interface here so you can
create the reference of interface and
you can create the object of a class and
here we can pass obj - it will work if i
if i run this code you can see we got hi
hello hi hello hi hello hi hello so we
got the same output
but using interface now so we are not
using thread we are implementing
interface so point to remember whenever
you want to get a thread there are two
ways one by extending an interface or by
extending a class or by implementing the
interface which is unable now when you
use class that's very simple but when
you use a interface we need to make sure
that we also create two objects I mean
we create object or thread in which you
will pass the object of runnable which
is here and then you will say t1 dot
start and t2 door start so that's it
that's how you use the Nabal interface
in the next video we'll try to reduce
the length of this code because this is
very lengthy code right
because in Java 8 we got some new
features wide we got the features of
lambda expression so can be implemented
expression here that we'll see in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
