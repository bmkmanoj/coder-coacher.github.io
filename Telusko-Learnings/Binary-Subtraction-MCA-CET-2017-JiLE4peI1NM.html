directly from those four lightnings and
in this video we'll talk about binary
subtraction now it's not that difficult
to understand this but again if you
follow some lose it will be easier to
understand so let's see we have zero
minus zero what you get is zero that's
simple right
when you say 1 minus 1 minus 0 is 1
that's simple when you say 1 minus 1
which is 0 right trouble starts when you
have 0 minus 1 now what should be the
answer so to understand this let's go to
the decimal system when you say decimal
system and when you say 0 minus 9
ok odd will say 0 minus 1 in decimal
system what is 0 0 minus 1 ok again it's
not possible but let's say if you want
to carry from somewhere if you want to
if you want to borrow from somewhere so
let's say we have 6 here when you borrow
one what you get is 1 0 right and then
that one thing of minus 1 will give you
9 that means whenever you subtract 0 by
1 you get a last digit of the number
system example in octal system and you
say 16 minus 1 what you get is 7 so 0
minus 1 in octal system is 7 0 minus 1
in decimal system is 9 in the same way 0
minus 1 in binary system will give you
the last digit which is supports and
that is 1 right so 0 minus 1 is 1 in
binary system but again since we need to
care we need to borrow so from someone
even in decimal system octal systems we
have to bother it right the same way you
have to borrow 1 here so you have to
borrow it so when you say 0 minus 1 it
will give you 1 but then again you have
to borrow 1 not to implement this with
an example here whatever you do here is
I will say 0 1 1 1 0 1 and then subtract
that this with 3 ones
now when you say 1 minus 1 that is
simple right what you get is 0 but when
you say 0 minus 1 that's that's that's
why the problem starts right so this 0
will ask for one from the previous one
so it will ask for this so it will give
you 1
act 1 we become 10.1 right so it will
give you 1 so 0 minus 1 is 1 then this
becomes 0 right again you cannot do 0
minus 1 so what you do is you have to
say one it will be bordered from this
this becomes 0 that is 0 and then 1 0
right so that's how you subtract two
numbers in binary format in fact you can
increase the number and you can subtract
these two numbers right so yeah that's
how this is the rules here to follow so
0 minus will go to 0 0 minus 1 and 1 by
0 is 1 0 minus 1 is 1 and 1 minus 1 is 0
so that's it from 1/8 my name is up
action in the next video we'll talk
about finally multiplication and
division that's it thanks thanks for
