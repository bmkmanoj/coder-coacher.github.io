from the database this time we'll try to
insert values so you can see we have
three records right so we have one
Ronnie two Naveen and three Mahesh
let's say we want to add one more row
but not from mask you'll I want to do it
with the help of Java so of course we
had to write this query right so what we
can do is we can simply copy this query
so that we can use this query in my code
so let me just paste this query here but
data I want to insert is not three
Mahesh I want to insert four let's name
Mohini
so we have four and Mohini I want to
insert this value into database now we
can here we can take any name doesn't
matter right so what we'll do here is to
insert to insert that value we cannot
write execute query right because
whenever you want to insert value into
database so we have three types of
languages in SQL right so we have DDL we
have DML and then we have dql so
whenever you work with DDL which is data
definition language which is which let's
say if you are creating a table when you
feel if you are changing the structure
of your database it is DDL data
definition language DML is whenever i
want to change the value of a table let
us say you are inserting a new value you
are updating existing value you are
deleting existing row so that is DML
whenever you far the query for date
fetching data so that is dql we also
have TC alpha which is transaction
control language let us say you want to
grant permission you want to revoke
permissions so that is TCL okay time and
we are talking about DD ldml and dql so
whenever you walk with DQ which is data
query language where you fetch the data
from the database we need to use execute
query because this execute query returns
the object of this all set because we
have we are getting data from the
database but whenever you work with DM a
let's say if you want to insert data so
while inserting you are not fetching the
data of the table right so I shall use
execute query we will be using execute
update because execute update so there
is a method execute update which will
give you so it will take a parameters
SQL query and it will give you ink it
will not give you object of the cells
set right now what is this end so this
ain't represent the number of rows
affected so let us say if you if you if
you insert data into database so it will
fo it will effect one row if you update
a table by some lette so if you are
updating three to four rows at the same
time so you will be getting four it will
return the value for which which is
which means we have updated four rows so
we cannot write a RS dot we may not
write others that they have to say
account so this is the number of rows
which are affected right and then since
we are not fetching data so no need of
while there note of this string we can
simply print a statement so we can say a
count plus rows affected okay even I am
not sure it will be rows although also
will use /s okay because I've two rows
then two rows then if it is one row than
one row affected right so now if I run
this query should work so you can see we
got one row affected right let's go back
to the SQL let's far the query and if I
far the query you can see we have four
mohini right so we can insert the data
with the help of insert Clause or insert
query and then for inserting we have to
use execute update but let's say we
don't have this data available we have
this data in the variable so let's say
if I have a variable as user ID and we
have five there and then we have one
more record which is okay this is of
type int right and then we will be
having a string which is let's say the
name is let's say le alright so we have
this name so we have user name user ID 5
and user name early I want to insert
this values into database for that I
cannot write for here we have to write
user ID and then we instead of writing
Mohini
we need to mention this is username
right but hold down we want to fetch the
value of users ID right so we cannot
write user ID inside double quotes
because that's a variable so we need to
separate this user ID from the double
quotes so we'll enter double quotes here
and we'll say plus because we are trying
to concatenate this with say plus double
quotes okay again the same thing here
after single code we have to say plus
double quotes or double quotes here but
before this you have to send double
quotes and then again plus double quotes
right so way to open and close double
quotes very you know by very by taking
proper precautions because it may be you
you might be ending double quotes
somewhere else and then it will give you
error right so this is how we need to
write double quotes and then plus
operator and if I run this query now so
you can see it says one-way affected and
if I book a by to database for than this
query we got five records now it seems
easy right because we can give double
quotes and plus but let's say we don't
have two columns we have ten columns in
that scenario we have to we have to do
lots of plus and double quotes right so
this is not the best way of doing it so
the best way to handle this type of
things whenever you want to insert
values where values are coming
dynamically so we can use something
called as instead of using statement we
can use the pad statement okay so as we
have seen in the theory we have talked
about this right so if you are not
seeing the theory of this just go back
to my channel once again and search for
the Java database connectivity theory by
telesco okay now so we have yeah so
instead of using statement will be using
prepare statement now it is pre passed
written means so whenever you want to
walk with the predefined queries you can
see the queries fixed but the value will
keep changing in this scenario we should
always use prepare statement how to use
prepare statement just say state instead
of statement just write prepare
statement here that is prepared
statement right let's
okay let's prepare statement and in
serve create statement here because
whenever you work with prepare statement
we have to use a method which is prepare
statement okay I mean this prepared
statement will ask you for the query it
is a predefined query right and whenever
you work with blip a statement you do
not have to write all these double
quotes and plus you can simply say I
know the query but I do not know the
values now when you say I do not know
the values just add question mark there
okay so instead of adding the values
just right question mark right
and so before executing so you can see I
am executing the query here right so
before executing are going to first
change the values right so we'll say sex
and we'll give the name as the poly okay
now so instead of so before filing the
query we have to update the values so
you have to replace this question mark
with sex we need to replace this
question mark with the help of Nepali
how to do that just simply say st dot so
to update the value just say set int now
this set end will take two parameters
the first parameter is the number of
question mark so it is the first
question mark and the value is user ID
okay then you have to say s dot such
string for the second question mark and
then you have to mention the user name
all right so we are replacing these two
things the first question mark and the
second question mark right and this one
is code and we got error comrades we
already okay so we have a error near the
double quotes
okay what's the error everything seems
good insert into students values okay
everything seems good there should not
be any problem there let me write this
once again now what's the issue
okay so we have we are adding one be
writing two we are using prepare
statement of the same package so no
issue with that when sitting user ID VI
inserting username and we are not using
okay everything seems good let's run
this I once again and there's a problem
again so it says
check the manual there's some something
wrong with double quotes okay everything
seems perfect
nothing to worry okay try this query
once again so values pushin la cama
question ma don't be light okay so
that's query and this is prepared
statement conduct the past treatment
other things sounds good okay that's the
past statement still there's an error so
let me just check
see we have we have made one mistake
here since we are passing the query here
we should not pass the same query here
because once you use preparer statement
you have to mention the query and the
preparer statement not in the execute
update right and if I run this code you
can see we are getting one row affected
now right let's go back to the database
and if I run this code you got six
dipali right it's that simple so that's
how we need to use we need to insert
values we can also update here we can
write update query we can write delete
query we can do all those stuff here and
that's how you do insertion you are
that's how you fetch values so in the
next video we'll see how to use a design
pattern coolest out design pattern so
when we work with maybe a project or
advanced software we need to use some
design pattern so I don't know if the
design pattern we should know about is
Dow which is data access object so many
of you work with database database stuff
which is JDBC you should always write
your Dao you should always write your
database steps inside this Dao layer so
this dar will be a new class in which
we'll be having all these steps so that
it will create some layers so that if
you have any problem with the database
you will only change the dollar not the
whole software again how to use that
that we'll see in the next video so I
