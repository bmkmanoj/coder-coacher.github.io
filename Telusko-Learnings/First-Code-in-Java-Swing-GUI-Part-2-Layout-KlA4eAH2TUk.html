jet flame in which I've shown a text
called as hello world using a label
let's run it again so if I say run you
can see the output is hello world now
let's say I want to I want to take two
labels one label will print hello world
and the second will label will print
welcome naveen now for that what we can
do is we can just go to GUI now too
short to text we need one more label so
we'll say label jlabel we'll say L 1
equal to nu J label and the text I want
to show here will say welcome
naveen simple and after adding L let me
add one more object now which is L 1
simple so the output expecting earth
it's it's hello world and after hello
world there will be one more text which
is welcome Naveen so that means on your
GUI you want to see two text that's on
this to see what the output will be if
you learn this file oh we are getting
only one output where is hello world the
problem is by default your CH frame your
jframe follows something called as card
layout not exactly card layout means
it's it follows card layout so what it
means is once well when you play cards
those like when you play those cards
when you have five cards you can see
only one card right it's something like
a stack of cards you can see only the
top card in the same way when you add it
when you add it L it took all the idea
of your jframe when you add it L 1 it
took again it over I did that hello
world I ate it now you can you can only
see welcome now win because you are the
layout you are falling here is card
layout now let me demonstrate cut about
once more let's say you have this window
and this window let me show you let me
run this again
now you can see half to window one
window is here and second it is here so
if I follow a card they are to discard
me out one window or one component will
override another component it doesn't
mean it doesn't means that we don't have
that earlier component there but the
last component is overwriting the old
component right and to solve this
problem we need to change the layout and
the default layout here is card layout
we need to change that layout into some
new type of layout but to change the
layout we need to use a method called as
set layout now set layout method will
ask you for an object of layout now what
are the options you can use here so one
thing one of the option is floor layout
then we can use grid layout we can even
use null layout and we have lots of
layout in this tutorial we'll say we'll
use floor layout not exactly floor
layout is by default all the component
will take the middle part or middle
space of the middle middle area of the
frame so how to useful only out will we
read an object of flow layout so we have
to say new it is flow layout so when you
say new floor layout it will pass the
object of lonely out in to set layout
that means stuff using card layout now
we are using flow layout if we run this
application now but this file and you
can see we are getting two text so it
will they will try to capture the center
of your jframe clear so even if I add
more frames or more labels it will try
to occupy the middle space of your jail
frame so this is your floor layout and
in next tutorial we'll see some
advancement maybe some buttons and the
text field
till then those escape for the for the
do subscribe and wait for the further
