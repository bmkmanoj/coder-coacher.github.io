localization and internationalization
using this two classes when it look at
locale and second if this was blended so
what we to do now is let's say first of
all let me let me bring something called
as happy poet okay so if I play this
text let me run this code and the output
you will be getting is happy birthday
right but I don't need this
happy birthday here what I enter parent
is I just want to print that so what I
had to printer is I just have to print
wish so depend upon the wish if I
specify a language called as English it
should print happy birthday if I use the
language of this Hindi it should print
anything Mubarak and depend upon the
affinity for language between different
different texts right so to work with
that first way to create is a properties
file now how to pay the property file
just right-click on your package click
on new and you can search for properties
file but in case if you don't find here
click on another there's just go to
others and you will find a property file
you click on next and name this as
bundle you can name it as anything I can
make name it as my bundle or my file my
resources and in anything and then click
on finish now if you go for the default
text by default it will be empty now now
what we'll do now in this property file
we have to mention a key value pair not
exactly key value pair means key is your
word you'll you'll be using in your code
that is wish and the value should be
fetched from here so we have to specify
the value is happy but they you can see
wish is black color and this value is in
orange color right so what you do in our
earth let's let's fetch that data here
to fetch this bundle here or this value
here by default the language will be
following his English and the country
after followers us so we created two
string variable one years language which
specify the language
and will say the language we are you're
using here is English and second way to
specify is the country so the country
name here will be us because your
keyboard or your system is configured to
work with this English language which
belongs to us we cannot we can also use
English UK you can also use English in
any other country next we have to create
is a locale object so let's create we'll
say this is L equal to a new locale now
in this you have to specify two
parameters for this language names again
his country name and the language is
Lang and country is country and we'll
say a semicolon next we have to create
our object of resourcebundle because the
only way you can fetch data from that
property is using this resource bundles
we say the source bundle and you can see
both these classes belong to same
package for Java util and will say are
equal to now the way you can you have to
create a resource bundle is by saying
resourcebundle dot get bundle it will
ask you for two parameters the first
parameter is the property file name and
we'll say the property file name is
bundle and the next thing you to specify
is the local object because depend upon
the locale it will fetch for the
properties example let's say the only
language I'm using here is English right
let's say I want to work with Hindi or
German language I need to create more
property file here that was that we'll
see later now to fetch that which will
say create a string we'll say which
equal to now this fish here is a
variable JA variable and then I will
change this to say
sto to make it simple and then we can
use get a dot get string and you have to
specify a key a key value is this you
have to specify this key which is wish
so in this we specify wish and that's it
let's blend that STR so we'll say system
dot at Winterland print STR rifle on
this code it will jump to this file
bundle taut properties it will fetch the
key keys fish and the value is happy
birthday and you will get that wish here
in Estia and you are printing that right
if I run this code oh but you never yeah
the problem is I to specify I mentioned
bundle but the bundle is in package
locale demo so to specify locale there
more slash bundle I forgot to mention
the exact part okay so let me just run
this now and the output is happy
birthday right
simple so this is how you have to use
this class the sauce bundle but question
arise what if I want in different
language not to work with different
language you need to create some more
properties file and how to do it that
we'll see in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
