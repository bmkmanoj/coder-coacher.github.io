the way we can use companion object the
other we use of it is to achieve factory
design pattern now what it's like to
design pattern if you are coming from
software development project may be any
project may be c-sharp or maybe based on
c-sharp or Java so sometimes we try to
create our factory design pattern where
if you want to create an object of a
class let's say if you have a class for
as a and if you want to create object of
this class and maybe creation of this
object is not that easy normally in what
we do is we simply save add obj equal to
a right so let's say the creation of
this object of for Class A is not that
easy the way you are doing here maybe
you have to do something example you
have to pass some parameters maybe you
have to first load some load some
connections and then you can do this
maybe there are there is some complex
logic behind building this object and so
you can type everything here but then
sometimes what happened you know when
you create a library when you create a
class where a user don't have to do much
to create an object so you can reduce
the work of a user by creating a factory
method inside your class so what will
happen is let's say if you want to call
or autumn saying it should it's not
public it's this function function show
let's say if you have this function show
and if I print something here very
simple thing and if I print ensure
nothing else so to call this show of
course I want an object right and let's
say creation of this object is not that
easy you have to pass some parameters
you have to do some extra stuff so what
you can do is you can do all those
things in a method and that method will
be called as a factory metal here
example let's say if I say this is this
is a create method and this create
method returns you the object of a and
okay so this method returns an object of
a and will simply say okay we can also
do it in inline so either we can okay we
can we can do it in line as a function
expression we can say it will return the
object of a again you could to have we
could have returned the entire method
where you will do some extra stuff and
then you rotate object again we don't
want to do X we don't want to add any
complex code here but just imagine if
you want to create an object which is
very difficult to make or it needs lots
of parameters or work to be done
so what you can do is you can create a
metaphor is create and this create
method will create an object for you the
problem is if I want to create the
object now of course I have to call this
method create right but how can you
create them how can you call a method
create now because create itself is a
method so what we can do is we can put
that in a companion object so if I say
companion object and if I put that
create inside the companion object what
we can do is we can call the create
method with the help of a dodj create
right so that's one of the use of
companion object we can achieve
something called as frak design pattern
the end in here and it's let's try with
let's try this now if I say obj dot show
it should work right so we got the
object right so we got the object which
is fun create and okay so this method
create returns a type of a and we are
returning the object of a right again as
I mentioned there might be some
difficult thing you have to read right
then you have to open the credit baggage
close it cut the package or do you have
to do this do those things here and yes
so that's that that feels good right
let's run this code let's say which is
working if I say run and then first drag
let's I hope it will work
oh we got an error now I don't is
because of the last class I remember we
have worked with his owner so another
Java before which is a Java code I
forgot to remove the quotes from there
let's run this once again if I say run
first code K T and here we go can you
see that we got the output as in show
right so in this in show is getting
printed because we are calling show so
let me repeat we are creating creating
the object in the factory method itself
okay we are not saying a bracket here so
we are using a factory design pattern
here and we can achieve that with the
help of companion object so that's it
that is some this video behavior as we
have seen how to use companion object
and I hope you are enjoying this so
that's it thank you so much for watching
