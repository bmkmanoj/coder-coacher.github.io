create a project in Eclipse and then how
to create a class in it so we have
created a class which is test demo which
belongs to a package comm taught Naveen
now what we'll do is first thing we'll
do is we have we will increase the font
size so to increase the font size in
Eclipse what you can do is just click on
window and click on preference if you go
to preference you can see there are lots
of options since we want to change these
or change the font it will be in general
and that will be having a option for
less appearance so expand this and
there's option of colors and font so to
change your text phone just click expand
the basic and you can see at last there
will be a text font and click on edit so
now you can choose these size not
responding okay so you can choose the
size here so I will say size is 14 and I
will let me let me make it bold click on
OK and ok so that's the that this is how
you have to increase the font size now
once you have done with the font size
let's write some code here now what to
write will just print a simple message
for this hello world so that's the
that's the first thing we should do
always
so we'll say system dot out dot println
of system dot dot print Ellen hello
Would now question arise do we have any
shortcuts here because in that means we
have as out as a shortcut so in Eclipse
we can simply sighs simply type s6 out
and say control space so as soon as you
say control space it will expand it well
so let's run this how to run we can just
right click here and say run as java
application and you can see here you can
see the output is hello world cool
that's one way the second way is you can
simply say control f11 and if you play
cont if you space control f11
it will control f11 it will compile the
fire and you can see the output there
okay so that's how that this is this is
how you have to create a sample
application and execute execute decode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
