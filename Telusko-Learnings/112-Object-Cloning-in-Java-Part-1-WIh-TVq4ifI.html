riddle will talk about learning object
now in Java if we talk about object
copping we have three choice either we
can go with something called a shallow
copy then second one we have is deep
copy and the third one we have is by
using loading now let's say exactly what
all this means so let's start the first
part which is shallow not as shallow
here is let's say we have a class let me
define a class as class ABC now in this
class if I create a variable called as I
okay let me take one more variable which
is J so have two variables one is I and
J so if I create object of a ABC as a
ABC obj quite a new ABC and let me
assign some values will say obj dot I is
equal to 5 and obj dot J is equal to 6
now the initial value for my I and J is
6 now let's say if I have if I play in
this let me just bring the value if I
say obj dot I or R or they can we can do
we can use something we can directly
print object which is obj and but the
problem is if you print obj we don't
have any to string method so it's better
to have a tostring method when you want
to print the object so how to get
tostring you can just right-click since
we're using netbeans or a good IDE so I
click and there's an insert code here we
want our tostring method for both the
values see now if I if I run this code
you can see it's an object of ABC it
will print I and J value okay let me on
this code now if I run this my values
are its it should be 5 and 6 start a
problem yeah so value is 5 and 6 right
now what I will do is let me create one
more object ABC obj 1 equal to new ABC
now I have two objects one with
reference a and second with sorry one
with reference opj second one is obj one
what if I print the value of obj one
year if I print object values for obj
one it will put in zero zero is because
we have not initialized the values of I
and J and by default for instance
variables the values are zero zero now
what I want I want to copy these values
which is five and six in this new
reference obj one one of the way to do
it is by Krait obj here
now what this obj will do is it will
just copy the data okay it seems like
it's whopping data but let's see what
happens let's say if I am assigning a
value of obj2 obj one seems like we are
finding values if i underscore now you
can see the value is five and six that
means in obj one we have value five and
six but what if if I go here if I say
obj one dot let's say J which was six
earlier let me make it eight right and
obviously the new value you will be
getting is five and eight right we are
we are going on going right but what if
I print value for obj now see I have
changed the value of obj one but not of
obj right so the output for obj one
should be the output you expecting here
it should be five and eight and the
output we expecting here is five and six
because we have not changed the value of
obj if I run this code both the values
were getting five and eight it's because
they are not creating two objects we are
creating to reference an object is same
which means in your heap memory will be
getting only one object with two
reference one is obj and second is obj
one and both this reference are pointing
to the same object if you change value
of obj it will effect on obj one also
that is the problem of shallow copy
first
next copy is deep copy now what exactly
deep means is instead of writing ABC obj
1 equal to obj we'll say ABC a new ABC
see what our consent was we want to copy
the values of obg to obj one right so we
have to do it in this way we can say obj
dot J and we'll copy value of obj I also
equal to its obj dot I right so now I am
doing our deep copy that means the
taking all the values from obj and
putting the values to obj 1 now if I
print the value for obj obj1 now the
output is 5 and 6 is because they are
fetching values from the fetching values
from this obj now what if I change the
value for obj for change value for obj
one dot J again it's equal to 8 and
it'll print the value of obj one it
should print the expected output here is
five and eight and let's run this and
the output will be getting guess here we
are getting five and eight but what if I
print value for obj one since we are not
changing values for obj1 if I say if I'm
not changing the value of obj let me
should print five and six and if I run
this and bingo we are not of we are
changing only value of obj1 not obj
that's why you are getting five and six
right
so that means walking this type of copy
is called as deep copy you have to pick
up each and every value and you have to
assign those values simple right this is
called as deep copy now the problem with
this shallow copy is we are not getting
two objects we're getting only one
object and both this reference are
pointing the same object in shallow the
problem with deep copy is it's good
right we are creating two objects both
the valve we can copy the values of one
object to other object but the problem
is let's imagine you have 50 variables
if you have all these 50 variables you
have to pick up each and every value
right that means
we'll increase the number of lines it
will take one also fifty lines right so
to make it simple what we can just write
the coding of shallow and it should work
indeed that means we can combine this
two to form a new type of copy and that
of copies are called as cloning right
exactly how cloning works which we'll
see in the part two of these tutorials
