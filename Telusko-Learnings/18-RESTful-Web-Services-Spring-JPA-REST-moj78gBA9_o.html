but then think about this if you
remember your that your zest with Jersey
we have and if you have specified the
education which is at at at get right
here we can mention that in the in the
method itself we can specify a comma
here you can say method and that get all
you can simply use at the rate get
mapping so when you say get mapping it
means you are using a get request you
can also use post mapping put mapping
and delete mapping for other thing I'll
get will see that once we continue with
the videos in this video we are the most
important part is the database
connection now think about this if you
want to work with database because I
want to fetch all the data here from
database so of course we have to we have
to connect with database we have to
create a repository right so we have to
see in a repository right and we have to
specify all the same examples that you
specify on all this properties and of
course some that we have to specify all
this properties but you have to mention
your URL your username password the URL
and you have to mention this methods we
need a method to put to find all the
aliens edge right you have to mention
the entire stuff here you have to
mention data of this entire code right
for one alien you want the entire code
for create alien this is the code for
delete aliens you have a code write
software for everything you have a code
there but what if I say you have a
easier way now how do i implement that
now first of all I am not using normal
JDBC here of course we'll be using the
EBC but then we will be using a layer of
it which is called
as a string forum now we also have a
concept of JPA again if you're not
familiar with JP a concept I would
recommend you to learn about that as
well
I do have a hibernate playlist if you if
you follow the follow that playlist you
will understand how exactly JPA works or
how exactly happen it works again you
will find that in description area but
even if you don't know that's fine I
will we can ignore that internal part of
it we can understand the order structure
what is happening what
we do here is first of all I will add a
GPS support in this project and as you
can see in my parmesan file I don't have
a GPS support so we have to add a GPS
support how do I get that how do I get a
spring JPA support for that you have to
go to memory depository and search for
things boot oh what's that
spring boot J P a now if you search for
spring good GPA your first research in
this you have to make sure that you are
selecting one point five point four
because that's our project version if
you'll see that's the project or spring
boot version we are working with so
let's use one point five point four copy
that and paste in your dependencies now
you've got a spring boot JPA support now
once you have added that and the moment
you run this project even if you are not
changing and stuff we have just added
dependencies right let's try to run this
code let's say run as a spring or we'll
just run the application the moment to
restart the application you will get an
error okay before solving the data I
want to tell you one more thing let's
say if you want to get a project and
you're sure that you will be building a
project which will be having arrests and
JPA both so while while you're getting
the project at that time itself we can
mention that you want to work with GPA
so you don't have to manually add this
dependency again we can it's very easy
you can just right click here and say
new spring Strutter project and you can
mention it at the default stop here you
can mention I want a web stuff so you
can mention web and you can mention JPA
so you don't have to manually manually
do the manually add a dependency but
let's say we have added this dependency
right anyhow but what is this error now
it says cannot determine the embedded
driver class for database type none what
what is this error now what is what
happens you know your spring boots logic
is very intelligent all you can say very
smart
it's a cheapo grammar I can see that you
have additive spring JP dependency but
you have not specified you properties Oh
spring understand
so what you have to do now is we have to
specify those properties here but which
property have to mention now other
things we have to do here so it's very
easy actually you can mention URL and it
will give you a list here right and in
fact this list you have to be you have
to select spring dot data source dot you
others because we are using a data
source contact here and this will
mentioned JDBC : MySQL
colon double slash localhost the same
the same property you have to mention in
normal JDBC right so evolution 3 C 0 6 /
the database name I forgot it a bit name
which you are working with so if I go to
my agent depository the database is less
DB right next to the same thing with the
rest DB the next thing you have to
mention is user name so I will say
string dot data source dot username we
mention the user name as root and I will
say again
fring dot data so stored password I'll
mention be password as 0 and the last
thing is the Java class we'll say spring
dot the same property you have to
mention in the na JDBC ok don't this is
nothing new with the spring data source
dot it is drywall dot driver - class -
name you didn't have to buy hard this
thing okay it will be pop-up it will pop
up automatically so we'll stay calm dot
man skills or JDBC driver right so we
have specified all this properties when
you work with agent repository here the
same stuff we see that the same stuff
and that is our job is done I think
let's reset the application again this
will not be fetching from database but
at least the addition should work oh we
got an error now it says it is not able
to find for MySQL dodge it is the driver
because we forgot to add
MySQL dependency let's add that as well
let's go to mount deposit ratio and
let's say hey I want our MySQL connector
inside you don't even have to do this if
you know that you are working with the
spring boot JPA web and masculine
while cutting this project we know
first for master it will give the
dependency but since we have not done
that there let's do it manually here I
will say I want I want to deny inversion
which is four point three point nine
again you can go with any ways in which
you love okay we have added the master
dependency as well this lets you start
the application now it should work and
you can see there is no error right
there is no error now but again it will
not work on database because we are not
facing from database how do I do that
here so in this project if you want to
make it work with it abyss you have to
go to your package and say hey I want to
create a new class now what if I say you
don't have to pay the class you have to
pay the interface you went to thinking
okay we have to first get the interface
then we have to get a class and then
we'll implement let's see how it works
we'll say alien repository okay and we
just have to extend or great click on
finish we got the interfaces right
we just have to extend with one of the
one of the internals one of the internal
interface colors code repository where
you have to mention whatever plans you
are working with and the primary key
whatever parameter key you're working
with so i working with a primary key in
teacher now in your master database you
have a primary key which is this is not
our table let's use rest DB let's verify
what you are working with and select
star from alien okay so this is our data
right now this is your primary key which
is integer so it is specify integer here
and now you might be thinking okay we
have to define all the methods here
create or get update and delete and then
we have to get one more class which will
implement in it this interface works
that's how Java works but what if I say
you don't have to do any of this stuff
let's keep this interface empty and let
us not get any other class and in here
in this resources we have to create
object of ADA repository will say agent
repository and we say as I poke that's
it and here we simply lights at auto
wire now this is a spring code feature
if you want object you don't have to get
the object by saying new or alien
repository you can say
right at or two-word it will search for
the implementation it will give you the
object you don't have to worry about
that and here let's not create the
object by ourselves
simply say the data will be coming from
the airport with the report dot Zippo
dot find all so we have to use internal
method we could find all ok this works
ok so we can type past it if it's not
work with let's change something let's
let's run this for let's see what
happens the moment along this code you
can see I am using the left for now and
oh we got an error
oh it says it is not a management if you
are using database we have to also make
sure that this is an entity because we
are using a concept of hibernate and in
hibernate we have to mention this as at
entity and it's not just hibernate we
are talking about in general JP is right
so in JP a we have to mention identity
and add ID so I ID will give you a idea
will make this is a primary key and this
class is entity class ok so we are
nudging flow Meadows now let's go back
to our postman and let's say hey postman
fetch the data and you can see that we
are getting all this data and this
things are coming from database right so
that's how this that's how this stuff
works here you just have to say find all
just type cache it with this list and
everything will work fine you don't have
to use any trivial stuff everything will
work fine right awesome things right so
this is how you use a spring rest with
database with the help of GPA let me
recap what is happening here the magic
thing here is we are not getting any
class which instances interface and it
still works right so this thing is done
by spring for you now there are lots of
people they say ok thing is not that
good now what is this thing is awesome
thing is not good it is awesome like it
will give you all those extra features
which which you need right so that's the
magic of spring boot again well once we
continue with the example in the next
videos will you will get more idea about
it but I would recommend you that before
going for the next video
Duke
because this is something which you will
understand only when you do it because
it's a magic light and magic when I show
the magic you will be thinking oh this
is awesome but the CEO think you will
understand when you fly it by yourself
so try it by yourself but then you will
see the actual then you will understand
the actual stuff the next video we'll
see the other methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
