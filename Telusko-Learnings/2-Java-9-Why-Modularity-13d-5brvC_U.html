Friday and in this video we'll talk
about why do we need modularity and why
do we need modules now in fact everyone
knows in Java 9 required a concept of
modules and with packages and jars we
will also be using modules to make our
software up in experience much better
but why do we need it and wanting what
advantage will be getting using modules
so to explain that I will be using an ID
here here which is IntelliJ again you
can use any IDE which you prefer you can
use NetBeans you can use Eclipse but
when you've got a fee or you got a
plugin for Java 9 the problem with that
means now is it is working with Java 9
but then it's not working on my machine
so I guess it is not working about some
of the configuration and with Eclipse
you have to ensure the plug-in and again
I'm not able to find that but IntelliJ
is working perfectly with Java 9 so if I
open intelligent or here so as of now it
reaches one of the best platform for
Java but then you can also use Java 9 on
that means all eclipse once once it once
they auto load the version now I am
opening intelligible any IDE after some
time so as of now we don't have a good
support on NetBeans and Eclipse okay so
I will create a new project here I will
say new and I will say a project now
this will be a Java project and I have
installed Java and I don't know machine
so you have to make sure that you are
using the 9 SDK which is dedicate and I
will click on next I don't want any
quarreling or groovy support here so
click on next and everything else here
nothing just next I will in this project
as my modules
demo or more demo so I'm creating
multiple mods in this project
ok in fact I will not be using modules
I'll be using feature which is I will be
doing a code we're using normal Java we
choose to do in Java 8 and Java 7 and
this one understand what is the issue
with that and then we move towards a
modularity so in this video we'll only
focus on why do we need modules ok so
let's say if I have a scenario so let me
create a plan C or Java class I will
name this class as run out of this class
names run out and in this runner I want
my
main functions is AP SVM tab you will
get your main function there now in this
main I want to add two numbers I'm going
for this English example possible here
so let's say I want to add two numbers
maybe I want to add two fluid numbers
two integers doesn't matter I just want
to add two numbers you can go with as
comp this example as you can think of
think of but let's to make it simple
since we all know how that works so I
can take two variables here we'll say
eat I we can assign the value and we can
you know we can do the calculation here
but normally what we do is we do the
calculation in some separate class in
some subject packages so first of all I
will move this class into a separate
package I will give this package name as
package Palm D'Or telesco and I will try
to put this into a package fold okay so
okay so we have to move it so when you
go to the package it should give the
error symbol and say move the package
okay you can see we've got a package
conduct a disco where you have your
donor and I want to have a class in a
separate package now so I will say a new
class and I want to have this class name
as calculator calculator and we'll say
okay but again it will be going to same
package I will just change this package
name as util because I want to have all
my calculator all my extra things in
util package okay in this util package I
want to add two numbers first of all you
are getting an error because it is not a
duty package so what I will do is I will
pick here I will go to this header and
say move to package you can see in
inutil record Calcutta now now in this
calculator I want to have a method which
is public ain't and which will add two
numbers of course and you can pass into
our you can pass into J and you can add
you can add your numbers here so you can
say return I plus J we can do this right
okay now let's say we have this scenario
where you are doing this add I plus J
but then maybe you want to add these two
values but then if the value of int okay
little stretch let's just use this thing
first what do we do is I will try to
police this calculator here so what I
will do is I would say okay first of all
have to get object of calculator you can
say calculator C equal to a new
calculator
I can say CDOT and I can pass two values
4 comma 5 ok now this the solution you
are getting I : 4 and J : 5 are you you
will get that only in IntelliJ as of now
that's not a Java feature that's
IntelliJ feature ok I will put that in a
variable called as result and I will say
int result equal to C dot add 4 comma 5
and then I'll be getting my result in
let me just bring my result I will say S
out and I will play my result as a
result you can see we are doing a we are
trying to print it now will this work of
course why not it will not why it will
not work so it will do it will work for
sure when you run this code you can see
in the output window we got 9 so when
you add 4 comma 5 we got 9 it's working
but you were thinking what's difficult
in this and why why do we even need
modules because we are not doing any of
the stuff here now whatever I do is I
will just do some modification again
this the same code will work on Java 8
and Java 7 Java 6 as well ok now what's
different so let me just make some
modification here let's say or maybe
some change in the requirement let's say
if the value of this integer values go
beyond a certain value let's say or
maybe I just I can pass or 4 comma 4
four point six and four point five point
seven I may pass float values so
normally what we do is if you pass float
value we need to have one more function
here which is public paint and add float
values but then this float value will
only add up maybe double value so it
will say add I will value it will be int
I not int I it will be double I and
double J and we will return but then I
don't want to return the float value I
want to eat on the int value I don't
want to return the double value I want
to return int value now we can do that
here we can do that and we can add two
numbers add those numbers so we can say
double I mean paint format of I + paint
format of J right we can we can do this
and this will work so even if you pass
double value now this should work which
not working here
what
so it should be the method name should
be a double in fact we don't even have
to change the method name or we can have
the same method name as we know we have
a concept of overloading okay so this
should work so even if I pass different
values this should work right so if I
click and if I say oh in fact I will
change this value to let's say nine
point six just to get a different output
I know this code you can see we got what
regard footing we are getting the answer
now what I will do is don't you think we
are doing the same stuff here what I
want is I want to have a separate class
which will add these two numbers so I
will say a class name is a door helper
as helper I will say add helper and in
this class and add helper I just want to
have a method which is public ain't add
which will add two values it will take
one day into my new page I and J and it
should return I plus J again for this
simple addition we don't have to make a
separate class but imagine you have a
complex problem where you are gonna want
a solution you are doing that with a
calculator but calculator needs a
separate class for Less helper and I
want to have this helping us a bit class
maybe I will say this is internal
package because I don't want anyone else
to use this this class will be used only
by calculator I don't want anyone else
to use it so here instead of doing this
I plus J I will simply use an object of
add helper will say helper or help and
peripheral to new add helper now with
this object I can simply say helper dot
ad and I can take two values we can we
can pass I comma J so you don't have to
perform this operation two times you can
simply pass the values here right now
okay again let me repeat this this
doesn't make sense for the simplex
simple example like this but if you have
been to into Java void from a long time
you know how complex a code you can
write so for complex could be always two
eight different layers right so let's
say we are passing I and J in the in
format so when you pass it you are
passing it as an informal
and the helper will add the values for
you so what we are doing from Garneau
you are using calculator and calculator
itself is using helper to add those two
values and this will work for sure again
we are not doing anything fancy here so
this should work you can see will be
getting the output as 14 that's right
now everything is working perfectly
right we got different packages so this
plus here which is internal now don't
you think this class internal should be
used only by calculator and that's
that's our agenda here might add helper
is a internal part of the software so
anyone else so let's say if you export
this project as a jar file or someone
else will include this peripheral jar
file they can use all the packages you
cannot control that right I mean can you
control so let's say if you expand
export this this project of jar file and
someone tried to access run up they can
do it because you are exporting the jar
file can they use calculator yes they
can use can they use add helper yes they
can but we don't want them to use
internal internal classes I don't want
anyone to use my add add helper even if
you write in documentation if you
mention hey let's say if you get a
documentation here that that's how you
do it you say a double star and you say
don't use this plus only for internal
use even even if you do that you know
some people will understand okay this is
a class which is used for only internal
purpose office of the job file or the
project as so if you are using this jar
file in your projects and your closet
you don't have to use this class but can
you stop them of course you can suggest
them but can you stopped it of course
not right you do not do that so even if
you don't want to you allow them to use
add helper you don't have a control and
that's where module will help so if you
create modules in this you can separate
your packages with the Alpha modules of
creating module packages because in
packages you don't have a control but in
module you can you have a control you
can control what is visible to the
outside world and what is not visible to
outside world so if you can modify this
code with the help of modules
you can actually control the other
people can use calculator but they
cannot use ad helper that's one of the
thing we can do
the next thing is let's say if you use
some external Java and if you miss one
of the Java file you will get better at
runtime but the advantage with modules
if you use modules in jar files and if
you say one modules need another module
you don't have to I mean you you will
not get error at runtime you will get
error at compile time so you compile
them itself you know hey something is
not right which is much better than one
time error right so then the next code
will try to understand how can we solve
this problem with the help of modules so
we'll write a module and we'll decide
what is visible to the outside world and
what is not visible to outside world
example when I say outside world imagine
this one is from outside world right
this is not in the same package so even
if it is not in the same package I can
actually create object of add helper and
so that it is importing the package
which we don't want anyone to use
I want this internal package should be
internal only to you till in fact just
to make it more interesting I will move
this package inside util just to define
that you internal belongs to YouTube and
they will work right but then will this
work in the India helper so if I say
control space you can see I'm still able
to use add helper there is no there's no
one to stop me there right and that's
where I want to have a control in
modular using modules so how to do that
that will say in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
