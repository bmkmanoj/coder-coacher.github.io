ASCII ASCII values now what exactly ask
is asking strands for it is American
Standard Code for information
interchange which means every character
on your keyboard will have a unique
number
so basically ASCII is of 7 bits which
means the the range of ASCII will be 2 -
2 7 such 2 raise to 7 which comes out to
be 128 that means the range of ASCII is
from 0 to 127 so you have ASCII values
from 0 to 127 now how to print this
ASCII value you can simply use a
variable we'll say we can directly use a
for-loop and what we'll do is we'll say
int I the value of I will start with 0
and then we'll say I equal to I less
than equal to 127 and then I plus plus
and here we can print it with the help
of printf but with the help of system
dot out dot print print F now why
printer because I want to print a
pattern you or the format so first I had
to print the integer value and will
provide a colon of that and then we'll
plane the character value will say C now
I want to replace this with I comma I so
both the values will come from I
variable simple so first person day will
be I and I again person C will be I
since we are I think person D it will
fetch the integer value of I which is
normal number and when you say person C
of the integer it will fetch its ASCII
code it's that simple right and then
we'll provide a big space I will say for
next we'll say a pipe so attack so that
we can differentiate between different
ASCII values and if I on this code now
run and waiting for the output
it's waiting waiting waiting I guess
there is some shut up on with NetBeans
because I can say we have all this
values which not in proper way okay hold
on will will go for new line so you
should have this pipe say slash and I
think she will be getting the new line
and run okay so you can see we have got
we got the least of all the ASCII values
so for ASCII value from zero to ten
these are your commands and some format
which is not which will not work with
the NetBeans on that means console the
actual output you can see is from 33
which is exclamation double quotes hash
even your normal numbers like 0 1 2 3 4
5 6 you start with 48 257 and then we
have this little symbols your capital a
starts with the 65 and its end at 90
so that is 90 then we have again some
special symbols then we have small a
which starts with 97 it goes till 122
and then at last 97 we have this blank
symbol yeah so this is how you have to
achieve we can print all the ASCII
values so once again ASCII stands for it
is Americans type into your American
Standard Code for information
interchange okay this this is what ask
is transferred has seven bits it's take
a range of 128 bit what retail values
will start with 0 to 127 clear so that
is what this video and do has come for
the further videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
