we'll talk about something called as
multi-threading which is one of the
amazing topic in Java in fact this is
the dis concepts lies in c-sharp you
have lots of languages which supports
threads now so let's see how to work
with Reds in Java now demonstrate the
the monstre thread let's go with the
example let's say we have a class called
as a and then we have a class called as
B we have two classes and both these
classes will have a same method whether
public void show and one will print will
say sound will say this show will print
hi and we just copy with this code here
and this goal help show will brain let's
say hello so now we have a function of a
method called a show in a class which
planes hi and we have a show method in B
class which show which brings hello now
what I want to do I want to call this
methods that means I have to create an
object right so let's go I want to call
this shock a so I say a obj equal to new
a I'm getting object of a now and then I
can say a obj dot show right by this I
will call a hi or I will print hi let's
say I'm to great object of B now so we
say B obj1 a newbie
now I will say obj one dot show now it
will print hello if I if I run this code
obviously we'll be getting high n hello
right but let's say I want to print I
want to put in this high five times I
have to bring this hello five times
I mean how to print this half items what
you can do is we can just type this
state means five times so we'll use we
do the side we give we can we can print
this high five times but this is not
logical way of doing this if you know
print anything for five times we can use
a loop right so we say int I equal to
say 1 and I less than equal to 5 and I
plus plus and then I will say it's out
okay I will use the same code which is
copy and we'll use this code here
instead of hi we have to print hello now
now if I run this code right let's say
what what happens when I run this code
if I say opt taught show your pointer
your pointer will move from here to here
Dyke it will jump from this location to
this location right and then it will
execute this statement
now if execute this statement five times
loop will get over this method will get
over again your pointer will go back to
this method or this statement and then
it will call this shoe that means this
show will execute after after the class
successful completion of this shoe right
and that's why you will get output as
five times high and then you will get
five times hello right this one white
items headed if and this code now
obviously the output will be five times
high and five times hello
but what I warn now I want my output to
look something in this way let's say we
have known bad output should be
something in and this way so far should
paint high and I should print hello then
should print high and I should play in
tell you may not be the same sequence
but it should work badly what I mean by
that is while your code is executing
this show at the same time to start
executing this point they start this
show right I'd like to work with this
what I need is there should be some
process some sub process which we work
with this this show and this there
should be some process sub classes which
would work with this show that means I
have to break my code in two parts or
execution to two parts one will call
this show and will call this show now
now let's say when you want to work with
this thing there is a concept of threads
what you can do is you can create
multiple threads and one one thread will
execute the show and second thread will
execute this show that means if you want
to work with something we require
threads and by default in
job when you help when you work with
this main function by default you are
working with one thread to prove that
point let me do this let me work this
example it's a we have this int variable
which is day zero and then we have a
variable let's say I and I will say five
divided by D obviously this when I
execute this statement it will throw an
error H because D is zero and you cannot
divide a number by zero it will give you
some arithmetic or exception but still
it let's run this if you have this code
now of course you will get an error
which is a little netting exception I
also kind of divide by zero so the main
problem for this a the main thing is the
error was in main function or main a
main method but they have written
something in this way exception in
thread mail which means by default your
main is a by default you have one thread
in Java which is your main thread that
means whenever you write a application
for dekstop that means which works with
JVM you have to use a main thread that
means what we are doing here is we are
we have a method or thread which is mean
so we have a main thread here and what I
want now this main to have execute
continue in this way very bad with noise
I want this mean to be continuing this
way but with this continuation I want
two more execution one will execute this
one and when we execute this one this
here this this thread here should print
high five times and this thread here
should print hello five times which
means I have to create two let's with
main thread except except me that I have
to read two motets one will one is
possible to print high and secondary
will be responsible to print hello now
question arises how to do that let's go
back to our code the step should do that
is convert your normal POJO class this
is your
easier pooja class convert this normal
pooja class into thirds how to do that
just extend your class with third class
so in Java we have this class called
thread okay and then here we'll say
again extends this should be thread so
now we have class a bit extends thread
and we have Class B with extreme threads
now now when you were to work with this
class called as thread you have to or
it's not compulsory but it's going to
work with Reds if you want their true
power you have to override a method
called s1
so run is our default on is a method of
thread so you have to override that
method again we can use annotations here
because we are what we are overriding I
mean how to use annotations we can
simply say override just to prove that
yes it's overriding I do no error so
that means again we can use annotations
our choice to make it more to make the
code or to keep the code simple I'm not
using over I titration here now now what
I will do is instead of calling show
from main function I will call this show
from run method that means instead of
calling show here and calling run so
what I can do I can just simply say obj
dot run but what I want I want to create
a new thread which means instead of mean
it should start with a new thread and
when you call run it will use the same
main thread what I want out to be hit a
new thread right so you should have run
I have to say start now start is a start
is delegated to call this a run method
right so indirectly the start will call
run and run will call show again we can
use this code or we can just cut this
code and paste it here that will also
work but since I've talked about I want
to use a method while I show that's why
we are going with this example the same
thing you have to do for this class
thread that means I have to use the same
function a same method here also again
same thing is if you are calling if
you're calling here start it should be
start here also
and I don't want this statement zero
simple right so we have two threads one
is a threat second is B thread and we
are calling a mythical a start now the
output we are expecting now it should be
something in this way hi hello hi hello
but let's say that I run this code the
output I will be getting Oh again same
that means the code is not proper okay
let me try it again
code is not proper right again how that
means something if something is wrong
that means it's it's working in parallel
right you can see we are printed high
and then it would jump to hello
I mean spitting five times that means
our tread we halfway the two threads
it's working but not in a proper way
it's because your CPU is damn fast your
CPU works in picoseconds what we are
expecting
once it is once it prints high the CPU
should print hello the problem is your
CPU is so fast once it get the command
that is for loop it will use his code
cashy and it will execute the for loop
continuously and to put through my point
let me just increase this counter from
five to maybe hundred so let's say it
instead of five let's it is 100 I can
see
can see hundreds of hello is getting
printed simultaneously that means it is
using code caching now question arise
how to stop it or how to make your sissy
PU wait for some time now we come to
wait if you want to make it wait you
have to use a method Paulette sleep now
sleep is a starting method in Java which
belongs to our class for a thread so we
have to use thread or sleep we were to
give a semicolon now this thread on
sleep will expect a long integer
that means we have to specify some
amount of time maybe in minutes maybe in
second sauce milliseconds but basically
this sleep method will always expect
milliseconds so that means if I specify
hundred a thousand it means it's one
second again let's go back to five so
that we can just see what's going on so
let's say let's make it five
and now now there are some applications
which will which will not allow you to
make your systems sleep some some
mission-critical applications will not
allow you to sleep your machine that
means in those type of software's this
method will give you an error and that's
why it's a good practice to always go
for a try-catch in fact your java itself
will prompt you for this so we have to
use try catch and the exception is with
ROI is interpreted exception will do the
same thing we'll use the same code here
also because I want it to be sleep for
some time and let it fall on this code
now you will see we have high hello
we have high hello we have high Hana and
we have high hello now you think it's
working properly that means every time
we execute this statement will execute
the same thing let's try it again if I
this Court now visits hi hello hi hello
I can see we have hello hi now why we
are getting this type of output is
because it's all depend upon your
scheduler there is an equal chance that
both the methods will arrive to this see
pee-yew at the same time at that time
your scheduler of your OS comes into
play and which journeys will use some
some type of algorithm or some random
number generation to call one of the
thread so if you call if you on this
buddy many times you will see different
different outputs right so this is how
you can work with threads this is how
you can rate threads if this is how you
have to use one method you have to use
sleep method in fact we have different
ways of writing threads that we'll see
in subsequent tutorials if you like this

button there do like and if you have any
doubts please comment thanks for
