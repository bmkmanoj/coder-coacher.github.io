JSP using which you are getting this
output our welcome sign here and our
text will to enter the value and once I
click on that value it will either if I
click on add it will add that element to
a list if I click on remove it will
remove that particular element in the
list if you have duplicate elements it
will it will remove the first occurrence
now I will try to make it work so what
we can do is we can write some a script
Lydia to try to script it after this
declension script declaration section of
JSP we can write a script light using
this tag and then this first will check
which button has created the event
because every button will call the same
form so if your button so it's a request
dot getparameter so if your button is ad
num say this is your button so how to
check if this was the button we can
simply say not null then we can simply
create an element E and we will fetch
that value of that text field we want
you to convert that into integer so
we'll say pass end and in bracket I can
simply say it is request dot
getparameter and the variable the
textual name is t1 and then we can add
that value into value so we say values
dot add element and we can pass a value
which is e now this element is this e
will go to add elements at element which
is a method of this this egb and this
added element will add that value to
this value at least you now so this was
for addition what about the remove
remove button so we say request we can
use the same course with the requested
get parameter
is parameter and in this will say it is
r.e.m num if it is not equal to null
which means this button was clicked in
that scenario also I will take first
take the value we'll say into I into e
with an integer dot pass and and in
bracket we have to say request dot
getparameter and this time also we have
to say t1 if this was the element it is
it has passed will simply say it is
values start to in in order to remove we
have to say the move element and we can
pass e so it will call a method of least
elements or which is the move element it
will pass this e and it will remove that
element so using this you can add and
remove the elements from the list but
how would we know that it's working so
for that or what I will do is I will
print the elements here so every time I
click on a button after a button display
it should print the elements in maybe in
in vertical format or you want all the
values in new line so you can do that so
what we can do is we can write a code
here so to verify we can write a code in
this way so we can use a script it
inside this before form tag close so to
print values we can just use this
template here and how to check first way
to check before printing we should check
that if the values are empty so if the
values are not null then only we should
proceed
so we'll say check for the value is not
null first now if it is not null that
means there are there is there are there
will be some values here so how to print
to plain first we create at least so it
is integer and the list name will be
lets say Nam's this time okay let me
input the package so we say import list
now once the package is imported what we
can do is we can fetch the values from
values so values list values dot get
element so I hope you remember this
method which is get elements so get
elements is a method of list elements so
this is the gate limas method which
returns you a value 0 so we need to
accept that
hanging to numbs so how to print to
print these values we can use anything
you can either use it later you can use
for loop or you can use enhanced
for-loop
my favorite is and asked for loop so I
will go for announce for loop here so
we'll say in with a value : so this
value will come from Dom's so if you are
not familiar with enhanced further we
can search for the enhanced for-loop
video on my channel okay and let's print
the value will say out dot print Alan
in fact we can also use expression here
but since we will try to make it easy
because I don't want to create a script
written inside the script so we'll use a
br tag plus I will say print also a
value and we'll go semicolon because
every value will print on a new line now
okay and just to verify will also print
the size of the least so out opening the
size before
once your for loop is over we will also
print the size of the leaf so we say
print Ln and this will print a size so
we'll say it is BR tag plus and we'll
say value it will be thumbs dot so
there's a method called as size will
also print we are printing our size a
size equal to the value yeah so this is
how we need to check the values which is
this is how we have to add the values
and this is how we have to remove the
values and using the inner script right
you can just print all the values now
how to run this how to check that we'll
see in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
