different coastal learnings and in this
video we'll talk about investment in
fact you know when when you talk about
investment it is like investing money
somewhere so that what you will get is
return of investment right so whenever
you invest anywhere maybe maybe in stock
market maybe buying a new house buying a
new property so what you want in return
is money right so when you when you buy
some stock what you want in return is a
good rate for that stock when you buy a
property again when you when you want to
resell it you want a good good money
from that why that's why we invest but
then why do we invest again for money
right but then what is the advantage of
it first you will get rich because we
want to get rich that's why we go for
investment since we want to have a
secure future example let's say Q now
you are young but let's say after 20
years 30 years when you grow you need
some money for yourself right to spend
your life remaining life then that's why
you need money but then we forgot in one
thing see there was a time you know way
back when people used to do hard work so
their income so their income was depend
upon the hard work they do but time
gaming the current trend is not hard
working it is not working you have to do
lots of mental work compared to your
hard work so initially I mean way back
100 years back when you want to say you
you can earn more you have to do lots of
hard work I'm not talking about let's
not talk about hundred let's say 300
years ago right so you have to you have
to work hard to earn money right but
nowadays you have to work smart the more
you work smart the more you will have
your mental work because the I mean you
aren't because of your mental work now
not not because of your hard work right
so programmers let's say if you are a
very good programmer if you can build
something very great you will earn more
right so that's how that's how thing
goes right you have to you need to do
lots of smart work it's your mental
thing it's your it's your ideas it's
your mental work using which you will
earn so you know when I talk about
investment my in fact my family my
friends they talk about investment with
me and they ask do you even do you even
even have a name I mean this word
investment in your dictionary but then
when I think about investment I don't do
investment
any investment anywhere but then I
invest in something else so for me the
definition of investor is something
different right and that investment so
when I say I want to invest somewhere I
want to improve my skill set so let's
say time being I'm working on some level
so when I say I want to go for the
investment if I have a certain of amount
of money if I have certain amount of
time I need to invest that money and
time in such a way that in future I will
be having a greater skill set so that I
will earn more again it's all come down
to money right but then for that we what
you also need is a good skill set so if
you have a good amount of skill set you
will be having lots of knowledge of
course because if you have a skill set
you will be having a job satisfaction
right if you are doing a job which you
know and which you are good at you will
enjoy it right example if you are a
programmer let's say if you've got a job
as a programmer and but then you don't
know these things which are required to
be a programmer you will not enjoy it
right let's say if you're a tester if
you if you went into automation testing
and you don't know how to test a
software was the use of that you will
not enjoy your job but you have a
specific skillset you will enjoy it
right so why improving skill set is
important first reason you want to earn
low second you want to satisfied with
your life right went beyond to satisfy
with your job the third thing is respect
the more you go up the order or up the
ladder you will be getting more respect
right again it's also depend upon your
experience let's say if you are new to
industry you will get the next you will
get a respect as a fresher right and
they will not expect you lot from you
but then let's say if you have
experience of five years or six years if
you still don't know some technologies
then there's a matter of respect why
they then people will think why to
respect you if you don't know anything
right so as you'll experience blows it
also increases your responsibility of
knowing more things right so that's so
that's why you have to improve yourself
every day and every month right now how
to improve yourself and that's why you
have to invest I mean not just money
it's also about time so do some English
enough time on your skill set maybe
every day one are maybe in a week you
can use your weekends or don't spoil
your weekend okay enjoy your weekend
plus I mean if you can do one extra art
of work one extra of you're improving
yourself I mean when I say improve
yourself it's everything you have to
improve your communication you have to
improve your a body language you have to
improve your skill set your mental skill
set you have to be master in the in the
fields which you are working on
so improve yourself that's very
important right and that's why I say
invest in yourself invest in your
knowledge okay
investing in stock market property that
is important I know but also invest in
yourself also investing on your skill
set so I hope you want to be somewhere
in some years right I mean of course you
are happy with your current whatever you
are doing currently but in future what
you if you if you are doing the same job
in future that will not be you you will
not feel that happy right
so whatever it suggests from today
improve yourself so that in future you
will achieve something which you want to
achieve okay
so invest in yourself start working
today invest using money invest using
time investing invest using both improve
your skill set so if you have some more
queries upon investment from where to
invest what to learn what not to learn I
mean today's I think you can learn
everything right so if you have any more
