paris car learnings and in this video
we'll talk about how to convert a bunny
code into a gray code so before doing
that we need to understand what is
binary code way to understand what is
gray code I need to understand what is X
odd okay so what we'll do we try to
first understand what is finally here so
every decimal number so basically your
computer works with binary format right
so when we talk about storing your files
or walking with your computer you work
with ballet number right place which is
1 and 0 so we can find the binary code
of any number right now let's say we
have a binary format so let's say we
have the first 8 decimal numbers will it
will take octal system here so let's say
we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 and 7 9 so if we
have this 8 value so we have 1 from 0 to
we have 7 right
now we'll try to find the binary format
of 0 here so the binary forming of 0
will be 2 0 0 0 why I'm taking 3 which
is because to represent the top 8 values
we just require 3 bits right so we take
3 zeros then we have 3 0 0 1 that's 0 1
0 right and then we have 0 1 1 then we
have this is this is 1 double 0 right
and this is 1 0 1 this is 1 1 0 and 4 7
we have triple 1 right so that's a
touchy about a format now if you compare
the any two numbers so if we talk about
any two consecutive numbers let's
compare the first two so how many bits
are changed this is 0 as it is then we
have 0 0 here we have 0 &amp;amp; 1 so 1 is 1
bit is changed what about this two
values so this is 0 okay that's one
change from 0 to 1 there is a second
change so in total we have two changes
here this one we have one change with 0
0 is same 1 1 in same this 0 is changed
to 1 this 1 in total we have 3 changes
so this 0 becomes 1 this one becomes 0
this one becomes 0 right we have 3
changes so between 2 Kanzi two numbers
we have 2 to 3 changes right so that's
not the good thing for your computer so
instead of having just a binary code
what we have we
a new system called as Greek code now in
this gray code what we can represent as
so we to start with the first three
zeros as it is we cannot change that the
next number to change the to get the
next number always change only one bit
it can be the last number it can be the
second number or second last number it
can be third last number so have to
start with the least significant bit two
most significant bit so what we can do
is we can just start with the first one
which is zero here and we can make it
one so we can make it zero zero one
right so we got that number now there
for the first for the second number now
can we change the last bit if you change
the last bit if it becomes zero zero
zero right and you can see we are
getting we are repeating this with this
thing
so can we change this one yes we can
right so the last two bits this this
will remain same and this will change
now now the next one is that it can be
we can change the last one so it becomes
zero one zero then we can change this
one but if you change this one it will
make it will be one right so it will be
zero 1 1 which is it will repeat we
cannot change we cannot make this 0
because it will repeat so we have to
change this 1 0 and we can say this is 0
or 1 and zip or 1 1 and 0 then for this
we can represent or we can change the
last one and in this we cannot change
last one we can change the second last
one so we can say 1 0 1 and the third
one will be 1 double 0 so you have to
father you will you will get the gray
codes right and if your company I need
two components I need two numbers quasi
two numbers you have only one bit of one
bit difference right what about the last
one last and first if you compare last
and first we have only one bit
difference right and that is the
advantage of using gray codes sounds
good but how to find a gray code
directly from a binary code right so
let's say you don't have this table and
you have a bundle format as 1 1 0 1 1 so
this is your binary code now and you
want to find the grey code of this
number so to understand this we need to
understand first what is X or it is a X
or gate or XOR operator so Lee's xor xor
is represented with this operator which
is plus
then circle and let's say we have two
values so we have zero zero so if you
apply a XOR operation between this two
the answer will be zero okay
and if we have 0 and 1 it will be 1 if
it is 1 and 0 it will be 1 and if you
have one and when it is zero so this is
the operation of XOR how it comes
doesn't matter ok this is the output so
for this we have a bigger formula for
that but that's not the case here we
will not talk about this in this video
so what we have if you have two values
which are same does the answer is 0 if 1
is 1 1 on say 0 if both the values are
different so it's in in this case we
have 0 1 2 dash Y 1 1 0 that's why 1
right so this is this is how you walk
with X or which is X or okay you can
also represent this with XOR that's also
possible right so to work with this we
require to work with X R now let's try
to find the answer for this so in this
we have to first take the first one as
it is so one comes here then to find the
next number you have to compare this to
the first and second number if this two
are same of course we have to apply X
all right if this two are same the
answer will be 0 then the next two if
this two are since they are different
than certainly 1 then this 2 different
answer is 1 this 2 same day as I is 0 so
this is the gray code for your bunny
code simple right so this is your binary
code and this is your gray code now how
to get a binary code back from a geek
gray code right so this is your gray
code we want to find bunny code again
for this take this one as it is
okay that's your input so this is your
input now this is your output now take
the second value from the input and the
first trolley from the output so this
compare this to now okay
so 0 and 1 it is 0 again you have to
apply so this is 1 you have to apply XOR
operation again then this one and the
third one of the input so second one of
the output and third one of the input so
this will be 0 and then this 2 this
should be 1 and this 2 this should be 1
so
zero by the decode right so from binary
record gray code and from Greek world
record the binary code so that's how you
convert a binary number into great
Gordon from gray code we get a binary
code simple so this is the whole fund
all of this so if you have if you if you
got this point just click on the like
button there and if you have a Tao is
click or type in the comment section so
that I will make a new video of that and
if you need more videos on the topics
like binary conversions or maybe access
free code so do comment so that I will
make that video so thank you so much for
watching and do subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
