ready from those four learnings and in
this video we'll talk about composite
design pattern now composite design
pattern is a part of structure design
pattern so when I went to use this
pattern so anyway you have a scenario
where you want to create object and
which represents a tree structure
example let's say when you want to
assemble a computer now if you remember
way back in a way back when we when we
wanted to assemble a computer in fact
nowadays in fact gamers do that right
but now normal people we buy laptop we
buy deck stop it don't assemble it now
there are people who do it now also
especially gamers people working on the
server side so let's say if you want to
if you want to assemble a computer what
we need for a computer so to break a
computer we need two things right we
need a we need a cabinet which will have
its own part and then we need some
peripheral devices right so we have we
need some peripheral devices so in a
computer in a computer we require a
cabinet and we require a peripheral
devices inside a cabinet we let's say we
need harddrive then we need motherboard
and inside the motherboard we required I
mean on the motherboard you require a
ram and you need what you need a CPU
right and then in particular devices you
have mouse and then you have keyboard so
when you talk about this boxes here
since this all our objects right now
whenever you have one object which has
lists of objects this object will be
called as a composite a composite object
the awesome thing is the composite
object which can also have a composite
objects right a composite object can
have even this is a composite object
this composite object can have a
composite or a leaf object so this one
will be called as a leaf object the
reason is we don't have anything inside
this right we have a composite object
here this is a leaf object now why this
leave because if this is the last object
now this is composite because we have
two things here we have two more leaf
objects so this even this are the are
leaf object right so all this plus all
this objects of same type right they all
are electronic device if you
if we talk about the computer it's a net
when device if we talk about the
cabinets and a device when I talk about
keyboard it's an editorial device that
is this they all follow same structure
they have all the same features right in
fact we have they are the hy device they
also have price so if you want to buy a
keyboard you will say what's the price
of it if you want to buy a cabinet which
has all these things you will say was a
price of it I mean I'm not talking about
the old I'm not talking about the only
the cabinet structure but the cabinet
which is which has all those objects
inside that hard drive motherboard and
all those things when you want to buy a
computer you will add all this price and
you will say that's the price of a
computer which is let's say any any any
amount right so what is compiler design
pattern is a compiler design pattern
will be having a tree structure where
within the tree structure you can have a
composite object which can have multiple
objects and you can have a leaf object
now the funda here is if you can perform
certain operations on leaf node but we
repeat if you can perform some operation
of Leon leaf node the same operation
need to be performed on the composite
object or composite node example if I
want to get the price of a keyboard I
should also be getting able to get the
price of a peripheral device if I want
to get the price of a peripheral you
wasn't sure also able to get the price
of the computer right so if you want to
if you want to create something like
this that's that's where you use
composite design pattern again how to
implement this that we'll see in the
practical video but remember this thing
composite design pattern is used where
you create a object structure or a tree
or or you create a software in a tree
structure where the one object can have
multiple objects and that object in have
multiple objects right and whatever the
operation you can perform on the leaf
node the same operation should be
performed on the composite object as
well okay so that's it of this video we
have talked about the theory of it in
the next video we'll talk about the
practical implication of it so if you
