of things and in this video we'll talk
about bullion agenda of three elements
so they said so in this image we see
some theorems which will be useful for
you for further calculations so let's
understand of all games we have again no
one has cleared up I know that but that
still we don't have a choice here so
subscribe so the most is probably not
p.m. so we have beginner or not so
what's up yeah yeah so it says if you
have already was a okay if you have a
really money and this I believe is gonna
have any two values it can have other
group all up ons so this a is a variable
and this variable a can have two onions
are the true or false if you have a
power bar so now we have a bar and then
above that we have a low bar so we will
give you a let's try to do that so you
see you have T bar
so we have T bar we take F tight and
then you have T bar are you doing f bar
which is equal to T right so when you're
a done you is T and you say a Baba it
will give you a mantastic oh so when you
have T bar bar so T bar will give you X
bar and then F 1 will give you t so
that's how it goes that's that is fall
so this is here for not operation now we
have what we have some
go for that okay now the next one is for
our to be honest if you have a as a
baseball and if you say let's say I hope
you've ever been useless for alright so
heinous
I will give you e now to close this it's
resolution just a tea nestea will give
you tea all if you are a man use
absolute say F plus F will give you and
trying to it does is equal you easily
output is dependent if I don't eat
that's why haters is in the next one is
a a plus one is equal to 1 e Ignis 1 is
equal to 1 now how's that possible
when you say a so let's say you're a
vacuous team which not be okay so this
way this way so T is 1 it's a problem
now TV sponsor that you install this so
you can plug this into one as verse we
can say 1 plus 1 is equal to 1 and F
would be 0 0 cos 0 is 0 so if your age
is 1 if you do 1 if you see the perfect
point what about this so what you say if
your a is 1 plus 1 is 1 right
what if your a is 0 0 person is also
want it doesn't matter what is your a
value the output will be 1 and we have
to remember this whatever plus 1 is will
always give you one the next one is we
have a plus 0 in this scenario its
develop on your value of e because if
your a is 1 it will give you want if
your age is 0
it will give you 0 so that's your 0 now
what next
did we have a plus B bar so when you say
a plus a bar it will give you 1
so if your a value is 1 you're able to 0
right
the CEO is one and then when you in a
new is 0 so 0 plus a 1 because if I will
give you 1 by 2 it will give you 1 so we
have a plus apt if this one is 1 equal 0
is 0 and X plus y bar is 1 potassium has
tell you to remember here anything else
that's perfect
let us go for the end operation so we
can take and here okay this is fun so we
have and so forth and what we have is we
have a so again and we notice plus B is
taught by a dot a will give you a short
right because if your a is 1 what not
one to give you one and if your will
give you 0 the next one is a dot one so
we got one I can give you one it's
because oh I make a mistake here it's a
plus 0 we speak and I say come on I said
okay so when you say a dot 1 is equal to
a and then you say a dot 0 it will give
you 0 because it doesn't matter was the
money of a anything toward zero will
give you 0 and then we have a got a part
it will give you 0 because ever it is 1
1 plus 0 will give you 0 and your age
doesn't matter
zero Omega zero so that's here for
contact so this is for or and that's
what and now we have some whole thing
example we have we have this one so we
have some of you remember the first one
as you say a it be the whole bar so this
is your debugger store so this is p1
will slow
now this enormous table so if you have
ATP we have two variables now if you
have AP and the whole bar you can submit
this elements with the help box we say
that what we have done we have taught
that way so it got meaningful but if you
want to little people about we can say
gay bar plus V / the next one is a plus
B before the bar will give you a bound
dot B bar so it is sub tight it was any
much move you have the mix of that the
dot equals minus and plus becomes taut
simple that is the amount of strong then
we have some faculty have to move it is
three move which is reduction formulas
so the dish economist says we have if
you have a plus a B they will give you a
so I didn't have a as feasible
it would give me but I mean if you are
thinking how to prove this it's very
simple you just have to create a truth
table so you have to be able to do for
this truth table for this they will give
you the same values sake was here get
into two formats it will give you a so
that's that's your first one the next
one is if you have a bracket it must be
it will again give you a and third one
is if you have a plus a bar b it will
give you a plus B I don't know what
about markers going down and down so
maybe the ink is good
so we have a penis a Barbie will give
you a plus B so for the further
calculations like the next video we
talked about some calculations we'll try
to reduce the formulas and that's it if
