another interview question so this time
the question is let's say we have a int
variable which is I equal to 1 and then
I have one more variable which is let us
say in let me get a and we have B this
is the value of B is 2 and then if I
have a third variable which is C equal
to let's say a plus B now the answer of
see if I try to print the answer of C
which is C here and if I run this
obviously the output will be 3 right
let's change the value okay instead of
adding with B let me add it with two
okay
and now if I run this still the answer
will be three right is because we are
adding 1 which a which is 1 and 2 which
is 2 of course 2 is 2 and then when you
add the value is 3 right let me do some
changes now let me just comment this
part and let's make this int bite
because of course the value is 1 right
and when you have a value 1 which means
you can you can put this value 1 inside
a body instead of wasting 4 bytes
because bite goes for so the int values
in variables goes for 4 bytes and roll
oh it's 4 bytes and this byte goes for
only 1 byte so instead of storing this
one in int variable I am saving this in
a byte variable now what happens when
you have this a which which is itself is
what you say it's a bite right and then
you have this age let me make it byte
also so B is also byte here and now let
me just remove this int and make it this
should be B and this will be bite oh let
me make it int okay so if you can see
there is the value which is int and if I
run this again the value is 3 right so
this will not be asked in your interview
the interview a question will be this is
just the what you what is a warm-up the
internet question will be they will give
you this line on the paper or what you
say
on the paper and they will ask there is
a there is a type white sea and you're
adding two values which is a and B both
are bytes whatever the output will it
give you the or will it give you the
output which is three or some other
number okay and you have to give the
answer now
take two to ten two seconds and think
they think thing about the answer of
course the answer will be three right
because when you add two byte variables
are first they ultimately bite right if
I remove this comment you can see there
is an arrow now what is the error it
says in capital types possible logic
conversion from into byte hold on we
don't have any interval here both the
variables a and B are byte right but
what happens whenever you apply the plus
operator you can use plus operator
minimum width into type okay so even if
you are using byte type the output it
will generate is ain't cool so that's
the that's one of the interview question
they may they might ask motion of B also
they've they might to again this too is
not bite here it's an int variable so if
you add a byte with int of course the
optimal output will be int okay
so we cannot try it by tier we have to
mention end Korea so that's the question
we had here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
