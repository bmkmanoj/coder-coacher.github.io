Wendy and in this video we'll see how do
you connect AWS RDS with masks you'll
walk bench now first of all why do we
need these two things is because if you
are walking on AWS and if you want to
create databases one of the service they
provide is RDS so in the audience you
can create your tables you are create
your database and tables for your
project and if you want to configure
them using your local machine so if you
want to create tables if you want to
insert some data and if you want to do
that from the local machine you have to
install MySQL workbench so we have to
understand how do we connect these two
things so first of all what I will do is
I will go to Amazon Web service and you
have make sure that you are logged in
now once you're logged in let's go to
RDS and if you don't find our deals
option here we'll go to services and
from services you will navigate to
audience you can see in databases we
have RDS here and the first step would
be create a database on a server so you
can see if I click on instances and I
already have two databases available I
will create one more instance here and
the way you can create an instance you
can say launch database instance that
will give you multiple options it will
give you Amazon then it will give you
mask your Mario DB Porsche grace oracle
ms SQL server now you need to select
mask because we are going for mysql so
we select mask earlier and then click on
next in fact if you are using a
templates as a free tier you can you
make you may choose go you may go with
only enable options eligible for
audience otherwise you can go with the
normal version so you can click on next
now here nothing to change the instance
which we want is only micro because we
are selected free version now if you are
going for the paid version you can see
if you want to pay for the use you can
choose multiple options here now since
this is free one I'm using pre free
version so I will go with this and then
it will ask you for the database
instance
identifier I would say the instance name
would be YouTube because I'm making this
video video for youtube so it's a
youtube and the master username I can
choose any one here okay I will go for
root username would be root and the
password now again you can set any
password I will set the password for
myself I will say some password and some
puzzle here as well so we got some
password and then say next okay now from
this which one is select now I
try different settings but then only one
setting which works is you can keep it
default here and in available zone you
can keep it default as when you can say
no preference but you have to make sure
that you have selected yes which means
you can pop it is publicly accessible
which means if you want to use from
local machine you can choose this one
and now time for database database names
I would say database name is the disco
itself and then the port number is three
three zero six nothing to mention here
everything is default default before now
here when you say you have you got two
options right it says create new VPC
security group I would say select create
select existing VPS security group and
expand this list now I try different
settings but none of them were working
so apps so instead of going for default
try RDS launch wizard so this this one
actually works and let's go back go down
go down nothing to nothing to change
here everything will be default and
click on launch DB instance now it will
take some time to launch your instance
so for the time it is getting launched
you can say vo DB instance details okay
now this is where you will get all your
settings now this is where you will get
your your endpoint now that endpoint is
very important because when you go for
Maskull workbench and when he will say
create nuke set new connection you can
see it will ask you for mansion name
that's fine we can give anything we can
say AWS RDS YouTube and then here this
is important it will ask you for the
host name now what should be my host
name that's a question because if you
are in local machine you can simply say
local host here if you have database in
the same machine but now we don't have
any time since the same machine be
having a server so of course we need to
use the host name of the server and to
get that you have to wait for the
database creation because it will give
you the endpoint name and you can see it
is still in grading phase DB instance in
creating phase are after created you
will get the endpoint so one of them it
creates let me just hop to the instances
so against it is it is saying created we
are waiting for the available status now
finally after three to four minutes we
got a new status here which is backing
up let's see if we got the endpoint and
as I guess we'll be getting endpoint now
I can say that we got our endpoint here
so we were waiting for this now if I
select this one so this is what your
endpoint is so just copy this
point and go back to your workbench
paste the host name so this is the host
name and this is your port number the
default one and you can select you have
two username which is root in this case
if you have said if you have changed it
you have to make sure that you are using
the proper username the password is the
same thing which which I mentioned there
and click on OK
now finally after doing all these things
the most important step would be test
connection let's do that and I'm hoping
it will give me OK status and finally
you can see that we got connected to
mask you'll at this end point and you
can see connection parameters are
correct and after that click on OK and
click on OK
now once you got the connection here
click on this now it will connect with
the server there and you can see the
moment you do that it will show some
signals here is it showing any thing
nothing notice now because I guess it is
still in backing up face ok but finally
we got our database agency that we got a
database which telescope which is which
were created on server and whatever you
do here now so if I say use that is go
and if I create any table it will get
created on this server so I would say
use the disco create table let's say the
table name would be alien and let's say
some parameters here would be a ID which
is int and a name so alien name which is
Val cat and I can say this size will be
20 and that's it this table will be
created on this server so if I say if I
sex acute both the statement and it is
kidding on this server not on the local
machine and ok so in this in this server
you have that table ok I cannot show you
as of now because it is still in the
backing of phase but trust me it is
there in the it is it on the server
right so this is how you do it so you
can see that we it is saying cutting
current activity to connections so those
connections are from the mask you'll
wish I'm which mask or bug which which I
am using here so at least one connection
is from here so that's how you connect
your local mask will workbench with AWS
RDS it's easy but some time you do get
errors so you have to make sure that you
configurable settings so that's it so
the next video we'll see how do you
connect spring and hibernate and deploy
it on a double scotch star so I hope you
enjoyed the video let me know in the
