enjoyed different physical earnings and
Here I am with a new video on modding
motivation and today we'll talk about
what is the minimum requirement to be
into IT let's say if you want to be an
IT professional what is the minimum
thing you do you need I mean as a
pleasure so let's say you have just
completed your graduation and you want
to be a you want to get into IT what are
the what are the minimum things you
should know so that you can go for the
interviews and you can crack it again it
depends upon different companies that
depend upon different post you want to
go for because see we have different
above companies right we have small
level companies we have startups we have
big level companies we have MNCs right
so everyone have their own requirements
I mean they they want some others I mean
they need some specific skills and some
people they don't need specific skills
they need people who can learn new
things I mean very fast so so they have
their own requirement right now there is
one more thing you know so first of all
its depend upon the company plus it's
also depend upon the post you're
applying for so let's say if you're if
you're applying for
I mean applying to Infosys and they have
different departments right they have
different profiles so depend upon
different profiles again they've given a
different different things but for
minimum you know let's see if you want
to be very specific if you want to go
for development so again we have
different things you are for testing you
have different tools but what is minimum
things they required from you so I would
say the minimum thing which they require
is the first one let's say you feel a
fresher and you want to get into any
company like Infosys or direct I maybe
maybe Microsoft Google so all they need
one specific thing is the way your thing
okay so see it when you talk about
development I'll focus on only focus on
development partyer because the
different tools so I mean that different
professions are different thing right
one is er we have testing we have tech
support we have development we have a
work I mean database administrators we
have networking engineer so we have
different profiles in the company so my
focus would be more on development part
because I know that much better than
other other things but for tech support
I can say for that if you want to get
into tech support or some life the only
thing is I mean you what you need is
good communication skills
good way to write emails and all the
stuff and you should know how to solve
specific things if it really if you want
to get into development what are the
medium things require the first thing
which you require is the your your way
of problem solving so you should know
how to solve a given problem and that's
why you know if you know Matz if you're
if you're good to be the match your your
by default good with programming's
because if you are good with max you
know how to solve a given problem right
in fact in match that's what we do we
write those quotes off hence proof we
write we write code for it's very
difficult to hold your phone it's on oh
yeah so you should be very good with
maths
I mean how to solve a given problem so
to be a good programmer you should know
how to solve a given problem and that's
why you know when you go for the
interviews the first round the first
round they do is aptitude okay because
in aptitude they will come to know that
how good you are with problem solving so
the first thing you require is is how to
know how can you solve a given problem
so again you can solve a given problem
using maths or they may they might give
you some programming things to solve so
first is the way you solve problem which
is the which is your quantity to I mean
the way you can solve a given problem I
don't know what you can call it as that
is one thing next you need is again a
good communication skills because
communication is very important so when
it comes to you know when it comes to
programming I mean when it when it comes
to the development part you know
communication matters because you are
not the only one who will be working on
the project right so there are different
people working on the same project now
the people will be in India with you so
let's say you have a team of 12 people
maybe there are four people they have
died with you in India and then they
have some other five people your
counterparts in US right so you should
know how to communicate with them
because solving of given problem is not
just about writing code it's also about
sharing what you know okay so you should
know that you are working on a module
and you can complete that module in this
time and you can you can inform your
other other counterparts that the
problem you are facing so you should
know how to communicate with people okay
the communication simply means that
putting your ideas in front of them
putting your thoughts front of them
putting your problems in front of them
right so first you need is the way to
solve a given problem second is to the
way you can communicate with people
third is it matters how much you know
but it also matters how much you show so
when you go for the introduce these
people they don't know right how much
you know so do I mean make sure when you
when you talk to this interview I mean
interviewer you should know how to
communicate with them you have to inform
them that the things you know because
the question they will ask you is based
on they want to know how much you know
right so so value are answering you have
to make sure that you answer in such a
way that they will know that how much
you know it has very importance first is
your way of problem solving the problems
again the way you communicate and it's
also about how much you can show them
how much you know right okay now my
hands are paining it's very difficult to
hold the phone I next time I will take a
selfie stick actually I'm in garden with
my my mom and my with my nephew again
with at the start of the video if you
have seen up a kid right that's my
nephew okay he's doing some mustard
anyway so that is that is that is
something which we required to be in to
accompany the next thing is at least the
knowledge of one programming language
again you can be a good you can be good
with C C++ Java dotnet PHP at least one
language you should be very comfortable
with I mean let's say if you are
comfortable with Java then is it that
you will only get Java job not exactly
there are companies they will need a
dotnet paper or they will need a Ruby
person but if you know Java and they can
train you on to be provided you know at
least one programming language because
if you know at least one language it is
easy to look it is easy to learn other
languages but if you don't know any
language how can you run the other
language right so if you know one
language that that that is something
which they require so at least master in
one language any language you prefer
okay that's one next most important is
the knowledge of data structures okay
because in lots of interviews they will
ask you they will ask you the questions
on data structures only you know how to
how one a sort works how bubblesort how
not bobert sorry bunny search bubble
sort then quick quick sort what is that
what is heap and all
the stuff you know they will they will
check your data structure skills and how
can you solve a given problem using some
algorithms so you should know how to do
programming plus you should know how to
do how to write a data structure code
also okay that's that's important the
algorithms you have to learn then the
concept of OS which is operating system
the concept of networking so if you go
for this interviews they will always ask
you these questions on OS networking and
all the stuff okay so yeah so this is
the minimum requirement I mean minimum
thing you should know follow up before
applying for any programming job and
having certification in one language
that will be again added advantage let's
say if you if you want to get into Java
make sure you make sure you go for Java
I mean you get Java certified or maybe
some other two other other technology
certification so that's it if you have
any more queries if you have any more
ideas share with your friends on YouTube
just comment in the comment section if
you have any more tips to give them
that's it that's my modding motivation
