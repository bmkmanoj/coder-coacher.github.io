now how to make it more efficient is now
if you if you concentrate on this object
here so we are creating an object which
is C so in order to create the object of
this CV to say new consumer and then you
have to pass this a method which is
accept don't you think if you are using
an interface which is consumer here so
obviously you have to write this line if
you are writing this line obviously you
have to define a method which is but
accept method so why we are writing this
the only thing which is important here
is this integer I write it's because
every method will have multiple multiple
things like it has a method name it has
it has method body it has the return
type and it has the parameters now what
is important here is if you concentrate
this thing is constant right so every
time you have to define this thing this
is also constant so it does not matter
whenever you create at the object of
consumer you have to define a method
which is accept so why do I accept you
the only thing which is important here
is I so what we can do is we can just
change this code from here to here and
what we can simply do is for every
integer I value this is my parameter so
you can your parameter value will be
change for every value of I what I need
is I want to print the value of I so
we'll say this out it's a system dot out
dot println
so we'll say print and then and this I
will put in the value of I simple right
so we we don't have to write everything
like new consumer we do not have to
specify the return type and we do not
have to accept right the method which is
accept because that will be taken care
but by your java so all that code was
they were like a bottle or what you can
say they are extra code which is not
required
okay so so what we have now is have
specified the parameter name which is I
and using this lambda expression so this
adder is a lambda expression here we
have specified the body which is system
dot out dot println I but if you know
that your consumer type is integer why
we should specify our integer here so we
can remove that integer and if you have
only one method one parameter in your
method you can also remove this back
head there so you can see we just have I
a lambda expression and system dot out
dot println and if I run this code now
you can see it still works so we saw one
two six but let's say how many time I'm
using this object only once right so
what you can do you can just copy this
code from here we'll say copy and we can
just paste this code on your Indus your
for loop so we don't require this thing
so this is what we have done in the
first tutorial so we have returned
values dot for each I add or system dot
out dot println so this is how we need
to print all the values and your from
your collection or from your list so I
hope you have got the idea of lambda
expression for for each method and it's
in this sub in this in the next tutorial
we'll talk about how to use different
methods of stream API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
