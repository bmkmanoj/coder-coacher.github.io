we'll talk about swinging applications
so this is your first video for advanced
Java tutorials in this will start with
swing applications so to understand what
is swing first we'll talk we'll talk
about NetBeans so does NetBeans it's an
IDE so you can say we have NetBeans IDE
8.0 which is the latest version for
NetBeans so IDE stands for integrated
development environment in which you can
you can do all this development tasks in
the same platform like compilation
edition reddit and then you can run it
on the same platform light so like if
you write your code in a notepad so you
have to write a code on notepad then you
have to compile using Java C and then
you can run your application using JVM
right so in that means you can do all
those tasks in the same platform or the
same software and that is NetBeans okay
so in this whenever you want to create
something new you have to start with a
new project so what we'll do we'll say
new project on C again you have this
project area so I'll click on your
project area and say new project and
then select java application again we
have multiple options so you like for
our new type of applications you can
select java FX for a website project or
web development you can do is in java
web if I now create enterprise
application you can select Java EE if
you know create HTML like html5 if you
can go with html5 since it's a first
application using swing swing so we are
working with Java and Java applications
so all your swing applications or swing
codes need to be done using this
projects so this is java application
project say next give proper name will
say swing demo and then we'll say finish
so once you say finish by default you
will get a file but we don't want to use
this file
we'll keep it aside and we'll create our
own so we'll close this now how to
create our own file so right click on
your project or your source package
new and you can select java class
and give off class name we'll say my
first my GUI jizya 4zy okay you can have
any filename so click on finish okay
once you reach here what we what we need
now is delete all this comment first
okay so once you once you've been there
now your first task is we have to create
a GUI notice GUI means it is graphical
user interface like when you work with
normal Java codes you have to do
everything using command-line right or
you can use those console or you can say
a line command interface or line user
interface which is your black console
something it looks in this way okay it
looks in this way so you have to type
all those commands okay so what we have
here is a stroller okay so what we have
is this everything have you doing
command line it like you compile so you
say Java C this is how you compile right
but what we need we need some GUI we
have to we have to view those thing in a
GUI so what you can do is just you have
to say let's create one more class so
we'll say class oh my frame okay so when
I say I have to create those form what
have to do is we have to say class my
frame to click to create a frame to
create a Gy we have to say extends frame
okay so to create a GUI you to do
extends flame and again you have to
import the package right so you have to
write a package name here so you have to
say import something what we can do in
NetBeans you just have to say control
shift I so when I say control shift I it
will do this thing so it's import Java
dot a double dot frame okay so this
frame this is a class which belongs to a
package a WT okay and now to display
this what we need we need a constructor
so
say construct my frame okay now to make
it visible what we need to do is we need
a main function so again in that means
you have some shortcuts so in order to
print main function you can say P SVM
and then press tab so you will get this
thing okay okay so let me just call this
constructor using I can say new my frame
- because to call a constructor you have
to use a keyword called as new okay
once your consider is get called what I
need I need to display my frame right so
let's see what happens when you line
this file so the right-click on your
core source code and say run now if we
run this file it's not working right
it's because you got it there's no
errors
you got the output but output is
blankets because you are not able to see
the frame it's because by default your
frame is in invisible mode so to make it
visible you have to say set visible true
so as I said visible true let's see what
happens if I done this so I can see
somewhere I have or I have this window
again so a small window here but I have
a window okay this is your frame but the
problem is not able to see right it's
not you can maximize right but what what
we want
by default it will have some size like
some some this size so we have to
specify those size also don't specify
those size go to your code and say set
size you can set this set the size of
your frame using set size and you can
say 400 power 400 which says it will use
400 pixels horizontally and 400 pixels
vertically so approximately we'll get a
square and that's it so let me run this
again
yeah now you can see we have a frame
here right so this is your frame so this
was your first G application again we'll
have some will will add some components
here in my next video so stay tuned and
do subscribe for the further videos
thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
