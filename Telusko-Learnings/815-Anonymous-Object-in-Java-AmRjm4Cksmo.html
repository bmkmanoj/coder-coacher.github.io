from fiscal earnings and in this video
we'll talk about anonymous object now
what is anonymous means so if you don't
know the name of this of something we
say anonymous right so when you read
some books in that we say author is
anonymous we simply say we don't know
the author right all we don't want to
reveal the author so we have a concept
of anonymous object now if we talk about
in Java we have this concept of object
creation right because whenever you work
with objects or whether you work with
Java of equal objects so the way we
create object is so let's say we have a
class which is a so we have this class
which is a so we have this class a right
we it has some properties it has some
methods but that's not important here
right let's let's take an method here we
will take a by 3 we'll say it will say
this in this class we have a method
which is show ok now what it does isn't
matter ok we have this method which is
show and I want to create an object of a
now so in order to create object what we
do so first we create something right so
example let's let's say we are not
getting object we are getting a variable
now so how do we create variable so
first we specify the variable name so
let's say variable name is value so
value is my variable name and in Java
since it is strictly typed language we
have to specify the datatype right so I
will say this is what it is of type and
it has a value so value has a value
which is 5 right so that that makes
sense so I that's how you create a
variable but let's say now you want to
create other first variable so when I
say that first video I'm talking about
objects so I want a reference video of
this class so what we'll do is we'll say
that reference variable as obg so that's
how we nominate a first one object so we
say obj but this obj is of type what
type it is of type a right so this int
means a so that's data type so type is
int type is a does the variable name
value does the variable name object the
difference will be this would be called
as so this is called as primitive right
that's primitive variable and this would
be called as reference to variable so
this is our EF reference
so this is primitive variable this is
referenced variable now can I use this
object to call Show and the answer is no
because this is just a variable in order
to call the method we need object and
the only way to call the object we say
new and all right that's why that's what
we have seen in the earlier videos when
you talked about how to get an object
right so we have to say a obj call to
new a and we have to provide a brackets
here so this is a constructor right so
now you know about all the stuff now
what's important so if you write
something in this way what is happening
at the back end so what we have is we
have a stack memory and we have a heap
memory okay
so normally we do this with this tutor
for memory one is stack and second is
heap so when I say I am creating a
variable so when I say int or when I say
int value equal to five or four time
let's make this value as I just to use
main memory here or to use minimum space
on the board so I will say int I equal
to five so what we are doing here is as
soon as you create a variable it goes
into the other circuit and local
instance or local variable it goes into
stack which is I and we can specify this
is fine now when it's at the value so
first is the variable name second you
give the value now what what happens
with this as soon as you say a obj so
now we got obj here as the name right so
this is obj here but what about this
watch it with the value so as soon as
you say new a in your heap memory so
this is tank and this is heap right so
inside your heap memory you will be
getting an object okay so this is obj
object that's difference here and it
will have a unique address right so
notice that the address is 1 0 1 so
inside your heap memory it will be
having a hash code we'll talk about that
in the part 1 of the video so we have a
hash code and in this you will be having
so let's say in this in this class we
also have variable called as int K right
and the default value for K will be 0
because that's an instance variable so
instance variable will have a value
which is 0 right so in this we will be
having two sections one for properties
and one for methods so it will also have
a method which is show
makes sense and this address will be
stored inside 1:01 okay so next time
when I want to call this show what we
can simply do is we can say it is obj
dot show that's how you call a method
right but just imagine when you want to
create an object it will take some space
inside a heap memory and it will take
some space inside stack memory right so
every time you create other first object
or the first variable we we consume some
amount of memory inside stack now
question arise how many times I'm using
this object I am using that object only
once right so this is so just imagine
you have a line of code you have
thousand lines of code and you're using
this object only once so the only the
only idea of creating this object here
was to call show then why to create an
object I mean let's say let's say you
have a value which is fine I know you do
you don't want to reuse this value then
why do you when create a variable when
you don't want to reuse the value so if
you want to call show then why to create
an object I mean can we directly write
new a dot show now the advantage will be
this is just one line right we are not
creating any reference to object here
that means it will not consume any stack
memory it will only consume heap memory
right so this is how we can actually
call show but how exactly this works so
what my choice will remove that will
come to this point how exactly this
works now think about this let's imagine
this is part a or this is X I will say
this is X and this is y so whenever you
have x and y and if they are equals
whenever you can use X you can use Y
right so this is X can I replace this
with Y and we can do that right so we
can replace this obj with new a so
that's why right so this X this is y dot
and we can say show so now what we are
doing here is this is just an of
check so as soon as you say new it will
create a new object with some new
address with some K value and show right
but this new a is not same as this new a
because this is a referenced object so
this will not create any place inside
stagette with all the greetings memory
inside the heap memory okay so now this
type of objects where you don't have
this reference this will be called as
anonymous object since we don't have the
name right so we don't have any name for
the object here that's why it is called
as anonymous object so this is a
referenced object and this is anonymous
object okay so what are the advantage of
using anonymous object it will not use
any memory inside stack right that's the
advantage the second advantage let's say
you have a method okay so you have a
very big method I mean huge so this is
your main method inside you inside this
you have approximately 1224 lines of
code okay so you have so much of code
here so you have approximately 1200 or
1024 lines of code and somewhere here at
the line number which is 25 so on the
line number 25 you are creating this
object so this is this is your line
number 25 okay
now this object will be there inside
your memory so again I'm using this at
the line number 26 and I am not using
this object for next thousand lines so
just imagine this object will be inside
in your inside in your memory for
hundred lines or thousand lines of code
right it will not be it will not be
eligible for garbage collection so what
it normally does is whenever you have
this tag it will have a reference here
okay this is our friends okay so when
your GC which is your garbage collection
comes for the you know comes for
cleaning it will check okay we already
have a reference so we cannot clean this
because this is occupied now even if you
are not using it it is occupied because
you are creating
reference variable or referenced object
the advantage of this object s so let's
say this is line number 27 okay
and we have again thousand lines of code
our head so if you write if you write
this this type of statement this object
will do is walk which is showing some
data but this will be energy bill so
this will be any G point for garbage
collection because we don't have any
reference so as soon as your work is
over
it is eligible for garbage collection so
of course which is better in this
scenario it is anonymous right so when
you want to use an object only once
always use anonymous object if you want
to use it multiple times use name
referenced object
now when I say multiple times and why
not anonymous object for multiple times
the issue will be so we remove all this
all this stuff oh I wanted a stack right
so let me just draw that stack which is
I equal to v OB j equal to 1 0 1 so
that's my link now let's say I'm
creating an object so let's say this is
the first object okay and somewhere here
in somebody in sideshow I am printing
the value of K so it is s o P and I am
printing the value of K now ok so if I
say obj dot k equal to 5 okay not 5
let's say this is 26 that's the value
and now if I say obj dot show what it
will print it will print the value of K
right because it will call show so as
soon as you write these two statements
in your object the value of K becomes 26
right so that's the value there so your
K has a value which is 26 so as soon as
you say show this show will call will
face the value of K which is 26 right
you're getting the output but what if if
I'm not using referenced object I am
using anonymous object so it will not be
there initially okay
let me just expand my heap size
okay so let me just say this is new a
and if I say dot show or let me set the
value first so as I say say dot k equal
to 29 if I set this value as new a dot K
29 it will create a new object okay so
the value of K here will be 29 right and
it will be having a show method but we
don't have any stack right or static
reference there now if I say new a
because we can replace this obj with new
a so we can say dot show what you think
will be the output okay if you're
thinking the output is 29 then you are
okay just just hold on before answering
the question okay guess the answer and
go to the comment section type the
answer okay then come back to the video
and watch the answer here okay so by try
it out go to the comment section type
your answer and then come to this now if
you run this code the output you will be
getting is actually zero because the
reason is as soon as you say new it will
create the new object here okay and the
value of K by the point will be 0 and it
will be show when you say a new a dot
show it will call this show not that one
and this show will print the value of
this K which is 0 right so that's why
whenever you want to use an object for
multiple times always use referenced
object when you want to use it only one
time use anonymous objects so that's it
that's all about anonymous object that's
