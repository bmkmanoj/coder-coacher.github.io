right but what about this one no right
so let's see what if you can have you
can have a software normally what we do
is if you know the text or if you know
the name you can search for the logo but
what if you see a logo somewhere and you
don't know what that company is or what
that product means so I have a logo here
and I want a software and unfortunately
Google is there right so Google has
given you one software called as Google
Goggles
and using Google Goggles you can
actually detect the name of the logo so
this is the logo here and I am using a
software called as Google Goggles to
find this name I can do the reflection
it might not work in the first attempt
you can see just not able to find that
let me destroy it once again and you can
see it says this is Drupal so this logo
here is a logo for Drupal how exactly it
was that will say in the video
so welcome back aliens this is no enjoy
different toys for learnings and today
we will talk about AI which is
artificial intelligence now what exactly
it means and well we have where we have
to use it so has we seen in the previous
part of this video that if you don't
know the logo and if you don't know the
name of a logo you can search for the
name of a logo with the help of image
search or you can say image
recognization so we are living in a
world of AI now where if we don't know
the logo if you don't know the product
example you know if you go to another
country and if you don't know that
foreign language you know when I go to
my own village I can see all the on the
bus we have all the all the names in
Telugu and I cannot wait there I can
understand but I can I cannot read
Telugu so what what I can do is I can
use some software and I can I can scan
that name which is in Telugu or any
other language and that will be
translated in the language which I know
right and that can be done with the help
of AI so way back in 1980s when everyone
wanted to look what did you work on
computer so they should think that
computer is something which can make
your work easy and I suppose it is doing
that right so if you have some
repetitive task you can do that with the
help of computers but then the moment
you say computer is smart no because at
that time when you say computer it will
only do those things which are limited
to task it was impossible for a computer
to recognize the face of a my face of a
person it was impossible for a computer
to understand my voice example if I if I
say something it should get converted
into English or the text or I want to
talk to my computer I don't know if you
have seen that movie a Hollywood movie
called as huh in that movie there is a
watch there is an OS which is a smart OS
which can actually talk to you in fact
nowadays we are doing that right if you
are anyway if you are using iPhone if
you are using Google service if you are
using Windows Phone in all these things
we have a personal assistant right which
is your virtual personal assistant so
for Apple we have City for Google we
have Google assistant hello and then
before which for windows we have Cortana
right so all this are smart
assistants so you can talk to them you
know so when you say what's a time now
they will give you the time not just
time
first time is very easy to give right
but even also you can also ask difficult
questions and they will solve those
issues all those things for you and at
some point you will feel that you are
talking to a person but that's not a
person that's a computer right so that
means somewhere we are adding
intelligence to the computer and it is
happening way back it started in late
1950s so I guess it was around 1956 when
they started working on the concept of a
eye which is artificial intelligence so
they wanted computer not just a fast
computer but a computer who can think
not just normal thinking of finding even
or finding a prime number but then
creating a software which can actually
behave like a human right and currently
it is doing it is going on so we are
building some softwares using which you
can so you will talk to a computer but
you will feel that you are talking to a
human right so that's the power of AI so
in this a I we have different concepts
again why it is so important so again
we'll talk about the concept in some
time but why it is so important and why
today I am making this video it's
because you know we have we all want to
achieve something in life right or we
want to do something which is different
from what others are doing now so at one
point learning a programming language
implementing some software that was cool
then then we have the trend where you
have to work on mobile application that
was a trend in like we have a fashion
trend so the same way we also have
technology trends so the recent trend
was Hadoop and big data so if you have
to do something different go for a Japan
big data but now if you say the current
trend is AI which is artificial
intelligence and everyone is moving to
AI but why suddenly what just happened
why everyone is moving to AI X because
ok let me give you some examples who are
moving to AI so first of all all these
IT companies like Apple Google Microsoft
they all went to AI in fact Facebook
another if you follow face or Mark
Zuckerberg on Facebook but he always
post those things right so he has
created its own a personal assistant I
guess it's called jollies if I'm not
wrong right so everyone have their own
possesses then now so
we have Apple Google Facebook Microsoft
everyone have their own own AI concept
but then not just those company now is
it affecting real-life issues like VB as
a customer videos Bank service right we
use we use online service we like we buy
something online
so do we are we using AI there and what
if I say all this all this different or
what you say domain they are also
implementing AI now recently I got the
ad from I don't know if you I feel
familiar with that bank or the digi bank
now DG Bank has their own personal of AI
so if you if you want to get your great
credit card statement so you will call
the department and then they will give
you this statement they will mail you
otherwise instead of talking to a person
on the other end you can talk to a
computer so DG Bank has their own
personal assistant the same goes with
sgfc now so sgfc is coming with a e v al
now they may they want pronounce it as
eva so they have a service for as Eva
where you can where you can communicate
with them
so we are talking to a computer they're
so when you call her when you text
you're not talking to a person you are
talking to a computer and that computer
will understand what you want even if
you don't know what you want they will
understand what you want okay you just
have to enter your query what you want
and they will give it to you it's not
just normal computer system value which
is giving your reply it's a smart system
it is build on ai ai na di so AI right
it is not just big companies now but all
the companies it may be banks online
e-commerce website or all this thing
they are using AI think about thing
about Amazon now you are getting all
these search recommendations how Amazon
right when you upload photos on because
of AI and Amazon when you upload photos
on Facebook and it can detect the faces
right I mean you don't have to tag now
people now Facebook will say okay you
know this guy this is so when I recently
I uploaded some photos on Facebook of my
of some party here and then
automatically all the faces were
detected so this this photo belongs to
this person and then I just have to say
yes or no because somebody make it it
might make a mistake right that's why it
needs some humor interaction where you
can say yes or no that means even
Facebook is using AI for the faces
so all this thing is done with the help
of AI this the things which I have shown
you before the video that is also done
by AI again if you are wondering about
Drupal or Drupal basically is a PHP
framework or CMS system using which you
can create amazing website so that's
Dutch Drupal if you can see our UPA L if
you want to search it anyway so that's a
I for you so AI is everywhere so if
you're thinking you want to go to a
trending thing ai is for you okay I mean
it depends if you if you like Matz if
you like to solve real world issues if
you like to if you if you like to accept
challenges go for AI it's an amazing
thing in terms of money because of
course it's a very new field so there
are lots of money in terms of
satisfaction since you are doing
something very new it will be totally
satisfied so let's try to understand
what is how can you learn AI now I mean
why doesn't mean trend now so in AI we
have a concept of machine learning so in
here we have lots of things one of the
thing is machine learning okay and that
is very 20 now and everyone wants to go
for machine learning right they want to
they want to create some software which
can learn by themselves example we
talked about ai ai is something where a
computer will behave like a human but
then that that need to be pre-programmed
why that need to be there should be some
algorithms using which you can do that
so AI is all about algorithms it's not
just about implementation implementation
is very easy what is difficult is to
create those algorithms right so using
machine learning your machine will learn
by itself so initially your machine will
think okay that's a bag but then after
certain inputs if if I you as a human
you will say that's not a bag that's a
laptop bag so your machine will
understand he will even under I mean it
will it will try to understand all the
things around it okay not just what its
main job example let's say if you have a
smart vacuum cleaner right what is its
job is to clean the entire room right it
is smart that's why it will need to do
it by itself we don't have to carry a
vacuum cleaner just leave that vacuum
cleaner there and automatically it will
clean everything but then if you can
teach it you know that's not that's not
a dust that some
more important things so it will try to
understand that's the important thing
okay your machine can learn by
themselves you just have to provide the
input so every time you provide more
input your machine will become a most I
mean it should become smarter the say be
that the same way be human works right
so every day we learn some new things
right we learn from experience in the
same way your machine your computer will
learn by experience when I was when I
was scanning that image it was bit
difficult for that software to detect it
the first time but since I did it lots
of time now it knows in which angle it
should scan and what type of image it
can be so the much the software is
actually learning if you have used Siri
Siri knows everything about you I mean
if you if you are using Siri right it
knows about your name it knows about
your favorite favorite food it notes
about you what where you go everything
because that's a a I which is based on
machine so it apart is machine learning
but then we have 120 word which is
called as deep learning so the so
machine learning is a part of AI and
deep learning is a part of machine
learning so if you go in depth so we
have AI in depth in that we have machine
learning and then that we have deep
learning now what is deep learning that
we give an example if I say ok let's say
I have a nephew or nephew who is 3 years
old now and if I say ok don't touch
don't touch the vessel because that is
hot and so what I am saying is don't
touch the vessel because it is hot but
what he understood is don't touch
anything which is hot
ok that is far as deep learning so you
are understanding different aspects from
one statement so if you provide a one
input it will try to understand the
around aspects as well that is deep
learning and all this AI thinks in fact
Facebook all these big companies they
are using deep learning so in case in
case if you want to get into AI this is
something you have to learn now so don't
I know it's not that easy to learn it
one day but if you are interested you
can go for AI so think about AI think
about deep learning think about machine
learning ok and it is used everywhere so
let me give you one more example so we
got the face recognition on Facebook or
Google spam filter if you are using
Google and
see we have us map we have a spam folder
right there right how do Google know
which mail is mass spam and which are
not so they have a AI behind the scenes
so that AI actually thinks okay this
type of maine's a spam mail so let's
figure let's keep that in a span thing
it's not just based on the keyboards
okay there are lots of things around it
so that is that is also done with the
help of AI so AI is everywhere soon
every where in fact mobile phones
laptops banks oil industry everywhere
will be having AI so you are thinking
about your future this is one of the way
you can choose so that's it if you have
some more queries if you have some if
you want to go give some more input we
have a comment section there so give
your input and do share and like my
videos like this much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
