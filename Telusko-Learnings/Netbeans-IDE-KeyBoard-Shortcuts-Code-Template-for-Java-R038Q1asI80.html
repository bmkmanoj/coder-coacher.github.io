using netbeans or any IDE now one of the
biggest advantage you're getting is
keyboard shortcuts now what I mean by
keyboard shortcuts is let's say I want
to print hello to print hello we
required a statement which is system dot
out dot println right so I have to type
the or I have to type the complete
statement right which is println but if
you are lazy enough or if you want to do
if you are going to code very fast what
you can use is you can use some keyboard
shortcuts or code templates not exactly
code template means is let's say I want
to print hello so I can simply say s out
and tab so when I present tab you will
directly get this system dot out dot
print and I can simply say hello we have
we have some more templates like if and
if you if you want to use a for loop you
can simply say for tab you will get a
for loop right it starts simple so you
can have you can you can use lots of
templates here now I find I know the
complete template list you can click on
help and there is something called as
keyboard shortcuts and we have we have a
list of keyboard shortcuts like example
if you place where was at we have use
ctrl s out right so if you go it down
somewhere here you will see is out a for
main functions we have P SVM for system
water printer and we have s out can see
I this is s out now what if you want to
create your own template so let me say
ok let's create our own template I want
this line I want this three or four
lines automatically so what I can do is
I can just say cut now
just go to your tools and options you
can see there is something called as
editor in editor there is something else
code templates like this code template
if I know creator own template just
click on new and name this as DP you can
give any any template name and click on
OK
Oh how did you have that name so we'll
say my my code okay and then in this
area you can just fade the paste the
code what you need so every time you
need this type of code just type my code
and click on apply and okay
now if you say my code tab you can see
you get that code every time you say my
code tab you will get that code simple
this is how you can get a own template
so if you know go for fast development
and you know there are certain lines you
will need continuously or regularly you
can just create a template of it okay so
