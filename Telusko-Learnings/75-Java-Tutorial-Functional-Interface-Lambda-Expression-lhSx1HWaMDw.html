different types of interfaces and we'll
measure you focus on a functional
interfaces so when you say types of
interface so the first interface is
norma interface now the exact you know
moment of pieces are so in one interface
if you have more than one method if you
have an interface which has more than
one method that is normal the second one
is called single ad try metal interface
again we can call it in a short form you
can call it a Sam interface so we have
single abstract method interface which
is so it will have only one method so as
you can see this ABC is Sam interface
the third one which we have is called
mark interface normal interface is an
interface which has more than one method
single abstract method interface has
only one method and marker interface you
guessed it right it doesn't have any
method okay so if you have an interface
so if you have any interface which
doesn't have any method will be called
as marker interface example if I if I
talk about interface which is which is
inbuilt interface in Java called Ursula
is able interface and if I click here
you can say it's an interface which
doesn't have any methods this interface
is called as mark interface again there
will be a question why we need an
interface which doesn't have any method
again we'll talk about that later once
we start with the concept of
civilization so we'll know that at that
time but time will remember we have we
do have three types of interfaces we
have normal single abstract for the
interface and mark interface so till one
point seven B is to have this three in
one point eight which is the latest
version of Java again from this video
we'll be focusing more on the Java 8
concepts in fact on every concept we'll
have I mean all this concept will have
something new which is that in Java 8
finally by introducing Java 8 here so in
Java 8 which is the latest version of
Java we don't have I mean we do have
single abstract method but that
interface is specifically called as a
functional interface so now in Java 8 we
have normal we have functional interface
and we have marker interface now what is
functioning to face it's an interface
which has only one method why it is so
important to know about function
interfaces is because if you know
function interface we can use something
called as lambda expression if you know
what is function interface we can use
expressions wherever you have functional
interfaces so this concept of lambda
expression is coming from a language for
Scala so Java adapted color language so
now in Java 8 we have all the features
which were there in Scala so again you
can do some experiment on Scala like the
videos false color it is it on my
youtube channel which it will not take
much time of yours maybe one or two
hours you will learn Scala there so
lambda expression is something new to
Java which was not there earlier so we
talked about function interface and
number expression now let me remove this
stuff so for point remember we have
three types of interfaces normal
function interface and mark interface
let me remove this and let me go back to
this interface here so this interface
ABC just have one method right which is
show so this type of interfaces are for
a function of waves so we can also use
an annotation called as functional
interface
I mean why we need to use this is
because maybe your intention was to make
this interface as functional but by
mistake you are using one more method
here which is which is let's say a and
if you do that you can see we are
getting error because functional
interface cannot have two methods we can
use function interface annotation does
not compass ine way I can remove that so
we have this interface which is
functional right now if you observe this
code let's say for for time being close
your eyes and just imagine what I'm
saying I hope you have closed your eyes
now so just imagine we have a class for
lies a okay so we have a class a when I
say a obj equal to now what comes to
your mind
so if you imagine if I say a obj equal
to so automatically in your mind there
will be a line you will complete the
lines right you will say new a so that
is something which which we can assume
so when you say ABC obj new ABC it is
something we can assume right what about
this methyl public void show in this ABC
interface we just have one method right
so why do we even define that stuff here
why to say public void show the problem
is Java there are there are lots of
people they don't like Java is because
Java has lots of boilerplate codes not
as boilerplate code it something
something which is extra okay we don't
need that this language for the Scala
there they thought you know why to have
this all this boilerplate codes and in
fact in Java also now we are acting that
so when you know that from here to here
it is something began as
then why to write all those stuff we can
remove that so we can remove this stuff
okay let me undo this part so since I'm
in the moving this candy back it's also
I will remove this one okay this candy
packets as well so I can remove this
stuff from here to here we just need
that round brackets there did you find
that whatever you're writing here is a
method and to define that this is a
method name which is show so this the
own package this show method now and we
can use an ad or to define that this
method here belongs to I mean this
statement here belongs to show method
since you have only one statement we
don't need this country back it's a move
we can remove all these fatty packets
and we can see we have two semi colons
here I don't need that semi colon I can
write everything in one line so that's
how you can create an object of an
interface in one line okay I mean I know
that is something very difficult to
understand but trust me this is not
difficult it is just unfamiliar lambda
expression Java it concepts are not
difficult it is just that you are not
familiar with it once you do one or more
code you will understand the crux of it
but time we remember what we have done
is we have just provided the
implementation for show method I wanted
to give system dot out dot println
inside show and we have done that it so
you can see it is freely walking so this
stuff we I just call it lambda
expression so whenever you use a method
bracket and then arrow and then the
method the definition this is called as
lambda expression and this is only
possible with functional interfaces you
cannot achieve this with an interface
which has more than one method because
there will be confusion right because if
you have more than one method you have
to define two methods this statement
belongs to which method it will be a
confusion right so this stop only works
with function interface and functional
interface only works in Java 8 so let me
just undo this stuff let me do they do
this once again what are the things we
have removed so first of all we have
removed from here to here because there
is something which we can imagine we can
also remove this curly brackets and we
have to put a a door there which is a
lambda expression now we don't need this
curly brackets because we have only one
statement we don't require semicolon you
can write everything in one line and if
you run this code is still work okay so
does the awesomeness about lambda
expression and function
face I know after watching this video
there will be some I mean they don't be
there will be some people who will not
understand this but that's okay you know
in meanwhile we'll be doing lots of
programming with novel expression you
will understand the complete thing once
we watch some more videos on it that's
it that's it about lambda expression see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
