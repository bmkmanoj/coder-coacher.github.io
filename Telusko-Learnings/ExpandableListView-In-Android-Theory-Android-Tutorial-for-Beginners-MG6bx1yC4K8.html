from today's colonics and in this video
we talk about expandable list view so in
the earlier video we have talked about
list view right so you can display the
components in the least format so let's
say you want to display some list of
languages you like maybe you want to
display some list of actors you like so
you can you can use list view right in
this video we'll see how to expand this
so let's say you have a sub list inside
of this so let's say you have a language
name and inside that language you have
the topic names so example I have
created that app here there's just just
a demo app so this is my app here if I
open this app so you can see we have
Java and we have C right so that's the
list here right so that's the list here
so if I expand this Java so you can see
we have the topics the subtopics which
is super encapsulation then we have
methods and if I expand see it shows
procedure its it shows pointers and
adding right so so let me again do it so
we have Java in the inside java we have
super encapsulation method then we have
procedure pointers and ad inside C right
so this is expandable right because you
can collapse it and you can expand so
you can see we are collapsing it and
then we are expanding it right so if we
can also provide the click on the child
so then when I click on encapsulation so
you can see a message there which is
Java : encapsulation which prints the
Java which is the group name and we have
an child here so let me repeat the terms
so this Java and C they are called as
group okay there's group names and the
internal path they're called as child so
this child will belongs to a group right
so this is one list which is super
encapsulation method is one list which
which is under Java okay then we have
procedure pointers and array which is
inside C so this part these are called
child and this C and Java they are
called as
group okay we can also call them as
patent okay because child belongs to
patent right and if I click on the child
element it will show both things the
group name plus the child name right so
this is what we want to build here now
question arise how to how to build this
so what we want in the output is so we
have a list here so we want to create a
list ISM this is my phone in which you
have a parent element which is your
group name so let's say this is Java and
inside this you have three child so you
know I made sure that the child will be
in the center so there's no logic of
putting your values into Center right
but still just to specify those those
are child elements I have taken those
things into Center so you can see Java
and C they are taking the left assign
the left alignment and this child
element they are taking the center
alignment right so or to do that so we
have we have two parent one is Java and
C and then we have some topics right so
this is your language name so Java is
the language or C will be at the left
alignment so we have Java and C which
will be on the left side and then you
have this element which is on the right
side Y over the center now to create
this we require three XML files
so the first XML file so basically we
require three layout resources so the
first resource will be the this this
list or this view here okay so for this
we have to create one layout okay let's
say we call them as the main layout so
that's the main layout then for the
group we have to create a layout so we
say this is least parent because they
will be responsible to lease the so to
handle the least of so to handle this
layout okay so this one and this is one
layout and every child will have a
layout which is which we will call as
least child so in total we'll be having
three layouts what is mean then we have
least pattern then we have least child
okay so this thing here which is Java
which is a layout of least parent then
we'll be having a child which is least
child and don't worry we'll be seeing
this once we start with the practical so
in the implementation
we'll try to implement all this stuff
okay and there is one more thing before
continuing with this let me ask you a
question for today's session in fact in
every session I ask you some questions
you have to answer those in the comment
section and today's question as least
any three features really three features
which are there in C and it is not there
in Java all we don't use that in Java
and these three features or two features
which is there in C or which is there in
Java but it not in C okay so two
features which is there in C not in Java
and two features which is there in Java
not in C okay let's see who answers that
question okay now come back so we have
so we will be doing this stuff in the
practical session okay so we have main
we have to create three views one is
main list parent and child a list child
to process this two to get this data
what we'll be creating is so what we
have in the parent so we have what we
have in the main is the expandable list
view okay so this is the component
available in Android studio so what you
have to do is you just have to create a
design and on the left side in the
continuous section you will find
expandable list view just drag it on the
screen so you will get a list view or
expandable list view on the design page
then on the design page we need to
create a leased parent we need to take
this parent and this child how to do
that we need to use a main we need to
use the main activity so this is this
for this file name will be activity
underscore mean so we need to create a
we will be having a file which is main
activity right which is your Java file
now inside this Java file you have to
create object of expandable list view
now we need to create two things the
first thing will be the least of the
group right so we have to create a list
of elements so it will be Java C it will
be inside at least normal Java ArrayList
right so we can have multiple elements
there in fact in my video are you
talking about only two elements let's
say you want to create
five six elements you can put all those
values inside one list and then for the
child we have to create a hash map
because every child belongs to a group
right so we have to also mention the
hash map there because hash map will
have two things the key and the value
so your value will be your list elements
and key will be your group ID right
again we'll see how to do that once we
start the practical so basically we
require two things at least and hash map
okay now once we have this two elements
inside this you need to put this values
inside your list but or not it will not
directly work as we know in the least
view we have to use some adapters here
also we need to use some adapters and
the adapter is expandable this adapter
we have to use that to in order to
assign this values on the on the on the
on your layouts okay
so we need to use an adapter which is
least expandable list adapter and the
problem is expandable this adapter
itself is an interface so we to search
for the class which implements that and
we we to use that thing also okay so the
only thing is it's not that difficult
but the video the practical videos bit
longer so you have to have the patience
and you to understand that we'll be
implementing all those stuff here okay
so yeah that's it from the expandable
ListView theory in the next video we'll
talk about the implementation of it it
will be a bigger video than this of
course because we are talking about the
implementation so thanks for watching
and do subscribe and do answer that
question of C and Java so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
