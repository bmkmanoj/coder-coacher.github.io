talk about one of the amazing subject on
amazing programming language called as
Java now if we talk about Java it's a
programming language which totally
depend upon oops concerned now as you
know many IT courses include us part
Kalles programming now basically this
programming starts with C then we go for
C++ then we go for Java and we have
amazing technology was dotnet
now many people compared with Java
and.net C both have their advantages
both have their drawbacks think about
this now if you talk about advantages of
Java it's a you know you can run this
software on any platform let it be the
NOx made it be a Windows a new platform
if we talk about dotnet especially
learns on Windows platform now it means
if you want to be a Windows program or
if you want to work if you want to clear
the software which would work on Windows
efficiently go for dotnet again dotnet
provides some features which is AA which
is better than Java and Java has some
features which is better than dotnet
it's dipping upon you what you want to
be you know when I go for lectures when
I gave some when I write some articles
so people ask me I want to be a
programmer so either I should go for
Java or.net my answer is depends right
so if you have interests in Java or go
for Java if you have interests in
dortmund go for it
darn it but as future tense now if we
talk about future of IT a lot lots of
people are saying that kalau it will be
the future because if you talk about
Google is working on clouds if we talk
about Facebook they have their own cloud
so all clouds clouds clouds and behind
clouds we have had you we have big data
so all this technology normally works
with Java so I recommend Amelie Java but
if you want to again windows that for
Microsoft has also its own cloud so so
if you want to work it
because if you have to go for Microsoft
cloud server go for dotnet it's amazing
now
kahshanna is how to start with Java you
know normally from C to C++ when you
start with C it's a quick complex ago
but you don't know about programming
anything you are like a freshman and
starting with C so the first code you
know that you have that addition of two
numbers then you have to print hello
then finding a one odd so to do the
small small parts you have this
programming and you're so confused why I
need this programming concept to do
addition of two numbers I can use
calculator and that's what you can
create your own calculator afterwards
but if you know the basic programming
palladiums and that's why you have these
startup language let us see you know
they start with C so that you can be
friendly with programming because if you
don't know programming and you're
starting with Java it's quite complex so
this time it's see after C they combine
some oops consider that you have this
object-oriented programming system into
c like we talked if it are about oops
console we have objects we have classes
and classes so if you have this c
language which is pop which is
procedural oriented programming and you
add some oops concept and what you have
if you add some classes into pin see
that becomes c with classes and that's
what we have is c++ so other it was C
with classes then we have this new name
color C++ but again C++ is not purely
object-oriented because if you say
object-oriented it simply means you have
to work with object it simply means you
have to work with classes everything you
do in object-oriented programming system
is with classes awesome block but in C++
you have this amazing conflict where you
can write your main main function out of
the class you can use those primitive
did it I ain't float all these things
that's why C++ is not purely optical
intent
it's amazing using C++ you can you can
do programming in oops concept you can
do programming pop so you have both the
advantages C was inform C++ boot
you can work in pop and you can work in
poop then we have this amazing concept
annoyed 19 1991 we have this amazing Sun
Microsystems team headed by James
Gosling so this one is with a
programming language called a spoke then
they wanted a platform independent
programming language so they named it
has oke programming again with that
patent issue all those things so they
change the name from oak to Java and how
to start with Java again the way you
learn C the way you learn C++ you have
to go for Java you have to pick up a
good book first you require a trainer
you require a good book or you have you
require lots of practice again book is
compulsion you have to lead you have to
use some book trader is often so if you
if you think you can do it by yourself
go ahead but if you think a programming
is not that easy for you you need a
trainer and you require practice you
require some good machine in which you
have this good job JDK installed and
then you have to practice okay now to
start again we have this amazing books
we can go for this come to our complete
reference latest is eighth edition and
you can buy these on flip card you get
discounts I'm not promoting flip card
here but after wedding kiss comes so you
can go for this second book I have here
this is head first it's not something
and JSP it's Java so you have this
another book called its head first Java
again if you if you hate reading read
this book you will love reading you know
they have all these comic parts you can
see here so you can see some comic path
so it's it's fun to read but if you
wanna you know a good reader you want
you like reading you have this book
this is some Java SE JP so if you want
to get a Charles I can find you have to
give an exam by Oracle now this is whole
book this is a son certification but in
two years back what I Cal bought son so
now they have this new exam for this
post CP or you can save ocjp so earlier
it was SC j p which is sun certified
Java programmer now it is connected
certified Java programmer contain TAS
same power changes so if we talk about
this book so if you want to be a sub
Java said if I go for this book if you
want to learn Java go for head first
Java if you want to learn different uh
practice again you have this book so
these are all questions for
certification book so if you want to go
for certification we have some
objectives questions here so I mean you
have many Internet resources to go for
Java but if you want some some concepts
to be clear I have remaining videos you
can see that I have videos on
constructors I have videos on Hofstra
classes so you can see those videos to
get your concepts view and if we talk
about what to read how to read study the
book so they have to start with any one
book sync two options you can go for
training or you can go for books if I am
going going for training so trainer will
decide what to teach what not to teach
so they have their own syllabus they
know what you should know they know what
you should not like then if it are about
books books have all the content so if
you're going for book bit difficult but
not impossible
you have to start with book again you
can get go findable I will recommend go
for it first Java but because you you
will learn you will know learning you
will love reading and you will
understand something so if you go for
that book it has some amazing syllabus
so it all starts with one is classes
what is object then what is oops concept
because if we talk about any good
programming language they all follow
this oops concern the book stands for
object-oriented programming system now
if you know oops properly Java is
amazing the always easy but if you are
you know you are going through bad days
with oops then your Java is gone because
to understand what is Java you should
know what is poops
and again observe this
for basic features you can say
inheritance you have encapsulation you
have you have this abstract abstraction
so you have these concepts so if those
concepts are clear
Java is clear give me one second yeah so
what I'm talking about you have this
four basic feature of oops so you have
to you have to learn those concepts then
you can understand Java properly then
you have to understand some programming
basics like what is if condition what is
if else
what is switch case what is a there's
four loops while loop do I look you know
everything is different everything is
different so lots of people say for the
while loop do-while loops are same or
exactly for them is different
while it was different no one is
different output is the same again lots
of people say you will get the same
output but processing part changes what
exactly changes will have in next other
if I will do a video on that for the
while loop and dowhile loop but if we
talk about switch case if else now
people say is if you know switch case in
C if you know switch case in C++ we will
understand switch case in Java again it
that's right but there are some
difference between switch case of Java
and switch case of C it simply switch
case of C suppose primitive datatype
switch case of Java supports object so
amazing then you have yeah then you have
after far loop for loop you have to
practice lots of things like - for
practice you have questions like fine
paper this factorial then you have to go
for a pen in Rome you have a strong
number so if you practice all this thing
you know for the sake of you know why
loops are clear so you know the basic of
programming will understand so once you
understand the basics of programming
then you have to go in advance part like
you have to work with of these files you
have to work with objects now we have
many concepts we have to work with files
where you can store your data in files
what it is
not those relational database I'm
talking about now well - let it be txt
files those are also your database so
you have to write some codes using which
you can save your data in file so pick
up data from user processing and store
it in file so that next time when user
comes they can retrieve the data from
file okay so that all comes under file
handling then we have this amazing
concept on exceptional handling see if
you don't know what exceptions will be
normally locks about arrows so let us of
three types we have compile time error
we have run time error we have this one
logical error if we talk about compile
time error so if you make any mistakes
in running or typing your code like your
hand type of mistakes so let's suppose
you miss semicolon instead of typing
main you type something else you have
instead of a you write it an e so it
will give some compile time error which
you can stall during a compile time only
the hands of logical errors which means
two plus two answer is five so you have
you are dealing with some logical
logical problems but if you are
depending on user input like you're
expecting you are taking input from a
file so today it was because you have a
file tomorrow maybe your file is deleted
so it will your code will try to open
the file which is not there so it will
give some error you have to handle those
errors because those errors are called
as runtime errors and normally in terms
of errors goes for exceptions so you
have to handle those exceptions so the
topic is exception handling then you
have this connections see if we talk
about arrays as you go ahead is again
raha video you can check it out so
arrays are connections similar type of
elements so same elements I you can have
in two variables you can have flow
variables you can have as but if you
talk about collections so condition is
an advanced part of adder which provides
too many features like you can have your
own data you can have any type of
deadline in the same collections you
have this a tray two options you can
expire your collection anytime so
conditions are similar
and this but not exactly same difference
okay then we have this general types you
so you can say again we will have video
on children's but simply genrich's is
like if you want to restrict your user
to to give some specific type of data
type let's suppose if you talk about
collections so that connection should
only include integers so you have to
specify trend Rick's if I have a
collection that should go is a support
float so you have to mention float so
that is genrich's so this all comes in
the core java so you have this java
which comes which goes in two parts so
one is called java second is advanced
java so if we talk about core java this
is your book kochava
now in advanced java again depend upon
the use it is given it depend upon
academic courses we have different names
when people say it's as cool Java some
says basic Java or some same programming
in Java but if you talk about the
advanced part normally we say it's an
advanced Java because it deals with
implementations so encode our you learn
concept you know you learn lots of
presents this concept that concept you
you understand everything in Java then
after that once you've done with the
basic course you have to advance
yourself so that you can create a
software so that you can implement your
concept it's somewhere and all it all
starts with a software platform so you
have two platforms normally we have
software platform we have a web platform
so if it was about software platform we
have to work with swing so we have this
concept of swing you can create a GUI
because earlier we talked about kochava
we have to work with CLI so it's Kamala
interface now you have to work with GUI
for that you require depends upon the
swing now in swing possible we will save
some data in your database or your you
require database so let's suppose my
script so you have my school they have
swing so to connect swing with my skills
you require JDBC I can however you so
you can say that so you have this
database concept so once you complete
with swing and JDBC
you can create a GUI software so you can
do a freelancing job
let's suppose God you want to create a
software you you want to earn this -
swing - QL JDBC that's it
if you know these concepts you can
create a good software but if you want
to advance yourself for web thing like
if you want to create our websites
Galaga websites I get to create a
website or equal HTML you require Java
Script Iroquois with a script so you can
learn all those concepts on amazing
website for SWT school school but to
learn o dynamic web so dynamic by
programming in Java you have this book
so this is what we talk about a web
component so this is head first servlet
and JSP so using servlets you can create
a dynamic website using JSP you can get
it at any website again
then why - wise average why JSP with
this Punk okay so this normally goes
with web components so we have that
software come component swing those pies
we have web components solve it and JSP
again we have this advanced version of
J's because of JSF so you can also go
for JSF but if you want to go for some
big software if you want to work in
industry as you are creating a huge
software enterprise of enterprise level
software you can say then you have to go
for EJB so it's enterprise javabeans and
seriously if you know all this software
where it should be you are a Java
programmer you can create big
applications and seriously in future it
will rock it's also not locking also but
in future it will dock because you have
this clouds you have to work with clouds
it works with head you then big data's
all these come together to form to work
with Java so if you have a job or gamma
bright future so let me know if you have
any doubts and please come in and make
sure you subscribe for more videos thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
