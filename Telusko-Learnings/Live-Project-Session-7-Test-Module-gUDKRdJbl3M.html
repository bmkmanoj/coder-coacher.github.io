question from Akshay are we late yes we
are running late so I was doing some
configuration so I got late by 5 minutes
oh six missed six minutes so we got four
people watching now okay so okay we'll
start the session with some questions so
I got a question from I use I use says
why algorithms are important
okay so algorithms are important because
when you make a project is not just
about coding like you have to solve a
real-world problem using a virtual world
technology example let's say when you go
to when you search for a cab or using
uber or using maybe Ola so what you do
is you search for the location right it
tracks you for the location and it may
happen that in your area I mean in the
particular area when you're searching
for a cab they might even multiple
capital right so which gap will get be
notified when you are there so this is
not that simple as you think you know
there is not soft because thing going on
behind the scene so we have to make sure
I mean they use an algorithm using which
they actually process the data right so
so algorithm C is used to assign a cap
to you if you're going to Google and if
you are searching for some data and if
you are getting a detail at example when
you coach YouTube example let me just
show you demonstration here let me share
my screen with you okay so I'm showing
my screen now and let me open a browser
here so I will open okay we'll use maybe
Firefox I'll use this Firefox here okay
if you ever go to youtube and if you
search for some some videos maybe if you
are wasting some time to load here okay
okay can see it says live project
session 720 people are watching you can
also watch it okay but then if you
search for Java tutorials
big nose you know so you are getting be
awaiting my as a second drink right so
you can see on so we have thousands of
YouTube channel and why you are getting
my channel there because YouTube is
running an algorithm and using the
algorithm so they think that people
searching in this area or with that
interest will see my video here now if
you search for the same thing on YouTube
you may get a different result so what
you will get third food of first maybe
and if I search for Scala again you can
see it is a - oh you can see mine in my
video as you this is this is your direct
v but if I search for scar tutorial so
it doesn't it's not that simple you know
if I search for obscure tutorial you can
see my second now so as beta changes as
a quest changes see you it so it does
some algorithm it from it process it it
does some opposition right and to define
that we have to write an algorithm so
that algorithm will be converted into a
code afterwards so it's very important
to learn algorithms first okay so if you
want to be a good programmer knowing the
concept of algorithm is very important
you got the concept okay so I'm average
student how to die okay so we've got a
question from 1c as well I'm a third
year completed and I'm average student
okay how can I learn good programming
knowledge so the way you can see when we
talk about programming is not just about
learning a language it's also about
implementing it in such a way that
people will use your software you know
we are we are forwarding one thing
programming doesn't have its own
identity as such you know if you don't
want to make a software of course you
will not use a programming language
right I mean for normal communication if
we do not use programming right you
don't talk to anyone using our language
so the only reason why we use
programming is to make software's right
so I would recommend you to learn you
have to make a software right so
that's the idea we have so that's it
we'll continue with the thing now okay
so actually we are studying Java
language now so okay let's get back here
nice community project and if you don't
know what's going on so basically we are
doing a live project here where I'm
making I am redesigning my entire
website live with you people
okay so we got this thing here we got
this save question okay class now what
we did is before doing this wheel's
shred let me finish Emma cold so we'll
go here and okay well it's camstasia
let me just read it according as well
okay now all these videos which you are
watching now will be available on
YouTube in a good quality so if you are
watching this on hangout you might get a
bad idea there but then if you are if
you if you want to watch this in a good
quality we can use okay what we can use
we can say I'm uploading a good quality
video you can watch them later so three
two and one
in fact I have uploaded four videos on
YouTube the last four sessions I mean
okay the first two videos of this
session was just Theory videos session
three four five and six are uploaded on
YouTube in a good quality with a name a
Java web development session 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 and
goes on okay okay so let's continue this
now so what what we wanted to do is in
the last set in the last video we were
discussing about question right so I
want to create a test module now so in
the test module what should happen is
when a first of all I want to add some
questions and then I will also want to
fetch those questions so when you want
to add questions in that case if you
want to add questions here so in that
case what you have to do is you have to
so we are getting a JC page here as you
can see that means curl it missed rung
come in this part which one is code to
understand what actually I want to do
here so if another is code now in fact
it is already running
whistling state administration server
let's run this code once again I would
select like run as a non server okay and
can't think I got your question I got
your mail about what features I need in
my in my test page so basically in the
test page what I'm expecting is when I
go okay let me just show you show you my
website how what exactly our board
InDesign so when you go to business calm
and if you click on a test again string
some time to load okay if I go to test
and if I click on with a without login
test so you can see a let's say and if
you if you want to focus on if you only
focus on questions or the exam system of
the design you are getting all these
questions so in total this test will be
adding five questions this this five
questions you will be getting from this
server so I'll getting a Java code which
will generate five random positions and
you will get those random questions in a
JSON format so the format which in which
you will get the data is Jason so what I
want is so see we have a database right
so database will be on server and we
have to write a Java code and using Java
code we will return those five questions
in JSON format in your design you have
to read those JSON format and example if
I give Unser's here so if I say one next
and if I said this is next and if I said
this is next and if I say this is next
so I can see I am giving five okay so if
I say end question so we got okay we got
we got the result page right so we got
this result page because okay so so what
what is happening is we got those five
questions and then once I complete the
exam you can see I am sending the JSON
format on the server back so on the
server side it would it will it will
receive this JSON format and the server
will calculate this code and that code
will be displayed here
makes sense okay so that makes sense
okay so this is what this is what I want
Karthik so the questions will be coming
from this server in a decent format I
want you to read that Jason show it on
the page and then after when you click
on submit when I click on submit that
question should go in a JSON format on
the server so the question should go in
a decent format okay so I will position
it perfect so I mean I am expecting this
page so whenever you get a time just do
send the design so that we can we can do
some modification there okay great so
let me go back to the spring here and so
what I like what so what I want now is I
want to add questions in the in
yesterday's session which is actually
private so the same session session
seven we already did last day I mean
yesterday but then there was some issues
I was not feeling good about yesterday's
session so I just closed the session in
between but now I'm confident so let's
go with it
I'm feeling much comfortable gray
because taking online session is
actually very headache you know it's a
big task so okay so what we have done is
we have created this design which is
four questions and again I'm using the
same feedback form for design or for
design questions I mean the question
page design and you can see if I run
this code not mention on this code okay
when I request for question dot HTM it
go to my browser okay so when I request
for question dot HTM this is the link
okay again this should be provided using
hyperlinks but then we have not made the
home page yet so I'm using all this legs
here so again this CSS is still not
working we are still figured out
figuring out how to put CSS in this we
have not done that yet
okay so let's enter a question let's say
if I want to add a new question right so
if I will add all the questions here
because see in my database
I need questions right and I don't have
much question we don't have much a
questions here in the database so if I
verify how many questions I have so I
have a local database as well the
database name is Naveen if I say
question and if I say view view all rows
you can see this many questions I have
in my system I have all this extra
questions here which we don't need okay
let's delete this all these questions
here so what do I do is today that we
have to file a query so for that I will
use a tool okay where's the quality tool
for pg at my main watts
okay where's the PG is it PG madman okay
dos yeah so we got a query tool I will
delete all the questions from which has
the ID as 0 so I would say combine fence
was looking at me when I say did it all
the kolchin so I did it from a question
where Q ID is equal to 0 so I want to
get all the question let's run this code
of course whenever I want to be late oh
it says in 29 rows affected as it
writted all the codes all the only
questions I don't know let's see so if I
save you all divita I don't tell me if I
deleted all the questions here my
interest will kill me okay we got some
questions okay and also want to delete
this three but then that's fine right so
we can use all these questions which is
made here so this this is local database
I have proximal you have ten questions
okay so what I do is I want to add more
questions and the way you can do that if
you want if I want to add more questions
I need a page right so this is the page
which is add question of course the
design will be better in future so if
you want to help in design do semi
designs okay so I'm entering the test
question is are and asking for the
question ID I will enter the question I
ID as 11 because 10 is already there
right the 10 is all in red let's go for
11 and let me enter a question
best YouTube channel for Java okay I
will give some options I will
a ABC PQR I don't want to come out any
other channels here that's why I'm going
for my convenience here I will say pick
you are a b c PQ at the disco and XYZ of
course if you do if you give this option
that is quite specified okay I don't
mean I don't want any other competition
in the channel right so I'm thinking
about submit oh we got an error but then
the other doesn't matter because it is
not able to find the print a print
question JSP that's not the main concern
the main concern is have you got your
data in a database let's go back and if
i refresh okay you can see we have not
got that question why because we have
not completed the code yet the problem
is when I say save questions you can see
I am sending a request to okay let me
just open my browser you can see I am
calling save question so we got my
question here so I got my question here
but then I have to add that question in
a database right so for that I will say
Q now dot save question and if I pass it
object but then what is Q Dao so Q now
here is an object of question Dao
so what is question now so question
table is a down layer so normally what
you do is whenever you want to create a
project I mean any way you want to get a
project where you have different if you
have a big task you have to divide your
thing you know the request will be sent
to the controller controller will do
lots of thing but then the moment you
say you want to do something we take a
pics of course you have to do with the
you have to use down layers so all your
now classes will be a part of tau they
are examples of questions we have
questions or feedback we have feedback
tau so I have a question down here which
will interact with the database right
now one of the things we need so since
we are using hibernate here so we'll be
using our session Factory now session
factory is used to connect with the
database right sorry we do is a very
toxic obsession factory because it will
load all the quantitation which you need
so is a session factory's session
factory
in factory or what's not such an factory
and then here I will use Auto wired okay
that's that great so we got Auto wire
but when the package is not getting
imported package important yes it is not
session factory package imported yes run
now I want to add questions either of
course you have to add a code for add
questions but then I don't want to type
the code I have already have a word with
me so I will simply copy that code and I
will just paste that code here I don't
want to quote type everything here so
I'm just paste it so i have a save
question which accepts a question okay
it is are we calling save question yes
we are calling save question from down
layered white so this is my question
controller if I go back to my question
Dao you can see we have a save question
which is taking a question is the
parameter we have to input the package
for this let's import the package and
I'm going to import the package for
session as well let me do this do that
and once we got a session object and
training session not safe and they're
saving the object right but then to make
it work we have to also use one more
annotation called as add transactional
this is this is thumping with using
which you can achieve coming and roll
back when you work with other base okay
perfect so we got a transactional there
and everything seems good so this using
which this using this you can actually
add questions now I want to restart this
server it is done let's go back and
let's so we have a method y2 let's enter
again we'll set the same request I don't
want to type the entire portion again
okay because I'm lazy but let's see if
it is working or not if I go back to my
thing you can see in the in this it says
inserted question you can see we got the
question but how do you verify
let's go back to the PG admin let's
refresh this server and you can see we
got a question so if the question is
best YouTube channel for Java
it is options or ABC PQR the disco and
XYZ of course the answer would be author
is provide oh yeah
if you have just joined this session do
click on the like button so that let me
know that you can join this session I
don't know why I have to ask with like
button there okay
so that's perfect now what next we have
added the question right now we will try
to fetch the questions now how do we
fetch a question because what I also
want is in my question controller I want
to see how many questions we have a
database because let's say I want to
verify how many questions we have or
okay we can do that we can print all the
questions right so let's do that let's
spin let's try to print all the
questions now of course if you want to
print all the questions or requests
would be get ocean so when I say get
questions it will print all the
questions right so let's do that let me
just copy this okay I will not type the
cool again I will I already have a code
here can I do have a code yes I have a
code code here so I will simply use do
we have a good yes okay so I am copying
the code now pasting that code here
okay so let's ignore this part for time
in okay you don't want to return a
question I want to return a model view
object
oh yeah and I don't create a model view
optic here because I want to send a
response I will say model and view where
they because mbmb and then I will try a
new model and view okay
now whatever data I am getting from the
okay I have to create a view page right
so obviously this is strange
okay when I say when I call for all the
questions I would say all questions dot
JSP so I am kinda create a page called
as all questions to our JSP which will
print all the questions here right okay
that's that's one thing I want to do
here and what else we can do is okay one
thing also do is let's say I don't want
to return a page because why we have to
waste all this pages right so we can
also return a string so I can return all
the quotient of string format because
see sometimes you only need data you
don't need a design right in fact I'm
not a big fan of design because I don't
know designing much so I always try to
print normal data because we have
designed teams separately right so David
wock wock design my part will be our
java parts I will return and I will
return a string here now point remember
whenever you return a string you have to
also use an equation called as response
body because if you are not sending a
page because normally what do what we do
is we always return a page name I don't
want it on a page you I want to return a
data right and that's why I will use a
string and we have to use annotation
which is response body okay and then now
I got at least here so I was returned
released questions draw two string I
want to convert the least into strength
so that I can send it back to the client
I'm also I'm also printing the questions
here itself okay so we can't get
questions right so we got this method us
get question but unfortunately you will
you can see we don't have questions
there right we don't have our questions
here we don't have get questions method
inside a question Dao
so we have to create that method now
that multiple ways of getting a method
we can type the method by ourselves or a
does that's why I love IDE you know you
can just simply
here and scrape and say create method
get questions inside question Dao
I can you see that you you got up you
got your method here I love riding a is
okay now I want to return the questions
now how do we return a question so what
I will do is if we can type D we can
type the entire code or I will use i
will copy base the code so I need a
session object let's do that let's paste
session object okay then I want to
return
unleased but then okay how do I return
at least not enough so we have to fetch
data from database right okay before
going ahead I want to know from everyone
are you getting what I'm doing here in
the live session see I'm not expecting
that you will understand everything but
I think you are getting the flow right
to do something we need something and
the at least if flow you're getting
everyone you can use a judgmental to
answer this okay okay so context is yes
you can understand whatever others okay
okay
we still continue I don't have a choice
even if I don't understand this okay so
what do I do here is I got a coach I got
a question right so now do I want to
fetch question from database now if you
know hibernate then we have to use a
concept okay so we will be hi be using
hibernate right so I'll be using HQ to
face the data now we have to know that
we have done the same thing for feedback
if remember in the feedback itself when
you say get feedbacks ah we have used a
query right which is hibernate query
well use the same thing here so I will
get a query object I will say query Q
equal to I will say session dot I will
say create query and then in this you
have to mention the query so the query
is from questions I went to fetch all
the questions right I would say from
questions now this will give me a list
of questions okay we have to input the
package for query and it is from cabinet
dot quad query which will work with
questions that's perfect and I guess if
you have to also mention the class here
also but whatever class you are working
with so you can see we'll be having some
okay we have a query so we have to first
mention the query so from questions okay
Q should be capital because we are using
hibernate and then here we have to make
in the classroom as well so then it will
understand what about quality of firing
so it's like question rod class we're
not have type constant right okay so
once you got B query here now what next
so the next thing believe here is a list
of values because if you far this query
you will get a list of questions right
so it's a list of questions we've got a
list of questions I will say I will say
this is questions equal to and I will
use a query Q dot least so we have Omega
policies which will give you the entire
list of questions and what we had to do
is we had to just return those questions
and done so this method will be helpful
to interval database right but then
again we have to use our annotation here
which is at
transactional so this is the antigen we
have to use a transactional okay so when
we call this meta get questions it will
give you a list of questions like and
you will be calling this method from
your question controller so you can see
we got get questions here right and if
you are returning you are fetching the
questions from from this in fact I can
simply write this here itself so that
will not West the number of lines why do
we generally start this separately where
you can get the object when you call get
questions so I'm going that gate
question I'm printing those gate
question and also again that word get
questions I just hope it will work let's
run this let's see if he is working or
not so I will use a page okay I will go
back here and I will say get questions
dot HTM if I say enter ok I'm hoping for
the output here can you see that we got
all the questions now we got these
questions in a format on these format a
normally if you want to show the same
data on it on a page of course you have
to Eternity is you have to return a JSON
right again how to convert this into
Jason as a different thing but at least
we got the questions right we got all
the question for the database so if I if
I add a new question now so let me just
copy this link and we'll go back here
and we'll paste it here and you can see
if I add a new question now so it's a
question dot HTM and he will ask the
question I will say question ID 12 and
we say the question as my favorite actor
okay so my favorite actor answer would
be okay this doesn't look look like a
Java question right my favorite
technology that that makes sense okay so
I will say my favorite echnology is Java
my fav technology is AWS my favorite
technology is dotnet and you know the
answer that is it is not dotnet and okay
so next I will say Android okay and I
will say the answer is Java of course so
identify we are making to our project
and
a click on submit' you can see it is it
says submitted but then this page is not
greater yet let's go back and inside if
I say get questions you can see we've
got a new question here so that means it
is working so when you add a question
you can also fetch the question but if
we don't want a question in this format
here we want a question in a JSON format
so I want you people so I want you
people to try it first
again this once once we complete this
session we will deploy this project on
github for the the project and and do
some changes and make sure you return a
JSON okay okay so we got get questions
right now what we want is let's say you
want to give a test so what I want is a
giving hard push we got because here he
says I can understand what is going on
okay welcome because so okay if you are
new to this type of session if you are
new to this life-life coding which we
are doing here what you have to do is
okay what here to do is up before the
next session what I would recommend to
you is to go to my channel ok go to my
channel and search for okay first of all
you have to go to telescope we have we
have a tennis career and if you can go
to playlist okay you can see we have
pitted or played is called as a java web
development so go to this playlist and
watch this playlist first so these are
all recorded session with a good quality
you'll understand what is going on this
in this this live session so that you
can next time you can actually continue
so again after this session you will be
having the session PI as well okay
we got a question from Karthik do we use
Jason or Jackson so I would recommend
you to go for Jackson because we are
working with Spring Framework and they
have a good compatibility but in case if
Jackson is not working you can also go
for jisun that that's okay in fact my
whole project is is used I mean it is
using jisun so the project which is only
deployed now on the server it is using
jisun but I am planning to go for
Jackson this time I mean there was no
need of redesign this website but then I
thought I want to teach programming as
well I wanted to teach you how to make a
project that's why we are redesigning it
but then okay so let's let's use Jackson
now okay so let's get back here so what
I want now is if I go to my page and if
I the quest for test so if I call it
test dot HTM whatever what will happen
now a moment I call for test dot HTM it
should return only five questions
because get questions will return all
the questions right so get questions
will return all the questions I don't
want all the questions I just want five
questions and those five questions
should be random questions now how can
you get a random question well that's a
tricky part here so first of all let's
try to understand if you have if you
have so many questions and that's what
we do in actual project okay we don't
directly write up code first of all I
want a query to know what are the
questions you have to fire I mean I mean
what should be the query what should be
the query using which you will get only
five questions okay so let's try a query
there so what I will do is I will open
my query tool and it will save you not
view data but I want a query tool and in
this query tool whatever you do is I
will say okay I will say select star
from questions so if I select star some
question of course you will get the
entire papers right you can see in the
output window okay you can you can see
we got the entire table I don't want the
entire
table here so we don't want the entire
table so what I want here is I want to
have only the only five questions so
what you can do is okay what how can you
mention only five questions so we can
say order by Q ID this is one way and
order by Q ID and we can set a limit of
five Hrithik is walking I know I got
this constant you can see we got five
questions that's perfect we got five
questions the problem is we are getting
first five questions I don't want first
five questions I want I want random five
questions so we want random five
questions if you can see that deep sound
that is just a bomb in my office you
know it always beeps it's my AC which is
not working properly okay so how do we
get a random question so we have a query
which is order by random so we got a
function in impose rules now if you are
using a mask you'll the function name is
Rand but then if you are using of course
this will be the function is random so
from father's query now you can see
regard to random question this time this
is not the first five of first four
questions I signed up random five
questions right so this is the query
using which we get random five questions
again you can do this with Java as well
but then if you can do that in SQL was
bad in that right so if every time I run
this query you can see we'll be waiting
random five questions simple and that's
why your SQL you should also have SQL
knowledge so if you don't have a SQL
knowledge this you will find difficult
when you make a project so point to
remember you need to learn the language
you need to learn these software
engineering skills you need to learn
about databases you need to learn about
SQL and that's what will make you a good
programmer okay knowing everything in
Java that will not make you a good
programmer
right you just have to learn the
different things as well
okay so okay so we got this random
questions here so now what
next we'll fire this query using okay so
let's go back to the code what I want
here is I want to create a method with
say public showing I will say yes the
method name will be the best I can with
it's not compulsory to use batch method
you can use any method name so this
method need to be called when you
request for so it's a request mapping
for test our test um so whenever I use a
call but resinous clear we will return
we will return a test questions okay
okay so we got these questions now how
do we fetch a question so of course we
will be doing the same thing right we
will fetch list of questions and we will
print those questions will return those
questions let's copy this and let's
paste it here
the only thing which will change is
Ashura fetching get questions I will say
get test questions because we don't want
all the questions here we want on it
those questions which is test questions
only five questions right and you can
see we don't have that method in my
question doubt so whatever you do here
is I will click on this and I will say
change now create a method let's get
test question so I got this method in
fact a maximum time we always do copy
and paste in right that's how software
element is in fact well there are lots
of codes available on Google if you want
to do something just go to google and
search for the code what is a value
equal so what makes you a good
programmer is and anyone can copy the
copy the code and paste the code white
the difficult part is from going to copy
and from where - from I mean going to
paste that is those two these students
are important to you all right
okay if you just join a session or make
sure you like the video so that I will
know that you are new to this code okay
perfecto so okay so we have to use some
annotations here so the first audition
we have to use is a great transactional
record this annotation when we have to
get object of session factory we need
this we need a query as well okay we'll
just do that query later so we got the
session object will also return the
least the problem here is we will return
it is just not the issue right the
problem here is when you have when you
want to fetch a question by firing this
query if you can see the query we have
it on here this is my query the problem
is till this point we were using
hibernate queries right we were using
hql so if you can see in my code I am
just returning for from question this is
not a SQL query this is a hql query so
this is not this is not SQL it is hql
SQL stands for structured query language
and hql stands for hibernate query
language so in hibernate we do not
specify select okay we say we use select
only when you want to go for a selected
row selected columns but now for five
questions I want to use SQL query right
because I don't know what will be the
hql for the random function so what can
be done now so can be use SQL query in
hibernate and this is possible we can do
that with the help of native queries we
can say let you query and it will
mention we need to query well with the
help of questions okay so in the NICU
query so the way in hibernate we use
queries in so forth when you when you
want to use as a hql be use query when
you want to use SQL we use native
queries okay
a question from Rana yes piranha all the
videos are available on YouTube channel
so in fact I have a good credit or good
quality videos that so if you go to
Canon and search for this bridge called
as Java web development so go to this
co-learning and search for Java
development you will see those last four
sessions the actual practical session
okay so when we use SQL we use native
queries now in this video query I will
use a query equal to okay first of all
you have to input the package I care so
it's a control space and okay that's the
package done with the package now I want
to fire the credit so how do you find a
query so it says session dot
so we how to get out SQL query so for
normal whatever you say create query and
for native query we have to say create
new tube queries so we say create hit
you query and we'll fire the query here
so the query here is select star from
question order by random and okay it's
just random and we say limit to five
when you get only five questions here
okay now how do you fire an IQ party
because it is easy to file a s q h q ID
you can simply say Q dot paste
what's here so if I say Q dot least oh
we have to also specify the type of
values right so I give a comma I will
say the data I want I'm expecting is in
a question format so once a question
with plots and he always say least do
not list
I hope or not Q dot lesion should be
quiet or things because I'm afraid to
the orbitals query and this at least if
I go to this least it will return me the
Z star value so that's perfect I can use
a digital values there so I will say
this will return me unleashed of oceans
the same way we have done before
so a tell me a list of questions I just
have written that list
in this format why so it's return
questions that sounds good to be will be
getting only five question this time
when you verify this query okay so let's
go back in the question controller
everything seems good it should work now
right so when I call for tests or
Astrium it this should work okay I have
not read in the server right leg run as
a non server okay by the time you've got
a question from Sanjay Sanjay we do this
at 5:00 p.m. in weekdays so the next
session would be on maybe Monday or
Tuesday I will try to take see I'm in
fact I will try to take the session and
tomorrow as well but let's see how it
goes because weekends are bit hectic for
me let's see if I get a time for
tomorrow as well I will update you two
or three hours before the session so
just stay updated on the channel so I
try to join our Facebook group so we
already have a Facebook group on
Facebook called as the Disco line
project tried to be a member of that
project a member of that group you will
get the updates and the timing is 5 p.m.
ist so if you are living at different
time zone
so just to convert your time zone into
ist okay so I will say okay get the
other side test dot HTM now so if I
select s dot HTM hope to get any
questions hope to 35 questions come on
give me five questions okay it's not
returning my page oh we have we forgot
to mention the response body right so it
spawns body because if you don't mention
response body it will search for the
page so you can see if I don't mention
response body it is searching for a page
called as whatever whatever data you
return they just searching for that page
I don't want to do that
okay oh that's great people are watching
from UK as well
okay so regard one what a very Karthik
will are you from I guess you are from
Australia on I hope I'm getting it
guessing it right
Sanjay is from UK so I'm running this
code and you can see that we got five
questions is it five question to finish
verify so we got question ID one then we
got question ID 4 then we got question
ID 9 so we got three questions we power
fourth question in regards fifth
question yes we got five questions and
these questions are coming in trying
them okay from Karthik is from new
tonight oh that's great awesome place to
live well says I'm from Delhi that's
great where's at least we're in the same
time zone
okay so that every time I've ever done a
call this page it is giving me a
different values so that means if you if
you make a test system now every time we
will get a different values right so
this is what we wanted okay and when
kitase you are from Singapore that's
great
got a question from written code Paul
this is Java yes this code looks like
Java okay but this is not a non-normal
kochava this is Spring Framework so if
you see something new you will this is
spring plain work okay because the
written consents great okay
again trona I can I can guess that from
your name Kalle yeah so that's good oh
okay
no one from Marcia anyway we all are
idiots right so okay okay so we got the
test model right so we got the questions
we got five questions that was the next
thing now let's say we got this five
questions okay what things you have to
do is record this five question okay and
now if I if I let's say if I submitting
answers now so now the following which
in which I will separate account source
is in adjacent format void so that Jason
format will have a question ID example
you can see I'm also printing the I'm
also printing the answer as well we
don't have to do that you can see we are
getting answers as well regard the
answer as pure Java language we don't
want to print answers can we scan be
skip that can we skip the answer yes we
can do that if I go to my questions to
RJ's a in the to shrink method if I
remove the answer part I will not get
the answer right we will not get the
answer on the page okay the point here
is if I submit the answers the submit
answer would be so when you submit you
have to submit the question ID and the
answer so that I can verify that on the
server does that make sense everyone
you
okay so once you say such a virtuous a
question submit then I mean when you
once you say question ID and answer then
the question will be verify on this
server but then how to do that how can
you verify it on a server again that
we'll be discussing in the next session
okay so once the session gets over I
will upload this project on github just
fetch the project do some changes and if
you can just help me with the design
can you just your future can you just
help me with the coding part as well if
you think we have a better way of
fetching the questions if you have a
better way of writing the questions that
just let me know I will be very happy to
make those changes okay and if you have
some notes if you are working for a
company and if you think that you are I
mean you I mean in your company if you
are using something new if you want to
share with this with other people that's
that's the whole idea here right we want
to share I mean whatever see the problem
here is in industry and in colleges we
have two different syllabus right in
colleges we have our very own syllabus
and Industry we are using new
technologies so the idea of this live
session is just to merge that gap of
colleges and Industry so if you are
working for a company and if you think
you are using something new just let us
know we'll try to embed that in a
project as well and okay and also and if
you want to suggest you know you can
send a mail on that is code tweeting so
it is Co like project this kaleipus it
at gmail.com and we will be happy to
listen to your feedbacks so we are
that's it from this session I hope you
liking this session do click on the like
button and do share the video with your
friends and if you're not not a
subscriber of course you wanna subscribe
all right that's where you are watching
this video so let me just grow let me
help
help me with going this channel so that
this so let me stop the recording here
and we'll goes we'll go for some
questions that we have five minutes so
we'll go for some questions here
let me hide my screen okay so okay so we
got a point from Karthik a
one-possession useage X so again Karthik
I am NOT good with design so if you can
help it with this so if you can design a
page in such a way that it will send
Ajax requests on the server I would love
to do that
okay fares and fair says what is service
and repository so normally whenever you
make when you when you make a dowel
layer so instead of our layer we have we
use added component by to let me share
my screen once again so wastage is that
every project okay so only down layer
what we are using here is weighs it out
there is the question it is here itself
so you can see I'm using edited
component right so instead of fusing
added component we should be using
repository so whenever you interact with
the database whenever you work with any
any service we use at repository now
again add repository and add component
are almost same it's just that they have
a different life cycle right so for
database we should always you deposit we
sometime for the controller see for
controllers we use at a rate controller
right we can also so it is also a
component the same which is working the
same way as component or the difference
is controller can take request
repository is used for databases if you
have something like service class let's
say if you have a class which will do
some processing we will use at a rate
service on that we can also use added
component but then to make it much
better we can also use at a rate service
okay now we've got a question from pro
now how can we get this code from github
so once I upload this budget on github
what you can do is be a part of the
project be a part of the Facebook group
because in facebook dope I will be
sharing the link I don't know if you are
part of the Facebook group so search so
go to Facebook and search for the disco
life project and that's how we do it
okay thank you I project and join the
okay we got a question from a retain
Kurd a is prologue worth to learn I
don't have much idea on prologue so I
can't say anything about that but then
nothing something is always a birthright
is depend upon how much you want to get
get into that okay so if you have to get
more updates just be a part of the
Facebook group also like the page on my
facebook so where you will find that
page so if you go to Facebook I just
hope when I go to files Facebook it will
not show some weird thing it is very
good figure you know it is way it's
actually very risky to share the
Facebook profile on on life well then
that's fine okay if I go to just search
for that is Oh learnings well this is
the page okay so like this page to get
to get the updates so you be meeting all
gets on this page love the Facebook
group okay the next question which is
which one is good hibernate or spring
both why because for database we use
hibernate and for flow we use plain so
what are good both are important okay
what is the disco okay the disco you can
take into two ways or you can divide
this one into two words tell and Cusco
okay this is of course if this in Hindi
it means say I mean share it tell it was
Co means share it right house kobata
something like that okay and it's
actually a Telugu what if you want to go
for the actual origin of wait a sec I'll
go what which means get to know ya which
also means know it so can take your
Telugu I was not trying that that's
great so the reason of this word is from
Telugu since I'm a South Indian I am a
Telugu so I don't understand much of 34
but then some of that which is
one of the words is the disco and
normally what people do is they take
Greek terms because using English term
for the website is actually not that
good because it will not it will not
make your what you say the search engine
will not make it that good so people he
was Greek terms and all those things so
i thought why to go forward a foreign
language when you can go for Indian
languages I'm going for 10 put Telugu
language which is that is core it's
unique okay so next question
so saying which is easy and useful I I
mean both are easy okay if you can watch
my videos both are easy actually because
I have taken it down so I would suggest
you to go for hibernate first and then
go for spring okay when could say is Oh
cutting of the mill that's good when
today's say is a which web service is
good rest rest is best that she's better
that's a rhyming thing that's good
okay the noun sit down we are we are end
of the timing
the session if you like this session do
click on the like button and do share
this with your friends I'm hoping that
you will share this video a link on your
Facebook profile
ok first we'll think about that I am NOT
that with with unstructured data but
we'll try so that's it thank you so much
for watching and see you in the next
session I will update you on the
Facebook group all on my page time up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
