different eyes for landings and I am
getting this question from a long time
why I call you an alien in fact if you
see my comments there are some people
they say okay he is calling us alien
that's fine
there are some people they get angry how
can I call them an alien I'll be an
alien No right we are humans the thing
is you know in fact I have mentioned
this in one of my video way back but
then this part was a part of a big
bigger video so maybe lots of people not
have not seen that video and they don't
know why I call you alien so I thought
okay since I'm calling you alien in
every video such as mentions mention
this thing why I call you alien and why
why I feel that all this all the
software industry people they are aliens
so the thing is what I believe is when
you talk about the IT world and when you
talk about the normal what we are you
graduating in two different worlds right
so as physically we are humans right so
we believe in real world right we eat we
consume we consume knowledge around us
or we talk to people you know we go out
to Gardens we go to different places
right so in real world we live in real
world right as a human you live in real
world but the moment you come to the IT
industry when you talk about software's
we talk about database we talk about all
these terms like Big Data have you can
can you can you touch all those things
can you feel those things no right in
fact you know when I say cloud the only
thing which comes to our mind is that
cloud where you have from where you will
get ray of water rains and all those
things right the cloud which can give
you a shade from sun that the thing is
in ID boyle clouded be different right
when you talk about servers when you
talk about limo service we say clouds
right so can we touch can we see this
flower yes we can can we see real clouds
yes can we see what your clouds know
right so somewhere we are living in two
different worlds we have a real world
and we have a virtual world so as she
once you are living in real world but
the moment you talk about virtual world
right this is totally different and who
is walking on this virtual world as
humans we consume virtual world wide we
use whatsapp we use Facebook so we are
consuming it but who is make who is
creating it right so this IT
professional they are making all this
different world right so unlike a
professional I have a part of this void
of or which
called as a virtual world right and when
you live in that world
not physically but mentally when you
live in that world you're not your
normal is human right because yes
physically you are an human when you are
at home you are an human but the moment
you work on project when you watch my
video when you when you are working on a
code or something you are not an human
you are an alien because you are living
in virtual world now the difference
between human and alien way the both are
I mean as a programmer you can get human
you can be up you can be a lien right
the thing is as a programmer you cannot
think in real life you have to always
imagine the virtual world I mean
thinking about the solutions whatever
you build I mean think about Oberer
think about Ola app think about
Microsoft Windows all these thanks works
in virtual world and you have to be in
that world if you want to solve a given
problem you have to think in that world
if you want if you are getting some bugs
you have to think in that but because
both is something you cannot see right
you have to just feel I mean there will
be a code which is running and then
something goes wrong you have to imagine
what's wrong right you kind of like want
even see what is wrong there right so
you have to be in that void and to be
there and to be best at it you have to
think like an alien and that's why I say
you people are not humans you people
call me at least our alien so next time
whenever you are an alien or welcome
back
aliens that simply means that we are
talking about the virtual world not real
world I will make sure that when I don't
make a programming video if I don't make
a normal video if I make if I'm making a
normal video for the channel I will I
will refer you as humans otherwise I
would refer you as alien so don't get
angry on that we all are we have to
understand that terminology right and if
you don't like that word that's fine
with the moment I say welcome back you
can just close your ears and say okay
that that loot that part and you can
continue so I hope this video was
helpful in fact I'm trying to commit all
the I'm coming I'm trying to comment or
reply all the comments which has why you
are calling an alien so let's see how it
goes so thank you so much guys and see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
