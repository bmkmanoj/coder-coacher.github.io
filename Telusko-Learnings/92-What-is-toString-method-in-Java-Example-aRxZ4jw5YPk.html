string method in Java not exact two
string means let's say I have a class
and it will name this class a student in
this class let me have two variables
will have a roll number and will have a
string method which a string variable
which is s name okay so I have a whole
number and s name so lot number is in
10s name in string when you find a main
function here and in this let me create
object of student
okay so we'll say student s1 equal to
new student okay and let me just create
a constructor so that I can assign the
values so when I create the object which
is s1 at that instance this value this
value should get some this variable
should get some value so what I mean by
that is let's say I have a constructor
student which accepts two or two
variable string s name and then we can
assign value so this roll number will go
here and this s name will go here so
instead of typing the constructor by
yourself we can take the help of
NetBeans so what you can simply do is
you can say enter alt insert when you
say alt insert it will give you this
option or you can just simply say right
click insert code and in this we have a
constructor option here in this
constructor i mentioned i want to go
with this two parameters generate so
that you can will you will get a
constructor with these two parameters so
that you can assign this value here and
this value here that means we have to
send value so we'll say values is let's
say 11 the number is 11 and the name we
are sending here is let's end up in okay
and once I done with that let me just
print the output now how to print output
is we can simply say s1 dot roll number
now this will print a roll number and
then s1 dot s name so here we are
assigned the assigning the values and
then
here we are fetching the values and
printing so if I'm this code now the
output you are getting is 11 and living
startup 11 and I win right but let's say
instead of painting I don't want to put
in individual values I just want to say
put into s1 I want to put in an object
which is s1 now you can see there is no
error unfortunately this is an object
right or this is a reference and you are
trying to print or reference and the
output we are expecting here is it
should print the values of s 1 variables
so s1 has roll numbers 1 has s name so
it should print the values right and
when I run this the output will be
viewed and the output is this now we can
get something this is our package name
ok this is our class name and what's
that let's see what is this term now
first understand what happens when you
try to print a reference now in Java
every class let's say student this will
extend a class colors object so this
indirectly extends a class called as
object so every class in java extends
object class that means this when you
try to print our object it will call a
method call as to string by default it
will call them with a color to string
then you will say in our class we don't
have any method palette to string right
but since the property of inheritance
this to string method belongs to this
object class so if I go to this two
string just press ctrl and click you can
say this two string method belongs to
which class it is object class right and
see what we are printing we are printing
get class dot get name which means it
will play it will get the name of the
class with the package name and then it
will fetch the hash code not exactly
high score means whenever you create
object in Java it will go into a a
virtual box or some some type of memory
and and you can say box and that box
will have our value in that box you can
have multiple objects
and each box will have a unique value or
unique code discuss hash code okay and
then that high school group in binary
format you want in hexadecimal format so
via writing this to exhaust string that
means the output we got is because of
this two string method right is because
we are you taking this thing what if
instead of returning this thing what if
I return that means let me over I get
method how to override where to say
public the signature string to string
and now so we are we are overwriting
this right so you can see we are getting
a notification that you are overriding
this method which comes from object
class so we can even write or override
annotation which is not compulsory but
it's better to write so it's not
compulsory so in this we will not write
this so we have public string to string
and what we're going to return is let's
say I will return roll number in then
plus then in double quotes plus and then
we'll print s name so what it will print
is it will return or roll number colon
name
so as ol number is 11 and name is Naveen
right if I run this now we don't want
this because this is a by default and
yd4 it will call to string method so we
don't have to write it that means if you
look if you try to print s 1 it will
call to string method and I 4 on this
see the output is 11 and I mean we are
printing the same thing it's s 1 but
this time instead of calling object
class to string it's going for
overriding in this we are calling our
own method which is to string right now
see the output you are getting is 11 and
now in right but it should be proper
right it should print roll number is 11
and s name is no V issue of that what we
can do is we can simply remove this and
we will ask that means to give you that
so right like insert code click on to
string for both the variables and
generate you can see Java itself gives
you a return which is student roll
number equal to this
then we call it this and if I run this
the output will be much better than the
last output is a student class object
rule number is Lebanese name is Naveen
right so that means when in Java when
you try to print the object it will call
the to string method if your class don't
have to shrink method it will it will
jump to object class to string and
that's it this is this is how we use to
string thanks for watching and do
