20 from that is for learnings and today
I'm going to talk about a controversial
topic maybe I don't know this function
controversial or not the topic is what's
wrong with IT colleges now one taking
this on why I'm making this video is
because you know from a long time in
fact from last three to four months I'm
getting lots of call or SMS or whatsapp
from my from an earlier students of
college you know they they always ask me
in fact from last four months they are
going for the interviews and they're not
able to crank those interviews so when
they ask me for tips how to correct the
interview how to give the answers so
they're not able to give proper answers
right in fact they are not able to crack
the coding test they are not able to
answer those very technical questions
what's what's going wrong here so there
are I mean there are some people there
are some students which I mean they're
not able to answer but sometime I feel
you know there's there's something wrong
with the IT education because the see
why we why we teach to students so that
they can they can get a job right that's
the first thing if you're if you're not
teaching student the way they should
learn and they are not able to correct
the interview there's something wrong
with the system itself right so and
everybody knows right what's wrong but I
just want to reiterate those those
things I just want to make sure that you
know what is wrong so that we will we'll
try to solve it so when you when you
know that there's something wrong then
only you can solve it right in fact
everyone knows that say there's
something wrong I just have some take
out some points here I know this is the
first time I don't normally refer to
books our two returning points but for
the first time I've written some points
here so that you know it will be helpful
for me to take up those points so
there's something wrong and that's
something wrong I have written here so
we'll first talk about what is the
problem and then we'll I will try to put
some points I mean some solutions for
that maybe that solution will not work I
mean it may be there that those those
solutions will not be implemented
because I cannot change the entire India
right so what you can do is you can
share this video more so that maybe this
video will reach to the your Chancellor
of your University and they may they may
try to improve
those things so let started the first
one what's wrong
the first thing is the syllabus I know
the syllabus was designed in 2000 so
year 2000 in fact the IT service which
we have four BS AIT four basic arm
science for BCA it was designed in year
2000 and at that time the technologies
were there and so we were we were - we
know they created this lab us based on
those technologies example all those
things which was which which were there
at that time if we talk about the other
fields example physics chemistry you
know they in that also the B we get some
new technologies but did those new
technologies are only 30% of be rated
right example so last form last 20 years
I feel only 20% of physics syllabus
might might I believe change but what
about IT we RIT is changing every month
right every month or every six months we
get some new things the problem is the
technology is changing very fast but
syllabus is still same you are still
adding the syllabus of year 2000 maybe
there might be some new changes we have
a Python we have PHP we have some new
things in in yours in your curriculum
but that's not enough right
so syllabus is not that perfect second
the depth of this rabis when you expect
that your students should know about OS
they should know about OS they should
know about programming they should know
about algorithms VV people only focus on
programming any programming is just a
part of software industry right there
lots of other stuff you should know if
we if you ask any person who have
graduated from the college they will
know that they know one of the
programming language maybe they're a fan
of Java they would they're a fan of
dotnet their fan of Python but what
about the other concepts to make a
software you should also know about
software engineering you should know
about data structures you should know
about this OS and no one knows about it
because the only way they learn is
because to crack the exam so they learn
os they learn the complete OS just to
protect the exam and after six months
they don't remember anything was the use
of that subject then
so Serapis is not that perfect and the
depth of it second the attitude of
teachers and students in fact the
college administration education is
to be part I mean so him you know I what
I feel about education is something like
you you get a you get a brain okay which
is not technical in those three years
you have to make sure that that brain
becomes technical so that they can work
in anti industry but what we do we don't
just make that technical we don't make
it technical but we we we try to insert
all the topics which are not required I
mean it is everything is required but
the way it should work right example if
you want to drink a tea so you have to
make a tea first right so you have to
put all those things and then you have
to you know the procedure for to making
a tea right but will you do with that
thing you will you will first drink
water then you will eat those tea powder
or then you will eat sugar and then you
will drink hot milk
it doesn't work that way right so you
should know how to teach I mean the
students should know how to learn stuff
they're learning stuff just because they
want to crack the exam that's it and
that's not helpful right second the
attitude of teachers they are teaching
because they're getting paid and they're
not even excited maybe that there are
different reasons why teachers are not
excited these days because those days
are you know those golden days where
teacher used to teach properly but
nowadays what is happening is you know
teachers are not getting motivated of
course I cannot link teachers here is
just that they are not motivated the
reason why they are not motivated is
because the multiple reason first
students write this the way see if I am
a teacher when I go to a classroom I
want my students to be active you know I
want them to learn new things exam if
they are not excited about the subject
what I will do now right I mean if if
they are giving me proper response and I
would like to put up new points but if
they are sitting like this dull faces
all those weird faces in fact I always
tell my students you know if you are
getting some stuff do you mean strength
feedback if you're understanding things
say it like this if you're not getting
the points you know you can do some of
your expression you don't give me that
look you know normally when when when
Tate when a teacher teachers to your
students and they're like I mean how
would we know that you are getting the
point or not you have to change this
attitude you are a student and you are
there for learning
okay not to crack exams so the first
thing which demotivates teachers is the
way student behave second this salary
I mean example all the teachers are
required to be masters right master of
IT MCA so you're expecting that teacher
should be sure that I've done MCA or MS
CIT so if let's say if I have done MCA
and then I have to choice now either I
can go to colleges for teaching I can
either go I can go to industry for
working if I'm going to industry I can
get a package of fifty thousand rupees
per month right but if I'm going to
college is same the same College which I
mean they gave me twenty thousand rupees
I mean come on yeah you're expecting
that you need are good teachers and
you're not paying them good amount how
teachers are getting get motivated
because I mean for this and the thing is
people who don't get job in industry
then they become teacher and they they
they they are not able to teach it
because they don't know stuff that's the
time there are lots of thing which is
wrong with the with the teaching staff
in the qualities are not teaching
everyone is like that but there are you
know right what I'm talking about so
there are some problem with the attitude
in teachers also so when to change that
our next problem is industrial visit you
know you always say that B people go to
Shimla Manali for the IV's is it is it
IV when you say IV what it means you're
going to the actual industry to check it
out how they work example you are going
to Bangalore to understand how companies
work how Flipkart works you are going to
Hyderabad to know how Google works that
is something was IV right what you do
you go to you go to Shimla to enjoy your
picnic that's not IV right again you I'm
not saying don't go to this places I'm
just saying that don't spoil the term
well as IB you're going for and I shall
visit to Shimla and that's that will not
help in your career I'm not saying don't
enjoy okay you can go you can go Shimla
you can do all the stuff but don't spoil
the name IV next industrial expert you
know every college I feel they should
call industry expert on maybe not expert
industry people who are working industry
every week at least one session should
be there in every week or every - I mean
once in once
two weeks it will be helpful and
students you have to you know you have
to you have to understand that these
people they're expert and maybe not
everyone is able to convey the ideas but
you have to understand that they are
there to help you right so you have to
make sure that you get most of the most
of it so this is a request for colleges
please call industry expert industry or
trainers and the last problem I have is
the way of teaching in a thing the thing
is 20 years back and or maybe 10 years
back if you say you want to learn
something so you have to go to colleges
and you have to learn but nowadays we
have lots of online courses in fact if
you want to learn Java you can you know
you know right I'm Emma you to have my
own videos so you can learn the complete
Java from my videos right you can learn
anything what you want from online from
Coursera from MOOCs from there are lots
of we have Khan Academy we have telesco
learnings we have we have lots of
China's whites on so you can learn
everything from there then by banette
colleges the thing is in colleges I feel
as a teacher you should have teaching
instead of teaching everything and
boring those students because see it's
not possible to complete complete job
I'm to cover complete Java to cover the
complete syllabus of Java in 40 hours
and then colleges are expected to do
that so what I would suggest is students
should learn from online courses and in
the lecture the teachers job should be
to motivate them okay because if you can
motivate people and that's that's very
important right if you can motivate
people they will learn from themselves
because even if you are talking for two
hours and if you are teaching very well
I mean you're you're thinking that
you're teaching very well but if they
are not focusing it because they are not
motivated what's the use of it
you are wasting two hours of your life
plus your students like so I feel as a
teacher our first responsibility is to
motivate people in fact what I do when I
go for training is I motivate them for
first 15 to 20 minutes I try to motivate
those people so that they will
understand what I'm talking about okay
it's like this is not my mantra I'm not
a Baba here to tell all this thing is
just that
you know I always do this search how can
we improve our way of teaching so I go
to different websites I go to divide
three different articles the best way of
teaching and I normally follows you know
where there are lots of videos on
YouTube about how Stanford University
teaches how MIT teaches their students
so I try to follow those concepts and
they are amazing people you know the way
that teach is amazing so if you can just
put those things because the instead of
teaching they motivate people they they
tell a story around the concepts and
then it goes into the students brain
right so that's very important so so
let's try to sort of the negative points
they started let's try to solve the
issue first syllabus how can we solve
this rabbit issue see first of all we
cannot change syllabus every year right
so what we can do now is fish of
changing syllabus every year let's
change the syllabus every three to five
years not every year I know that's not
possible
but at least three to five years then
question arise if I put a new technology
in the in the course let's say if I we
are introducing big data into course or
in the coil syllabus who will teach it
because not every teacher knows about
Big Data right so what we can do is we
can call industry expert and all the
colleges they can come together to form
a union and then this industry people
they will teach to teachers this is like
train the trainer's right so they will
teach the teachers what is that concept
and then teacher can teach into the
colleges now using this we can upgrade
this skill of students plus the teachers
okay that's what we can do so we can
change the là-bas every three to five
years that's one second even if even if
it is there is a concept not in syllabus
as a student it is your responsibility
to learn it I mean this note there is
nothing which is which is stopping you
right to not learn that not that
constant example when I wanted to learn
Scala there is no Institute in Mumbai or
to teach Scala I don't know if there is
an institute what I did I went to
different books this is one of the book
I am referring for Scala now right so if
you want to learn something there is no
stopping right you can you can go to
YouTube you can watch some Scala videos
you can buy this book read this book you
will learn Scala no one is stopping you
right so
you think there's you need something
which is not in your syllabus you can
learn it by yourself
second we have talked about your
attitude let's talk about industry
expert please call industry expert in
your colleges because that will be very
helpful in fact it will help students
because they will get motivated second
as a college you will understand that
what else they need in industry when I
go to different companies what I know I
mean I know what is what they are they
require there because I am a trainer
with right in in different companies so
when I go then I know what is their
curriculum what the students are
expected to know example let's say if I
talk about JavaScript now people are
learning JavaScript in colleges and in
the industry they are using angularjs
they are using means tag I mean there's
no mention of this this topic in the
college syllabus right so even if you
are going for a company and then your
company is training you on those things
you should be well you should be knowing
at this there's a concept called as
there's a concept called as mean stack
and angularjs so call industry expert it
will helpful and when you say industrial
visit make sure that industrial visit is
actually industrial visit not a picnic
and that we have to change the way of
teaching please read some articles on on
education so that's about my thoughts
about what's wrong the ID colleges if
you have something with you because see
if you can solve this problem we can
actually fill up the gap between the
industry and the college education
because in industry there are lots of
vacancies right there are approximately
two like McKinsey is only for
programmers and we have lots of people
that are unemployed
the thing is industry need industry
don't need people they need skill the
people and they are not skillful right
so if we can change our policy the way
our college works
maybe we can we can accommodate more
people in the India in the industry so
yeah so if you have more suggestions you
can come in to in the comment section
and do share so that this will be this
video reaches to your college
administration or the your university
administration and they might do
something about it
so yeah that's it thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
