ready from the Lascar learnings and now
we talk about factory design pattern so
faculties and pattern belongs to create
store design pattern which is which
belongs to design patterns in Java so in
this video we'll talk about one of the
example which which is rated to OS on
phones
so now let's imagine so let's say you
you you want an OS in your phone so
depend upon your phone you'll be having
different OS right so let's say if you
are using Apple phone you will be having
iOS if you're using Samsung phone or HTC
phone will be having Android if you are
using a Nokia phone you'll be having
Windows OS right so we have different
different phones and we have different
different OS right so there are some
people who know I bought the OS and then
there are some people they don't know
about OS they are not concerned about OS
what they want is a phone right so there
are people who use Lumia for them
doesn't matter which OS they are working
on they what they want or they want a
phone to use then there are I phone
people it doesn't matter which of I was
there which OS they use they want an
phone right so some people are not
concerned about the OS they are only
concerned about the phone right so now
let's say you want a noise in your phone
so you are building a new phone by
yourself let's say you are building it
as very 5 Raspberry Pi phone and you
want us on that now depend upon which
what type of O's you want to go for
maybe you want a open source or so you
will be going for Android if you want a
closed source OS will be going for iOS
and if you want some weird OS you will
going for Windows right so we have
depend upon your requirement will be
having different different types of OS
right so let's say you you have a main
method and in that paint method what you
want an object of OS now so in B Holaday
interface which is OS and this OS
interface will be implemented by Android
OS iOS and Windows OS so this all this
classes implements a OS there now so if
you want to create object of any of this
you just have to mention I want open
source OS so automatically it will give
you the object of Android phone Android
OS if you want us which is closed source
you will get automatically we will get
object of iOS right so somebody else is
providing you that object and that
somebody else is your
three okay now because we talked about
software development or software
development lifecycle or software
engineering whenever you build a project
so you have to work with different
modules right and all this module should
have low coupling and high question so
you if you want to achieve this low
coupling we use something less factory
here so you show of you creating this
object ask someone else to create you
this object so maybe in future you'll be
having a new OS so let's say you have a
OS maybe I don't know maybe Symbian it's
a world alright let's say you have Cindy
and one more so you have one more class
there so as a normal user you are not
concerned about which oh so you want you
just say I want old oils they will give
your object of Symbian yeah but on point
so maybe in future if that simply
replaced by BlackBerry OS you don't know
about anything right you just you just
have to specify old OS Automator you
will get Blackberry object who is giving
those objects it is your factory and how
to implement all this things that will
say in the practical size</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
