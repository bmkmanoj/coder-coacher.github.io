about JDBC in which we have tried to
fetch data from the database right so in
this video we'll try to implement the
the where clause or we'll try to fetch
one value with the we have done that
right so we have tried to fetch this one
way let's let's try to fetch all the
values so instead of fetching only one
value we'll we'll say I want to print
all the values so let me just write the
query in Maskell first without any where
clause and if I say it's the next star
from student it will give me whole table
right so we have one which is Rani -
Naveen and three Mahesh right so now
we'll try to print this data using Java
for that we have to execute up query
which is select star from students
without any where clause and now when
you try to execute this query you will
get the whole table right so inside this
RS you don't have one column or one row
now you have two rows also you have two
columns and 3 rows right and so let's
try to print this so let's say if I say
R is dot next if you are saying R this
dot get string it will give you the
second column right because it is
username here let's let let us write the
number so if I say RS dot get string 1
now this time it will give you the first
column which is user ID which is int
whether we so let's instead of writing
getstring we can also write get int
which will give you the integer value we
also won't want to print okay let's
let's say this is not name now this is a
user data and which will be having both
the things we have user we we have user
ID will give a colon between and will
try to print the username which is
getstring and this you have to mention
the second column which is to write and
here I will try to plant user data so
what I am doing so I am just finding a
query which is our select star from
student which will face the whole table
and if I run this query you can see we
are getting the first row which is one
Ronnie but what if you want to get the
second row now for the second row we
have we have to
say RS dot next because it will shift
your pointer to the next row okay and
again you have to say I this dot next it
will it will switch your point of view
the third row here and to do that just
repeat this statement so let's say copy
this and paste it here okay we don't
have to declare this once again because
we have divided agreeing it once right
or what we can do we can declare it here
with say string user data initially it
will be blank okay and then then you do
not have to declare it once again right
yeah so now if you have three rows so
you have to write this stuff three times
if I run this code you can see we are
getting two rows now so we got one
Ronnie - Naveen and if you repeat the
same line now same three lines once
again and if I try to run this you can
see we got three rows right so that's
how you to fetch data from the database
by writing others dot next every time
but hold on how many times we will write
this I should of this what we can do is
we can use a while loop here so we can
say a while loop and no need to mention
okay and you can write this as dot next
as a condition because I just not our is
dot next we'll do two things for you
because we don't have any method call as
RS with that we don't have any method
College has next wide which is there in
the connection API so we need to say
next does the method we have to use for
the next record so I just dot next we'll
do two things it will shift your pointer
to the next row and it will also give
you the return it will also return you
do we have the other row there if you
have other rows or the next row it will
it will return true otherwise it will
return false and if on this code we got
the same stuff which is one Ronnie -
Naveen and three Mahesh right so that's
how you fetch the whole table but let's
say now the next thing we want is we do
not want to fetch data we want to insert
data in your database okay so yeah that
will do in the next video so in this
video we have talked about how to fetch
the whole table using JDBC so in the
next video we'll talk about how to
insert values into database
