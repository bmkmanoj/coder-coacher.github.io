some design pattern for this example I'm
using mask you'll sew over 5.1 you can
install any database server you can use
SQL Server you can use Oracle you can
use ms axis or you can use mask you and
your any latest version so let's create
our database first we'll say Oh in fact
I have a database with my name so we'll
use that database so we'll say use now
in now means the database name here and
then in that database let me create a
table so we'll say create table and
we'll say student and this will have two
variables we'll say our two columns will
say a roll number type int and we say
size is five and we'll say s name it
should be back add and the size of Vaca
will be 25 now let's insert some values
so we say insert into student values
we'll say value is 1 I will say value of
11 and we'll say not name is Rahul so we
have roll number 11 as Rahul so inserted
there strike so we'll say select star
from student right so you can see we
have at all number 11 and s name as
Rahul
now what we'll do is we'll insert some
more values we'll say 12 and ensure of
Rahul will say Ganesh and say 30 oh this
is 13 say shut up so we have three rows
will say select star from shouldn't we
have this three names
okay now what we'll do is we'll go to
our Java code now our main task is from
your java code you have to you want to
fetch name of let's say you want a name
of goal number 12 that means you need
Ganesh so what we can do is here we'll
we'll say I want our student will say
name is s1
I don't know I don't know his name I
want to get his name I what I know is
rule number so what I can simply do is I
can say get name in Blackgate for rule
number 12
isn't it if you write this statement you
will get s name and you can simply say s
out well and then we say SS 1 dot get
name or this one so s 1 dot will say s
name right now the problem is we don't
have met this method called as get name
so what we can do is again before going
for before coming to this video I will
recommend you watch my JDBC basics video
so that you will understand what I am
doing here so we don't have a method
called let's get name here right so we
have to define that
so we'll define that method somewhere in
this class we'll say class student D a
oh now what Dao stands here is data
access object and this D a o will have a
method called as public string our
public student because it will return on
your student and method name will be get
name or what we'll do is we simply say
get student with on roll number 12 so if
I get student roll number 12 and it will
be get student and this we are passing a
variable we say roll number simple and
we'll say return we go and here we'll
say student as equal to a new student
and then we can simply return s oh but
hold on we don't have a class was 2002
so this will create a class called as
student so it's a class student again
you can create all these classes
independent file also again in this
class will have two things when his roll
number and second a string s name okay
so we have a class student with two
variables as two variables roll number s
name and here I am returning a student
object but I don't want to return a
blank student I want to return our
student with roll number and name
not the dole number shouldn't I know
this roll number is equal to roll number
so this s roll number here is this roll
number here okay and here I want to call
this with a student now students two nd
a Oh will say da Oh equal to new student
da oh okay and then we can use the
object of Dao to call get student simple
so now we have now we will great object
of student Dao it will call get student
engagement we are passing this rule
number 12
so we are getting roll number enroll
maybe 1812 and then that 12 comes here
but what about s name because when you
return this when you return this as you
should also have s name and the problem
is we don't know what is name right and
that's why we have we want to fetch that
s name from database so what we'll do is
we'll say simply we have to follow those
seven steps or EBC so i find another
seven steps you can go to my previous
tutorial on JDBC and you can check seven
steps so I will tank I am directly
jumping to the second step and this I
have to import a library which is mask
you'll driver I'm done with that so this
is your mask you'll driver here how to
add this have to go to library right
click add library and you can go to mask
you'll hear somebody or mask you'll
delivery driver and you can click on add
library since we have already done that
so we will not repeat it again and here
I will say we have to you want to load
the drivers will say class dot Ford name
here we'll say F dimension calm dot
minus QL dot JDBC dot driver there is a
chance that we will be getting an error
so we'll go for try catch it says around
the block with try catch regard will
will go for general exception ensure
fainting using a logger
and simply print the error using s out
so x okay now here next step is you have
to call you want to create object of
connections with the creation condition
con equal to since connection is the
interface you can see it's an interface
going to go on connection it's an
interface right so we'll say the two
great object of interface we require a
driver manager dot get connection it
will ask you for three parameters first
is connection string roll number so your
this connection string username and
password so we'll say a passer is 0 user
name is load and you have to say JDBC :
mask ul : / / localhost okay in the
recommendation if you don't know what a
what I'm doing here or the steps of
masculine EBC go to my previous tutorial
okay and then after local Lowe's will
say I will type it without his name and
database name here as later his name
it's nothing okay next time you have to
get a statement so we say statement este
equal to corn dot create statement now
we read as call query so we'll go up
here and we'll say string query equal to
and the query I'm using here is select s
name from student where the OL number is
equal to roll number all right so with
this whole number will come here and
aquaria bleah become select s name from
student metal number is equal to 12
okay and then and then we'll say st dot
execute query because when you say
execute query and you have to pause the
query here it will give you our results
set so we say result set r is equal to s
st dot execute query and this result set
what you'll be getting is is the result
okay what result will be getting is will
say select it's the same query here it's
a select s name from student where those
number equal to 12 so you are getting
here is his name and gate can his right
so by D for your pointer will be here
and you want to shift to Ganesh you
so we'll say our s dot next you have to
shift your pointer and then we'll print
us out notice out we don't have to print
to you will say now we got how can you
fetch the name will say a name string
name is equal to RS dot get string and
then we can pass the column number and
the column number here is one is because
we are fetching only first only one
column and then we'll say a student
which is s dot s name is equal to name
so this name here will go to this s name
and then you can return a su so this s
name is same as this s name and you can
print this name using this on following
steps and now if I run this yesterday I
having an error okay so we'll say if you
get any error return and let's say
that's on this one so on this code the
output will be getting is oh this should
not be any double consumed and when I
run this code now the output is its
tarnish right so that means for just
focus on this now if you ignore the
below part is 2000 we are getting a do
class and that we are just saying get
student with rule number 12 you're
getting is Li which is Ganesh if you
write 11 here and if we run this now
it's novel right it's that simple if you
don't if you just just see this number
of lines you can achieve your JDBC
connection this the number of lines in
fact if you want to if you want to save
or student you can simply say
da or dot ad student and we can pass s1
or maybe as to creating a new object it
should be that simple okay in fact we'll
do that we'll add a student using this
thing in the next tutorial I hope you
got the gada thing we are doing here and
thanks for watching and just ask a pod
