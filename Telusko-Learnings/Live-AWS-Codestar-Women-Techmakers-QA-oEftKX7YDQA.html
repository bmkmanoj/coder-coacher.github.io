okay I've not set my headphones the mic
yet I was doing some settings and I can
see people are watching me maybe you are
using some echos there and let me know
how is how it is now
is it properly audible let me know in
the comment section which ID window I
can see four people liked this video
already and it's in good ok so yeah so
today we have a lot of thing to talk
about so I was supposed to go live
tomorrow but then tomorrow I have some
other work to become written that's why
I'm going live today as you can see the
tie as it's the title of the video says
live AWS coached are women techmakers
and the QA so we're talking about all
those things I can I can see they're
lots of questions coming up now but then
we have important thing to discuss first
so let's first discuss all those things
and then we move towards the other
things ok so let's start the first point
the first point is AWS Goldstar now as I
mentioned I in fact I have already made
videos on Java before right and then
I've already made videos on cloud
computing now one of the one of the
famous one of the famous technology
which we always talk about is AWS and
I'm a big fan of Amazon Web Services I
don't know how many actual learning Java
from my channel so I have koja videos I
have advantage to our videos not
everything but then I do have some
videos and the most important thing is
there lots of people they learn
technology but they forgot one thing
they forgot to implement tech things I
mean did you learn lots of things right
it's also important to implement it and
that's why if you remember we did a live
session for projects so I did some 10
live sessions only for project
perspective how to make a project how to
deploy that project on AWS all those
things in fact either do is Google App
Engine then different stuff right so yes
we have so many things we have so much
strength to work on so people who are
learning Java is for them so learn Java
code Java advanced part and then deploy
it on some web service now recently if
you I don't know how many of you know
about database
has multiple services AWS has ec2 again
early making of a different video on
this how exactly everything works but
then just to give you the idea we have a
concept of AWS which is Amazon Web
Services in which you have ec2 you have
beat stack stock stock ideas yeah and
then so what you do is you have used to
create a project and you deploy the
project by yourself right
but now thanks thanks to Amazon coach
star now we have this amazing concept
where you can make a project and you can
simply push your project on the server
and everything will be working good so
again so I've been making videos on
co-star so if you have not seen my
videos on a double as before just do
that
so whatever what you should be doing is
go to my channel and search for a place
called as a java java web development or
a live project so there are two
playlists a one is the actual live
session the second one is the edited
version so all the unwanted things are
removed from there right so all right so
yeah so you have two things there live
project and the java web development so
go for java opened it is it is what you
say we have edited the part which is
important okay so so once you have seen
that I will making videos on co-star as
well now poet star is actually amazing
the prerequisite for that is you should
know hibernate you should know spring
okay most open in spring you should know
spring technology JSP and hibernate so
that you can understand the video which
is coming on the way so first of all do
or watch those videos first and then we
move towards this one the code star the
second announcement or the second thing
okay so we will make a video on co-star
so by the time what you can do is you
can make an account on AWS Amazon Web
Services the account is free for one
year the only thing is they will ask you
for your credit card information
okay I know if you don't have a great
card just search for your friend's
credit card because they will not charge
you they might charge you 62 piece or
one one dollar just to check if you are
paid for this proper otherwise they will
not charge you for one year provided
you're not using extra instances
if you have that with you because trust
me when you join a company or any big
company they will be deploying their
application on cloud services we have
two cloud services we have private one
we have public one every come most of
the companies they do have their own
cloud service which is private one and
now they are also going for public one
which is AWS or Google App Engine so you
should be good you should be good with
cloud services as well so that's why I'm
making this video of a SS quote star
soon just wanted to let you know that
okay oh it's actually two lippies not
six to the piece I got one of the
comment okay if some sample I was
charged around $1 I don't know I don't
remember now but yeah so they might
charge you to the piece or 60 psi to
remember not exactly now but yes they
will charge you some amount but that's
okay you can use it for one year okay
yeah it's one dollar white so it is says
one dollar okay it's sorry I'm not sure
one dollar or two rupees that's fine
okay so that's the first point the
second point is again we'll talk about
QA I will try to answer all your
questions but just hold on for some time
okay so next is the next part the expiry
I want to talk about is women techmakers
now what happened is you know I used to
I mean when I started making videos from
the last three years rights I have so
many videos and I had to add to had this
habit of checking my analytics I want to
check I want to check about different
stuff like who is watching my videos
from which country I'm getting most of
my views of what is the gender ratio of
male and female but I realized you know
70% of more than 70% of my the Gentiles
show is male and around 30 30 percent is
a less than 30 person is female maybe
they don't so I don't know why we have
this huge gap I don't know about other
youtubers what they have or the ratio
but what I feel is wait come a
technology I don't know why there is
this huge gap because industries are
facing these issues in fact I have
talked to many people in danger in the
industry then there are some people from
Google some people from in fact many
she believes that we are not actually
going for we're not actually having a
good balance between the women and men
in technology so we need to maintain the
balance because the only way to support
this world or to make it work properly
is by having that balance of female and
male ratio right and that's why I'm
trying to you know I'm trying to try to
solve this issues I'm going to different
colleges based only for this so girls
base colleges I'm going there and trying
to motivate people motivate the girls so
I believe that maybe they they are
motivated but they are not using YouTube
that's my that might be one reason but
then I feel there should be a proper
balance between girls and also women and
men in the technology world so maybe 15
maybe not be 50/50 it will take some
time may be at least 45 55 maybe 30 59
49 51 maybe more more women than men so
I'm ready for that point where you will
be having that balance because it is not
properly thought it's not proper now
okay now this is not just from my side
it in fact Google believes in this so
what Google know so Google has their
initiate you now which is called as
women techmakers so go to google and
search for women techmakers if any of
the female watching this video just do
check it out and in fact even if you
have so if you are a male and if you
have a female friend if you know someone
who can help who can be helped with this
thing do let them know it's about women
techmakers because i believe the only
way you can make this world a better
place is by having that balance we don't
want this arty to be male-dominated I
want I mean we want that equality so
that you'll be having different thinking
right maybe it is going one way now and
that's why it is going in a bad way so I
believe if this balance it will be going
a good way so if you are so if you're a
female make sure that you go to Google
and search for take of women techmakers
so it's from google it's like google
initiate you okay
and the second one is if you're a male
do you do your let do your friends let
let let know know about these things
we went take makers
so yeah just want to talk about these
two things and now let's talk about QA
finally we are going for QA sessions and
we don't have much time today it's
already been it's already 9:40 in India
here I don't know from where you're
watching this session and I have some
other work in morning so so let's let's
do it quickly okay so I hope you have
enjoyed this session I just won one four
people are watching this and only 51
likes come on guys if you enjoyed this
type of sessions do games like button so
we got Kadesh from us that's great so
all over the world people are watching
this that's great okay so let's go with
QA and before the strife level says high
regard Sunil here says hi Louise says hi
that he says hi ROM says first okay Alan
says open you are falling from a long
time buddy that's great okay so it is
audible rom say is my name
oh hi ROM okay everything seems to the
same skirt here okay so calm so Monty
says congratulations thank you mum deep
ok please make a video on JSP page
nation okay that's a good point
JSP page nation so I let me just take it
down somewhere
I will surely make on make a video on
this page nation JSP page a nation point
to be point no tater guys okay so what
things are you going to discuss now we
have discussed that okay so hamster says
which is best be e or BSC ID with MCA
wannabe programmer I would say if you
get a chance to become a be ego for be e
because the thing is B II will take
fotios and if you go for and if you're
going for MCA it will be three years bc
ii o three years be a CIT and three
years I'm C it will take six years so I
would say B is a better option and there
are lots of companies they prefer be e
because you if you get a good college
you will get good opportunities or for
different companies so I would say yes
be e will be better
okay so heart says it told that you'll
be coming live at 10:30 but now it's
9:30 yeah so I was supposed to be live
at 10:00
I've not mentioned 20s I mentioned 10
p.m. but then I got free very oddly so I
thought I will be getting I will be
getting free by 90 so if I can get go
live at 10 but I got free at 8:45 itself
so I thought ok let's make it quick so
that you know I can finish this work I
can finish some other work and then I
can take a good nap because tomorrow's
an important day I have to I have some
other work to do so yeah so let's see
and that's why I've been life ugly I
hope that's fine with you but ok so Dom
says I've worn job in Google so that's
good you have a high mission work hard
work on your algorithm skills work on
your project skills so algorithms you
can structures Matt's problem-solving
skills these are important things if you
are going to get into Google ok so can
you do we do some Android things no I'm
not planning for anyone anymore
I'm busy with some other stuff so no
Android as of now please make a video on
spring web MVC with hibernate yes I'll
be making a video on that soon so I'm
making a video on spring MVC and
hibernate integration using annotations
it is coming on the way
ok so Robbie says I want to be a Java
done upon confused what should I do
ok to be a Java developer you have to
make sure that you know Java properly ok
so the first thing is you have to learn
code Java then you have to go for
Advanced part and while you're learning
coach Java make sure that you also learn
learn about how can you implement it
because there are lots of people they
only learn they don't implement so I
want you to implement as well there's a
difference between learning Java and
knowing job ok so you can you longer
syntax in know Java but then if you
really want to implement Java then you
have to learn a different way understand
the concept implementing it so so if you
can you know just learn and then also
implement something make a project and
deploy it and upload that on github and
let your friend know about your project
and let them give you gave their
comments that's how you improve right in
fact you know since I make videos on
YouTube and I try different stuff so
whenever you try something new you learn
something
right so you can see I have videos on
different technologies all different
technologies why because the more video
I make the more I learn right the more
so more feedback I get from you people
may be positive or negative everything
is good for me so positive feedback
motivate me negative feedback again
motivates me because I'm not doing good
so I have to mix I have to make sure
that I'm doing good videos in future ok
so I can see 130 people watching this
and 86 likes that's great that's a good
number
okay so what next what would be the
future of angularjs not sure about a
JavaScript frameworks because I'm not
good with JavaScript just to be honest
here I can't comment on the front-end
technologies but yeah I'm gonna genius
is good I what I heard is a react genius
is what you say is or is about angularjs
now so I don't know man I'm not sure but
okay so you can you can ask someone else
who knows angular JS properly I work on
Java frameworks Oh next one says your
videos for data flares are awesome
that's great data flashed in using my
videos that's awesome it's been a long
time I've made videos for data flat
that's good
okay Sundeep says after beer B is CCS
which is better MC or MSC so I would say
go for MCA because industry people I'm
an industry pre-fall MCA not m/s CIT
that's my experience they always think
MCA is higher than MSC ID but then if
you want to get into research if you
want to get into maybe you're maybe you
want to invent something you want to
learn a huge so many things we can go
for you can go for MSC yes that's
awesome
in fact just to let you know I have done
my MSC in IT so I am also a messy guy
but you never see you a lot lot of them
not a lot of stuff okay so she's raised
large says what are the skills that we
should have to become Safa developer I
do have a video on this search for
minimum mean okay minimum requirement to
be a sofa developer or search for
telesco minimum requirement to a
software developer and you can watch the
video
has everything mentioned okay the ninja
says how can I learn OpenCV no idea I
have not seen OpenCV yet okay
phantom says what's your opinion about
Google Chromebook I've not used it yet
so no idea it might be good it's a
Google product so it should be good for
programmer at least oh-kay Oh explain it
doctors in Java I've done that right
oh man says can you explain a doctor's
in Java I've done that so if you can
watch search for adapter design pattern
I do have that video I guess I'm not
sure so it should be there how can a bit
let me check if it is there okay next
over there so Binayak sighs thank you so
much for the videos okay everything
seems good okay next question next
question where to deploy web application
for free good question
so for PHP for Ruby ideas there are lots
of free service available for study
websites as well but if you want to
deploy a web application like using Java
or other other technologies like dotnet
for Java especially you can use Amazon
Web service it's free for one year and
if you are actually earning on your
website of course you can you can invest
later right
so at least for one year you will get it
for free one instance so one instance of
ec2 one instance of RDS so Amazon had
different services every things will get
one one free service so yeah that's what
I can do okay
so Mohammed says Java was a dotnet which
one to learn of course I will say Java
why was I talking it I'm a huge fan of
Java you know okay okay we can say so
I'm struggling in Java what should I do
I don't know C and C++ C there are two
two ways of learning one is watching
videos one and in there multiple ways of
learning watching videos reading books
attending classroom training as an
attending online training so first try
four videos okay the best way of
learning
something is watch videos if you're not
good at watching videos if you don't
understand that read books if that is
see you have to understand how you learn
okay so I learned from videos and books
that's what I prefer
some people prefer classroom training so
if you really don't understand Java go
for some classes and learn it otherwise
if you can learn online you can join
online matches online courses and you
can learn okay life training so make
sure that you so don't struggle learn
okay so if you are feeling videos are
not good for you go for books books are
not good for you go for classroom
training classroom they are not good for
you
I'll go for online trading so search for
a better way okay great
so we've in onyx things I have learned a
lot of from your videos so that's great
Vinayak do share these videos with your
friends okay so alien says alien world
says oh that's it so yeah alien voice
okay what a why string is immutable in
Java so I do have a video on that
instead of saying things about here just
go to youtube and search for a disco why
strings are immutable so use the
channeling then this string you will get
the video oh okay Boop endless a is your
videos are very helpful or that's great
thank you so much okay I'll give the
same question which is the best library
for JavaScript no idea no idea okay so
only what he says is actually too deep
is not okay to talk about talked about
that I'm not sure I'm not too sure about
the amount ok Jawad says $1 to maybe no
ok most people say is $1 some people say
okay so in you as they charge $1 and if
you are going for Indian US service they
charge a 2 rupees maybe that's that's
the scenario okay so more it says
everyday they update Java and I did not
found any browser that supports Java C
Java is not a browser level stuff okay
Java is enterprise diverse stuff it's a
general programming language so if you
talk about Java it is very famous in
enterprise world things like Hadoop
things like
Android the other work they are made on
Java so it's not a browser level things
you know don't just I mean see that such
so many people they're only focusing on
the client side stuff oh you have to
understand this there are two llama
market you work with one is consumer
market and you're you have enterprise
market the consumer market is somewhere
you use all different technologies and
we talk about enterprise market the
famous language is dotnet and Java right
so this is something which people do
miss sobhana says do it updates videos
as well I will try to make a video on
coach start let's see how all other
videos I can make even I am into a
learning phase of for AWS I'm not a
complete certified a nativist yet I'm on
that words of learning stuff in a
depressor so I know about ec2 I know
about Beanstalk I know about being I
don't know how to bounce that bean stock
stock I don't doesn't matter so I know
about your coached our audience that's
it I don't know about all the other
services of enable so okay so what
should happen okay we have talked about
that they will check whether the ground
is active yeah so that's right they will
check so when you pay for credit card
that they will check for the things okay
I'm trying to Explorer Mozilla Chrome
but Apple it doesn't oh so you're
talking about the applet stuff maybe I
have not worked nap it from a long time
so maybe a new browser doesn't support
applets maybe that's the case I'm not
sure it's we had really been a long time
I worked on applet
oh okay so Mahmoud says go for macbook
air yeah so banku kaizuka is a good
machine oh oh oh the programming was
invented by a women sir yeah that's
right I mean that's what I say you know
the first programmer is a lady right
lady advanced
low and slowly slowly so you know this
and see the thing is now in fact I would
also request you to watch Uncle Bob
videos because he also talks about so
he's a very old programmer he's been 40
years programming from last 40 years and
he has seen all the transitions right so
initially there was the
there was a high ratio of women in
technology then as a programmer than men
but things are changing I don't know
what's happening with the with the world
now okay the videos aren't logic Java so
I do have a video on project Java you
can you can check it out okay yeah there
was one more question in one of the
video was how can you how can you use my
entire peps entire playlist right
because people do get confused with all
of so many videos so what I would
suggest just go to my channel go to my
website to restore calm so go to the
website that is calm and there is a
video tab there just click on the video
tab then you can see all different
playlists so if you have to learn about
Java go for job then you're taken to
learn about SQL go for SQL playlist the
advantage would be you will not get
distracted
that's thing that's important then it
says equality isn't met why why it's a
myth okay oh I just scrolled and I lost
all the questions that's great this is
why I hate the child window here okay
this one more announcement I'm planning
to make a I'm trying to upload to at
least two videos per week okay so I'm
seriously seriously thinking about
making more videos on youtube i'm not
just talking and the videos which only
talks about different stuff but also
things which can teach you so that's
that's all the things I mean I'm
passionate about teaching different
stuff for you so either making at least
two videos per week now at least two
videos okay and I'm trying to upload
those videos on Thursday and sorry
Tuesday and Thursday so Tuesday and
Thursday we'll be having a video and
Sunday will be going live so at least
three videos on a week right so actually
to stuff and then the live interaction
on the on the third day I think that
will be that will be a good idea so yeah
so I did one more he'll point from you
people so if you want to make if you
want me to make a video just let me know
so how you can do that
whatever you do is on the website I will
update I will have one more link in
future maybe next five to six days maybe
in one week I will put one more thing
you can submit the request of the topic
name so that I can go to the topic and I
can make a video on that yeah that would
be a good idea right so yeah we'll do
that okay so ten more minutes and then
we'll I wind up with the sessions I know
there are lots of questions here just to
let you know the website name it is
there is calm I don't know if you have
if you have been to my chat website
before the website name itself is quite
calm okay
what is pythonic script no idea can you
make a video for Java database for
deployment that's what I'm doing so I'll
be doing this video in next two days I
WS with so it doubles with a deploy I
mean in fact I have that video on my
channel search for Java development
spring AWS Java web development spring
AWS and you will get the video but now
I'll be making a video with a double
squad stars so coach ties a new service
from Amazon okay so how do you know when
I'm going like next okay then so Sami
peoples are asked the same questions
right okay so how do you know when I'm
going live so you have to make sure that
you like my channel so that you like the
channel page on Facebook so I have a via
Facebook page just go to Facebook and
search for the co-learning and like the
page right that's how you will get
updated you can also like the novelty
page on the main ready a page your page
on Facebook's or such one amenity page
and like it that's what I will do I will
do the announcements okay yeah so
question form what is what is a tab list
item is basically Amazon Web service
which provides which provides cloud
services so if the wise ass pass and
also I guess okay so so do you make a
video on a jean no I'm not into a dotter
technology so I cannot make a video on
that
what is Kathleen programming I don't
know I don't know what is Kathleen I
heard about Cortland but not Kathleen
okay last two minutes
okay darshan says how to deploy a
verification project on open shape three
okay good point because the videos which
I've made are layered on Emma's
openshift was open shipped to and now
they have shut down open shipped to and
now they have open shiftry it's bit
different compared to open shipped to
and I have not explored it yet because I
have moved to a diverse so so once I get
some time I will explore open shape tree
as well but as of now I don't have any
idea how to do that because they have
changed different things okay make a
video on it one java yes that's on the
way I mean it will take some time okay
up to which extent we should know Java
for Android development so go Java you
should not tell connections threads yeah
so you should know threads and
corrections it abuses administration or
development both okay Kujawa then JavaFX
offspring I would say Java FX go for
Java effects after Co Java okay what I'd
not next
SD in youtuber what is Estrella I don't
know what is SG n okay okay so I'm so
last two minutes and I'm searching for
some good questions that I can answer
those questions okay when I say good
questions it means the things with the
questions between which I can answer
okay any YouTube channel or you know for
front-end no idea no idea I've never
learned front-end on YouTube so this is
a one this one website for this code
Academy I guess code Academy oh it's a
good a good platform to learn fronton
technologies okay sigh not says your
videos make java easy understandable
thanks for sharing knowledge oh that
thank you so much I hope that was that
well okay so the question what is
blockchain so my Asus was a block change
blockchain is basically a defense stuff
in the technology now it's very new and
it is changing the world so it's the way
of keeping data so you know people you
should keep data at one place and
there's lots of issues of security
monitoring so now we have a set of
operations so the next set of operations
will be depend upon the first set of
operations it's like a chain right so
from so let's say if you have a change
so much if you have a change so much big
you can have new operation or new data
at the end like a chain and this
operation will be depend upon the
previous operations I know is difficult
to understand it's a very different
acknowledge II so Perseus blockchain is
a new thing and the bit Bitcoin
technology so Bitcoin is based on
blockchain it's not just Bitcoin that so
many technologies which are based on
blockchain now so if you want to learn
something new now the auction is a good
way to go okay next question from Bank
when will be going live next so most
probably is coming sir coming Sunday so
tomorrow I'm not going live
so next Sunday yeah so not coming said
the next same thing so to what I'm not
going life I have some other work to do
so next Sunday
I'll give any life
Oh which thing which is a which language
