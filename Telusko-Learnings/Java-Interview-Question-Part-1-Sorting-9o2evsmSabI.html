video will talk about a Java interview
coding question so I have a question
here which is this one so the question
is you are given any array of length and
this area here or you have to sort this
array element in the descending order of
the frequency so what it means is let's
say you have this array of four three
one six for the six four so what we need
to do now is wait to sort this array in
such a way that the number of
occurrences if the frequency of that
number will define the you know the
dependent sequence so if you talk about
this four so four is one two and then
three so it is it is appearing for three
times right so it will be three fours
then we have three and three four two
times between level three then we have
six and six four two times it will be
six six and we have one which will be
here once so we have to sort this
element depend upon the in it the number
of the frequency right now it is very
easy when you work with collection API
but unfortunately in this question it is
mentioned as collection is not loud the
problem is the lots of companies they
want to check your programming skill set
not how much you know it's about how
much you can implement things so
basically if you know about single
dimensional array or two dimensional
array so we can achieve this with the
help of 2d arrays or normal Addie's so
we don't have to use collation APR good
so I will be doing this part in two
videos in the first video which is this
one will be discussing about the
theoretical part the steps to follow in
the next part of the tutorial we'll talk
about the implementation we will see the
actual code ok so let's start with the
step one so in order to do that so this
is my input here which is four three one
six four three six four so what we do
now is first you have to sort the array
now we can use any sort here we can use
bubble sort we can use merge sort which
ever you saw sorting technique you like
so we can sort the array and the after
sorting the array will be one three
threes four four four and six six again
so dads
that's the first step so first first
step we have to sort this adding the
second step is you have to create a 2d
array and you have to populate it now
how to create these 2d attics this 2d
array will be of two columns and number
of rows depend upon the number of unique
elements so in this I have around four
unique elements how to guess that so
what I will do is I will say this one is
here and the occurrence of one is only
one then we have three the appearance of
three is two then we have for the
appearance of four is three and then we
have six the occurrence of six is two
okay how to do do this in programming as
a different question but this is the
steps you have to follow so first step
is you have to first sort the array in
this format second step is you have to
create a 2d array you have to populate
that add it in this format now once you
got this then you have to sort this 2d
array in the descending order of the
occurrence so what I mean by that is if
you talk about this one this column here
and this array in the story or if we
talk about this column this defines the
number of the frequency right so what we
can do is we can sort it in the order of
frequency so if you can see if it is
full we have three times okay so it
should come first three then we have
three is two so it comes here then we
have oh okay then we have four then we
have six as to so that should be here
six is two and then we have one is one
so it should be here one is one now once
you got all this in descending order of
the frequency what we can do is we can
print the elements in this format so we
have to print this for three times we
have to print this three two times we
have to print this six two times and
then we have to put in this one sit one
time and that's it here if you follow
the steps we got an output which is
triple four three double three double
six one which is the output that
expecting here cool so this is the
question where you have to sort the
array depend up on that
so the steps you have to follow is you
have to first sort the array then you
have to create a 2d array then we have
to sort that 2d array and then we have
to win those 2d array in this format
okay so it seems difficult but it's not
that difficult maybe if you are not
comfortable with 2d array or single
dimensional array so might be you will
find it difficult so I will suggest just
have a look on the code in the next
tutorial if you don't understand the
code it's okay just go back to your
basic tutorial of arrays and 2d arrays
and then come back to the programming
part then you will that the concept will
be clear okay so that's this one this
video which is theory of this steps so
if you like this video do like on that
thumbs up do subscribe for the further
videos thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
