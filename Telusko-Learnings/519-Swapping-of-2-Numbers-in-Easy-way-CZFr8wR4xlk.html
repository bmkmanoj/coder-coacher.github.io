subscriber so do first do subscribe and
then watch this video so in this video
we talk about swapping of two numbers
now in the last video we have already
seen how to swap two numbers but in this
video we'll see in the easiest way now
this this this formula or this technique
was suggested by one of my subscriber
YouTube called us be joined us
if FF is named correctly so in this
technique what we'll do is let's say we
have two numbers one is what is 5 and
then we have int B which is 6
ok so we have these two numbers and we
want to slap these two numbers so when I
print the value so let's say if I print
a and let me give a space here and B so
if I print this value so the output will
be 5 and 6 but I want to swap these two
numbers and the output should be 6 and 5
now to do that what we'll simply do is
we'll say B equal to a but will it work
the problem is once we say B is equal to
a now even the B what the B will low
loses value so I fire on this both the
value will be same which is 5 and 5 what
if if I say equal a a a plus B but hold
on we will be getting will be getting a
new value for B ok it will be getting a
new value for B which is lemon right I
don't want that
so let me subscribe B now will it work
let's try so if I again run this this is
5 &amp;amp; 5 so what we can simply do is I want
to assign the new value which is a 2 B
and still I want to preserve the value
of B in a so what I can do is I can say
equal to B so this B will assign its
value to a and then this way the value
of a will be 6 right and this 6 will be
subtracted with this 6 this would the
value will be 5 but
getting an error here right so let me
give a quick recap what we have done we
want to assign a value of A to B but the
problem is once you assign a value of A
to B B will lose its value so we want to
preserve the value of B in a so we can
simply use a bracket here so B even
assign a value to a and this B which is
6 will will be subtracted with 6 because
a new value of a will be 6 right after
this operation so in programming in Java
programming this we first solve these
round brackets and then we go for this
calculation of - ok so it will be first
a which is 5 so 5 plus B which is 6 it
will be 1111 minus 6 because the value
of a will be 6 Co simple right and then
when I run this code will be getting 6 +
5 so we are swapping two numbers in the
easiest way so that's it and thank you
be joy with us and thank you for
