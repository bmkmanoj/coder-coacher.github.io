about how to what are different ways to
instantiate a class so what I have here
is I have a test class in this I have a
method called a show and I want to print
this in show so in order to call this
show method we need to instantiate test
right so one of the way is which we do
which we do normally which is create an
object so which we directly instantiate
it and we'll say obj dot we can simply
say show right and now if we run this
that's your put it is in show so that's
one way the second way is by creating a
clone right so if you know about clone
so you can just have a have an object
which is let's say obj you can create a
new object of this test class as obj1
and then you can create this obj one
object with the help of this obj object
provided your class supports clone or
your plus that should implement
cloneable interface so if you don't know
about learning interface you can search
for the cloneable or what you say
cloning object learning video on my
channel so that second way the third way
is by using DZ arises in this
realization so whenever you do diesel
ization it will create a new instance so
if you know about diesel edition it's
something like you know I have a video
on that also you can just search for
civilization in Java in my channel so
you will get the idea of this
civilization sort of three ways first
way is this then we can use clone we can
use visualization in fact if you know
about the latest framework which is
spring framework so in spring framework
you have something called as dependency
injections we have dependency enjoy
so that's the other way but don't we
have any other way of creating an object
or instantiate a glass so let me go in
this way so there is a class in Java
call this class so there's a class
itself causes class let me create this
object of that class I see and we'll say
glance dot so there is a method called
as for name so this for name is a method
is a static method belongs to our class
class so what we to mention here is we
just have to mention the class name a
colleague a fully qualified class name
so we'll say it's comm dot naveen dot
test so that's my class name with the
package again this this method for name
might throw an error of class not found
so we just have to throws the exception
here okay and then to just to create the
instance what we can do is we need the
instance of test so we'll say test T
equal to so in order to create the test
object we can simply use this class C so
this class has a method called as new
instance so new instance is responsible
to return you the object of test but by
default this new instance if you see the
if you see the property it returns you
the type of T so if you are going with
gender ik but by default it will return
you something called as object type so
what I need is test type
so using typecasting allocating this
object and we can simply say T dot show
so that's one of the way okay so anyway
you say new instance it will create the
object and now if we run this if I just
go here so without without using a new
keyword if I go here and run again it
will it will again print in show cool so
that has a different ways of creating an
object or to instantiate a class in Java
so I hope you like this liked with this
video so do subscribe for the further
