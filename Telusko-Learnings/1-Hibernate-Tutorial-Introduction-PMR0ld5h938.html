Josie from Titusville gardening's and in
this video we'll talk about hybrid net
now think about this word so we are
living in a world of information right
or you can call it as data right so when
you talk about this data and when you
talk about this software world in
software world we always talk about
languages right we have C language we
have C++ we have Java we also have
gotten it but let's say if you talk
about this jar of world we have a
concept of oops right bitches
object so in Java everything is an
object that means if you want to make an
make a software you have to think about
objects right so it deals with the
concept of oak's which is in haiyan's
abstraction then we have polymorphism so
if we talk about all this thing when it
comes to object right but hold on when
you want to store a data now how do you
store the data so normally when you say
you want to show the data you might be
showing that in a file which is your txt
files you might be storing your data
inside may be XLS file and who use that
you might be storing your data in do C
or CSV files the problem is if you are
storing your data in all this format it
is very difficult to fetch very
difficult to process and that's why we
have this amazing person we used to have
I mean we have this amazing scientist
dr. Cod right again that's a respect so
yeah dr. Cod given those two old rules
golden rules which I don't remember now
so due to those rules we have this
concept of relational databases right so
we have we have on the on the one side
we have object model and the on the
other side we have relational model
right so we process data we do we do all
those software stuff with the help of
objects and we stored our data in a
relational part that means if you are
living in this world and if you want to
connect your software or your
applications which works on objects with
the relations you have to connect them
right now is it that simple to connect
we have done that right let's say you
have our DBMS which is your MySQL and
you have Java on this side so how do you
connect your Java and MySQL so we have
we have this concept of JDBC which is
Java database connectivity so using this
you can connect
application and you can connect your
mask you'll the problem starts when you
say you want to connect them in a fishin
way when you say fishing way what it
means think about it think about
developers now let's imagine I'm a I'm a
developer here it is my job to write an
application and all those data should be
saved on the tables right okay when you
say save it also means persist so we use
this amazing voice persist so we want to
achieve persistence we want to store our
data which is in the application into
the database because in application we
use variables right so we normally store
our data inside variable so we have to
make sure that that data goes into table
in objects we have classes on the other
side you in your relation side we have
tables there we have a concept of fields
right we have we have variables on this
side we have those columns or table
columns on this side we have objects on
this side we have those tuples right now
it is easy to map it right we have class
we have table we have variables we have
fields but but can you implement all
those oops concept what about
inheritance what about polymorphism how
can you achieve that on tables so this
people industry people they wanted a a
mapping tool where you can map your
objects and relational properly and
that's why we have a concept of o our m
which stands for object relational
mapping okay so it's just a concept
right so when you say ORM it's just a
concept we wanted a implementation and
that's where we have some ORM tools so
we have a tool which is hibernate we
have a tool like JP a or not JP a
hibernate I buy tails we have top link
right so we have all this tool and one
of the best tool to use is hibernate so
as per the ranking the best ORM tool is
hibernate again there is a big debate on
this as well but let's say it's
hibernate so if you know hyper tonight
you can learn the other other thing as
well so what hibernate does is it does
the mapping between object world and
relational world now how exactly we do
it that will say in the
entire series okay so in this entire
series the indicators we'll be talking
about hibernate hql how to map it and
all the stuff so make sure you subscribe
the channel and do like this video so
that you can you can watch all those
other videos thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
