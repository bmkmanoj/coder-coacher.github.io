code to check a given number is a prime
odd not okay so when you talk about
prime numbers so prime numbers are those
numbers which are divisible by itself
and 1 so if you try to divide that
number between 1 to that number it will
not divide get by any number so to
demonstrate this we know in a code what
we'll do is we'll first take input from
user so we'll say int I I will say ain't
num and this input will come from the
user but you know initially we'll start
with a number 25 and we know 25 is not a
prime number
and later we'll track this number from
the user so for this to do this
operations what we need is we need a k
variable or we'll use a flag so we'll
say a boolean flag
so we'll say we'll say is prime so we'll
use this a variable which is a spline
and by default this is false or by
default it is it's a true okay so once
you get a stream is equal to true and
then what we'll do is we'll start the
counting from 1 so this will have a for
loop will have a for loop here we'll
start with the value which is 1 and will
and not 1 will start with 2 because we
know the prime number gets divided by 1
and itself so why to go to the last
point we'll finish one before that point
and then it will say I plus plus okay so
so we are starting with 2 and we are
finishing yet num so we have to check
that number should be should not get
divided by any number between this 2 now
to check that we'll say if F and mod I
is equal to equal to 0 that means it is
getting divided so in that scenario what
we'll do is we'll say we'll set is prime
is equal to false and that's it ok so
once you see ok it's number it's any any
aslam so once you see that it is getting
divided by any number you just have to
say it is as false and since we know it
is false we can just
break so if divide if it gets divided by
any number so we can simply said is
prime equal to false and then we'll say
break and then once your for loop is
over now we'll check if the number is
prime okay since if only takes the true
and false value boolean value we can die
taillight is flying and we'll print here
the numb is it numb is a prime number
okay and we'll finish the string here so
if it is prime it is it will print prime
otherwise it will print so we'll sell
out not a prime number
simple right so this is the logic of
prime number so we have to start with
the value 2 and we have to finish till
the number or the letter 1 minus the
number if that number is divided by any
number in between we'll simply set is
prime as false and we'll say break once
it is break or any way which is not
breaking or breaking we have to check is
if it is a still us to the true value if
it is true then we'll print is prime
otherwise it will claim the prime number
and if I run this so of course we know
25 not a prime number then question what
is a prime number so let's try 29 which
is I guess a prime number
yeah so 20 I is a prime number okay so
there is the simplest logic you can have
but if what the thing is we are starting
with 2 and we are ending yet damn tight
so we can what we can also do is we can
just divide we can just go till the half
of that number because as for
mathematics if you if you have a prime
number so we just have to start with the
2 and then we have to end at half of the
number so it is it will be running much
faster than the previous value okay so
if I say start so it is again a prime
number okay and then what we can simply
so we what is a faster way from this we
can also do it tell the square root of
this as a math dot
square root and you have to pass numb
them okay so there's one of the way to
do it so if I say run so it's again a
prime number right so this is the best
way you can find so which is 4 square
root cool so yeah so that's how you have
to check a given prime number for this
example we can simply go with numb you
can also go with 1/2 or you can also go
with the dis square root so this is how
you have to check a given number is
prime or so thanks for watching and do
