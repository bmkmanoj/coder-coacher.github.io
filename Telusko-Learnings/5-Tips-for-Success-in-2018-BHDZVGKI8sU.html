but only some aren't able to achieve
success now if you think successful
people ask mutter than you maybe a right
or maybe not so in this video we'll talk
about those five tips which will help
you to be successful
welcome back aliens my name is live
already and let's get started first step
take action we all know what do we are
just not doing it now we have plants
why'd we know what to do
the only things we are not taking action
so if you want to be successful start
taking action on every plan so if you
want to do something don't just think
about it start doing it
tip number two be consistent you either
go forward or you go backward you don't
stay on the same level every day you
learn something new every day you work
on a project you are going forward now
space doesn't matter maybe faster or
slower what matters this you are going
forward every day you are wasting not
doing your project or not learning
something new you go pass water so you
don't stay on the same level either you
go forward all your core values
tip number three make each day count in
appear you have 365 days make every day
count because these are a famous code
which says I will do it today which
others don't so that I will have
tomorrow watch for those four and every
day you waste you are failing to achieve
your success by one day therefore
improve every day the only thing which
is constant is changed technology is
evolving and you have to evolve as well
and that's why you have to improve your
skills every day now push your eyes what
to improve and how much time have to
spend it now what to improve so you will
find a video I have made one video few
months back so we'll find the link here
that video talks about what you have to
improve my communication technical
skills domain knowledge you have to
improve that every day
now when you see how much it's already
been upon you now some people can spend
due to three hours per day some people
can spend 30 minutes of the project at
its best then
now you cannot specify the time right
what you can specify is the percentage
in watering too so let's say if this one
month you want to learn adjust
technology or maybe you want to achieve
you want to work on this project so what
you can do is every day you can spend
one person so improve yourself one
percent per day now how would you
improve I would say read books watch
videos on YouTube there is a Tech Talk
is that is cause I think there's so many
times I've been able right so whenever
you you find something new to learn do
that the last step which is fifth one
use your forward effectively technology
is very powerful and I took a sip spot
for nowadays we have so much of
distraction every time you work on
something you get a message on your
whatsapp a bit of Facebook message
physical-education what you do you just
grab your phone right because you cannot
resist and that's where you are getting
distracted so once you get distracted
coming back to your work is very
difficult now how do you avoid it so you
can put your mobile phone on silent you
can just drop all the notification of
your phone when you're walking I'll be
when you get any time you can just go
back and see your notifications right
now you can use your phone been affected
in a different way
instead of making your phone as a
distraction you can make it as a
predictive tool now Facebook whatsapp
they're a good tool for the
communication right so if you want to
build your network of course you know
you need those two tools or two those
those apps now you can use some other
apps as well which will improve you
now what happens is every time you get
some free time let's say you are
planting somewhere if you are waiting on
a cue you have that small lead time line
what you do you unlock your board and
the first thing you can see there is
Facebook or whatsapp application all the
logos what if I what I would say it is
on your home sprint remove Facebook and
whatsapp whatsapp app and keep some
improvement tools example you can have a
game not any game but a game which will
help you to improve your plate example
there are some puzzle apps or there are
some played games you can install that
and you can play that it will so as you
need exercise your brain of speed
exercise exercise right it will help you
in those things you can have app like
coda the only thing is in Pune as well
depend upon your interest choose those
topics on the to those topics to which
will improve you the second one is
youtube so you can you subscribe to
learning channels right that is for
nothing there so many times of any
goodbye so you subscribe then immediate
notification of those channels so watch
those videos it will help you in a free
time now what I do so if you if you see
my mobile home screen
I have ebooks apps so the moment I get
some free time I open I ebook and I
start reading I don't have whatsapp and
Facebook apps on my home screen of my
phone I have an e-book which is Google
Play Books so those are five tips the
first one take action second one be
consistent third one make each day down
fourth one improve every day and the
fifth one has use your phone
I hope you will work on the skills so
