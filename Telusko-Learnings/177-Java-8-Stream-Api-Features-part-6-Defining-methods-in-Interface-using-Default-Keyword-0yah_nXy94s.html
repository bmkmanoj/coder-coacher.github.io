is we have just we have we try to modify
the interface once they are publishers
because once they are published there
will be lots of classes which has which
are implemented that interface which is
active so what what if in future I want
to modify this interface we cannot
declare any extra methods right what
about defining those methods that means
we are trying to define methods an
interface is it possible Java 7 says or
any any version till Java 7 says no you
cannot define meta interface but Java 8
says hold on what if a person needs to
modify interface we should allow him to
add methods but you cannot declare is
because all the classes which I depend
upon that interface will give you error
that's why we should be able to define
methods and how to define is using our
default keyboard so if you write a
default keyword in front of your method
it will allow you to define and once
again this thing will only work in Java
8 so if you are using Java 1.7 or that
means 7 it with this code will not work
and this default method we can simply
say is out it will print I can make
people laugh now you can see here since
I am defining a default method in this
villain you don't have any other even if
I if I mean even if I go to this hero
and if I remove this method and there
will not be any error is because we are
defining that method there so it's kind
of inheritance or it's kind of
overriding right it's because we are we
are overriding a method which is a
defined method so yes in Java 8 you can
define methods in interface with the
help of default keyword make sure you
are mentioning this metal as default
once again
this method is public ok so by default
all the methods in interface are public
so this is basically default public
avoid comedy okay so you can't define a
method
now what if if I create if I create a
main function and if I try to call if I
create a main function or main method
and that if I create object of hito and
if I call obj dot act it will call this
act right but if I call obj dot comedy
obviously it will call this method
default and it will execute so it will
it's it is same like a method definition
in a class but this is an interface
that's why we have to define it as
default so a big mystery solved that is
we can define methods and interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
