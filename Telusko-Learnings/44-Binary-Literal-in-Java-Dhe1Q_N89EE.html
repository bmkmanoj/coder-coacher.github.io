to represent a bond a literal in Java
now what I mean when I say we have
something else binary literal so let's
say we have a integer which is int I and
the value of I is five right and then if
I print the value of I here so this is
out our system daughter pendulum and let
me print I okay and you find on this
code so let me use shift f6 to run this
the output is 5 right but let's say I
want to represent this number not in a
decimal format but in a binary format so
it's a binary format is the computer
representation of your numbers right so
computer understand only one language
which is 1 and 0 so this 1 not 1 means 5
so if you know the basic idea about
binary conversion so when you convert
this 5 into binary code binary so it
will get 1 0 1 and now if I done this if
I say shift f6 so you can see the answer
is 1 not 1 but I don't want to print one
not one I want to print 5 so even if I
give our input in binary format each the
output should be in decimal format so
what we can do is we can represent this
number a binary number into decimal
format using something called as Oh B so
just white or OB in front of your
vanilla literal and it will convert that
number to decimal format Oh
so if I run this the answer is 5 right
so if I write OB 1 not 1 I will get 5
now let's say how a bigger number so
let's say 1 and 6 zeroes it will be 64
let's check it is 64 if I add two more
zeros it will be Phi 1 2 2 2 2 6 so it
meanders and up to 6 right but when we
get confuse right how many zeroes we
have here it's very difficult to count
so let's say this is 8 zeros let's say
you have more zeros you have two more
zeros which will which will give you a
thousand or 1024
right so I want to specify how many
zeros we have so we can actually use
underscore
so again this feature was introduced in
Java 1.7 so that you can differentiate
to a numbers so we can use underscore
okay let's save this and run and we get
one zero four again okay so how to
represent a bunny literal so if you have
to use OB we can either use a small or
we can use not Oh beats zero B so either
we can use small B or capital B so I'm
using a capital B let me write a small B
here and if I run this we can same
output simple so that's it on this video
so for further videos do subscribe and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
