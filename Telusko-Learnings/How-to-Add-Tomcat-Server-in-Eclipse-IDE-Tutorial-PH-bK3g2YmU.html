to create a simple web application or
Java based web application in Eclipse
so the first thing we have to do is we
have to change the perspective of your
eclipse so in the last example we have
seen how to create a Java project it's
because we were in Java perspective now
we have to switch it to Java EE
perspective so you can see there is an
icon here which is Java EE but in case
if you don't have this icon here
so what we can do is we can just click
on this open perspective icon and select
Java EE and click on OK
now it will open Eclipse in a Java EE
perspective so when you talk about Java
Web Application
so either you will be using sublet or
you'll be using JSP for both is na do we
need a web server so I can see in this
server section we don't have any server
so it says no servers are available so
what you can do is you can click on this
no so available and then you have to
expand Apache because when you talk
about web servers
so one of the web server which is very
famous which is Apache Tomcat so we can
select apart a version 7 and then we
click on next now it will ask you for
Apache installation directory so either
you have to download Apache externally
so what we can simply do is we can go to
Google and we'll say download Apache
Tomcat 7 and we click on the first link
it will take you to the website which is
Tomcat dot Apache dodgy and this will go
with the default mirror and we click on
save now once you click on zip it will
download a patch a tomcat which will be
of nine MB and we'll look in something
in this way so when you download it will
be apache tomcat 7.0 point 6 2 version
and what we can simply do is we can just
right click here and say extract here
now once you click on extract here it
will take some time maybe 5 seconds or
10 seconds depend upon the system speed
and you can
there is a folder called as Apache
Tomcat okay we'll open this folder and
say we'll copy this path here because
when you do this part there so once you
copy the path get back to eclipse and
paste that path here so once you say
paste that part you can simply say next
we don't have any project now so we can
simply say finish now once you say
finished there will be a option here
called as apache tomcat 7.0 by default
it is in stopped now we can start it so
I think on this server and say start so
there might be a chance that Apache will
use a port number which is already busy
so basically our change normally uses so
if you double-click on this Apache here
so it will open this prompt and by
default using a port number which is 8 0
8 0 but let's say in your system if you
have 2 Apache and the earlier part a
port number which is Apache Tomcat port
number is 8080 this will give you error
so what we can simply do is we can
change the port number so you can make
it edge rate one edge rate to our
internet for your choice is yours but in
this example we do not need to change
any port number so we can direct link
over the default one which is eight zero
eight zero clear so in this video we
have seen how to configure you our
Eclipse so that you can at least create
a web application so step one we have to
change the perspective to Java II step
two you have to attach a tomcat server
in your machine with Eclipse and you
have to start it now once you've done
this next step will be to create a
simple web application and that we'll
see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
