keyword as a method and this will see
what is super keyword as an object now
let's say let me remove this constructor
you
I don't need constructor now and here
also I will let me remove the
constructor and since by default every
class exchange object so we don't have
to write this let me move this object
also so instead of going for methods or
constructors let me go with the
variables so we'll say int I equal to 5
okay so I have our instance variable
here which is I and the value of I is 5
now if you go here and if you try to
print so if I say oh so let's say if I
create on a method which is a public
void show and this method let me just
define let me just put in the value of I
now you will say this class don't have a
variable I so how will you print since
we are going for inheritance this I will
come down and you can print it right so
your inheritance fetch all the important
properties or all the public properties
from the parent class a knife I create
object of be here if I say be obj P now
if I say obj dot show the output you're
expecting here is 5 right so if I say 1
it will call it will run it will go out
between 5
but what if if I define one more
variable here same I and the values for
so we can define I here also and I hear
also since we are defining I here it
will not fetch this I now so if I
highlight this you can see it's
highlighting this one not this one and
if I run this code they are peaceful but
what if I want the output as 5 I want to
fetch the value of I from the superclass
the only way you can do is we can say
you a or the object of a and then we can
call I now since we are extending that a
why to create an object you can simply
use a cable cutter super so you can
simply say super dot I
Stram this I reference with this I you
can see it is highlighted this I now and
if I run this code they are produce five
right so this is the importance of super
keyboard now what if you have a method
here which is let's say super public
void let's say ABC and one for this VAR
names it's okay for this let's say let's
print a ABC okay so that means it's a
class ABC method and then this also let
me say public wide ABC a little print is
out we'll print be a visa that means
from this show now instead of calling
instead of calling this let me go don't
let me do it let me remove show now I
don't want to show here I don't even
want this I and you make your code very
simple ensure of calling show
let me call ABC now the object we are
using is of be right hence it will also
call it will it can call ABC it's
because we are writing or we don't have
a ABC method in B class right and that's
why it going for a class and if I run
this code because of the a because of
inheritance we can call a we can call
ABC but what if the same method i'm
defining here if i say ABC if I say it's
be ABC the output you'll be getting now
is be ABC it's because we are going for
what writing but I want to call a ABC
from here from this ABC so I can simply
say it is super taught ABC that means it
will call the ABC method of superclass
and if I run this the output is ABC and
be ABC because we are calling ABC of
super and then it will secure further it
will print B ABC this is the this is the
use of super keyword as a object okay so
this super is the object of super class
and I hope you know about this key what
this give it is the object of other it
will call as current instance
simple so this is this is the importance
of super keyboard in ciao thank you so
much for watching and do subscribe for
