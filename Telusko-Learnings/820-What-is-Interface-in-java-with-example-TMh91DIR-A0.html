totally depend upon something called as
interface now say last time we have seen
something called as abstract classes see
whenever you go for the class class
means a block where you'll define
something right you can define your
variables you can define your methods
but the problem is when you don't know
what is the definition of method you
have to declare it I'm going to declare
a method is called as abstract method
that means you have an abstract method
here and a class which has at least one
abstract method is called as abstract
class see last time we have seen this
but a problem is going to go for two
abstract class let's suppose we have a
as abstract class we have B as our
second of stragglers
now again whenever you create a class C
which should define our method it is
declaring abstract method a that is
declared so when we define it but a
problem is when you go for two abstract
class at the same time that suppose a
Java class busiest a class you want this
abstract class definition to be defined
in C that means you will create a class
C this will exchange a and B the problem
is when you go for this terms where a is
class B is class this is called as
multiple inheritance and unfortunately
Java doesn't support multiple
inheritance
so here in order that we want Java
should support multiple inheritance we
have to use interfaces now they talk
about interfaces the concept of
interface is almost like concept of
abstract class the only difference is
we'll talk about abstract class they are
class way talk about intervals they are
interface again in after class you can
declare the method in interface also you
can declare a method but in after in
abstract class you can at least
defines a method in interface you cannot
define any method that means
interphase you can only declare in a
static a second declare and you can
define now let's talk about object you
cannot create the object of abstract
class in the same way you cannot get an
object of interface but the thing is if
a and B if in this term if a and B is
your interface now if you create a new
class as Class C this class can use a
comma B because this time a and B are
not class they are interface that means
whenever you whenever you take interface
in Class C when you go for class and
close it is exchanged when you go for
interface and class it is implements
because in interphase you only declare
that means a new class which will be
using that interface will be defining it
and different terms so you can say it as
implementing it so now we have to use
something called as implements so now
plus C implements a comma B and this
class C should define each and every
method which is declaring interface
again not just one interface both
interfaces right nothing in this way
let's open a simple example in case if
you have to if you want to make AI
interface it's very simple you just have
to use a keyword interface just like you
are using a keyword called as class so
interface a again we can we can declare
in a method by default interface has
public methods so public void show again
my dear we are only declaring it
semicolon we are not defining it okay
this is your first interface and in case
if you want to implement this interface
again we cannot use interface directly
because the thing is the method which is
only declared is of no use we want its
definition so for defining you require a
class then suppose class name is B which
is
sorry it's not extensive which is
implementing the Class A so Class B
implements Class A and now we are we
have to define this method example it's
public why so and Here I am just
printing a statement is system dot out
dot bring and now I'm reading here it's
hello C as it's as simple as that you
have a interface which is declaring a
show method a class which is defining a
show method but let's imagine this class
has a new method called as void this
blip again you can do it and this is
displaying hi that means this method
prints hello this method means hi again
when you create object of Class B let's
suppose you have an object of Class B as
the object equal to nu B here when you
use object obj this object can call both
the methods winners when you say obj dot
show yeah between call because show
Valastro vision when you say it obj dot
display this will again call the method
display again this is possible but the
problem is I don't want any user to you
use this this method I just only want to
the user should use this method I mean
that means I am restricting him to use
this method and you can do it you know
when you go for interface interface has
only one declaration that is show and
I've got the user should use from the
show further I'd make an object of e
again it's not possible because to
create object we require constructors
and we have to define constructors
and in the face you cannot define
anything that means you cannot click you
cannot create constructor that means you
cannot use constructor that means you
cannot create objects but we can create
reference because C to create reference
with don't require constructors that
means if I say a OB change this is the
reference of a knife this statement and
if suppose I am giving a memory of B it
is possible because whenever you say
interface interface to create the object
of interface we just require memory with
creating the reference and the memory
will be coming by B that means
indirectly have an object which is of a
and this time if I say obj dot show yes
this will this will execute because show
belongs to a but when I say obj dot
display this is not possible because
this play does not belongs to a
interface it belongs to B class and I am
restricting a user from using this
display and this is why interface are
you know largely used and this is the
importance of interface first thing
interface helps you to use multiple
inheritance in Java and second thing it
provides you security right this is
interface thank you that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
