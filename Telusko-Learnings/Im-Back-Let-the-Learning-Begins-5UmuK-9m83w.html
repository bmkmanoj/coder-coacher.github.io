don't know how quick the audio is okay
it seems I'm life so welcome back agents
were they are back after a break of
almost one month now a little video on
16th fair for not wrong and it's it's 18
knots almost one month and so we are
back we are back with a bank so there
are so many things on TV and people are
saying are you watching ticket I was
watching it again but it took me a long
time to set up my mobile phone because
we weren't using a different phone
because the other phone I don't have
enough charge so I'm using this phone
here and it took me some time to say
that sets it up because the handle was
is not restored here so we can say yes
once again and back and so that's the
learning begins you know there are so
many things which is coming on the way
after the break sometimes don't know a
lot of videos I will not reveal the
concept of the topics now I will make in
a separate video on what to expect in
the next three months from three
spellings this time I will be doing a
promo planning with that I will be
uploading our videos okay so
straightforward without much operations
itself okay so if you like it let me
know this code and let me know the if
India is bidding okay so let's get back
to the question everyone and it seems
good it seems everything seems good
they're streaming seems cursed and how
about the audio I don't know about the
audio here I'm just using a mobile phone
I'm not even used to you can see that
I'm from a vacation I told you our
proper setup rise up now and you can see
I'm using my heart please not the usual
place so everyone knows okay okay the
questions okay so people are saying
waiting oh okay my bad
so yes say is hi says what you see you
again yeah that's great that's I'm happy
to be back
are they still are things okay so
pushing from big shot at yes hello sir
I'm not good in
solving so should I learn designing
going Java if you're not problem solving
I would say coding you see it's many
talk about coding it's all about the
industry the page you saw coding is not
that important from Sonic is very
important so first of all it's not that
you cannot do it try to improve yourself
from so many skills is not that
difficult you just have to work hard or
practice every day there are different
questions and try
whether the goods wait
the other the next thing is even it is
nothing is a good option if you just
need to recreate you I feel if you want
to create or designing a creativity is
very important a stomach is not much
streaming that it should not just one
not just I guess this'll add okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
