we talk about web pages now web page is
our page which will be having some
content which you require so then
suppose if you want Wikipedia
information if you want to search about
anything like suppose what is Java so
you can type on Google what is Java you
will open a page ok that a page will be
called as web page normally web pages
are of two types
okay one is static web page second is
running web page now if we talk about
creating a web page normally we have
this up this markup language called as
html5 l you create web pages right now
we are no not some people ask me all the
difference between static web page done
a web page the problem with a books is
you know if you learn those server
languages like PHP if you learn about
Java of JSP if we learn about ASP all
these languages are server-side
programming now if we talk about this
languages it was on so which stick
people still don't know it is static and
dynamic you know so the basic concept
about static and dynamic is not that
difficult you know already the only
thing is maybe you do not know the names
ok six-way simple think about this let's
suppose you have this line and you have
this soap ok again sizes in vitam trying
to small walls always big doesn't matter
it's a good good machine big so small
machine small machine so let's suppose
this can be your voice from this can be
your computer this can be your laptop
this can be your iPad so if it all about
lines we have different types of clients
we have solvers we have different
observers but every machine client
machine require a web client web server
web client and normally web client what
be use is browsers so Google Chrome is
your web client Firefox is your web
client opener is your vector
so let's suppose we have client and we
have a so now every server will be
having our disk okay all the web pages
will be freed into this disk and this is
called as a Passover disk or you can say
a database of web pages this is your web
server so now this is your client this
is your server this is your disk tonight
will request to a server
he will ask you for a page okay a
pre-defined of pre-designed or
pre-developed page right content is
already there design is already
mentioned everything is specified you
have the file in the disk client will
ask you for the page so ball will go to
disk and it will pick up the page and
since your back so you send a request
server sends a request oh I'm sorry
server gives you response so you send a
request server gives your response you
ask for our webpage so now goes to the
disk it pickups the web page and gives
you back done right but the problem is
in this world you know if you are living
in this advanced world where we have all
dynamic contents example if we talk
about Facebook so Facebook is a website
where you have this first login page now
for every person login page is same so
you can say login page is type pitch
right because you have predefined page
on this disk you ask for the page it
gives you the page but the problem is if
we talk about your own friend list so on
Facebook once you log in you will get
your own home page you will get your own
friend list so design is same for
everyone but data changes right and
that's why those pages are really don't
exist we have to create those pages on
user request it means when the line
request for a web page
which is Dunning web page server already
don't have that page server needs to
create those page and that's why when I
talk about dynamic web pages or dynamic
servers design changes so you have a
client here you have a server here this
always called as web server this is your
bed kind now your data is somewhere here
a database or a real database it can be
your our DBMS it can be your Big Data
so everything is stored here right so if
you look if you want data from this disk
which is actual database your web server
works with HTML
the problem is HTML cannot interact with
database right because hTML is not a
programming language it's a markup
language so markup language cannot deal
with database and that's why you require
some advanced application server here it
means your web client will ask the data
from web server it will check it is a
client is asking for the static web page
all tunning web page if this static web
page which has his own disk so it will
go to disk and it will give you the
spawns but if that page is dynamic it
means it is not already present you have
to create at that time your web server
will interact with application server
right and that's why this is your
application server and application
server will interact with database it
gets by the data and will give back to
web server and web server will give
extra point so static page client
requests in the server server gives you
these forms done in the page the line
entry crazy server so I don't out the
page it will interact with App Engine
server will ask you for the data appears
I will go to database process the data
and gives it back so finally what you
are getting is web page like don't even
know that he is asking for the static
page
in tiny pitch it all matters is a page
what light is getting a page so if your
static page give it given by solo which
the link page you have to use
application server and now if we talk
about web servers we have different
different web servers but if you talk
about application servers again we have
different types example you can use you
can use JBoss nicely wrapping a server
you can use this web logic you can use
web logic you can use WebSphere you have
many application servers right but if
you talk about this all gives with all
the Java ok so if we talk about again
server you can have different different
language to work with a given server
normally here then we require some
languages to enter to create application
servers right and you all learn those
languages like to create a web page or
equal HTML but to create application
server which will process from database
you require languages right and those
languages one of the language is PHP now
PHP is open source so if you want to go
for open source technology amazing then
second is ASP now it is also called as
classic ASP so if you want to work with
dotnet so we have to go for asp.net so
ASP without daunted is for his classic
is so you can use PHP or ASP how you can
use JSP there is P stands for active
server pages by Microsoft JSP javaserver
pages now from Oracle you can also use
JSF you can use starts you have multiple
application server languages so if you
want to create a dynamic website with
Dani web pages you require one of these
languages ok so if you talk about
Facebook PHP if we talk about online
secure sites JSP and if we talk about
normal web sites all you know majorly
fit on our website that they are
developed in asp.net so open source
portable PA
speak Windows oriented Microsoft
oriented language ASP and if you want to
go for secure if you have to go for
portability go for JSP again choice is
yours it's all depend upon requirements
now there are some programmers is depend
upon requirement so let's suppose I have
program what if I want to create our web
page or a website so it depend upon nice
requirements I will change my technology
so client is warned of a good-looking or
a flexible website PHP a client is
looking with the power you know looking
for a secured JSP so we have different
requirements we have different
technologies and this is what when you
say in static webpage and telling web
page static means face a page all is it
present dynamic page not available you
have to make an available with the help
of application so so thanks for watching
I hope it helped and please subscribe
