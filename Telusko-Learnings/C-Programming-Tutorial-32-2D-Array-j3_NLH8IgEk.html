is 2d adits it is two dimensional array
so as we see in the last video what is
one dimension that is you have so if you
have four variables of similar types we
can create an array right
so we can simply say we have int Z so
let's imagine we have we have our Z addy
here which has four elements now let's
say we have one more array so this add a
name is X so in in in X added we have
some elements which is from let's say 3
5 7 9 and we have one more array which
is let's say Y and we can specify values
as 8 comma 5 comma 2 comma 1 and need
any line of values and in we have so
that we have three edges and each array
will have four elements so what we can
do here is we can specify a end notion
of creating two different arrays we can
create one big array which will have
these three areas so imagine four cups
so if you have four cups you can you can
carry those four cups in one tray but if
you have three trays so what you will do
is you will carry a big box in that big
box will be having three different trays
okay in the same manner of having three
different areas we can create a big
array or two-dimensional array which
will have these three arrays will name
that array as we say double or D array
so this to represent this as a
two-dimensional if we have to use two
square brackets okay
and here to specify the number of a DS
which is the number of rows and columns
I imagine this is we have three rows we
have three rows and we have four columns
right so we can specify it as three and
here for okay so we have three rows and
four columns
how to assign these values so let me
remove this variable names just to
explain it in better way okay so this
row number is zero this row number is
one and this one number is two and same
goes with the column so this is the
first column
I will say this is 0 column 1 column 2
column and 3 column so to assign a value
to this low or this this value here
which is specify this is 0 &amp;amp; 1 right so
it's time to the 1 so the first value so
the assign value to 1 you have to say a
off Nova not a d of two brackets 0 and 0
will be 1 so that's your first value
then D of 0 and 1 so can you imagine
this value so this is 0 1 which is 2 so
that's 2 here okay and then we can just
go set all the values so that's one way
we can specify 0 then next value will be
2 right so 2 which is let's say 3 values
3 and then D of 0 and 3 it will be 4 now
once you finished with that value that's
let's go for the next set of values
which is 3 5 so we have to say D of 1
and 0 if you specify this as 3 and then
this goes on so you can specify 1 of 1 1
off to one of three one off then then 2
of 0 so you got the point right so
instead of assigning this values in this
way if you know the value specifically
we can assign this values directly to
the added now how to so before assigning
/ key to the 2-dimensional array let's
see how to assign this value to single
dimensional array so let's say I want to
assign this values to single dimensional
arrays so we have to say Z now when you
were to assign static values we do not
have to specify the size here and then
we can provide our curly brackets in
this cuddly package you can specify 1
comma 2 comma 3 comma 4 so these are you
can assign a value to one dimensional
array let's sign this a value to a
two-dimensional array but not 1 al you
will be having the whole box here
so in this two-dimensional array will be
having let's provide a curly brackets so
this will have so I'm just and I'm just
have just entered this line and then two
curly brackets so this curly bracket
will have elements right but these are
not element this is these are itself
they are added so
to say addy the first daddy second addy
and the third addy
first and it will have 1 comma 2 comma 3
comma 4
the secondary will have 3 comma 5 comma
7 comma 9 and third I will have 8 comma
5 comma 2 comma 1 okay just to make it
more readable let's enter here so we are
creating a two dimensional array and so
we got this is your one dimensional
array this is two dimensional if we can
even create two dimensional if we can
you win given create four dimensional
array you can have multiple dimension at
it so here we have created two
dimensional array let's print this
values now how to print we have to say
again printf we have to specify the type
of the value so we have to say person D
and in drag you to specify D so let's
say I want to print seven years so to
specify seven you have to say one of two
so D of one of two right and if I run
this you should get a value which is
seven man
yeah here we go we got a value which is
seven but I don't want to print one by
the I want to put all the values so for
that whenever you want to print any
struck any format which is in matrix
format in this way we have to use nested
for loop side as we have seen in the fat
and so if you are not seeing my pattern
video so do watch those videos so we'll
see we'll assign about so for us we
require two variables just to count the
number of rows and columns we'll say I
and J and we'll start with zero because
whenever you talk about arrays start
with zero in the number of call in the
number of for those we have the three
rows so we have to stop it at two so if
you say less than three not equal to
three
make sure you don't include equals there
and then inside we have one more for the
which starts which is J which will be
counted by J we start with zero J less
than four this time because we have four
columns and J plus plus and inside this
will say printf double quotes
I mean person D will say a space just to
represent and space will say D off so
show of 0 comma 0 of 0 comma 1 we can
specify I of J ok that's how you have to
print the values so if you run this code
now you can see we got all the values
from the array but we want it in our
matrix format right so what we'll do is
after the inner for loop will print F
and we'll just bring the newline that's
it nothing much will print a new line
and you can see we got an output in a
matrix format so that's how you have to
use two dimensional array in C so just
to make a quick recap so in one damage
in one variable you can have one value
in an a/d you can have multiple values
in two-dimensional array we can have
multiple areas okay so that's why we
have to give two black gets here want to
specify number of rows and I get two
tops with a number of columns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
