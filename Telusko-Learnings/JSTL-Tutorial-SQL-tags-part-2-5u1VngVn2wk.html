ready and in this video what we'll do is
we will try to complete the last example
the example which we are trying to
complete so we have connected with the
database using data source and then we
have also applied the query here which
is Rick star from gadgets let us try to
face data now you have to make sure that
when you fetch the data we we use we use
this library which is math so connector
can you see that I have added that
library here that means I expand this so
I have added that library here which is
math so connector okay and it should be
that inside web app library now once you
have done that we need to also take one
more tag library for fault code because
we will be using a for each loop here so
we said tag lip prefix will say okay so
this should be SQL right because you're
working with SQL and this would be C
okay and then we specify the URI equal
to in this we have to specify the code
tag so this is cold and this is SQL and
let's use a enhance model to print all
this element so we'll say ctrl C I mean
we'll say C which is a code tag with say
C colon SQL or not SQL values for H and
sheer will specify from where you want
to face that for that you have to say
items now this items will be having list
of elements right but hold on from where
you'll be getting this list of element
so you will be getting this list of
elements from RS because R is a result
set why'd you have to fetch one by
element you have to say R s dot Rose so
this Rose will give you the list of
elements and then you can store it
inside you can store one value somewhere
you can say you can store that value and
let's say a row so one row will have one
row right and now we can print that row
we can say colon out will say value
equal to and we can fetch we can print
the value here we can say I want to
print row of or maybe not row let's
let's use something better we say gadget
which will look better right and we'll
say here gadget
. we can print what we can print gid
then we can also after that we can print
okay is it working something is missing
here
you turn this tag okay and then we can
also print the weekends with us with
that : in between we can print the name
of the gadget so we can print the name
here and then with a colon in between we
can print the price of it so we'll print
the price okay so it will print
everything now let's try let's try let's
see it is working or not let's go to the
browser okay that's weird
and if I say enter you see that we got
the values here but hold on we are not
getting the names because it is not
named it is gee names and if I say enter
you got all the cards here it's just
that we have not added a break break
before so we say break here and we'll
say enter you can see we got all the
records from our database right so
that's how we can use SQL data source to
press that value okay so this is how you
can use SQL data source to fetch the
value from database and you can do that
with your pop gstl and see how powerful
it is now if you look if you if any Java
programmer or any HTML designer can
understand this you know we don't have
any java code there right so the gesture
is that powerful so let's say from this
video we have talked about SQL tags or
SQL the SQL ties in jst and if you liked
