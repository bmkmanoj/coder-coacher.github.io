prerequisites for Android programming
now there are two basic prerequisites
that you should know one is XML and
second is Java hold on is not that
difficult you should know about XML
basics of XML now everyone knows about
HTML right so you already have maybe you
have already designed a web page so if
you know HTML it is very easy to learn
XML it's all about tags the difference
will be in HTML you have all predefined
tags in XML you can have your own tags
but the thing is Android itself they
have their own tags and then you have to
use Android tags in XML ok again there
are lots of things you should know in
XML but not now you should know about
the basics of XML once we start with the
programming you will get to know lots of
different tags available okay
so thing is you should know about tags
you should know about how to create what
what are tags inside tag how to assign a
value to a tag that's it and if you know
all those things in XML you are good to
go the next thing you require is Java
knowledge now not everything in Java
some of the core features of Java the
basics of java so if you're no you
should know about the oops concept oopss
object oriented programming system you
should know about optimization about
class you should know how to get a class
you should know how to extend a class
which is inheritance you should know
polymorphism update or you should know
about abstraction how to create abstract
classes most important about
encapsulation so if you know about the
O's concept then we can you should know
about interfaces now interval is very
important because when you walk on
Android application so there are there
were lots of time you will be using
existing libraries you we have to import
existing libraries and maybe in those
libraries you'll be having interfaces so
you should have a basic idea about
interface so that I think you should
know but you should also know some extra
things so that it will be helpful for
you to learn Android very easily some
something called as exception handling
because in your application there might
be lots of exceptions so you have to
enter the those exceptions with the
again Java code so you should know about
exception handling
next will be threads because if we talk
about mobile market now
while mobile phones now we have multiple
cores right we will be having a single
core processor we have multi core
processor which is dual core quad core
maybe octa-core just imagine we have
octa-core CPUs now so what you want your
application should be able to use all
the course and to make it work you
should know the concept of threads maybe
you're building a web-based application
you when you want to send a request to
the server I can you should have a
knowledge of threads so it will be
helpful if you know exception handling
you know I powered threads now one way
advant one more thing you should know is
about the listeners and adapters what is
listener so let's say you're creating an
application where you want to click on a
button and of course right when you use
an application you have buttons you have
you have Scrolls so you have to apply
something else listeners how to learn
about listeners if you if you have ever
learned about swing in Java so in swing
we use buttons we use labels we use we
use text fields so there we apply
listeners so if you have a knowledge
about swing it will be helpful for this
this series so again there are lots of
things in Java you should know basics of
it not the deep knowledge so I will be
having the list in the description area
don't worry about hold on from where you
will learn all those things or if you
already know about these things
how will you brush them for your concept
for that I have my own videos on Java so
you can just go back to the tutorials
take one or two day off don't just rush
towards Android now start with Java and
then learn and why because it's very
easy to learn Android but the thing is
you should know about the cool part of
Java
if you don't know Co Java that is
difficult to learn Android ok so I will
be pitched alway I will be having all
the links in its description area so
there are two plic wizards you should
know before starting android and in the
next video we will talk about
prerequisite you should have in your
machine so that you can write android
codes so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
