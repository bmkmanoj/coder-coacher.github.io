constructor notice constructor so let's
say we have a class called as ABC and in
this class I let me create the object of
this class so we'll say ABC and then
we'll say obj now when you write this
statement ABC ABC obj
now this obj will be called as reference
now in order to in order to instantiate
this obj we need to use a new keyword
now new keyword is responsible to give
the memory and then we need to provide a
method which is ABC with a black kid so
when you have any one you use this round
bracket this defines it's a method right
but hold on this is not normal method
this method has the same name as last
name you can see we have ABC class name
that means it's a method which has the
same name as your class name and that's
why this type of methods are called as
constructors so here this ABC is a
constructor now how to then where is
this method we have not defined this
right now this is this is where your JVM
comes into picture right so JVM provides
you a constructor by default and that
constructor is public ABC so even if you
don't write it it has this default
method which is ABC with bracket which
is your constructor and a point to be
noted constructor has the same name as
last name and constructor never returns
anything and that's why we don't agree
to write this return type here so let's
see how to call a constructor do I need
to call obj dot ABC is it is it
applicable you can see we are getting an
error right it says we are not able to
find this thing at the method well as
ABC it's because you cannot call
constructor explicitly so let's say if I
have a statement here in ABC cons to
define is the constructor or to a B in
ABC Const since we cannot call this ABC
let's see the output and the output will
be in ABC Const that means this is
getting called but when
whenever you create an object it will
automatically call the constructor clear
so constructor has these three
properties first one constructor has the
same name as class name second
constructor never returns anything and
third one constructors get call when you
create the object or you can say when
you when you instantiate the object it
will automatically get called now you
can have different types of constructors
we can have constructor or default
constructor or you can have
parameterised constructor that is
default constructor default consider is
something which you don't need to write
it is not compulsory to write
constructor right but let's say if you
want to pass some parameters let's say
if you want to pass into I then this
type of constructors are called as
parametrized constructor now how to use
parametrized constructor that we'll see
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
