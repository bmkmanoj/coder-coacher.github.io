called less abstract class see again we
talk about class and objects pick
something like if we have some idea in
your mind it is called as class if you
have some reality objects it is called
as object it's something like if you
create an object required class to
define you know what objects should do
which are defined in class now here let
suppose you have imagination you know
something you want to create a whole
pile which will be having a front facing
camera a back facing camera and a flash
on both side now we talk about today's
spoon it has backlight on one side on
back side you want a flash flash to be
on front side also this is your own
concept that means you have a class here
which have which defines that in this
object you should have one camera you
have a back camera you should have front
light and backlund but the problem is
when you want to imprint a front light
on your mobile phone
it's your new concept the only thing is
you don't know how it will work that
means it is a method which is you don't
know what what omegle actually does that
means you only know there should be a
bad light out up front right what it
does you don't know that means this
method you cannot define and the method
cannot define you have to declare it and
the methods which is only declared a
call as abstract matter it's something
like again the same class I suppose we
have played in our mobile phone so class
like mobile now here if you define some
with us like public void for camera so
you have to define it if you want a bad
light you require public void yeah like
now you know what back like does that
means when you define backlight it's
something
we knew when you want to take some
photos the backlight get on or something
else flashlights when you want to use a
lit torch you can use your backlight as
torch you don't know what your film
camera will do so you have public boy
your it's red light now you know you
don't know what when Tigers you only
know there should be something or less
front line that means here you don't
know what will define that means you
have to declare that means a matter
which is declared you cannot define it
nice colors
abstract so the matter which is only
declared not defined it is for the
abstract matter now class which has at
least one abstract metal as far as
abstract class so in shock emitter which
is only Clarisse college abstract matter
class which has at least one abstract
metal scholars abstract class now the
features you cannot create object of
abstract class it's so simple you want
to create a mobile phone like an object
you have a concept which should be which
having a front light now the problem is
you are making a mobile phone you know
there should be a front light what it
does you don't know that means this no
you know there's no logic to lapping of
oble phone you are having a front camera
on a front line but no use that means if
you want a mobile phone that means you
have to you have to define the way
different light will walk that means if
you want to create object you cannot
read object of this class because this
class is abstract class now in case if
you have to use this method that means
you have to create
new plus for this it's my new balloon
its new mobile and you have to exchange
you have an abstract class really upset
classes move re now when I will define
an abstract class right
if you expense a new plans with abstract
class you have to define each and every
matter which is abstract in the best
class for abstract class we define all
these methods now this class will be
called as concrete plus and this one is
called as abstract plus now in any case
if you fail to define this method
different front light method in this
class this clause also become abstract
class so that means it something in this
way you have a mobile phone or mobile
class which is abstract so this like
this lines are abstract you're creating
a new class call as new mobile now in
this mobile class you haven't one
abstract method called as thread line if
you expense this abstract class in this
class that we shall be define different
like in this method or in this class now
if you fail to define that method in
this class this class also becomes
abstract that means you have to define a
new class called as it will be new new
worthless in this if you have to declare
or you have to define the method which
is declare that means the abstract
method in this class carries to discuss
and the abstract method which is in this
class we have to define in this class
and if you are successful in defining
the method in this class now this class
will recall as concrete that means your
aim is to develop an object and you can
we make objects of concrete class you
cannot make object of abstract class so
your focus should be on concrete class
and this is your abstract class that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
