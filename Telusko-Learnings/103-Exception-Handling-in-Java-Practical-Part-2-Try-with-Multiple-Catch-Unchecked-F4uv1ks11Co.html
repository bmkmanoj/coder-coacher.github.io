exception now if we remember if I pry if
I print the value let me just after this
zero
let me also print the value of e if you
observe the type of error it is throwing
is arithmetic exception not exactly at
the vitamin exception is it's a it's a
subclass of exception let's just check
how it works let me just write here
instead of exception let me write
automatic exception okay and let's see
what is exactly I admit exception means
so if I go to this class either
exception arithmetic exceptions extends
a runtime exception that means if you
are this example here we have added
matter exception or exception right and
this item in exception is a plus of
runtime exception now let's see what is
it exactly the entire exception is if I
go to click on run time exception Ren
time exception extends exception as we
have seen here it is run time it is
exception right and if I go to exception
again how to jump from class to class
just type just press control and click
on the class name and you can see this
exception here exchange throw able
except through ever class so this is the
whole hierarchy right and all these data
are data
I've been fetch from Java Docs so in it
means you have in Bill Java talk so
nothing to worry about download all
those files okay
now let's let's move towards next next
type of arrow let's say I taken a let me
take an array here so let's say I have
an array of names a I will say new int
and the size of my arrays for simple and
let me add some values in that so let me
add some values we'll say int I equal to
0 because index will start with 0 not I
it is time to see a counter see and see
less than equal to 4 and c plus plus
right and let me say the value of will
not print here on to say
we'll say a of C is equal to C plus 1
that means the value of this array will
start with a 1 it will go till 4 right
this is what we expecting right now let
me just run this run this code again the
only error we are expecting is this
right that means I admit exception
cannot divide by 0 if you're on this
code Oh
with this bug awake we got only one
error well quiet regard D okay all right
now let me just bring this values how to
put int values we can use enhanced
for-loop will say int may be running out
the variables names so let me say int P
I will say into value from a let me
print all the values of a which is a
value okay and let me just run this code
and for loop is not working
now why ah it's because your K is
throwing an error right is because the
value of J is 0 let me just make the
value as 2 so that see the problem is
when - once you get this error here it
is directly jumping to the catch
statement what I want to continue this
block right so let me just remove that
either biting - if I run this code boom
you are getting one more error and that
is your array index out of bounds
exception which simply means the size of
your array is 4 and the number of values
you are storing is 5 see this starting
with 0 it is going to 4 that means 0 1 2
3 4 5 or 5 if we have I getting five
elements right that means we have values
0 1 2 3 4 that means we are getting 5
elements and that's why it's giving an
error
so what we should do is we should remove
this equal to here but let us see how to
handle it
type of edit it has thrown is added
index out of bounds exception what it
means with this one at with this one try
you can write multiple catch and the
second catch will be add a index out of
bounds exception will say again e and
will print here maximum number of values
is four so you cannot only four elements
write an iPod on this the same error it
will call maximum number of value is
number of values is four simple so that
means we can have multiple catch with
one try so we have two catches here with
one try and this is how you can you can
go with one try with multiple caches
okay and the remaining part we'll see in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
