draw this pattern with the help of two
nested for-loops
so what if we can just use one nested
for loop to plane this pattern is it
possible let's try it out so let me
remove this the second for loop let's
focus on the first nested for loop here
now instead of printing five rows let me
play nine rows at at the same time so
let me read nine rows okay and if I run
this code if I run this code with the
nine rows you can see we got this output
but it we don't want this right what we
want
after the fifth row when you go for the
sixth to ninth row your the value of
your J should decrease right so how to
achieve that so for sure something has
to happen
after your I becomes greater than five
right or I if you have got a value is
greater than five then we need to do
something way to do one way to do
something when your eyes it is in five
and if you observe we just want to print
a J four times here three times here two
times here and one time here so if you
just add the value of I and J so your
value of I here will be 500 I sex and
your J is 4 right so 6 plus 4 is 10 I
here will be 7 and J is 3 so again 7
plus 3 is 10 then we have 8 plus 2 is 10
and 9 plus 1 is 10 right so so it should
print only when your i plus j is equal
to equal to 10 if it goes about 10 if it
goes about 10 we can simply say break
because we do know we don't want to
print in that way if it goes about 10 I
don't want to plan this and if I run
this code you got the pattern right
quite simple so once again something
should happen when your I values greater
than 5 okay
and even if I I think it should find on
this let me remove this code just for
the experiment purpose and if I run this
code or we got the same output so we
don't require that 5 days a week if if
your I plus J value is greater than 10
that means
uh.if here if you are what if you're J
value is five we've got the same output
is it I'll make me write run this once
again okay so if your J value is or I
plus J is goes about ten then we have to
say break quite simple right so that's
how you can achieve this pattern in one
nested for-loops
so guys from this video so if you have
liked this video do subscribe and thanks
