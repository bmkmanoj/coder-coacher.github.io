boot is a character-building it's a it
so you can see that we have definition
here taken up optioning ated view of
building productions very spring
application right so you can make a
spring application which is ready to
deploy okay now what are the
prerequisites for this session so if you
are not messing with the prerequisite
then please please understand they try
to understand the concept because if it
don't know some basic stuff which will
be very difficult for you to understand
this not as a prerequisite for this
session first of all you should know
basic Java it will be better if you know
some it and JSP update off it's not
exactly the thing but what exactly does
it mean another base another thing is
how to use Eclipse that is something you
should know before going for this
session these so going height of the
session if the thing is matching with
you you can just close the session that
fine should be no XML Quantic as well
yes - will be better if you know XML
right so the topic for today is spraying
work okay so the how the sessions will
be going so for suppose we talk about
soffit and JSP so we'll make a simple
web simple you know simple code where we
can simply add two numbers that fit
nothing else so we'll add two numbers so
we'll go for its addition of two numbers
and then also that will be done that
will be that will be done using speaker
servant and JSP and then once you have
talked about service and JSP which will
of course much playing a way of
flickering a lot i don't know whatts
what is going wrong here
okay it's not triggering now okay yeah
so we'll be going for service and DSB
first and then we'll move towards
springboard so we'll see how to exactly
this to beat this can be done in spring
boat so let's start the tank so first of
all I will open my clips and let's add
two numbers using so with a JSP yeah I
can see the eyes thing is flickering and
what is going wrong here so just try to
this tight like this now so we click on
next and then we'll go for so we create
a new project here and we'll say this
new project is equal to others and we
select spring or not fling but we'll
select a web project or not web project
oh I guess I'm not in a proper I'm a
Java EE yes we are let's put a new
project here we'll say new denied web
project and when you satanic web project
will say this is a demo servlet
application in fact I told you I already
have that project there we simply set
demo project and what I do now is I want
to add two numbers right so first of all
we need a ways of we need a HTML page
right so with it HTML page here we say
this page is index dot HTML and then
we'll say yeah so still flickering when
I type something on a dice will it work
now okay
so I think it will not it will not stick
or now so when I say form or something I
guess whatever the color is changing it
is the screen is getting thicker
okay so because a form tag here and when
I say form I will say action and I will
say add add add
so we are going to say add and then I'm
here what I will do is I will say type
so don't worry the session is getting
recorded and the video will be uploaded
on YouTube as well so so yeah suppose if
they say input type equal to text and we
say input type equal to text and we'll
say name equal to t1 so we simply add
two numbers I get this is a simple
simple code for addition of two numbers
so main mean our main idea is not to go
for a big code by 200 steps to
understand why was the use of Swing boat
and then we required a button here with
the input type equal to submit okay now
when I click on the submit button what I
want to do is I want to call this ad but
there's a fault hand to handle had we
don't have anything right so we say demo
new and we say so it is a servlet here
because we want to handle the request
right we need to really something we
using which we can add two numbers and
then so will say calm dot that is called
as a package name and we say this class
name is add servlet the things we want
to add two numbers and now people who
don't know how it that's fine because we
are not here to and we are not here to
understand servlet we are here to
understand was the use of string boat
okay so we have a servlet here and
whenever like whenever I request for
whenever I send a request for ADD so
whenever I send a request for ADD it
will call this particular servlet which
will which is your add servlet right and
here in here what we'll do is so we have
to patch those two values now when you
say you want to fetch those two values
you have to explicitly mention integer
dot power and yes guys if the screen is
flickering I don't know what with what's
going wrong there might be some issue on
from the network
in fact when I was trying to connect you
to session it was taking lots of time so
we'll say request dot getparameter to
face the value will say t1 and then
we'll say a copy and paste now since we
are so what we are doing here is we are
fetching those two values now if you do
if you don't know sublet please try to
understand we are placing the values if
you know so that you know what I'm doing
right what I'm doing is whatever value
we are passing here with t1 and to to t2
that goes into this ad solves it right
and then we can simply add those two
values will say int k equal to I plus J
now once you've got the value of K I can
simply print the value now how do you
print the value is say ouch dot println
you can print the value which is K and
you are done
once I do this but yeah we have one more
issues we have to first create object or
object of out and that's one of the
issues with which subject you know you
have to create all the object by
yourself you know you always expect that
your your your your Java will give you
something but unfortunately you have to
do everything by yourself so we have to
create object of a printwriter here so
that you can save out dot print of
println okay now if you know this quad
it will work you will be what you will
be getting is is a your addition of two
numbers let's try that we are simply
doing addition of two numbers here okay
so let me just show you the output at
this plinks flickering is really
irritating right okay what I'm thinking
you know I will sure to solve this
session as we can reconnect although it
is tickling now okay is it something you
can adjust by the flickering part of all
we do is I will say H of seven if I
click on the submit where you can see
record the answer is five so what we are
doing here is we are adding no it's not
because of this recalling because I have
done this a lot lot of sign
okay so you can see so we are adding to
deuce together and they got the output
so what's what's important is we got the
output slice but then just to add those
two values we have to do we have to
think about lots of stuff right example
if you if you don't do this conjugation
here what we do in NJ in sublet is you
have to so you have to do in the web
directional file so if you know what I'm
talking about we have to write the web
the XML file here and that so we have
like a lots of work like so you have to
do all this thing when you when you work
with subject you have to press this
value by yourself you have to create
object of enjoyed by yourself and then
you have to you have to print and then
you have to map this by yourself but
then if you the moment to go to string
framework okay in fact we have done one
more thing here I have to add this
Tomcat this this Tomcat thing by myself
like so when when you install eclipse
you have to add a tomcat to your head
lips and there is something which is
very important if you don't do this it
will not work but then spring boot says
hey don't worry I have something
interesting for you if you want to do
the same thing using spring boot what
you have to do is you have to create a
new project but then I'm not using
eclipse here you can see that we I am
going for a different type of IDE GE are
called as spring tool suite
so spring tool switch is unused as you
print IDE compared to eclipse but it is
based on Eclipse this is a flavor type
of eclipse you know it's a different
Eclipse work on together ok so what we
do is here is allocate a new project but
this time I will go for spring setter
project ok and as I mentioned this is a
spring boot project and then we click on
next I will click on web now since we
are creating a website instead we just
have to take a web here so that you will
get all the features then click on next
and click on finish it is so easy to
create a spring food project so it will
take sense it will take some time to
get this downloaded from the internet
okay uh know why it is ticking so much
okay so I got my project here and then I
will open this and then so first of all
we need that XML file right so I will
say right click and we create XML file
here we say a HTML file now again I will
not type everything by myself I will
simply use my oil pool before I click on
finish you can see record HTML but I
don't want to type everything by myself
what I will do is I will go here and it
will copy this code because that's what
we already have like service list will
face that stuff here so positive or to
HTML page what do I fall for add now if
you want to create a servlet vacancy
when you go for server technology you
have to create a class and - class
extension to be servlet and then you
have to get a doing with Duquette method
which takes two objects request and
response object and then you have to
convert the value coming from the coming
from the user that is T 1 and T 2 so
what we can do in Springwood is we can
create a simple class instead of
creating it yourself that you can do a
simple class and we can name this class
and add controller again you can have
any any name that's fine with us now to
make this a controller which can work
with the requests you just have to use
an annotation as ad controller now this
annotations is very important when it
comes to spring framework and that's why
that's well I feel your folder or
concept should be very clear when before
going for the advanced part now what we
can do here is we can say we can create
any normal method we can say public
string hello
a simple method and then we can simply
return whatever you want to return so
what we want to return here is the
addition of two numbers voice but then
whenever I call whenever I call for this
add whenever I call for this add it
should call this method wise but then
how it will call this method so for that
I guess this pond is bit a bit small
there is no single Z font size here
okay so what I'm going to do is but I
want to say for all the four for the as
equals so I will say the quest mapping
because I have to map the request right
for ad request whenever I use a false
for the ad request I want to execute
this method hello and then this hello
will take two parameters so whatever
value you are getting from the user user
getting those parameters here now what
is what are those parameters okay first
of all let me just check is if it is
visible for you on YouTube and guys if
you like this type of sessions do click
on the like button just to let me know
that if you are liking this site this
obsession you can see your messages and
everyone saying is licking a lot okay
yeah so I want to I want to exit those
two values right but to exit those two
values we can actually use one more
annotation here called as the request
PanAm in fact let's not do that what if
I think these changes of see we in
submit what we did is in sublet you are
setting those two values and we were
converting those values into into t1 I
mean we have we were converting those
values into integers right but then in
your table in your Spring Framework in
spring boot you can simply say int I
comma int J okay and then we can simply
return
I love okay that's it again you have to
convert into string what I will do is I
would say oh I will convert that into
string that sighs that's the dodgy we
can use but then whatever value you pass
whatever value you pass your in t1 and
t2 how those value will be assigned here
that's the real confusion
how can you assign t1 and t2 here is it
possible directly yes you can do the
actual food to achieve that we can
simply use one more annotation called as
request param and you will say the value
41 should go to int i let's import the
package for that and value 42 should go
to the value of t2 should go to j and
that's it you don't have to do any
conversion you don't have to specify
anything let us compare this to logic so
compare this to logic this is your
service and look at the code how
irritating it is and look at your
control look at your spring boot MVC
first of all I have just changed this to
rest controller okay look at look at
this code which is much simpler if we
look at it this one or that one in fact
I feel this one is better and there is
one more advantage here the advantages
if we run this code and you can see in
spring boot I have not used
any Tomcat server nowhere I have used a
tomcat server right if I go to the
browser in fire if I search for
localhost:8080 three that's the bottom
of hot spring Buddha you can see regard
hello boys
but that's really don't want how to
avoid what we want is add so I want to
call this page which is new Wilder
extremals it's a new file dot HTML it's
not able to find this file there that's
well whatever it's simply to as I was
simply call the ad in stop wasting more
time that save this work this this work
even this is not working that's weird
why so why it's not working
oh let's run this once again let's say
where's the project I guess the
positions not getting this first was
right-click and we say run ass gonna
spring boot application because when is
unless you have to run it a single
application you can take is working and
it's working and let's take the portable
on which foot is running it is a device
is to the fourth number not a two a
three
let's do that once again and let's call
our new file dot HTML oh it's not
working again what's wrong here let me
just check the other guys does it done
any mapping here so it is doing the
mapping there let's fly with AD is it's
falling ad yes it is calling ad let's
pass the value with the t1 equal to 5
and T 2 equal to H can you see that we
got the output again I'm not able to
call the individuals page that's fine
but you can see we get the output we are
getting the output in spring boot so
nothing spring boot is actually very
easy it makes your work very easy but if
you have noticed we have done one more
thing when it compared with your at
least example we have to add the term
cash right but the moment you do spring
boot project you don't talk to add
tomcat because some cash which can run
your bill which can run your servlet is
embedded in your spring boot and you can
see if I open the Ponte XML file for
that you have you should know it is
novel so just an for XML file again my
intention here is not to teach you what
exactly spring boot work my - when my
main my main idea here is to explain I
mean this will show you that there is
something but a spring boot which exists
in Java frameworks in future if you want
to learn something this is something
which you have to learn so you can see
when you create a spring boot project
you get a embedded tomcat you don't have
to create your own
can you get your thumb get embedded
because we are using a spring boot
strata project make sense so that's the
power of swing boot in fact this is not
just the only for power if you want to
create a database application you can
use swing boot if you want to create a
amazing website you can use swing boot
that's the way we are doing here and it
was reduced a lot of it will reduce lots
of codes it will reduce lots of errors
because they when you work with eclipse
trust me when you try when you try to
write a several application for the
first time there will be lot lots of
issues maybe some diss errors maybe
Tomcat issue right and you have to point
in a lots of stuff but then springboard
says spring boot is not the spring
Buddhism focus more on configuration it
focused more on the walking off weight
so in spring both we focus more on the
working and less on the quantitation and
of course why we are developers we want
more of we want more of logic right
instead of focusing on instead of
focusing on the configuration so if you
if you don't like conjugation spring
boot it for you so I would recommend you
to explore on spring boot there are lots
of tutorials available on YouTube
available on Google just you can XO that
XO them there so that's it that that's
what I wanted to show you the live
session nothing else
by the way it's 12:00 a.m. here so we
were we are talking from one day between
so that's it so that's it on this
session if you like this session do
share this session on your Facebook
profile okay so we have some questions
here we got the questions on the reserve
what's the difference between spring MVC
and spring boot
so basically spring MVC we use spring
MVC to make websites right but then
spring boot is used to make your project
much much easier to work with you can
use spring boot for spring MVC you can
use spring boot for JPA you can use free
you can use ring boot everywhere okay
the spring boot is actually a way of
making a project so that is of this
session do like and share on your
Facebook profile if you like this video
that's a thank you so much for joining I
hope you are enjoying my session so
that's it guys thank you so much for
joining</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
