this this video is nothing but a
continuation of for my last interval
arithmetic operator due to some
interruption like my idea you got shut
up so here I just continue whatever we
have covered so we have covered
something called as addiction operator
okay which is used to add values we have
covered that is what we have also seen
that it is used for concatenation also
if you want to concatenate strings then
also you can use this if you want to
subtract then you can use a subtraction
operator then again we have covered some
of the code as multiplication operator
this is an operator operator which it
runs reminders also we have explored
something called as exponential operator
which is used to return the power okay
off right so this is nothing but this is
automatic operators okay one more
operating operator is there which is
which is like true which is also like
similar kind of division but which used
to return the pushing and with your
removes which removes and I will say
division operator so if you would use
then you will get a value of question
and it removes the decimal values of it
shows abused is not ready to sit out and
to be used there is no protection that
can we get food not fight it but then we
use sure of it and it will remove the
visible value and it returns me it is
already booted vegetable Firefox okay so
this is all about arithmetic of records
right if you liked this video subscribe
