greatest of three numbers now let me
remove this previous example so it's
removed okay so let's say I have three
values let's say I have a B and C so I
have these three values and the values
for this is weak and I guess and values
will say is 4 B is 6 and C is 2 now as
you can see divide the greatest number
is 6 right first L will write a code to
plane this now how to check if a will
write a comment here if a is greater
than B and if a is greater than C that
means a is greater right so we'll say a
is greater so it's a otherwise if a is
not greater now we are sure if this
condition is false if a is not greater
then obviously we don't want to compare
the next thing with a we have to option
then either B is greater or say C is
greater so we can check if B is greater
than C if this is the case then that
means your greater number is B otherwise
the only choice you have is C right so
if a is greater than B and a is greater
than C obviously you're getting embodies
a if this is not the case
then we don't have to compare buttes a
now so we can directly say if B is
greater than C then B is greater
otherwise C is greater now how to write
the same thing in programming so we'll
check if so when you say you want to
check something you have to say if if a
is greater than B then you have to say
and
but unfortunately and it's not a keyword
in C the key word we use to represent
and is this ampersand ampersand now
ampersand ampersand means and and then a
is greater than C if this is the case
we'll say printf
a is greater so a is greater but I don't
want to print the value of I would not
want to print a I want to put in the
value of a so we have to use person D
and here we'll say a now else what we'll
do is we'll say else now again we have
to check now we cannot say only F else
we have to say else if that means if you
want to again check after if you want to
again check then you have to say else if
we'd say bass greater than see if this
is the case will say a print F and here
will sprint will say person D is greater
which is B and then we have to say else
printf will say a person D is greater
this time it should be C right so we
have represented this thing here this
this statements in conditional format so
this is how you have to use if-else
condition simple so this is how you have
to find gators of three numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
