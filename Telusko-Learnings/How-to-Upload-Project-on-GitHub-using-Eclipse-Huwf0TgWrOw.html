ready and in this video we'll talk about
how can we upload a project from eclipse
to github now of course when you have an
eclipse project there are two ways of
uploading it one is the standard way
using a command line so if you use
terminal or command line what you can do
is you can write some commands and you
can push this project on ticket absorber
provided you have a repository there
otherwise we can use Eclipse now which
is an easy way you can use an eclipse to
push your project director to get up now
of course to understand this video you
need to have some basics of gate what it
worries I click it is and what is github
but if you know it you can go with the
video otherwise you have to watch my
previous videos on github now what we
will do is we'll try to push this
project we have a project called as my
code in which I have two files one is
alien and calculator doesn't matter how
much code you have I also have a text
file just to show you we can also upload
a text file I want to upload this
project on github step one would be of
course you need to have a github account
and I do have a github account so it's a
free account the only thing is if you
want a github account which is public
it's free but if you want a private
repository then you have to pay for it
then public is fine for us now if you
can see I have a github Gotama deposit I
get github account and github you create
different repositories for different
things example I do have some dummy
repositories here I have some like I was
doing some live project there so I have
my own repositories here now this step
would be of course you need to have a
repository your own repository and the
way you can do that is by clicking on
this new button when you click on new I
will upload this project on a depository
which is called as flash now flash is
basically my batch name so I'm taking
online courses where you have a batch
one is flash so I'm doing it for them so
we have a flash as a badge as a batch as
a depository name you can have any
deposit and doesn't matter you can use
flash you can see ABC you can say P Q P
Q it doesn't matter and you have to save
Sonic public of course and then Y public
is because it's free otherwise when you
click on cloud you have to pay for it
and then we'll click on create a
positive and you call
to Depository here now in this episode
Korea can you get further instruction if
you want to do it in command line
otherwise you just try to remember this
this link you can fact you can copy this
link and you can have with you so copy
this link we will use this link in the
in the subsequent step now once you've
got this link with you this is the main
repository link you have you can see we
have got flash dot gate now once you
have this link with you let's go back to
eclipse now in our Eclipse or before
that I just want to verify one more
thing if I click on this flash now you
can see this repository is empty you
don't have any repositories here also
the the projects here now what I'm going
to do is and I'm in my Eclipse I will
try to push this project now this step
would be right click on the project
first and there's the option of team now
in this team you have to first of all
share this project so of course you need
to share this project in order to upload
github now when you share you have to
first push this project on your local
git repository and if you have installed
gate that's great otherwise you have to
follow the steps luckily if you are
using Mac be by default ever get
installed if you are using windows then
of course you have to install gate so
there's a different procedure to ask how
to install gate ok now once you have
here once you come here when you say
create repository this is a fault this
is for local one and I can select my own
repositories here or we can create a
repository I can say this is for so this
so it will so this will create a local
repository for me I will say my
repository name is flash again it's not
compulsory to have that name but then
that's fine it you can have the same
name on the local and the server you can
have a different name this doesn't
matter
click on finish and we got a local
repository this is a local repository
for me and nothing to mention here click
on finish now we got our repository now
but this will be a local repository ok
now how do we know that's a local
deposit how do you know that it is share
you can see we got this know head thing
and you can see this question mark that
means you have your code is not
committed yet so first you have to
commit your project in the local one and
the way you can do that is by saying
team this is option of commit and you
have to select all the files which you
want to commit again normally we don't
push all the
files but then that's fine for the
example we can do that I can say first
coverage uploading all the files all
files now you might be thinking by doing
this will it be uploaded on server of
course not so if I click on commit and
push ok now it is asking you for the
remote one as it remote one yeah
so when you click on push it will ask
you for the remote one okay now we have
a remote repository and then we can see
we got remote repository here we are
getting a name of the URL and then I
already have a github account here which
is Navin ready and I have set up my
password also you might not get this
step again if you have not got this
window don't worry I will show you the
other way around if you're not getting
this way and if you if you got this
window great you can simply click on
next and you have to selective master
branch if it is already there and click
on next and it should push otherwise
we'll do another step if I click on
finish it is pushing now just pushing
all the files and yes you can see that
it is pushing on your repository and
click on OK I guess we pushed let's
verify let's refresh this thing and can
you see that we got all our files here
you got your my code as the folder and
you can see we got all our files here
now in case if you have not got that
window or finally if we can have a round
of applause that we have completed the
first first commit but not if you have
not got the got the option what you can
do is you can push on the local
repository you might not have connected
your local repository with this server
in that case what you do is right click
here and you have to say team and this
option off show in repository view in
case it is not working for you ok
otherwise it is good to go in this you
have to create a remote one luckily I
have my machine was connected before
with the server in this case you have to
click on remote you have to click on
clear to possible create remote because
you are not connected yet in which you
can mention the name of the repository
as flash or anything you can say remote
flash you can click on ok
here you have to click on change where
you will mention your so your repository
length remember that link we have worked
with you have to paste it here
with the username and password of course
and then click on finish and we are good
to go save and push it will work for you
right the same thing so this the second
step you have to do in case they eat the
first the first step doesn't work so
that's how you upload a project from a
local repository to this is a mortar
posit tree now we can have one more
project here we can create that my
project here we can say maybe any
project maybe a web project will also do
will say this is a AAA and click on
finish and if I want to push this one of
course this is empty now but we can
create files and we can put the files
there if I want to push this project
it's very easy now just say right leg
team share project just to recap these
steps again I can use the same local
repository if you have and then click on
finish now this is done in the local one
if you want to push it on server will
say team commit will say it all the
files you can have any comment they
can't push comment and it should be done
so it can upload multiple projects is
not that you have to create you have to
push on the one project you can have
multiple project in your repository and
we can see if I go to flash we got two
for two projects here you can make the
changes and you can push here and that's
how you uploaded on github it's that
easy right so that's it from this video
