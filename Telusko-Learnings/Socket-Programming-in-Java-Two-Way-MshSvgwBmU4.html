about how to send a request from client
to server using socket programming so
let me go for recap so we have a socket
from the on the client side in which you
have to mention two things the localhost
and the IP address which is localhost
here and the port number and then you
have to send a string you can send the
string using a method which is right but
in order to use right you have to create
object of Holland we are writing here os
it should be out dot right we can yeah
we can use out dot right here and
instead of right we can also use out dot
println and then as in fact you can use
os directly we can say OS dot right that
that will also do all we can use out dot
println that's that's one way of doing
it
right and then we can say flush on this
our side we have accepted this data
using BR dot readline and then we have
assigned to str and then we are printing
that thing but now what we need to apply
here is we require one more string here
we'll name this string as str1 and this
str one or maybe not as TR one will say
nickname so nickname will be equal to I
want to fetch only the first three
character so we can say STR dot to the
this option of substring in which you
have to mention the first point which is
zero and the number of characters you
need so we require three characters okay
so we have to mention the starting point
and the number of letters you need and
then we can simply return this value to
the client client machine now how to
return this value so whenever you want
to send something from a client to
server or from server to client we
require this lines here we required this
two lines in fact we require this three
line so we can just reuse the code just
copy this code and paste it in your
server side and yeah everything will be
same yeah we call teacher of sending STR
me to say nickname here because we are
not sending a string we are sending a
nickname which is a string itself
and that's it so after this let me say
out dart flush which will forcefully
sanity data now so we'll send it at the
client and we'll print here maybe this
is out data sent so data sent from
server to client now what I will do I
will mention that this message is from
server so we say s : so whatever message
you are getting from service will have s
:
okay so that we can touch differentiate
between client messages and sour
messages and we can even print this here
okay so this is the message sent from
server and on the client side since I
was sending a data way to print that
data here now how to print so first we
have to take the data from the server
right now whenever you want to fetch
something we require this two lines for
fetching so we'll paste it here again
way to change the string name we'll name
this as nickname so just remember
whenever you use when you want to fetch
values from the other machine we need to
use bufferedreader when you want to send
data we use output string writer now
once you got your nickname we'll print
that nickname here and we'll say this is
C : a delta from server will print
nickname so what we expecting from the
server is the nickname right and then if
we run this code they turn the server
first so you can see service a is
started so I started and server is
waiting for the client request we also
need the question client so we got data
from server is nav yeah so we lost all
the data from the server this is the
data printed by your client which is C
data from server and that's now so if
you send na VI n you will be getting nav
if you send some other data you will get
some different values so that's how you
send a request from client to server and
then you get a response from server to
client
we can also create a chat application
here in which you a server send data to
client continuously a client will send
data to serve of continuously it's not
just sending data and getting the
response it's you can continue to talk
to the server and so I will talk to
client for that way to use while loop
again how to do that will do we'll make
a video on that let me know in the
comment section if you want that such
type of videos where you can where you
want a chatting application so I will be
waiting for your comments there if you
