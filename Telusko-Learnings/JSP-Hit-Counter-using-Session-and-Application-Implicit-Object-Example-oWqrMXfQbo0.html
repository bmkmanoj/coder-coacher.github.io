about JSP hit counter so let's say if I
if I go to a website and in that website
it should all web page it should tell me
how many times I've visited that website
or got that page so let's say how to do
that great a JC page here so we'll say
new and look at the con JSP or make sure
you have a web project there and we'll
name this j.jz page as home and we'll
click on finish
okay so this is your JC page and let me
remove all the comments of the extra
part okay I don't need head also here
now in this body instead of printing
hello world
I should print the number of visits but
to achieve this task we have multiple
options now if you're familiar with GSP
you might be knowing about this type of
declaration so let's say we have this is
your scripted right now anything you're
right in this grip light will go to your
sublet beach or sublet a service method
so anything you write here will go to
service method example if I say int I
and if I say save with just compile this
file compile it now when you compile it
will give you the servlet so let me
click on views of it let me just run
this file once so if I say run so it
will take some time because it's the
first time learning this running this
project so I'm using Apache here so it's
monitoring open I II okay so nothing
nothing will displace because I'm not
displaying anything but let me just
right click this file here and say if I
say view servlet so this JSP file will
be converted into a servlet file so this
is your servlet here now if you see this
out at the name of your server at class
it will be home underscore JSP
and then in this method you will be have
in this class you will be having a
service method which is underscore GSP
service so if you just right-click and
if you say you served right so this part
will get converted this part will
convert it into a service method so you
can see there are lots of extra thing
already these are your implicit objects
what you see in GSP and then somewhere
here somebody in service there will be a
declaration of int I so you can see that
is int I here so anything you write in
this service you think you write in this
service here this couplet it will go
into service method so let's say if I
say int I there and if I say zero so
initially my value will be zero and then
if I say let me print this value so
we'll say out dot println and if I print
the value but every time I come here I
would say I plus plus last time the
value was I so if I give a new visit so
it which it should show one simple in
fact I should go for I plus plus here
only because this is post increment
otherwise I have to use the increment so
I'm saying I plus plus and just out I -
on this code if I say run unfortunately
it will be open in IE I hate this
browser but no choice here we can change
it to Firefox also okay so if I say one
and every time i refresh see when you
fire the offence the answer is one it's
because whenever you click whenever you
say refresh it will call this service
method and this service method will
execute this statement also so every
time you call service it will create a
new variable I now what I want
initially it should be I after that it
should give a new value so what you can
do you can use something called a
declaration area now in a declaration
section here it says for one servlet it
will execute this this part only once so
what I can do I can declare my I here so
I don't need to declare it here and now
every time i refresh this page it will
call this service method and then if i
if i run this let's see the output and
now you can see a new tab and if I say
refresh refresh refresh you can see the
values incrementing so I can if I see a
difference the values increasing so this
is one way of knowing the number of
heads
then you will say this will be a browser
specific thing okay let me check let me
just copy this code from here and we'll
use Chrome this time and in chrome if I
say paste enter okay so you can see the
values tun is seven and if I say again
refresh it is 29 now let me just copy
this code and let me go to my Mozilla
and paste it here and open the value
strata writer so it is 27 29 here
because I'm using Chrome and when I fish
to Firefox it's a new request so it is
30 now so that means this is one way of
maintaining the the counter but let's
say I don't want to when I said it's
open if I if I open this in chrome and
if I say refresh it should increase the
counter once I switch to different
dowser it should again start with zero
then in that case was that what will be
the solution for that you cannot use
this concept then you have to go for
something new and that something new is
called as scopes now what is scope here
we have multiple scope the body the
default scope for your JSP is peach now
what we'll do we'll use something called
a session scope you
so again session is implicit object in
your JSP so what you can simply do is
you can declare a variable integer so
we'll say integer I but the initial
value of this integer will be coming
from session so we can simply say
session thought
we'll say get attribute and we provide a
drink or let's count okay now so they
will be a attribute in your session
colors count right but what if there's
one problem it says this session I get a
trip it will give you object we have to
cast it will say integer so if you are
getting confused why I'm getting this
black theme here because I have said
detail so if you are using that it means
or if you are using any other ideas
so they offers you to set this theme the
only reason I'm using this theme is
because this is black so it will help it
will reduce the number number of bytes
required by my video and it will reduce
the size of the total video which means
when you watch this video on YouTube it
will take less buffering so this is just
an experiment I don't know how many of
you like this theme so if you don't like
this theme just let me know in my
comment okay and if you love this theme
again you can comment in the comment
section okay let's get back to it so we
are getting session don't get attributed
so this count will give you the value
the last value but what if this is the
first visit of course it will give you
add all right because this will be null
at that time so this is your first visit
so we can check if I is equal to equal
to null of course what the first visit
it will be null or it will be zero so we
can you can use an hour statement in any
case in any scenario will say I equal to
zero so if the first time why is it or
will say one so if it is the first time
we can simply say I equal to one right
but let's say this is your second time
so in that scenario will execute L
statement here and in else we can print
we can say I plus plus we are
incrementing the value and well print
that value in this way so we can say out
dot println and here I will say the you
have visited this website of a page with
a plus
I love times so for the first time it
will be time but I'm not going to go
into more grammar here say when you use
it with the first time which is one it
will bring times so you can just ignore
that part now once you said this we need
to set the session attribute once again
will say set dot set attribute because
the event once you increment the value
wait to set the count once again and
then the next time the count will be I
so you can see we are we are upgrading
the value here so we are upgrading a
value here which is I plus plus so let's
say this is my fifth visit so the last
value will be 4 so I will be getting
food here I mean green tea value which
is 5 and then the new value will be set
as 5 simple now let me on this project
so if I run again it will be opening ie
so ok since it is my first visit nothing
will print so in fact I should print it
this part outside right so that mistake
here so it should print that part
outside so have it run it will be open
in IE once again to IE and so you can
see there is output you have visited
this website 1 times this ignore this
part if I refers this it says 2 times 3
times 4 times so where I'm showing this
value in session right secession is bow
is browser dependent if I change my
browser if I paste it here if I say
enter you can see it against this one if
i refresh it says 2 3 4 so every time
you refresh it will increment the value
simple right but let's say I want to
maintain it throughout the browser I
don't want I don't want to depend upon
each browser so anytime if I switch back
to my next browser it should give me the
same value which is let's say if I open
this in IE 4 10 times the value would be
I will be 10 if I switch back to Chrome
which would give me 11
for that you cannot use session for that
day some object called as application so
instead of using session we can also use
applications application is throughout
so it's all depend upon you if you want
to go for the same browser you can use
session if you want to go for multiple
browsers you can use application so if I
done this now so let me get back to I
here so in this I again it says one time
and if I say to finish it goes multiple
times so let's say this is studying here
get back to Chrome will paste it here
will say enter it says 14 right so
because we are using application context
here so this application context is the
object of sublet context so this is the
application servlet context if you use
session it is the object of HTTP session
so this is how you have to count the
number of heads in JSP okay now if you
are if you know on to know okay how to
change this this style you can't feel
you can just click on Tools you can go
to options there is something called as
appearance here in appearance there will
be a look and feel option so I have
already downloaded a to plug-in so when
you when you click on this combo box we
will not get all the options you will
not get this last two you will get first
five in order to get this you have to
gloat you have to go to the plug-in so
you have to go so tools then you have to
search for plugins go to your the
plugins section search for dark look and
feel you can see there should be some
very this is doctor can feel this will
help you to change your look and feel
for that you have to search here for
dark look and feel and you have to just
install it once you install it you have
to go to tools again options appearance
you can feel and select so select now
doc nimbus you need to restart your
browser to make the fakeness simple so
this is how you need to calculate JSP
counter this is how we have to change
the look and feel so that's it from this
video so doe subscribe for the further
videos and thank you so much for
