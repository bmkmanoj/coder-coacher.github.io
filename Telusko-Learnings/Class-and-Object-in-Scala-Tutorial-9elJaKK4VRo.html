tutorial while we talk about classes and
object so this is now a new idea from
the high school earnings and let's start
with it so the next last video we have
talked about how to assign variables I'm
now so how to get a variable how to
assign the values and how to add to add
to objects
now when you say you are performing in
some operation here so when you thinking
that when you say 8 plus 7 so when you
are saying 8 8 plus 7 so that's not
exactly 8 plus 7 what we are doing is so
we don't have any plus operator you know
in Scala so everything you we use isn't
method so example if you use plus there
that's a function again when I use
method method and function that means
the same right not exactly same but this
is a function so this plus operator here
is a plus I mean it's a function because
Scala is also a function of the
programming so that's how you that's how
it looks so in this video we'll let's
talk about classes so just to define
that I will open a Java so I have to
eclipse in which I have so in one I have
Java another another we have Scala
so in this Java Park what I will do is I
will create a class because normally as
a job for grammar we have this habit of
Kenya class white and we'll go for white
a diptych typical example of student
will click on finish now in this student
class what we have is if I open that so
let's say in this student class I have
three variables one is ain't roll number
and let's say only your interval roll
number then we have string name and then
we have the last one as int marks okay
so I just have these three variables
here and so normally if you don't
mention the type of the axis here that
means it's up it's a package private
right that means it is it can be
accessible inside the package itself now
if I if I want a constructor here so I
can say write like so's generate
constructors with field let's fetch all
and okay you got a constructor here we
can also assign you know we normally
also used to two other methods which is
a hash
I mean because within Java we follow the
concept of javabeans right so in Java
beans we have to make sure that you have
getter and setter for that so we have to
use getters and setters because we want
to implement java beans here and what
else we need we need one more thing
which is a hash function I mean the
hashcode method and so we'll say
generate hashcode and equals so this is
what we implement in Java right so if
you want to achieve all this thing in
Scala you don't have to write all this
line can you imagine how many lines of
code be writing here waiting
approximately 70 lines of code again see
that 70 lines of code let's do that in
Scala how we get a class so I will
remove all this code here let me get a
class here so in order to create a
classes color we simply use a special
keyword colors case and we use a class
and we'll say student and that's it you
got your class ready
okay that's your class I mean of course
you will not rush me right but that's a
class now this thing here this round
bracket specify the constructor so you
don't have to create a class and then
create a constructor you can create a
constructor as soon as you get a class
so you can specify the variables here so
I can say however the first variable as
bad I will say this is roll number of
type int then I can say I have a bad
which is name of type string and I have
a int I mean I have a bad which is marks
and it is 8 so you can you can compare
this thing with your Java code so if you
can compare your Java pod here that's
your Java port right so you can compare
this with this one line and you can also
specify some default value so let's say
in this constructor itself if we can
create a default constructor
so I can create or default construct I
will say souls and our default ways
before constructor so a constructor with
no fields and okay so I got a default
consider here and I can assign some
values right I can say by default if you
if a student is not specifying roll
number the number will be 1 if he is not
specifying the name name will be by
default
naveen and it's not specifying the marks
box by default will be let's say 90
doesn't default values we can achieve
the same thing in in student by
specifying the values here itself we can
say the default value for dole number
let's say this is 1 the default value
for name is let's say Naveen and the
default value for marks let's say this
is 90 so we can achieve the same stuff
here in one line you see that it's that
amazing and if you want to provide some
definition here if you want to provide
some methods you just hope I have to
open the brackets and you have to close
the brackets so with this three lines of
code we have actually created a class
with a constructor which accepts
multiple parameters awesome right so now
let's create an object of it now how do
we create an object it's very simple we
can simply say I want to create an
object like oh okay hold on how will you
how will you create object here so it's
very simple we simply have to save add
we'll say s 1 equal to student or the
round bracket and that's it we got our
first object here and you can see we got
we also we are getting some instant
output we got one we got a student
object with the default values even if
you don't mention the value here it will
take it if all values but we can change
it right I can say I want the roll
number as 4 I want the name as Rahul and
I want the marks as 75 now if I create
the object we got the object with those
values in fact we can also specify only
4 if I specify only 4 it will take it
will take 4 as a value and the remaining
part will be taken from the default
values so it was taking the roll numbers
for that's the element but this 2 is
taking as it I mean is it thing as
default so that also means that it we
are also achieving constructor
overloading here automatically you don't
have to do any stuff there so if we are
achieving constructor overloading by
default it is that awesome because if in
Java you have to create multiple
constructor so this constructor which
takes nothing then this constructor
which takes everything then one more
constructor which takes only one
parameter next constructor which takes
only one parameter which is name what
next transitive it takes only one
parameter marks is very hectic right
so we can specify we can pass two
parameters Z I can say this is let's say
this is Rahul same I am NOT specifying
the third parameter so I am specifying
only one two so I am specifying this is
four I am specifying this is Rahul so
this will be taken as default but what
happens if I pass only rajulio so it
will get confused right because the
confusion is how we do know that which
method I mean which wherever you assign
the value so in case if you are first if
you're passing the variable is not
matching matching with the first
variable it will give you error at that
time I specifically have to mention that
we assign the name and you can see the
name is changed but a remaining thing
which is rule number and marks the same
so that's how you create a class you
create a constructor and you create an
object but the other thing which we do
here we have to write lots of stuff
right we have to write lots of lines of
code you can see that so this is the
difference between Java and Scala so if
you are from Java background if you have
if you have done this you know what I'm
talking about right in Scala we can
write in though in those things in two
lines again there is a learning curve
here but the only thing is it is worth
learning right so that's it that's it
from this video in the next video we'll
talk about how to define methods in
Scala thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
