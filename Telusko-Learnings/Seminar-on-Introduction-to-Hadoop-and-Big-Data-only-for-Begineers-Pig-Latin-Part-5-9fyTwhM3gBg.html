now hype is a term given by Facebook now
you all use Facebook here when you
search the post on Facebook etc search
for Navin routine it will take two
seconds max two seconds to fetch all
novelties in the world it's that fast
that means they will be using something
called as Map Reduce for that that means
their developers need to use MapReduce
but unfortunately maximum users or
maximum people who use software's they
work on SQL it's damn difficult to to
move on to shift from SQL domain to
MapReduce domain so Facebook founded
something called as high the facebook
says don't worry if you love SQL you
don't know what is MapReduce it's okay
if you know SQL you can use something
called as X cube so X Q is same like or
similar like SQL not be covered not much
difference so we stopped using MapReduce
as a developer what you can do is you
can create SQL and actually seem like
SQL SQL stands for structured query
language hql stands for it is five query
language now internally your SQL gets
converted into MapReduce pools
less than a mosque what unites SQL what
is executed as MapReduce so people that
this company aren't making I do very
simple to operate in shaft learning
MapReduce you can learn hi
so indirectly that hive statements or
SQL statement will convert into
magnitudes here and it is done by
something called as hi service
so good no
and the last technology and Hadoop for
our session there is something called as
pink lights Bo what is a programming
language pig is a programming language
for it's not that that's an older
so this a pig is a language built by
Yahoo okay
in fact Facebook Google Yahoo and Amazon
these are the biggest panels of Hadoop
technology so if you are if you have
different different framework in Hadoop
it's or articles of these companies
Facebook has high Yahoo pick Google
MapReduce and Amazon they are walking
with something called as we have Lewis
the biggest cloud serving or cloud
service a tablet a the much transport
Amazon Web Services in fact you don't
have to download a big data soften your
machine you can run big data online
cloud computing for this Google Snow
White is some people has bigquery amazon
has AWS world is moving very fast and we
are still at C and C++ so let's see what
is big now what is big big it's
everything
doesn't matter was that right in the
same way big language they can handle
any type of data so why is this word big
is because real pigs eat anything they
can digest anything big language can
handle any type of data may be audio may
be video may be text may be images
doesn't matter it can handle any type of
data in this big you have something
called as of pig latin which is a
programming language
and it needs something called as runtime
environment like in Java we have Java as
a language and JVMs Wrentham environment
in the same way for pig pig latin is the
language name and runtime is the runtime
where you can run Pig applications
clear and how to build a pig application
you can use again language like Ruby
Python Java PHP you can use all these
languages to build P to build this one
time nothing simple
now now pig has some very easy code
let's say if I ask you to you have to
read a file in Java you have to take
that file and you have to remove all the
odd numbers
what was your logic you have to use file
class you have to use file out input
stream class then you have to use a form
though you have to start with the first
line to the last line and then you have
to show the output simple in pig you can
do the same thing in less number of
lines first step you have to use
something called as load in this mode
you can mention defined in the day of my
file a - numbers dot txt so it's in now
dot PHP second line one second step is
you have to first group it if you get
five files do qualify this is mapping
the next thing is grouping next we have
to reduce it then we have to use
something called as filter this is your
first step both step you have to delete
the grouping file once you have done
with the grouping once you're done with
the filter you have to remove that file
so we say dumb be a disaster will be
fatal to your P store see
done in Java you have to line right
number of lines in Peggy apply light
only dislikes this is the statement this
is the statement that's it and you will
get your all odd numbers your logic will
be here in filter you know then question
is can you do it in Java in Java 7 you
have to do that task of first line
second line third line in Java 8 we have
summer streams using streams you can use
functions for this map you can use
functions for this reduce so map
function dot reduce function will become
Map Reduce function so in Java 8 we have
inbuilt functions and then touch my java
it is a big what you can say hi from
Java 7 to Java 8 is a big jump because
it reverses of the stream API again for
what to walk with this big data so again
you can if you don't want to learn Java
it's ok you should know big like a you
should know hide you should know
something else Map Reduce or you can use
something on us our language now on
langage derive from s language s x for
statistics so you have to use at least
one language to walk with us but if you
don't know which language to learn best
is draw them real and that's the part of
java all this open so technology they
are built in java java language whatever
technology you know so these are strong
inclusion of Hadoop and big data so what
we have we have MapReduce which is used
to create this summary and create the
aggregation we use HDFS which is Hadoop
distributed file system we have
map or when we have high which is a SQL
type of language built by Facebook which
will convert
h2l stable into MapReduce jobs then we
have
big language using pig you can work with
big data and build by Yahoo okay see
when you talk about Java language if you
want to do the same thing in Java you
have to think how to do it in pink you
have to focus on what to do instead of
how to do you know and that's the
introduction of I do and dictator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
