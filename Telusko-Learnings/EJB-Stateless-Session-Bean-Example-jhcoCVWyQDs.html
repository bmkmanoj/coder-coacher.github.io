we'll talk about a JB
so we'll see the example of a GB so
before going for a JB we'll start with
servlet or will act to numbers using
served it and then we will try to use
being interrupted and then we'll go for
towards eg B so let's start with that
let's open it let's get a new project
and we'll create a web project this time
so we'll say Java web and web
applications then we can say next will
say this application has demo EJB and
then next I will go for GlassFish server
it was provides to EJB features and then
we'll say next or will will not go for
any framework now and then we'll say
finish now once you got your project
what we'll do is we'll create a basic
HTML page again we already have a home
page here which is the index dot HTML so
what we'll do we'll take two numbers
from user because we want to add two
numbers so so we'll ask user 20 two
numbers we'll say enter first number and
then we'll give input text as input type
equal to text Oh spell missed it's text
and then we'll say a name for that text
will say t1 that's it now since we need
two text fields so we'll do some code
reuse here so it's and this time we'll
say t2 and enter second number and then
what next we require a button here again
we want this to be common new lines so
we'll say BR for decline and then VR and
then we need our input button so we'll
say submit input type equal to submit
that's it we'll use the default name
okay now if you call if you click on
this submit it it should call a form
rights and that's why we require a form
tag here so we'll say form in this it
will call I will create or servlet as
I'd sublet okay and the method will I'll
be using here is post and then we'll say
forum close so this is the HTML page
when you run this code now and when you
click on this button it will call this
add servlet that means we have to create
a servlet here so we'll let you in your
project and then we'll select a servlet
will name this servlet as ad servlet and
then we'll go for any package name so
we'll say next
again it's your choice to go with webelo
XML or you can use annotations so this
time I'm not taking this checkbox here
I'm going for the annotation type of
coding so we'll say finish so this is
your servlet or for simplicity let me
remove this comments all these comments
and okay let me give it a first thing
okay so what we have you have all these
packages let me import this in one by
one this is your servlet as add servlet
now to mention it has servlet we have an
annotation called as a trait web sublet
which specify this the below class is
sublet if you call a pattern like slash
add servlet it will call this servlet I
can if you if you are changing the
request type here if we change this quiz
type you have to change the pattern here
now again since we are using our inbuilt
class so what we do is we have to import
a package so we'll say again you can
click here and import or you can just
give the shortcut called as ctrl shift I
it will import the package now since we
are working with a service type of
things so we have to go for either do
post or do gate since we are since we
are working with a method called as post
so we have a defined as do post which
will accept two parameters and state
appease servlet requests our EQ and then
HTTP servlet response will say our es
simple right and then we have to import
the package so control shift I it will
import the package now now very cool see
again we have to accept the details from
client and then we'll process the
details and then we'll send that details
to clients write a few fifth line sends
two and three so we have to add two and
three and we have to written five for
that since we are going to return a
value will require object of print
writer because it will have a method
called as a println so we'll say print
writer out equal to I our response
object will help us to create an object
so we'll say get writer so there is a
chances that I will get an error so you
can click here on this bubble and then
it will give you a suggestion like oh
you have to import the package next
error should be it will throw an
exception so it's a checks checked
exceptions so we have to click on this
and say add to the clause so you can see
if we have an i/o exception here okay
next we have to accept details from
kline now so for to accept details we
require two variables we'll say int I in
which the request will come from request
or not your questions are the Q dot get
parameter this is how you taken from
your HTML page in sublets and we'll say
t1 so we will get our data from this t1
so I will come from this t1 and J will
come from this t2 but when I say get
parameter it will always give me a
string per spring value we have to
convert it into integer value so we'll
say integer dot pass end brackets okay
and then we'll do the same thing for J
so we'll say copy and paste this is your
J and this time we'll say t2
now what next we have to add these two
numbers so we'll take a third variable
as int K and we'll say I plus J okay and
then once it is done you have to print
the values so we'll say out dot println
and we'll pass k now this will print
your K on client machine right again
we'll see I will say addy
addition is : it is K simple right now
to run this file just go to your index
dot JS JS index dot HTML and from this
let me remove this comments no need for
comments here now to compile it or run
it you have to right-click on your HTML
and say run it will take some time
because the it will take some time for
the deployment this is the first time
I'm running this code so it will take
some time approximately 10 seconds
depending system configuration yeah
since we are working with GlassFish it
will it will activate the GlassFish
server and now it is deploying your
project to GlassFish server
as I said depend upon your configuration
it will take some time so it is taking
more than 10 seconds now one will
eventually will be getting with the
output
okay so till then we will do a quick
division so we have we have created a
form in HTML in this we have to input
text as t1 and t2 and then you have a
button so once you click on this button
it will call your ad servlet in which we
have to create a servlet by extending
that servlet which is TTP servlet and
then since we are working with some type
of service whether we can use do get or
do post depend upon your request depend
upon your request you have to use a do
get or do post here and then since we
are printing it on a client machine we
have to eat a cookie we require object
of print writer and then we have to take
input from I and J and then we have to
calculate the value of cave which is I
plus J and then you have to print the
value of K now if I run this code see
this is my HTML page so this you can see
this is this is the localhost which
means the I pairs of my machine and then
this is the port number GlassFish using
and then this is my project name and
this is my page so if I say 45 or do you
have some number 67 submit and the
answer is addition is 1 1 2 right does
the answer but what we say is this is
the or actual server which which gives
you the spawns but normally you should
divide your work you should you should
you create something called as or
methods so if you convert this thing
into like a more efficient way more
efficient code you have to use a method
here
which means I will define a method
called as public void add which will
take two parameters int I comma int into
J and then what we'll do is we'll say
we'll do one thing will return these
bills will say int I will return return
end and here I will say I plus J so what
it means some something will call this
and which passing to parameters I and J
it will do the addition and it will
return right so now here what we can do
is instead of writing I plus J we can
just directly say add I comma J so it
will give the same output right let me
do let me run this so let's pass 43 and
11 and the output is addition 54 right
but this time we are working with we are
working with this this method called as
ad now what again we say as a instead of
having your business logic now this part
is business logic instead of having a
business logic into a servlet what we
can do is we can use we can make this
code as reusable that means in others in
other servlet if you need the same code
so what you can do is you can create a
beam which is reusable so how to get
been it's very simple just create a
normal class and we'll name this class
as ADD bean and we'll give a package
name as a will say EJB and then finish
again this is not a EJB exactly this is
just a bean concept what so what beans
means if you have a variable like int I
comma J and K and if this variables are
private now if you create object of this
bean by default it will become a I
forget object of this class it will
become a bean but for that you need some
getters and setters why it is because to
access private variables you require the
Gator setters so how to introduce
characters right click we have insert
code will say getter and setter with a
Quadra setup for all these three
variables and generate now we have all
these getters and setters right
now since after that we have to add also
so we'll say public void add and then we
can actually say k equal to I plus J now
so this is your bin right so normal we
have three variables we will do addy we
do addition we have three variables we
have getters and setters for everything
and then last is V Dakota method called
as ad which will add this value of I and
J
and save it in K now the changes here
will be we don't need this method now
because we are submitting the logic with
the presentation with actual server so
instead of calling this now now we have
to set the value we have first you have
to get object of this beam Sarika object
will say add be in obj equal to new add
beam again we have to import the package
because we are working with ECB package
here so we'll say a no option for okay
let's play simple we just that's not
working semester okay let me just import
a package back by myself
we'll say import it's egb oh let me just
remove this let me change the package
name because we have some inbuilt
package in Java as egb so we'll say this
packages are beans beans
oh my be to base specific with a new
factor now it is easy to import the
package because there will not be any
conflict with this oh posit yeah so this
is a my bean dot add bean okay now what
next I will will say or now we have to
set the value of I right so we'll say
obj dot said I now we cannot directly
use I we have to use set I because which
is a public method because your
variables are private so you cannot
access your private variables directly
so we have to use methods which is Gator
sensitives and then you happy here we
can you pass J and then we'll say obj
dot add which will set the value of K as
the value of I and J so if you have a
value is 5 when J value sex the add will
do addition of I am 6 and it will save
that 11 number in in in K so now when it
ko so we'll say end K and obj dot get K
it will give me the value of K
now and then you can print the value of
K here simple right now let me just run
this code so go here and again just what
change it will say addition using bean
okay let me run this code now and it's
56 oh sorry there and 90 submit the
addition using bin is 146 now this time
what we are doing is we are actually
using a beanie aware we are using a beam
yure right but the problem is think
about our distributed systems you have a
server on different machine and you have
your bins on different machines that
means that were don't know the
implementation of bees right when you
say this new ad beam it gives you
something called as dependency that
means you should know your
implementation you have to create the
object right there are chances that you
will be having your you will be having
your you will be having your reference
you will be having your reference on
different machine and your object on
different machine at that point of time
what you need is you don't know what the
object will be so you need help from
someone to remove this dependency and
that dependency you can remove with the
help of II J B which means you just have
to concentrate on reference creation I
will take care of your object creation
right so let's implement each a B with
the same example now instead of using a
normal beam this time we have to use a
each a B for that will right-click on
your package and we'll say now is even
talking about EJB it can be of three
types it can be session also to type
basically you can be session or it can
be message driven pins so but for this
example we'll go for a session and we'll
name this as ad EJB and then in this we
have three options we have any stateless
a stateful and singleton I will focus on
stateless you and then we'll say finish
imodium of the we will remove the
comments then this one also now what
more important here is all your age a
bee will have an annotation so depend
upon which type of each of you are using
you have different annotations so if you
are using a state full session bean so
you have to you right here say state
full right now again we have required a
same code here which we have done in bin
which means I need a private I J and K
for this I need get a sitter so we'll
say o private int I and then we and get
a sitter so we'll say insert code
getters and setters for all the
variables generate I got you guys a
third I also need a method well as
public wide ad which is k equal to I
plus G oh so lon
it's I plus J and then what we'll do is
we'll say okay this is this is your EJ
be part now to use this EJ be here
instead of using a bean because I don't
want to implement and since I want to
increase the scope I will say add hit JB
here and we create the object name as
obj now this is your reference I don't
want to create our object of that I
don't want to create the object I will
ask EJ be to create the object first we
have to import this we will say import
now now if you run this code it will not
work because we don't have our object
for this I need someone to create ops
create me an object right and that
someone is your EJB you just have to
give an annotations for this object as
EJB so it will create an object up for
this a add EJB class so again we have to
input the package or not see this
package below this class belongs to our
package well as EJB okay so now we have
done with this we are not creating any
object by ourself we are asking a JB to
give me an object now if you on this
code let me do some modification we'll
say using a JB
knife around this code at 76 and we'll
say 99 and the addition using EJB is 179
and as the advantage of using EJB we are
not dependent on the implementation we
just we should just know the last name
and the difference right that's a title
using that we can work with EJB so I
hope this this video has helped you in
the EJB concept do subscribe for the
further videos thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
