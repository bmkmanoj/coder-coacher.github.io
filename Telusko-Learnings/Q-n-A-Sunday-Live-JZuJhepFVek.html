okay so I guess we are live everything
seems good can you just bring a lap
while bit closer a bit more okay we are
still doing the setup because I have
changed my location or bed let me do one
more thing take it more clothes is it
purple
no okay wait up it up it up let's find
this language okay so everything seems
good and I don't know how many people
are watching because I can't see the
stats today Oh 77 people are watching
that's great
this is the biggest alibi else oh great
so I got 7 likes as well ok so let's
start with the messages ok so this is
basically a qi session nothing much
today nothing to discuss it's just about
cure because I was getting lots of
questions on the comments and I thought
okay let's go live I was supposed to go
live every Sunday we could because but
due to some problem I was not able to do
that so yeah so today I was free a bit I
was working on a project and due to
which I was not able to come live so now
today I am live and let's start with the
questions and answers and I can see we
have 1 0 8 people watching this video or
this live session this life streaming
that's great ok great so let me start
with the questions and ok first of all
before starting with questions I had an
awesome week I am working on working on
a project making spring tutorials for
udemy and maybe not udemy specifically
but I'm making some tutorials so that I
can upload it somewhere and yeah so
let's see how it goes there are lots of
things coming on the way from next month
I was a busy with training so you know
this is the only month I can make videos
next month I'm completely busy you will
not find multiple I mean you will not
find much videos next month from
September again will resume some more
videos
okay by the way next month is my
birthday month so I'll have my I love
August anyway so oh okay so every once a
sausage say is high high regard James
although Ben writes great we got lots of
people today okay so because not a okay
so the hi good evening everyone so much
it says hello saw love your videos oh
that's my pleasure
okay so okay so
Sian if we got the first question here
from Sahil I mean be take computer
science what should be the should watch
me my approach other than academics okay
so in fact this week I went to different
colleges for seminars and everywhere I
was talking about this concept where
like if it that this is good okay so
finally record of sunlight here in my in
monsoon great is a bit more bit mud okay
so oh yeah I was talking about this
stuff so okay so what is academics so
when I talk about economic they have all
syllabus right if you can see every
college they are not updated under the
syllabus and industry we are using
different technologies and in in college
we have different things which we learn
so what is happening now is there's a
huge gap now we are responsible to fill
that gap right I'm trying to fill that
gap but then I cannot do everything I
cannot fill up the entire gap here so I
believe you know when you talk when you
want to join a company a company I mean
when a company hire people they hire
people who has at least 70 to 80 percent
of knowledge what they need okay
because see for every post you cannot be
hundred percent perfect okay you need to
be at least 70 80 percent perfect so
that these people can train you so that
you can be hundred percent now question
arise how to be that 70 or 80 percent
how to get that knowledge if you only
depend upon your college they will train
you for 40 to 50 percent not more than
that that too if you are the top squad
or if you have learned each and every
concept in your syllabus then you become
40 to 50 now how do you fill up that gap
now only way you can do that
is by building some projects so I always
believe you know the more you build the
more you will the more you will have the
knowledge so start building stuff you
know the more you build a project now
the more advantage you have you will
have in future
so within academics make sure that
you're building a project okay now
people do ask what project we have to
build you the different things you can
build see everyone we have different
ideas right in fact in my brain I get so
many ideas you know I'm sure every human
they have this amazing brain in which
you get lots of ideas the only thing is
we don't know how to implement that and
some people believe ok we call an idea
but then is it really helpful does it
matter if you get an idea just try to
implement that that is one of the
project you can build all talk to people
ask them what they want and build that
project all the wise you can go to
freelancer.com you can go to up work
these are some websites where you can go
and you can get freelancing projects you
will get knowledge and you will also
earn right that's what you can do okay
so that's what that's what you can do a
better than academics ok so next
question is from Alphonse aho oh is that
ok I lost all the questions again I just
scrolled ok so questions Oh Java
interview questions
ah ok mostly really talked about you
know introduced they will okay I cannot
specifically give you questions but then
I can help you with the topics when you
go for the introduced most of the time
they ask you about correction API
because in correction API we have so
many stuffs you know in fact Y
collection API specifically is because
when you talk about Java language it has
so many varieties with C language right
C C++ now collection is something which
is very new and it is very helpful when
you build a java project we do use a
collection API a lot so they will ask
you questions are based on conditional
API they will ask you a question based
on what else what else we are threads
right so I would suggest you to brush
your skills on threads prediction API
example what is deadlock and what is
wait and notify how that works then you
can see what one we asked how do you
static variable or static study
content how JVM works is it those
questions how JVM Wells different memory
types so learn about this topics and
you'll be good to go okay so super re
super rich knows that it is super legit
okay so bill I'm very bad with names
anyway so super legit Roy says hello so
your Java tutorials is awesome oh that's
thank you so much I thought that's a
question okay I thought there's a
question mark at the end okay thanks so
much
Shree Nazis hello sir what's up
assailing I know poor joke
okay so avian says I'm trying to
automate some process in my company and
I kind of need help
oh how can I help now I don't know okay
so I mean BTech first year which
language should I learn first of course
are there are two choice you can go for
either three choice the first one is C
programming because every college will
will ask you to do that it doesn't
matter which degree you are doing people
do ask you to learn C programming first
but then I would recommend you to start
with Python okay I can it's your choice
okay you can start with C or Python or
you can start with JavaScript now the
advantage of build or flooding
JavaScript is a first language is you
know after completing JavaScript we
actually built a project I don't know
about C no one built project build based
on C okay the only way you can do that
is if you want to build your vortex you
cannot quite get into embedded systems
if you want to build your own OS that's
why we will use C and then it takes some
time to build all those things so if you
want to make a simple website you know
if you want a project with you I would
search it'll go for a JavaScript you can
go for Python because it is very easy to
learn and C of course because every call
it says that so if your college is
forcing you to learn C of course go for
C otherwise I would recommend you to go
for Python it is very easy all
JavaScript when you if you want to build
a project at s start okay the only thing
is if you learn JavaScript you may not
come out okay you might you might not
want to learn Java in future so if you
have a if you want to learn Java in
future start with C then go for C++ and
go for Java if you want to build project
directly that start with
okay so next one can you make a video to
print that number in palindrome and a
perfect number oh I do have that video
on YouTube search for okay if you want
to search for videos which are there on
YouTube search for Teddy's score and the
topic name so example if you want to
know about palindrome search for that is
co palindrome so if it will give my
video so try that okay okay so Nick
already says can you tell me an idea for
making our web application using REST
API Oh idea okay so if you see that two
ways of building project one you can
build a project with your own ideas or
what you can do is okay lots of people
they they do have ideas but they don't
know is it possible to implement or not
so what you can do is if you are not
sure you can implement those ideas which
are already built example build your own
Facebook by your own build your own
whatsapp build your own Twitter so try
to mimic this applications of course you
cannot build the entire stuff in one day
but then if you try to mimic try to
implement one by one feature and that's
how you can build your first project and
once they start building stuff you will
get your own ideas and even you can then
you will know that whatever you do
whatever ideas you have you can actually
implement those that's what I've started
I applied I try to mimic some software's
and then I went into building my own
projects okay what do Metta say sir I
want to learn angular and nodejs give me
some advice okay I'm not into J's much
I'm not a JavaScript developer I'm more
towards Java still if you want some
advice what you can do is start with
JavaScript make sure your JavaScript
concept are very very good also learn
job jQuery because it will give you a
base I'm not saying that to learn
angularjs you should know jQuery but
then it will be a base for you I'm not
sure if it is jQuery require that but
what you can do is launch I was there
first basics of JavaScript learn jQuery
and then jump to angularjs now there are
lots of videos available on YouTube on
angularjs but I would recommend you to
which students can follow okay if you
search for angularjs on YouTube
I'm just doing that and okay there are
lots of playlists available but I would
recommend it to go for angular angular
for now because I'm gonna fall is trendy
okay all you can go for angular 2 as
well because I don't okay we don't have
any tutorials on angular for okay you
can go for angular 2 I would recommend
it to go a follow a playlist of venket
that-that's-that's look good that looks
good yeah that looks good other than new
Bostian everything is good you know the
problem with new boston he doesn't he's
not following troppo or do you say
coding conventions that's what I've got
a feedback they they don't like new
Boston some people I would go for a
wanker I don't know which what others
you have anyone who feel no angularjs
just coming to the coming in the chat
window said that it would be a little
fall wasn't there okay so next question
happy Shama says so is your code Java
paid course contains swing or eight
ability no it doesn't contain swing for
eight ability for several reasons one
reason is it is damn blendy okay split
to learn swing itself it's a it's a very
big course we cannot include that in
core Java and second not everyone is
using swing nowadays if you if you if
you join any software element company
they're not building software's nowadays
they are building web applications they
are building enterprise applications
they are building mobile applications
those those days are gone when you have
desktop applications but even if you
want to build desktop application we use
Java FX no one your swing nowadays the
problem with education system is there
are some syllabus where you still have
swing and inability and that's why you
can see I don't have new videos on AWT
or swang on YouTube no one no one no one
want to learn it right okay so I can see
we have 170 people watching this only 50
likes come on guys if you if you want
this more sessions like this because
this is what motivate me right the the
more likes you I get on the videos
that's why we get motivated because I
feel what I'm doing is worthwhile
because that's good we got 89 likes
that's great we go entity likes in
ten seconds okay thank you so much okay
that means people are liking this
session is great okay next question is
from approval could you help in Apex and
visualforce I'm so sorry I'm don't know
about those technologies Peg's how the
body capex but I don't know what it is
no idea sorry so sorry next question is
from chemistry web app was this website
Oh actually good very good question you
know some people do mix it this mix do
these two things web app and website in
fact I do mix up these two things when I
talk about different when I teach the
sessions okay so let's try to
differentiate between this two Oh see
what happened is it all started in 1990s
right the the web era and in 1998 we got
Google and everyone thought okay let's
this is like everyone thought okay this
is the next big next big thing so they
started making their own websites now
when you say websites it more towards a
static content you know we have some
pointing of the net only on the web on
somewhere I mean you have some pointing
somewhere in the HTML format and what
you are doing is you are browsing those
website you are clicking on the link and
you're going here and there it's more
towards static content I'm not saying if
you have any website it is not for this
website but then it is more towards a
static content when you say web app it's
actually some processing is going on on
the server example when you when you
talk about stock market applications
when you talk about Facebook application
you for sure know there's something
happening on the server side right if
you want to build an application as a
sauce head programmer so as up as a
programmer you will refer that as an app
because you are building an application
which will run on the server side right
and then the client what they will get
is a they will get pages now that they
might get a page they might get a data
but for what what you are building is a
web application now as a layman
they will refer that as websites right
they don't refer it as web applications
what therefore is a website so again you
can interchange those two things but
then as a programmer we always say web
app when you are building a dynamic web
site ah that's bad
okay next question please may continue
bearish questions om in fact I was
thinking about that aha I was I was
planning to make interview questions but
I don't know every time I think about
making interview questions I get stuck
with some other work visit I mean work
of other project or maybe some other
series currently I'm working on spring
series in fact last month that was busy
with Portland series after that I was
busy with West series and now I'm
building spring cities so I'm quite busy
with all this stuff the moment I get
some time I will surely make videos on
interview based questions I'm also
planning to make videos on data
structures because I'm getting this
suckers from a long time they want it as
structures I will try to do that I will
try to build those things I'm trying to
do it as soon as possible okay so what
next next question is Android
development versus web development which
is better both I mean it's obvious right
I mean both are important nowadays
because see when you say website it will
not replace a mobile or mobile phones
and mobile phone will not replace
websites that both will be there you
have a defined what you want to do if
you if you are more towards consumer
market go for Android because we have
huge demand in consumer market if you
want to get into a web market or if you
want to get into enterprise market go
for web development I personally love
web development not the web designing
not the designing part but the backend
part I know I'm not that comfortable
with Android when it comes to mobile
development I'm planning to go for iOS
but I don't know how it will be going so
okay now this is all this is effectivity
50-50 chance for you I cannot say one is
better than other what you can do is you
can do some research I would I would
suggest you to go for both learn the
basics of Android learn the basics of
development web development and see what
matches with you if you're still
confused take a point and flip it
okay I will not give the result but I
rated some well when you flip the coin
and once the coin is on I mean when
before looking at the coin I mean try to
try it
I know pray which one you want so in
your in your brain you will be having
that signal you know this is what we
want so like I'm not able to put that
into words but then you can try it out
okay so which language is which language
for full back-end development you can
use any language you can use a cigar net
you can use Java you can use PHP you can
use Ruby personally I prefer Java
because of stability because of
enterprise world everyone I mean most of
the enterprise softwares are built on
Java
I prefer Java but then Java is damp
ostomate when you want to deploy it
somewhere right even my website is
deployed on a very very very what do you
say a very costly server so again so if
you if you can invest of course go for
go for job otherwise I would say you
should go for PHP or if you want to make
a make it cheap because when you when
you deploy it
PHP space are compared to Java space
those are those are I mean not that
cheap I mean that don not that costly it
will give it a get you know cheap price
but if you can invest another go for job
of a back-end development
okay oh and be take okay so but yeah
okay so so I mean we take first year
which language should I learn for we
have asked you this questions we are
done with that am I getting the repeated
questions now
Sacco says happy birthday oh this is
that is not next month it is August 20
okay you can wish that wish me then okay
so next please make a video on Big Data
Hadoop and machine learning mmm I let me
try let me try okay so next question
from Andrew jars are you okay now that's
thing to do is going to be free no
spring would be for you Danny all for it
will be a paid course okay I I think I'm
okay is it life
it's like right there's no problem
health is purple okay I thought
something went wrong okay whitey nine
people are watching if you are enjoying
this session do click on the like button
so that I will know that everything one
is watching and I lost all my questions
it went up directly I don't know where
was I so let me just go with let me just
go with any pep I mean with any point
here I'm going for this question can you
please teach Python in fact I am not
comfortable with Python yet the moment I
get comfortable I will I will certainly
make videos on that and what do you say
I'm a big nerd in Python I'm not
intimidate also so I cannot make videos
on that this shop says should I go for
community programming of course you
should go for comedy programming ok that
is what you say that's how you can
improve your skill set ok so ok you can
help me with one more thing if you are
you know do share this videos with your
friends so if you if you get time now
just share this link on your Facebook
profile so that everyone will know that
something is happening because I want to
teach more people and I can see this has
Kaabah town now is seventy nine thousand
eight hundred seventy nine let's make it
one lakh soon so do share this videos
with your friends let them know about
this channel let everyone learn about
different technologies for free right so
please make a video of small projects
using framework that's what I did you
know last two months well that was I was
doing it I don't know if you have seen
my videos we were building my own
website you're saying I mean I was doing
that code live again more videos all on
the way the Android video is on the way
it will be done tomorrow day for
tomorrow and to it life will be going to
power so by Tuesday will be going for
the second live session of Android
because I just got free on Friday
I'm trying to let's see how it goes so
I'm building to attach stuff okay so
okay that sounds Kurt okay which is the
big okay next one is okay what do you
think about a language oh it's color is
very good if you want to get into big
data because in big data nowadays we are
walking on spark initially we were
working on Hadoop and now people are
finding Apache spark powerful than
Hadoop so for for spark Scala is
compulsory you don't have a choice I
mean of course you can use Java and
Python or using ant spark but then Scala
gives you more power right so Scala is
faster when it comes to other these two
languages again that's on theory I don't
know about implementation because
different limitation will give you
different speed but if you are going
into big data for sure you should learn
Scala it will be helpful I am NOT saying
when I say you have to learn star that
that doesn't mean she should not you
should not know Java you should not know
Python but you learn Scala is where it
will be helpful okay Kareem Shah says I
don't think you have compared to cotton
in series the thing is I have made all
the basic videos which are required to
be to learn Android okay since I see the
main idea of making my making those
videos are to give you that head start
so that you can learn something example
let's say if I don't make videos on
Cortland and if you want to learn
Android using Cortland maybe you already
know Android Android so the videos which
I made will be helpful for you to learn
and other video which I made on path and
will be helpful for you to learn Android
okay so so everybody's I mean every
video for me in the last video but then
later I realize okay I can make one more
video I can make one more video because
it takes lots of efforts to make those
series you know I don't know how you
take it here on your site but it takes
lots of time to build a series I've made
approximately four to three videos on
Cortland okay more videos will be coming
but then this are enough to do start
with Android so that's what I build it
okay so next video ok Python done no
cost next next next
okay okay next question so everyone says
hi okay next question is from go ahead
should I go for gate exam or direct job
okay if you want to okay
giving gate exam will not be a bad thing
it will be good for you in future but
then if you have done your engineering
you can start with job as well right if
you got a good go but you say good
aggregate in your exam you can start
with job make make some project because
the world is changing now no one is
asking for certificates they are asking
for projects even if you want to go for
Oracle certification it will not it will
not be of much help if you are building
some projects so if you compare whatever
certification and projects I would say
build five projects which will be bigger
than a certificate because certificate
will because there are lots of people
they give or like an exam they get 93
percentage by knowing anything I mean by
knowing that thing what they do they
learn terms and they write and they
learn they give exams they buy how atoms
actually so we have some dummy dummy
questions they buy hard those questions
they give exam and it's of no use but if
you build project it will surely prove
your skills you know if you want to if
you're going for the introduce you can
show you can show you show your projects
that's what I believe so build some
projects okay next okay so please upload
video in advance Java oh I do have some
videos on advanced job but the only
thing is you know of course there is
something which everyone should know
that's why I built the entire series for
advanced Java I believe you know
attending the life courses will be
believe any beneficial and that's why I
started with the Android life courses
not Android I don't want our life forces
a spring life cause hibernate life goes
so because these things are its are good
when when you learn one-to-one otherwise
when you learn by paying some amount the
problem is there are lots of people they
don't take three things very seriously
right because it is for free so they
don't don't take it seriously so okay my
plan is to not so the spring videos
which I am making I will be giving you
those courses but not free but it I will
not charge a big amount
so that you will be you people with me
serious and again I know they're not
there will be lots of people in this
chattering that they will say we don't I
mean we cannot pay for the fees see if
you can afford a mobile phone if you can
afford a computer if you can afford an
internet connection if you can afford
that geosynchronous well you can afford
maybe a thousand rupees for a course
which will change your career right if
you're if you're buying a phone for
20,000 rupees which which does not think
I think I mean if you can buy a course
for 1,000 rupees which will teach you
lots of stuff so think about it that's
my thinking okay I might make some more
videos up for free okay let's see how it
goes okay okay so question myself saying
it is possible to achieve operator
overloading in Java I'm not sure I've
not done that because operator
overloading it was that in C++ it is
dead in Cortland using normal Java I
don't think it's possible but if you can
tweak your JDK then it is possible I
don't know how to do that okay next
question please start with AI for that I
have to learn AI and I don't know AI
unfortunately okay next question use of
dau glasses okay yeah before going for
that I can see people are watching this
sessions and hey you're not changing
this video on Facebook that's bad and
okay so do cup click on like button if
you are enjoying this sessions I can see
160 likes that's one of that so that's
awesome okay so great so question use of
doubt glasses now see when you talk
about job applications what we do is see
let's go in this way let's say you are
using Facebook or on Facebook you're
clicking on friends okay so you want
your friend list right so when you kick
when you click on that friends the
depression is what is server so on the
server side we have a controller which
will accept your request then it will
only it will only accept the request
right we also need to do some processing
that processing will be done by a
service layer right
but the question arise
your data is told on database right how
are you French data from database so you
need some special code using which you
can fetch data from database and those
code or I mean that code will be turns
in some class so that class which have a
code or which interact with databases
for the dowels or Dao classes now stands
for data access object it's an object
which works with either base okay mate
Vanessa database not exactly only our
DBMS it can be MongoDB it can be files
it can be okay that is no SQL MongoDB
you can go for big data doesn't matter
a class which interact with database is
called as a dau class okay what about
MongoDB MongoDB is unknowable database
where you don't store data in SQL format
you store data in a JSON format so yeah
so there's no SQL in MongoDB okay so I
can see we have already closed half an
hour okay three to four questions more
it's very difficult to answer all the
questions here okay so I'm trying to go
for as much as possible okay it's Java
certification useful nowadays kind of I
would say if I was at your place if I'm
new to programming if I'm new to
software development I would say I would
never I would not go for certification I
would go for projects okay because I
believe if I am employed also I will be
I will hire those people who have built
projects then I will have I mean I will
not hire certificate people I will hire
those people who have worked on project
by saying that I'm not I mean I'm not
saying that certificate is not important
it's just that if you have a choice go
for projects any important question
there okay is that okay can machine
learning get placed if I'm in a small
college company visiting are mostly
service based companies and require
skills like Java please reply okay this
is a problem you know there are lots of
companies they are going or service
based companies they are going for small
colleges that is that that is one thing
so what I would suggest is don't join
this okay if you want to eat it a
machine-learning I have not mentioned
the question the name is humans right
give me the question once again okay the
question is can machine learning get me
pleased if I'm in a small college
company visiting are mostly service
based companies require skills like PHP
Java etcetera please reply okay so yeah
the question is again if you are if you
are interested in machine learning the
thing is if you are interested in
machine learning
I would suggest before joining any
company before going for any introduced
Bay I'm in learn machine learning and
build small module okay again you cannot
build a big project in that build a
small module and go for the introduced
but cannot you're positive yes because
campus introduced always they will come
the people will have small colleges you
will be getting all this service based
companies if you if your sis if you're
serious about machine learning gained a
big company and for that I would suggest
for machine learning of course you need
certification it will be helpful from
where to get it in India we don't have
much certificate which much
certification courses but you can
achieve that online so we have Coursera
we have a DX you can go there get a
course and get certified that will be
the best way okay one last question and
then okay well okay question from Abu
Telescope load not working okay you are
hitting my point okay okay so this is a
point where I was supposed to make a
video on this what happened within his
scope low okay that's fine okay let's
talk about the thing boy where is the
disco Pro what happened any question
okay Ready Steady scope low okay my idea
behind making another channel called SEO
Pro was see I was getting lots of lots
of ideas in my mind making different
videos now if you if you talk about
subscribe or see I have approximately 79
okay almost eighty thousand subscribers
now like eighty thousand subscribers
know the entire
this here is their programmers right and
this is I guess I just love this
community where we have 80,000
subscribers right and we all are
programmers or to be a programmer now
out of this 80,000 there are some some
chunk of people they are big nerves okay
they know only basics there are some
people they they know some I mean
they're good with Java there are some
people they are exploiting Java now why
they subscribe my channel because I was
making great videos on spring I was
making videos on open shaped right so I
was making some advanced technology as
well I realized later I am mixing all
these tech technologies for different
set I mean for different set of people
if I upload a video or on spring now so
this big nose they will never get
confusion i done this or not if I upload
a video which is very basic it will be
live and the expense people will not
like it and I was facing that issue
because I was getting those things in
comment section
you know bigness was saying what is this
and if I make a video on spring or if I
make a video which is a very basic
experience people will say okay why you
are making this type of videos which is
which which everyone knows or they don't
understand that they are there are some
bigness they don't know this new stuff
so that's why I thought okay I will
upload all the advanced stuff on
telescope low ok the extreme part will
be uploaded on telescope low and the
basics will be their own that is
co-learning so what I did is I did some
live sessions the live session was done
on Tarascon learnings and the video was
available on telescope row now youtube
thought that this it is a fake channel
because it was on different email id so
you took taught it's a fake Channel and
they they terminated that channel I mean
that's very bad and so that the first
reason that terminated channel and
second I have I have not started a
change channel once again because I
wanted to make the disco flow as a paid
channel but the problem is the paid
content is not available in some
countries I don't want that no I mean I
don't want people I I want everyone to
learn from my channel right I cannot
stop people example there are some
people in some countries where YouTube
patron is not available and it will be
something like even if they want to pay
they cannot pay for that right so again
my planning now
to make videos and upload on telesco
learning itself the only thing is I'm
short of I'm short of money for to
invest in this project on YouTube
let's see how I can generate money now
because the lots of investment going on
example you can see this camera lighting
the lots of investment investment going
on so let's see how we tell how that
goes
maybe I will ask for donations let's see
how that goes
ok so ok that's it oh one last question
can I learn Java off with my videos yes
you can so you can watch my back you see
because on Java for free and you can
learn everything from that I'm sure
those are quite useful ok oh ok I'm
getting this question repeatedly ok I'm
missing USA and job opportunity is dead
no idea you know there are some students
who are living in USA from where I mean
to whom I'm giving online 20 now so
they're happy they got a job as well I
mean some of the people who are doing it
and doing MS in USA I have taken the
Java badge and some of them do they got
to got the job but I don't know about
everyone most of them most of them they
got they got the job but then they were
good at programming as well they were
good at analytical skills they were good
at programming they were good with
technical skills so if you're good at it
of course you will get a job but then if
you do if you are not good at technical
stuff even if you have MS degree you
will not get a job so yeah that's it oh
we have ok so I'm gonna do a question
from a lot of ok so ok now the questions
are getting up and up ok last question
selenium that's that last question
selenium ok what is selenium basically
selenium is a testing tool okay I have
not worked in selenium but then if you
want to test your software you can use
selenium ok selenium is a testing tool
okay okay I'm getting lots of questions
okay let's give 10 more minutes now
because I can see people are getting
angry now I don't know why you get angry
yeah come on try to understand this I am
going live
I got 181 people watching this video
and if you are bombarding with questions
you know I can't even see questions here
so just calm down okay
I'm trying our best to answer all your
questions let's calm down where was I
was talking about selenium it's telling
him is a testing tool if you want to
automate automate your testing you can
use selenium okay and if you want to
learn selenium you have to start with
Java so first learn Java first and then
go for selenium okay so we were who I
want to answer I know the answers and
type you're coming type of question now
because I cannot see any questions about
they've all went about so okay from I'm
sure okay so I am doing BSC CS I'm in
second year semester I have learnt C++
and Java oops but I have a problem in
learning java's graphics can you suggest
me a solution for this graphics in Java
I can start with native ad ability first
because ADA 2 T do does have some tools
to create those graphs so learn the
basics of aw T or try to understand how
graph works because C to draw something
on on the console or the only on that
frame you need to know the frame also I
mean which point I mean your pixel start
with the first location zero point zero
comma zero and then it goes down so you
should know the graph as well once you
know graph it should be good with the
calculations right the motions all those
things I don't know exactly what you are
stuck with we're talking about what
language should I learn next
oh okay this is a bit different
different question okay after learning
C++ and Java
oops you don't want to go for graphics
oh okay the language we should you
should learn next is learn it once I
mean learn the advanced java part now
once you know Co Java go to the Advanced
part that's what you can do now okay
next question
Oh again everything is going up hold on
hold on hold on I can't see questions
okay um I'm from Java background how
Hadoop is learn and how Java helps at
you okay why is okay why Java is helpful
for Hadoop is because when you talk
about how do you framework a new
framework is built on Java technology
and if you even if you want to program
and you have to you have to learn you
have to use Java now knowing Java of
course will not make it
I mean nothing Java is not enough for
Hadoop they're not something you have to
learn you should know about distributed
systems how sour works how the process
get distributed between be 20 feet
between different systems so if you have
the basics of digital systems if you
have the basics of java learning head
you will be very easy now some way to
learn it since I don't have a course on
that I can suggest you to go to little
site udemy these are some places where
you can find good help tutorials or in
fact I also bought a book which is not
here now you remember the book name how
do you I forgot the book name as well so
there's a book which is very very good
for Hadoop so you can buy that book in
fact if you go to amazon.com it's not
that now if you go to amazon.com if you
search my new book it will give you that
the book as the first one okay so that's
why that's how I learn did you okay I'm
not a complete I don't know completely I
do but then I have learned basics of it
okay okay yeah that said people are
asking lots of questions now okay again
I lost all the questions here okay
before had you what before had you what
to learn it it's not later what to learn
so before how do you learn Java and
destroy systems okay okay okay so that's
it okay what do you think of blockchain
technology yeah I heard about this thing
this term blockchain like chain but I
don't remember anything now blockchain
okay we'll talk about we decide we will
do any search on that blockchain okay oh
how did you practice or programming okay
do practice so if you follow any any
tutorials on YouTube before if you
follow my to dos on you
tube up in every session in every video
I will give you some code right so first
you have to practice that code after
that do some research is it possible to
do in this way is it possible to do in
that way once you have done with the
research once you do some experiment and
then afterwards after every five topics
build a small project based on that
topic that's how you can that but that's
how you can improvement improve your
thing okay that said that's it I'm not
stopping the door I'm shutting the live
session now one more question okay so
which one okay how much time required
okay this okay how much time is required
how much time of sleep is required for
programmers right okay now this is a
very favorite question for one of my
intern here okay so okay sleeping time
for fall for programmers okay so when I
was beginning in the programming world I
should say 24 photos or 45 was three
years or four years back I was sleeping
one day for five max five hours I used
to get I used to get I used to go to
sleep at 1:00 p.m. a 1:00 a.m. at night
and I should get up at 6 a.m. in the
morning to go to office or to good to go
for the training so I should say 24 5
was but now I sleep for seven hours so
it's depends you know depends upon what
type of job you have so even if you
sleep for 10 hours it is not enough for
some people right so it's not actually
programmer it is actually depend upon
people so Dennis Lee was not not enough
for you guys right so I now I sleep for
seven hours I get it in it isn't enough
for me so just deepen I want people to
people okay okay so please answer it
which question but see this is the
problem you are not understanding this
you should be on my side you can see how
many comments are here okay you you are
saying I'm not answering your question
but then raise your question it's just
lost somewhere in the desert
okay okay okay last question but the key
values are question you are saying my
summer question but raise your question
I can't see your question
okay do one thing do one thing send me
your questions on Teddy's Scott training
send me a mail okay so it is telesco or
that there will be lots of males right
that is one problem
okay I'm typing my email id that is for
doing let's see how many how many
questions I can answer
so I'm I'm sending my email id send your
mail on this send your question on this
email id all okay okay now I will not
share day m'lady what you can do is
after this session gets over come into
your question in the I mean comment your
question just below this video
okay I will do all the questions I will
make those answers and I will make a
video on that okay I don't like to type
the answers but I will make a video on
that that is what I can do now okay
that's it so comment come in to your
question in the comment section I will
try to make a video on that let's see
