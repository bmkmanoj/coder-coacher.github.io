this tutorial we're going to learn the
box model and this is important because
you're gonna use it a lot so I'm just
gonna erase everything in here it's okay
if you start over just copy this text
here if you're starting from scratch and
then the CSS file I'm also gonna start
this from scratch
except I'm gonna leave the reset in
there now the box model has several
things to it and let's make one with a
div okay and let's just give this an ID
of test okay and I'm gonna make it test
here and let's give it a border of one
pixel solid red so we can see it okay I
should probably give it a height as well
let's do height 200 pixels and width
400 pixels how about 300 hopefully it
fits on the screen okay here we have a
box now basically what you can do with
boxes is add margin and padding a margin
is what goes on the outside of the box
so the margin will affect the outer
edges of the box so let's take a look at
that margin 10 pixels this will add 10
pixels on every side and you see there's
an invisible margin on the outside of
this box
now what padding does is it affects the
inside of the box and the only way I can
really show you that is by adding some
text in here so we have some text in
here and padding will affect the inside
of the box so let's add some padding and
we'll do 10 pitch
schools on all sides and refresh and now
the inside of the box has padding now
there's one thing you need to consider
is that when you add margin and padding
the overall size of this actual box is
changing so this box is not actually 300
pixels wide anymore it's more like let's
see margin adds 10 to the left and right
and padding adds 10 to the left and
right so it's actually 340 pixels and
then the height is actually 240 so
things you can do to keep it the actual
size you want it to be as you subtract
40 from 200 so this would be 160 and
this would be to 60 and we refresh that
and that should be the original total
width of 300 pixels from the edge of
this point all the way to the edge of
the invisible margin here because this
can trick you up sometimes when you see
a width of oh sorry that's supposed to
be 260 there we go now it should be the
correct size this can trick you up
because of the margin and the padding
now there's obviously margin right you
can do 10 pixels margin left 10 pixels
margin top and margin bottom now you can
also put padding here instead of margin
and I'll show you the shorthand way to
do this if you do margin 10 pixels like
so this will apply whatever you put to
every side
if you do margin 10 zero this applies to
the top and bottom the first one right
here and the second one applies to the
left and right so if you refresh that we
still have the margin at the top and at
the bottom so it basically you can also
use four of them let's say five pixels
and 12 pixels now this might look
confusing let's see what it does
okay what this does is it counts
clockwise and it starts at the top
so those top-right bottom-left and if
you have to you could always make a note
like margin top right bottom left and
you can do that with um padding 10
pixels 5 1 pixel 12 pixel another thing
you should consider is when you have a
border on here it's actually 2 pixels
wider and 2 pixels taller because this
pixel takes up one space so if we get
rid of all this stuff and just put it
back to 300 pixels and say 200 pixels
this isn't actually 300 by 200 this is
actually 200 and 2 because there's a top
and a bottom 1 2 and the width is
actually 300 - because of the two walls
so I mean if you are trying to get exact
pixel proportion you will just do 298
and 198 so a little bit of math is
involved sometimes and you might wonder
well why is this important this is
important because if you have a layout
and you're trying to fit things in a
certain area like 900 pixel area and you
want your sidebar to be a certain size
than the right side to be a certain size
you want to get things perfectly
accurate so that's a
pretty much it for the box model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
