check out the content aware fill and to
use this you have to open a flat file so
that the background is this locked layer
and what you do is you delete something
that you saw XO I'm just going to select
this window piece right in here and
press Delete and you see Phyllis's
content aware and I'm just going to
press ok and it fills it in that's
pretty good looking it looks like it
tried to get some of the floor down
there a lot if I try to delete in this
object well with that one messed up and
what about this chair I'm just going to
select it real quick that chair turned
out pretty good you can still see the
lines you could touch those up maybe or
refined the edges of your selection
here's one I notice there's problems
with them in the background it's blurry
in the foreground it's blurry and
there's a little bit of focus in the
middle and it seems to have troubles
with the pictures like this so i just
select that delete and what do we get it
gets rid of it pretty good and makes
these leaf textures look like they're
really attached but it still has this
blur and that'd be pretty tricky to fix
try deleting that again come on
content-aware alright let's try another
one oh this one's pretty cool the
perspective now that would be really
tricky i'll just select this first
window and delete and i get different
results sometimes we get that little
panel there it looks like it's getting a
piece of an upper window how about this
one sounds pretty good
we're closing up shop all right about
this one not too bad and the trash cans
I had problems with let me get rid of
SAT piece and it doesn't really know
what to do exactly it looks like it's
trying to get the perspective a little
bit but so not everything's going to
work perfectly get rid of some greats
that one turned out a little funny how
about a window back here oh now it
doesn't know what to do all right here's
a little picture of a woman fishing and
i'll just select a little boat and i'll
try to get some of her neck that little
line there whoops delete and pretty
close let's see if you get a little bit
more well that looks pretty crazy but
look how good that looks you could
almost make it so it looks like there's
nobody even there do a little more over
here now you got a picture world so I
know what it was in it cool let's close
that and the last one we could try to
delete some junk on the wall look at
that smooths it up I'll put a little
hole for us there let's uh delete one of
these panels that one had problems
both of those did and how about this
whole door frame that's not too bad got
rid of an entire door frame alright guys
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
