dream.com and in this tutorial we're
going to learn about IDs and classes in
the previous tutorial we did some
elements like so now we're going to work
with IDs and classes so the first thing
we're going to do is an ID so make a
divider and to give anything an ID we'll
just pop in ID equals and then we give
it a name and for the most part I'm just
going to call this header and down at
the bottom I'll make one called
footer div id equals footer and to wrap
everything in the middle inside I'll
just call this content whoops
div id equals content okay now if you
refresh your page you shouldn't see
anything really different we still have
to define things so I usually put these
under the body tag is a level of their
importance because IDs are kind of like
the structure of your whole site and to
write an ID
once again you use the squigglies and
you use a pound sign so we had a header
content and footer easy enough and let's
just say for the header we'll make the
width 500 pixels for the height
we'll make it 200 pixels and for the
background
we'll make it black and for the color
we'll make it white now you'll notice
this time I used hexadecimals in
shorthand oh let's just save this and
there we have a header that's black
let's put some text in there let's call
it my page
there we go for the content
let's do width is 500 pixels the height
should be it should be flexible and
stretch with however much content is in
there so I'm going to leave that not
even declare it and for this I'm going
to give it a border of one pixel dashed
and white and I want to add some padding
so that the text isn't touching the
border so I'll just add padding equals
ten pixels and there's our content div
and the footer I'm not going to mess
with you could do whatever you want with
that okay so that's easy enough now you
see how we've declared width two times
here a good thing to consider when
coding our programming is to use not
reuse code too much so what I would do
is I'd make a wrapper if we wanted our
whole site to be 500 pixels that make
div id equals wrapper then all the way
at the bottom we end the div and at the
top let's make a wrapper id we can take
this width out and in the wrapper it
constrains everything within it to 500
pixels what's nice about a wrapper is
also you could Center things and the
center things we do margin whoops
margin:0 auto now this is a shorthand
margin but just remember that when you
want to Center things and now our page
is centered now let's go to some classes
and a class starts with a period class
and let's make one called
bold how about one called you let's just
make these even shorter just dot B and
dot you okay and four dot B we're going
to do font-weight:bold er four dot you
will do text-decoration:underline okay
now you don't need to remember all these
early off the top of your head you'll
probably remember them by doing them
over a hundred times so you know don't
burn yourself out just trying to
remember everything also if you use a
IDE integrated development environment
they give you code hinting that'll make
this a lot easier I personally think
it's best just to learn to type it all
by memory and you'll just never forget
it
so how about this down here let's say
span class equals B and then end the
span now what does class B do right here
dot B font-weight:bold err so we refresh
the page you can see this text is bolder
and the same thing for if we do u span
class equals u and refresh and this text
is underlined easy peasy
now you can also combine two classes
into a an element so span class equals B
space you now the sorry the space
is important you would normally think
that you would separate it with a comma
but you separate it with a space so
we're on the h1 tag and there was o this
h1 tag is already bolded so that's how
you use classes and classes as you can
see are used here here you just reuse
them all through your page often for
formatting text links and other little
things so that's pretty much it for the
IDs and classes just to remind you IDs
are for your structure and should only
be used once each per page so there
should be one header one wrapper and
classes are reused over and over alright
keep practicing and this will be really
easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
