I'm just gonna cover a simple XML it's
pretty good to know it's really easy to
use there's a tutorial on PHP dotnet
it's pretty good but if you like to
watch someone do it here we go the first
thing I'll do is simple XML load file
and I've already made an XML file called
test XML okay and this will load the
test XML file and let's just make
something let's say um people will be
our main container and let's just say
person whoops and let's say name Jessie
age 26 okay and I'll copy this and just
create one more I'll call this guy Joe
and I'll say he's 27
alright so there's a very simple XML
document and what you want to do is
assign the load file a variable
I should mention you can also load it
from load string and you'd put the XML
stuff in here but I kind of like to use
load file it's just cleaner and next
let's do echo 3 and print our xml and
refresh look how beautiful this is looks
pretty familiar doesn't it
now we have a simple XML object that
works like an array and we have the
person we look at the XML the person I'm
sorry right here and there's two of them
in there so we have name age name age
and it just works like a regular array
so if we wanted to select let's say the
age of Joe I'd say XML
person
actually I do person zero age save and
sorry Joe is number one there we go if
there's his age pretty easy to use echo
XML person zero name there we go now
there's a lot of other features like
let's say you have a name of a field
let's just call this body weight let's
put in 500 whoops so we have one called
body weight and if we do xml person body
weight we can't do that because this -
here is an illegal character so they
just built it in so that you put these
little squigglies around it and make
sure you comment it like that okay so
now we can get the body weight and
refresh 500 that's pretty cool if we had
more children also inside of body weight
let's say i'll let's call this blah blah
and I'll call this block too okay so we
could go like this and just add on to
that and say blah - and there we have it
you can also get values from the
attributes and you can do that let's
just get rid of this and the XML and
attribute let's say type equals boy we'd
say XML let me print our the XML again
so it's easy to tell what we're doing so
when we have an attribute you see it
puts it right inside of the element
right here so you'd grab it like this
XML person 0 type and refresh I better
comment that out because now you can't
see it there we go boy you can also
output the XML if you want like this you
say XML as XML echo that out and we have
this here if you view the source it
comes out as the XML so what if we
wanted to do some more stuff you can say
XML let's add a child so let's go to
person 0 add child let's just say height
and we'll say five hundred centimeters
and refresh when we have this here let's
see where that went
new page source this went inside the
person object good and I could get all
that attributes if I wanted from the
section let's say for each XML person
zero as data and I'll just say echo data
dot BR and refresh I get Jessie 26 and
that would be because here in here
it doesn't recursively grab the children
inside of here though you could do
another object or I look at SPL you can
also pop in XPath with this I'm not
going to do that XPath is kind of used
for querying I think it's like regular
expressions and fine
stuff but I think you know just play
around with this it's pretty easy to use
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
