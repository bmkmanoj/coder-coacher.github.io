7 and I'm gonna show you how to create a
new theme that you can work with and
here's just a fresh install kit and by
the way I really like Drupal 7 it's
really pretty and easy to use I'm gonna
go ahead and go to appearance and under
appearance you see we have a bunch of
themes and all this stuff and this dark
theme is a pretty good starter theme
because it's Barenaked and what I'm
gonna do is open up my Drupal folder and
go to themes and here's the Starke
folder I'll just right click and pick
copy and I'll go back and go to Drupal
sites and then under all and then under
themes I'm gonna right-click and paste
and then let's name our themes something
we'll use for my example I'll just use
dreams since that's the name I always
use and down in the dot info file we
need to rename this our theme name so
I'll call this dream dot info and then
open that up and I'll call this dream
and you can change in here what you want
let's see core and I'm probably going to
get a reset file reset CSS Eric Myers
reset this is a nice one
and you can just copy this URL if you'd
like one and I will make a new file
paste this in and I'll say this I reset
dot CSS close that and under the
stylesheet so I'll make another one of
these called style sheets all equals
reset dot CSS and I want that to go
before the layout so package core I
think this is good I can delete this if
I want and I'll close that close this
and layout that CSS okay and that should
be good I'll refresh this scroll down
and we have dream 7.0 I'll enable and
set default okay and you can close this
and it will refresh your little area and
now you have a plain thin to work with
so if I were to open layout CSS I could
put something in here like let's say
body background of silver and I'll hit
refresh and there we have it one thing
that you might be wondering is how can i
edit this template like the HTML and
stuff well you can override that if
you'd like or I would probably use like
the structure blocks and all this stuff
but if you want to do that if you want
to get the original files you would go
to triple modules
system and in here there's files called
dot TPL dot PHP and these are the
template files TP l stands for template
and what you could do is just copy page
this is your main page the page dot TPL
dot PHP and then go back to your sites
all themes turn and then just paste it
in here and to see if we made a change
I'll just scroll down in this file and
say I made a change I'll put it right
here okay and you could change all your
element tags and everything if you
wanted I wouldn't mess with all the PHP
unless you really know what you're doing
but I'll save that refresh and you see
nothing's changed that's because this
template is cached into the database so
to make changes with that you would go
to configuration and how let's see down
to development and performance and we
would do clear all caches
and it's clearing all that stuff from
the database I'll go ahead and close
this and here it is I made a change so
all you're doing is just overriding the
files you can include a node there's a
couple of them to look into one more
thing if you go to structure and let's
say blocks one thing you'll have to
notice is that if you're working on
blocks over here there's tabs here for
different themes and you might
accidentally be in like this theme and
you're changing stuff and nothing's
changing on your actual site you got to
make sure you're on the right tab and
the way around that is to go to
appearance and disable themes that
you're not using
and I'll go back to structure blocks and
now you see it only shows two here and
you should probably know CSS if you're
gonna actually do this by the way but
that's a quick introduction and thanks a
lot for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
