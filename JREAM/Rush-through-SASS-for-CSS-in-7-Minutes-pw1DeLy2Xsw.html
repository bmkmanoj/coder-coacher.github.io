can write it a lot nicer you'll want to
install a compiler now when I say
compiler this isn't early like a C
compiler it's just changing your code
into regular CSS and you're writing it
almost exactly the same as CSS anyways
so I use koala it's open source and it's
available for Apple Windows and I think
that's Linux I don't know what else it
would be and koalas what I'll be using
that's just this little guy here a cool
tool for web developers okay so I just
made a little sample project with an
index.html file I included a CSS
stylesheet and notice I have a CSS
folder and it's including here and I
made a sass a subdirectory you could put
these in the same folder if you wanted
but I like to keep them separated okay
so pretty easy so far and what I'm going
to do is open up the little koala guy so
let me open my folder and here I'm going
to drag this public guy in here okay and
it's detected I have a CSS file and a s
CSS file and I'm going to right-click
this and set the output path to public
CSS style yes and I'll click this guy
and this little auto compile every time
I save my file it should automatically
compile it to the style.css so really I
never actually edit my CSS file I'll
just edit my sass file and they have a
couple options here I don't know compact
it I don't compile so it was successful
I have nothing in here though so there's
really nothing there and what we'll do
is we'll just make a variable first I'll
say dollar B G will be f2 f2 f2
we'll do a body tag and say background
is BG and let's make another variable
called FF for font family how to say
Arial and I'll say font family is FF
alright so open this guy up refresh and
there it goes
so that's nice that it compile alright
when I saved it and just ignore these
characters because this is a demo video
I just pasted some funny non UTF
characters or some stuff like that so
what's cool about sass is we can do
something like this let's take a look at
our Dom I have a container into h1 okay
and I'll just throw it h2 in here list
so if I wanted to grab only the
container and the UL li I would instead
write it like this dot container UL li
or you know I really could just say URL
I like that and I'll say padding equals
10 pixels and you can assign anything to
a variable to now this is a class I
believe I had it as an ID nope okay so
that should have compiled okay you see
every time I save it compiles into this
nice little guy here I'll go ahead and
refresh and there's my guy so it's so
very convenient to use man and that's
not the limit if I go to the sass stocks
learn sass they talk about nesting here
which this is a lot easier to read than
those one-liners and everything go down
a little bit partials are cool let me
show you these I'm going to make a new
guy and I'm going to go and call him
colors dot s CSS and if I wanted to have
some colors like blue
you color will be blue and red colored
red oops these don't now this is just a
quick and dirty way to show you alright
and it starts with an underscore and
what we do is we do a little import with
it so I'll just say import colors like
that and I'll look at my style CSS and
you see how it just includes that sub
file it's that partial file with the
underscore and you can do as many of
those as you want to kind of keep things
organized which they basically talk
about here
mix-ins are pretty cool and I'm just
going to copy their example because it's
a really good example you know how you
always got to type up border-radius or
something
heck I couldn't even make a new file
I'll just call this mix-ins
with an underscore I'll paste that in
okay so this will apply a border radius
of all that good stuff on with all these
settings so it's cross browser and one
call in the style.css I'll just load up
mix-ins okay and let's find a div to
give a color let's just say div id
equals box kay
we'll have a test box and um back to
here I'll take the box I'll say
background will just be read we're being
lazy and I'll pace what I had here and
it was this @include okay so a border
radius of five pixels let me add a
height and width okay
and let's go ahead and refresh that bad
boy see if you worked and there is he's
not very big 120 there we go
and you see how the border radius
appears there basically what that
variable did was if we look the CSS file
you see how it rendered all this stuff
out for us saved us a lot of time very
cool let me go down a little bit there's
this extended and inheritance where
you've probably run into this before I'm
not going to do an example because it's
really straightforward you have a
success and error and a warning and
they're all a message and they might
have a different background color border
color but they have the same width and
padding and instead of doing this comma
list like this and then making separate
classes like this
they give you the option to just extend
a class or ID which is it's pretty cool
I like it but other than that they got
operators and I've never touched these
yet so anyways that's an introduction to
sass if you guys have any tips and
suggestions leave a comment because I'm
pretty new to it and the baby's crying
so I gotta go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
