we're going to just take a photo of a
person try to make it look kind of cool
almost like a CD cover this is just a
guy for a band called newsboys I just
pasted it in here so since the overall
background of this is black what I'm
going to do is paint the bottom layer
black and you'll see why in just a
second okay and what I'm going to do is
um a layer mask I think it's called this
little square with a circle in it click
that and we get this little attachment
layer here and what this allows us to do
is do a gradient fade ok so I'm going to
select the gradient tool and I want the
black to white okay and if you don't
have this just click this click one of
these make sure this is black make sure
this is white and you'll be good to go
you don't want the transparency won't
either so what i'm going to do i'm just
going to fade this down a little bit
this thumb looks kind of funny there so
it's kind of like that and i'm going to
add some text ok says newsboys if you
don't have the right color just select
the text and flip it around if you need
to and i'm going to use just ariel and
let's make it about 48 and bold ok and i
am going to put the letters closer
together because sometimes that was kind
of cool there are yet negative 25 let's
do negative 75
100 okay that looks kind of cool and
let's do some layer options so right
click the text layer and go to blending
options you can't see it on my screen
but it's pretty easy to find it's like
the second item X let's give it a little
silver overlay so I'm going to click
gradient overlay here and that's a
little too dark for my liking so you
could either change the gradient colors
or just make it lighter I'm going to do
mine a little lighter and I'm going to
do bevel and emboss and with the inner
bevel the size is going to be really
small so that it might be hard to see in
this video but the edges get a little
outline so it looks like it's popping up
a little bit and you can change the
depth if you'd like actually like all
these settings right here okay and the
next thing we're going to do to make it
a little cooler just move this up now
hold alt and drag down and we get a copy
of this ok and I'm going to go to edit
transform flip vertically ok and this
lines up with all of that and I'm going
to make a new layer and I'm going to
hold control and click this layer so
we're selecting this upside down thing
and an empty layer I'm going to press
ctrl e or you could right-click and
select merge layers so now this is no
longer text it's actually a graphic and
with this I'm gonna add this layer mask
I'm not sure what this is called but we
get this little square box here and
we're going to do the same thing we did
before with the gradient and just kind
of fade it up there we go and it looks
like it's kind of reflecting you could
change the transparency if you like
that's a little dark thing that looks
pretty good and
let's see okay let's take this layer
here and just make another copy I'm
going to put this on the very top and
I'm just going to find one of these that
look good so um sometimes color burn
where's color Dodge where's color burn
way at the top of a color burn can look
good sometimes and if you wanted to give
it like a little background let's say
just repeat this text I guess we could
do it this way i'm going to merge these
two layers and kind of move them over
you're probably wondering what is he
doing oh don't worry okay so we got this
layer of newsboys text now we want the
actual guy to be on top of that and how
are we going to do that we are going to
select the magic wand tool and that
selects most of it for us and you can
hold alt to not select something well I
guess that doesn't work out how I want
it let's see what it does and we get
newsboys put this under it let me hide
these two layers this looks kind of
funny I guess you know I'm gonna do it
like this because this might look kind
of neat then I'm just gonna select some
transparency and I'm going to once again
do one of these masks and there we go it
looks like it's behind him you could
also do the eraser tool to get rid of
the stuff here why don't we do that real
quick so get it off his hand and his
face if there's any that you could see
on it you could erase that
okay the rest looks pretty good and
let's turn this layer back on sorry let
me move these over I think this will
look a little better smaller okay and
there we have a neat little edited photo
