maze or sorry I'm not going to make a
maze I'm going to make a little
character that moves around the screen
in JavaScript just to get you started on
let's say if you wanted to make a
javascript game and to do so I have a
character I just found on the internet
just a little funny looking guy I had my
index.html file which is this file and
I've included jQuery a JavaScript file
called maze because I was going to do a
maze but nope
and a stylesheet for the maze and I can
just delete that one there and I have a
div id of map and that's where stuff is
going to go mm-hmm so first things first
I'm going to bust open the CSS file and
define map and what I'm going to do is
give it a border of one pixel solid
black and it's going to display as a
block so I'll say a height will be 300
pixels and width will be 800 pixels and
refresh and it looks like we got
something good there cool and for the
player I'm going to define him in the
CSS and he's going to be oops player
and he's going to be position oops
absolute and background:url of character
dot PNG with no-repeat that's just a
name right here and he's got to have a
width of 109 pixel height of what was
that 154 this is just for an example and
you might get some better ideas just by
following this way of doing it and I'm
gonna say border one pixel solid red
just so we know where he's at and I'm
just going to pop him in down here div
ID equals player make sure it works
refresh and there is cool I can go ahead
and delete that and what we're going to
do is have JavaScript insert our player
so I'm going to start with a function
and this is like the document already
but it's a shorthand version so pretty
much does the same thing this will load
when the page loads and I'm going to
create a variable called player and he's
going to be that div we just created so
div ID equals player and we're going to
pop him inside of the map so let's say
Matt dot append player
and refresh there is good I could get
rid of that border but I'm going to
leave it on for now and what we're going
to do is let our little arrow keys move
them around and this is positioned
absolutely so in the map we need to
position relatives so that map is
handled like a parent position relative
oops
with height I think that's good okay so
we got our little guy in there now what
we're going to do is mess with the arrow
keys and this is actually kind of
confusing so try to I'll try to explain
it slowly what we're doing is anytime
they press the up-down left-right key
we're going to do a function and we
actually do that on the document level
okay so key down function e e is the
function being called
I don't know how to explain that sorry
but I just put it in there and what
we'll do is we'll do alert e dot key
code and refresh and I'm pressing up
down left right and we get these numbers
so up is 38 left is 37 down is 40 right
is 39 so it goes clockwise from left up
right down okay so we're going to do a
little switch on this I'll say switch a
dot key code
oops and let's say case of Oh what was
it started at 37 so 37 case 38 case 39
and case 40 and I'm just going to
comment here that this was left 30 it
was up 39 was right and 40 was down okay
and what we're going to do is move the
player so mm-hmm I'm going to grab the
player and manipulate his CSS and we
want to break out of this after it
happens so we can pop this in all these
and I like my space in a little better
okay so I can comment this out up here
and what we have is we're going to let's
see get the current position of the
character so let's go ahead and do that
of our position equals player dot
position nice little thing in jQuery and
I'm just going to alert position so when
I press the arrow up it gives me object
object and just like with every other
language there's only a top and a left
for its position coordinates kind of
like X&amp;amp;Y
so if I did alert positioned top this
will refresh and it says zero it's
always going to be zero because that's
where it is right now all right so we
have this position and what I'm going to
do is if we go left we're going to say
CSS we're going to add left of position
dot left - 20 pixels and you'll see what
that does refresh and there is the left
one works and what's really happening
here is we're getting its current
position so we always want to get his
most recent position and depending on
the way we're going to move him we're
going to subtract or add to the position
so for up it's a little different we're
actually going to do top and these are
CSS things remember we're just taking
advantage of JavaScript so position dot
top and if we're going up you have to do
negative so minus 20 plus pixel and for
right this one is going to add 20 so
left and positioned left plus 20 pixels
and lastly four down will be top
position dot top plus 20 pixels and this
might look confusing but basically this
is adding and this is appending okay so
down cool I'm using all my arrow keys
and I can move him around now the reason
I'm doing it with 20 pixels goes a nice
little shape but if he was a lot smaller
I'd probably move them square by square
but if I did 50 pixels
I'd say refresh and now I have a little
character and what we would do is maybe
make a little map here in the background
with tiles but that that'd be kind of a
longer thing to do
so hopefully this maybe gives you some
ideas of something you could do and
