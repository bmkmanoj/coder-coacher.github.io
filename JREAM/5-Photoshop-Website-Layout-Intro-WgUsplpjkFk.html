tutorial will do a little bit of web
elements and I just took a screenshot of
the dig website and I'm gonna zoom in a
hundred percent now I'm a little
constrained in this work area but i'll
show you how to make a couple of things
first of all what i want to do is make a
new layer and I'll have this to work on
top of in the background and this isn't
like just to rip something off its just
to show you how shapes are made so
really what i do is i just select a box
like this to get that background color
and then I press the I tool to get this
colored then G and paint and then we'd
have that square there and you know you
could make it transparent to see what
you're working with make a new layer and
we got this cornered box so you know
you're just kind of building all these
pieces up I press I grab the color and
let's get some that's a little too round
maybe it's about six or so I'm all in
the space bar by the way when I'm moving
the shape around okay so you know that's
good enough and that'll be a good shape
and it looked like they had some corner
things that slide that way that's going
to be a little bit trickier let me make
this a little more transparent um well
there's a couple of ways we could do
this i'm just going to do this way i
think of right now um make a new layer
and i will make just uh this cover that
little angle there and then i'll grab
the I tool and I'll make a shape on top
over this like that and let's move this
back to a hundred percent then let's try
to move that
it's not perfect but hey okay yeah that
might be fine um okay I'm just not going
to get too picky about this then you
could hold alt and shift and drag it
over edit transform flip horizontally
and we'll have that right there and I'll
just hold ctrl click all three of these
layers and I will right click and go to
merge layers and now we have this button
up top and if we get rid of the
background you can see it's looking kind
of funny so you might want to just
straighten out that line there and I
guess you could grab the where's that
magic wand tool this one they're just
magic wand and you know you could delete
these little things here and we have a
little button easy peasy um you know the
same things going to happen down here to
this looks like it's a little bit of a
gradient possibly um so I'll just make
this layer here i'll hit the I tool and
I'm going to make a shape so it's not
going to be exact but we're just getting
the feel for it okay so we have this
here and let's go to let's move this
down a second and let me just click here
if I click here it looks like it's this
color and if I click down here okay it's
there's no Grady on that and you just
look at this you can see we're slowly
building a big loyal pretty cool this
looks like the fonts aerial so I'll just
make some text and i'll say about end up
here say Ariel um
maybe size 12 and it's going to be white
okay maybe it's bold it might have some
different CSS formatting on it whatever
we're not trying to clone the site just
trying to get familiar with things all
right it's kind of cool and now we have
a little GUI here that we're working on
a website and you can see how you do all
this and then we slice it if we want it
to break it up into little elements
because that's how websites build is
just a bunch of little elements and the
slice tool whoops right up here there's
the slice tool so we grabbed like a
slice of something um probably just grab
this button here ok there's the button
and double-click it and this is the name
that the file will save as so I'll just
call it button BG and I'm going to get
rid of text because that's going to be
put on there in HTML and then you know
we could slice this bar here and call
this main bar up for this header piece
we probably don't want to do anything
because that's just a solid background
and I'd go to file save for web and
devices and you can save these well I
thought you could save them one by one
but where am I at at the very bottom
just going to click Save and I guess
I'll just save it to my desktop so
slices all slices selected slices I'm
just going to do all slices and save and
on my desktop I have an images folder
and you can see here here's the button
BG the main bar you can just ignore this
other garbage we didn't name it's just
to give you a quick rundown and hope
this tutorial helped you i hope we'll
make something better next time thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
