play with jQuery user interface and you
can just go to jQuery UI calm the first
thing to do is download it and you'll go
here and scroll down and I just select a
download mm-hmm and included all the
options you can change your theme or
make your own no big deal
we just want to do something with it and
then go to demo and documentation and
you can choose some of these things to
take a look at it what we're gonna play
with is the slider okay and you see this
is just a little bar that slides left
and right and it's cool because it's a
little widget for your website so after
you've downloaded it unzip it to a
folder maybe on your desktop that's
where I put mine and you get an
index.html file everything is pretty
much included and I'm going to edit mine
and I've already cleaned this out
basically I went from this point where
we include the user interface and
deleted everything and just left this
here I've included a custom JS file
which is where I'm gonna write the
JavaScript code so make sure you go to
your J's folder create a custom J's file
and I'll go ahead and open that and I
just have a document ready function in
here and you can make sure it's working
by doing alert one and we can make a new
tab and just testing and drag that in
there and one so it's working the next
thing we're going to make a slider and
to make a slider we need to attach it to
an document object on the page so let's
make a div ID and call this slider okay
and in the custom j/s I'm just going to
grab that div idea of slider and add a
slider okay
and refresh and I have this big nice
slider that doesn't do anything and you
can go to this UI page here and just
view the source and it's basically
showing us the same thing but what I'm
trying to show you is how to actually
use this so you can go to options here
and they have a bunch of these four
different elements we want to use and
what we want to do is change some of the
values whoops sorry about that and if
I'm in the slide or what I can do is
pass an object in here and an object in
JavaScript is these little squiggly
brackets and I'm going to say max will
be 25 and you don't end these with a
semicolon in this literal object you end
it with a comma and then let's do men of
0 I'll do a min of 10 and we could
change the orientation to be a vertical
if we want it and don't refresh that
okay now notice I have 10 to 25 my
minimum is 10 to 25 so there's really
only 15 clicks if you slid this up so
you can change that all these things are
different options if you decide to
change those and these are just options
here we want to go to events and when
someone changes the slider we want
something to happen okay and first what
I'm gonna do is create an item here
called div ID equals I'll just call it
s2 okay and I'll pop a 0 in there
basically we're going to make this div
stretch up and down and to know that
we're stretching that we need to add
some style in here so first I'll say
style and I'll say
whoops s2 whoops and I'll say background
I can't type very well today
it's silver okay let me refresh that
okay so we have that there I'm going to
change this back to horizontal I don't
like that okay pretty fresh and when we
slide this it's going to make it bigger
and if we go back to the jQuery page an
event with a change you can see inside
of that object that we just made will
create a function so we'll say change
function event UI and you might not know
this but there's values inside of the
user interface that we can get back I'll
just do alert UI and you'll see what I
mean
and I'll drag that and we'll get an
object object and if you know how to
print object keys in JavaScript you can
find those out but I'll just give you
the answer its dot value so I'll refresh
and we get eleven twelve and it goes to
25 and back to ten so first thing we
want to do is update this value in the
box and we call that s 2 so I'll say s 2
dot HTML and that will be UI dot value
okay and refresh and every time I drag
this I get a new number works good and
now we're going to change the height of
the s2 box
so let's grab it again and say s to dot
CSS and I'm going to change the height
and I'm going to get the UI value and
I'm going to multiply it by ten so it's
it's visible and then I'm going to
append px to it four pixels and you
should know that if you know CSS okay so
I let go and it keeps getting bigger and
shrinking
now obviously you could do a lot more
with this and knowing the numbers you
can also create these well I won't go
into binding and all that if you really
create another slider you should give it
a different class name for example
slider to dot the slider so that this is
totally different and it won't conflict
div ID equals slider to and refresh and
now we have two sliders this one won't
interfere with that one and that one
still works and really what you could do
is make this effect the same element
when we do a change and I'll just grab
s2 dot
append and also you I'd value times 500
refresh and that adds just something to
the end of it so you could make sliders
work together if you wanted and I think
that's a pretty quick simple
introduction you can learn a lot from
this document page so check it out and I
hope this helped you and if they for
