about tortoise SVN today it's a Windows
application SB n stands for subversion
and when you download this it plugs into
your windows and let me just say that
most people won't need this unless
you're writing a lot of software or you
do a lot of coding or you could even use
it for images if you want to backup
stuff and keep records of progress
you've made but most people won't use
this and in my opinion by the way I
don't think the kind of new computer
users should use it because it can be
kind of confusing so here's a directory
which has my subversion on it and
basically what that means is all these
folders are stored on a network like a
computer though kind of like a web host
and it hosts my files and I have a
private subversion you can have free
public ones almost anywhere but if you
have a private one you usually have to
pay I will mention the one I use it's
called code spaces and because code
spaces is really cheaply priced the mini
for three bucks a month and it has
everything I need for private hosting
I'm not affiliated with them but I
really like them and they have a little
control panel in the back so I'm hosted
with them and all these files are on
their server but they're also downloaded
to my hard drive so what is this little
red check mean this means that I have an
update on my computer that's behind the
update that's on the server so if I go
into here what are they talking about
well that appears my icon is a little
bit out of date because I was monkeying
around here the question mark means you
have a file in the subversion that it
doesn't know what to do with so I'll
right-click this select tortoise SVN now
I can either add it or I can just delete
it
and whoops that doesn't work there we go
now what happens if I want like this I
just delete all this well I could always
get it back because I right-click
tortoise SVN and update to revision and
the working copy is what you usually
want to update to otherwise you could
update to previous revisions and I'll
press ok it's going to give me back all
the files that are missing isn't that
cool
if I open this and I'll just put some
lines in it save it and where is that
little red dot it seems like my I don't
know these icons don't always behave
perfectly well I guess you can see there
and I could right click and go to commit
and that means I'm going to commit the
update to what I have on my computer
onto the server ok and it's going at
revision 193 cool now alternatively I
could right-click this go to tortoise
SVN and go to update to revision and I
could even put this down to revision 1
and that's going to be very old if I
ever needed to do that for any reason I
can go to revision 78 if I had to and
what update does when you click here and
choose update here it goes it updates
everything on the server that what you
have now is going to be the working copy
so anytime I wanted to check out sorry
update to revision the working copy
would be the most updated version the
last time I did that pretty cool you can
do something like this make a new folder
aye-aye-aye and you'd have to
right-click and add the folder there it
is add what in the world is under here
Oh a bunch of temporary files that I was
monkeying around with but anyways you'd
add this and then to put it on your
server you would do commit so I will
delete that now I shouldn't tell you
that there are hidden files called dot
SVN I don't have them on right now but
you don't want to delete those files or
mess with them because that keeps track
of every folder and those will be in
every single little folder and let's see
tortoise SVN oops so if you have
tortoise SVN and let's say you're
working on a copy and someone else is
working on a copy and you both upload it
to the server what you're going to have
is a conflict and it's going to show
this icon up up here except without the
check and it's going to be that little
exclamation point in the triangle and
it's going to say hey there's a conflict
so what you got to do is you have to
merge them and this merge it's a whole
other story but you basically look at
the differences between the code and
this makes it really doable to work with
a team or one or two people or just
yourself if you have several computers
you work on and that's that's a pretty
cool thing let's see what else with that
sometimes you need to run cleanup now
exactly sure why off the top of my head
I forgot why how embarrassing
where was I oh learn PHP so if I wanted
to delete something I would actually
have to right-click and go to tortoise
SVN delete and the reason I have to do
that is because we don't just delete it
from our hard drive we delete it from
the server too
tortoise SVN to rename we have to rename
through tortoise SVN because what it's
really doing is sending a command
towards the host and changing the server
the name on the server not just our hard
drive branching and tagging that's a
little different thing and you can
create ignore lists also so that's just
a basic overview it's going to take a
while to get used to it but if you do
code things you should probably use this
it's pretty good and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
