guys had requested another blender video
or girls and so I'll go ahead and have
at it this will be a very beginner thing
we're going to make a model a very
simple one and will render it and I have
the screen up so that you know what
version i'm using and there are a few
things I want to say about it number one
is when you click a menu up here
sometimes it looks like it's not working
all you have to do is click and then
move your mouse down and then it shows
up and that was driving me nuts same
with down here and these it looks like
nothing's happening but you just move
your mouse up anytime you select
something so one of the main concerns in
the last series was you're using a
laptop and you don't have a numpad and
if you go down here to the view let me
shrink this little time line down this
is the little animation timeline so I'll
click view move up and you can actually
click your views here you see their
assigned a hotkey I don't know how to
change the hotkeys I'm guessing it's
possible but this is an alternative if
you need to access use from a laptop for
now so I hope that helps it also has the
perspective and ortho views to which I
talked about in the previous video for
example if I went to the top view and I
held down my middle mouse button and
just moved it a little bit you see we're
in perspective because this grid is
going into the distance but if I change
it to ortho mode you see the grid is
square and it doesn't really go into any
distance anywhere I move it and the
reason for that is it going to help you
edit things or if you want to render it
differently besides that i'm going to go
ahead and go to file new reload the
startup file so that we can all start on
an even keel and first let's talk about
this what is this over here
and what is this this little guy here
with the little circle and the dots
that's your light source and this here
is your camera and your camera is the
view in which gets rendered so if I move
the mouse i'm going to hold down the
middle mouse button and just dragged
slowly okay doesn't matter where you
leave off you see my view here it's
actually going to render from where this
cameras looking so I'll go ahead and
click render over here on the right and
you see it has that cube now hit escape
but you see how far away my cube is here
how about I do it from the top maybe
that'll help I'll go ahead and render
you see there is no top view I'll go
ahead and hit escape again and holding
down the middle mouse button so let's go
ahead and move the camera I'm going to
right click the camera now keep in mind
that right click is a right click I
always get it confused and now we're
going to just hold down the right mouse
button and drag this over to wherever we
want I'll put it here and then when I'm
done with dragging it I'm going to left
click OK and that locks it into place so
it's kind of like your happen back and
forth between left and right clicks a
lot and what I'm going to do is rotate
my mouse a little bit to see where the
camera is you can do this and play
around with it if you like I'm only
doing this to show you an example so I'm
going to left-click and hold it down
then I'll right click snap it into place
and let's see what happens when i render
you see how we're much closer to the
block okay so i'll hit escape
and I want you guys to feel like this
you're not getting lost so I'm showing
you examples then I'm going to reset the
file so what I'll do is I'll go to file
new reload startup file okay so we know
what these things are we know how to
select an object that's a right click
and it gets that little border around it
if I right click this right click you
can also hold shift to select multiple
things but what we're going to do today
is edit mode so I'm going to press the
letter A is an apple okay and that will
deselect or select everything just keep
pressing the letter A and you'll see
what it does and to do that you can
press the tab key or down here where it
says object mode we're going to go to
oops let me deselect these
it's like my things lagging behind a
little bit to have tab well that's
bizarre I've never had this happen
before let me make a new file I don't
know where my edit mode went reload the
startup file this guy there we go edit
mode and the shortcut to this is the tab
key right there so once you enable edit
mode go ahead and zoom in a little bit
and I'm going to press a to deselect
everything okay now with this little
plus cursor what we have our vertices on
the edge of this Square and they're
actually kind of hard to click but go
ahead and give it your best shot and go
ahead and right-click it looks like i
missed it there i got it and what you
can do is you can hold down your left
mouse button and drag and then
left-click to lock it into place okay
and slowly do this to try to get the
feel of moving stuff around and i'm
going to hold down my middle mouse
button and rotate just to see what i did
your shape doesn't have to look like
mine i'm just playing around so what i'm
going to do is just deselect with a and
I'm going to right-click this guy here
if I can I'm going to hold shift right
click that guy there so you see I have
two vertices selected and I'm going to
right click and drag down ooh i miss the
arrow it's like playing a game i'm not
sure why i can't grab that guy
I'll try with my right no that's
actually incredibly annoying there now
rotate when I rotate its losing the
touch there it doesn't it seems like I
can't move them both together that's
extremely annoying I do not like that
one bit click click with shift and I'll
try the red arrow mmm it doesn't like me
so here's what I'll do I'm going to
press the letter B okay and you get this
box selector and it looks kind of messed
up just being on a screen like this and
you're going to left-click and just
select like a portion right and then
I'll right click or left click all these
clicks keep getting me confused and with
this selected I could do something like
scale or extrude let's do s so I'll
press the letter S okay there we go when
you get something you like just click
and with that little top selected press
letter e to extrude but you can also
look on this side we have all these
buttons here if you want to so if i did
extrude region and click and I'll
extrude it once more and then we can
shrink it
whoops and extrude it a little bit more
and we're basically just making some
kind of junk right and let's render and
see this masterpiece it actually looks a
lot better on the render because it
looks crooked here so what I want to do
is actually something that you can
follow along with a little bit better so
once again I'm going to do a file new
reload startup file we have our cube
here right so let me just delete the
cube we'll start with something fresh so
I'll just go to add and I want to add a
that's not a surface I guess on cubed
from a mesh yeah we'll just do a cube
because it's easiest so I'll zoom in
with the mouse wheel and i'll press tab
to go to edit mode notice I press tab
and I unprecendented it so make sure you
have your object selected you'll have
this little border around it and i'll
press ctrl R whoops I'm an object mode
make sure you're in edit mode
come on it's going really slow for me
i'm not sure if it's the new version
because i'm on a super fast computer
okay so we're in edit mode and we have
it selected and i'll press ctrl R and we
get these shapes and this basically says
hey we're in what direction do you want
to make a slice and i'll just say here
click and what i did was i left clicked
ok and then where do I want to do it
I'll do it right here and I left clipped
again ok so what I also want I want to
do that again so control are once more a
left click and I'll just click right
there I'll press ctrl R again and I want
it this way ok i'll press ctrl R again
and you see this is where you can move
it and just click ok that looks good if
we were making a rubik's cube or
something it'd be kind of cool but we're
not I just did this so that it's going
to look cool while we extrude some stuff
ok I suppose we should add one more so
I'll just press ctrl R and get the
little purple guy there I'll just put it
a half way through ok and don't forget
to rotate with your middle mouse button
and just roll that mouse button if you
need to zoom out so what I want to do is
select a face of one of these and you
see this down here these three little
boxes we don't have to select everything
by vertices because that can be
extremely annoying this one here will
sell it select by edges so if I just
left click here let me try to get one
let me rotate so I can see what I'm
doing see that how we got that edge
there that whole line I can hold shift
and click this other line as well like
that and you can mess with full lines
but I actually really like the
face one right here and we have these
little dots I'll just left click that
guy and I'll say extrude from the menu
right here and slide up a little bit and
just click and that was kind of cool so
let's shrink it a little bit i'll just
do shrink and fatten and the mouse is
going at it automatically and then you
just have to right click okay i'm going
to extrude once again you can press the
letter e if you prefer and then i'll
also shrink it whoops all this goes in
the direction i don't want it to okay
and it's kind of like a little steep for
a castle or something next I'll select
this face down here with a right-click
and I'm going to extrude the region and
it's going to go inside I'll just make
it go back to there so it's kind of like
a pretend doorway or something and you
can kind of get the idea of how you
could model something with simple
squares there's a lot of things here
that you should play with let's see I
haven't tried this actually let me write
click this guy into a spin whoa check
that out that looks crazy I don't think
I want that so I'll just press ctrl Z
and undo it okay so by doing this you
can get some good practice and getting
familiar with the mouse and this crazy
graphical user interface and make
friends with these face select buttons
and pixel select if you do find a better
way rather than the box select like this
to select pixels let me know or if
there's a way to increase the vertices
size
I've actually never looked into that but
like an adobe illustrator vertices are
extremely easy to select and it's a lot
more intuitive than this so if you know
a way of that please post it in the
comments because it drives me crazy and
last but not least let's render our
final masterpiece look at that isn't it
a beauty okay so that'll keep you busy
for a while to play with all these tools
and try to make something simple like a
little building or a spacecraft alright
