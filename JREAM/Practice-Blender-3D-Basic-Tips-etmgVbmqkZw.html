I'm a bit under the weather you can see
it's through 21 am but let's get busy
I'll just open it up on my desktop and
here we have blender now you probably
get the welcome screen if i go to help
splash screen i'm using 2.7 to be and
the difference with this versus 2.6 is
they have little panels here that are
kind of nice to read so the first thing
i would do to understand blender is
pause for a minute and just chill
because the system is kind of
overwhelming at first so file user
preferences and i'm not going to go into
like the interface options and stuff but
you can adjust like the size of the
arrows to move stuff if you'd like but
let's go to add-ons and what you're
going to look for is this one mine is
already installed but just type in
navigation and you should see 3d
navigation and this will also help you
if you're on a laptop and you don't have
that numbered to flip around and you
just take it off right and once it
installs you'll have this navigation bar
to the left side called navigation to me
it's a bit hard to read things that are
sideways but I just know it's at the
bottom so once you do that you just save
your user settings and then close and
now in the navigation this might be
easier for you to use so here's front
back right left top bottom and you can
change from perspective to ortho
whatever so that's pretty useful and
then it has a camera view too so if you
hover over these it shows the shortcut
on the numpad so that's 0 for the camera
this should be but no perspective ortho
is five
and you know you can hover over these to
get used to them it's not too bad so I
just want to go to the default view
looks like I assumed them quite a bit I
never knew it was / all that titles
between camera and perspective cool
camera and global local okay so here we
are if I hold my middle mouse button
down and spin I rotate ok now the way to
get good at blender is to keep
practicing these silly hotkeys really
the navigation if I hold shift in the
middle mouse button you know you can pan
so getting those down is really the
trick so that you can navigate and then
being able to hop to like front back and
all that stuff if you don't want to use
the numpad I kind of like it I usually
get it wrong and I've been practicing
quite a bit so it is a learning curve so
I'm just going to go ahead and file load
factory settings whoops and click again
okay so let me just break this down for
you what this is it just starts with a
empty cube for whatever reason and
there's a lot of little symbols going on
so let's do one at a time try to focus
on the right mouse button the hand
you're holding your mouse and probably
if you're right handed and just
right-click this guy ok that's the
camera and what that is is what's
actually going to render so you see the
scene i'm looking at from this angle it
actually click this little camera icon
here and then click render it's
rendering a totally different view i'll
hit escape see how it's like this i'll
even zoom out so you would think oh
since i see this it's just going to
render like that nope so it's all about
where the camera is positioned then you
have this little
dot with lines and right click it and
this is a lamp or a light source and it
just provides light and there's options
for these things something right now you
probably don't need to worry about at
the moment and then when you right-click
an object when it has that glow it
selects it and then to deselect you
press a and if you're not all hot on the
hotkeys you know you can go down here to
the bottom and say select you can even
inverse it so it'll select everything
but the block but a is a really easy
hotkey if you have something selected
deselect ok and this little lifeguard
looking icon really weird so just left
click like here what's that going to do
is place the next object in that
location so if I said object I'm sorry
add a and we'll add a mesh and that is
that a monkey ok I don't know why they
add that so it just it adds it there ok
for positioning you could obviously move
these arrows but one thing that's quite
annoying is you select with the right
mouse button like click and I'm going to
use my right mouse button to drag this
blue arrow up ok so I'll drag it up and
you see the blue arrows supposed to be
constrained but it's not so I'll let go
and it's like oh ok so I'll click my
right mouse button again and it goes
back so you have a couple of options if
you happen to drag it with the right
mouse button and you want to put it
someplace you can press ENTER like that
I'm going to press ctrl Z to undo it or
you can use your left mouse button drag
let go and it'll behave how it is
supposed to move
like that you can also drag inside the
center circle without touching that
pivot point which is in the center of
the box and you can move those but
that's a whole different topic so you
can move it like that as well alright so
I'm just going to right-click this you
can press X to delete if you want or
usually you can just press the delete to
delete your call and you just hit enter
to confirm so I'll just click my little
guy here right and the hotkey of the
decade is shift a that means add and
that just brings up this menu ok so
shift a and let's add a cube and what
you can look at down here is we have an
object mode and then we have an edit
mode these are two good beginning points
to get familiar with right now sculpt
mode is a whole different thing it's
pretty cool but you know baby steps so
you can go to edit mode and now you're
only editing this square ok so if i
press a i deselect everything i press it
again it doesn't select the camera on
the light source because i'm only
editing this isolated object alright so
what we can do is I can just deselect
and there's a lot of things we can do
like there's a lot to learn with blender
let's start with this I'll press a and
i'll click subdivide ok and this divides
the square up into different parts and
the number of cuts down here under
subdivide make sure you are scroll to
the top i'm just going to hit two ok and
then I'll just press a to deselect ok so
what I want to do is move these lines
towards the edges so I hit kind of a
rounded cube right and if I click this
where am I you see down here we have
three options vertex side
or edge and face so right now i'm
selecting the vertexes right i can press
shift + select a whole bunch of them and
then you know do a bunch of stuff i'll
press a and get out of there but i want
to select the side right here I'm just
going to right-click and instead of
holding shift and going around the whole
circle I'm going to press the spacebar
and this is really useful when you don't
know where to find something in the menu
so I'm going to just type edge i'm
looking for a edge select edge ring
select control alt select mouse nope
that didn't do it let's try a loop
select click nope all there's more down
here I'm looking for select well that is
this thing called know
edge
man select edge loops there we go I
don't know why it wasn't working so
select that's odd it's not showing up in
here edge mm-hmm I am mistaken I could
have sworn this had it before okay so
let me just press a I'll right click
this just one of the edges and I'll say
select edge loops okay and I'm gonna
drag with my left mouse and bring him
here I'll press a this is just for
practice and it looks like there is no
hotkey so i'll click this and put him
over there we're just putting these
edges here select edge loops just saves
us time from having to rinky dink all
around and we'll move down and then i'm
going to hold down the middle mouse
button and rotate and click him yeah
it's kind of repetitive I used to know
the hotkey but there's a lot to remember
in blender select edge loops okay and
now we have something that looks kind of
interesting again I'm just holding down
my middle mouse wheel to navigate and
scrolling so what the heck did this do
well you can add a lot of modifiers and
kind of change the whole appearance of
it so if i go to let's see this is the
modifiers this little wrench guy i want
to add a modifier and what i want to do
is a subdivision surface like this now
when you see here this modifier the view
is just what displays in the view but
render is it too so if we should match
it up to two ok and you see that it's a
really smooth edge surface if we put it
to three we could change this to
wireframe to to see what it's really
doing so down here this is your viewport
display let's go to wireframe and you
see how many lines it gets meaning it
would take longer to render the more
vertices and stuff you have and change
this view to that you see if you
increase it it's going to use more power
to render and if you went to the
rendered view it's kind of like a
preview and then you can 3 2 so 2 is a
little choppy but you know who really
cares we're just playing around right so
in this little drop-down guy here let's
go back to the solid that's the default
and it's pretty nice to look at so
what's interesting is I'm in edit mode
and I'm going to you can press tab if
you want to go back to object mode that
tackles the back and forth but for the
beginner just boom what's interesting is
this object it's really a square so if I
show the bounding box you see it's still
a square and go to a solid and back to
editing mode let me just press a you see
it's still a square even though it has
those rounded corners so the vertices
aren't even lined up with this because
we didn't apply it so if I were to let's
just say right-click a random guy here
and move them over see it affects the
modifier right or maybe if I grabbed a
corner like that and dried them up
it's affecting the modifier but we're
using the cube base pretty interesting
so I'll just undo that the way to get it
to actually permanently stay in the
state that it's in rather than having
this bounding box you have to go into
object mode I just press the tab key and
you would hit apply okay so now this is
actually an object with curves so i'll
hit tab again and you see it looks a
whole lot different it has the actual
vertices and everything to it pretty
cool and you'll see a lot of tutorials
that do things different ways there's a
lot of different ways to do things i
want to show you some of the popular
methods for modeling okay so I'll just
press the tab to get out of here delete
enter and let's create a new object so
I'll just go to add mesh and let's do a
UV sphere okay and over here segments I
don't want a whole bunch of segments
let's just say oops let's do eight by
eight see if that's a good number
because if we're on a model we don't
want something too complicated okay and
okay that's good okay so eh eh now
notice when I press a and D selected and
then I right click it again I can't
change those settings again so you kind
of got to decide like oh this is what I
want so what you can do if your use of
something like 3d studio max is a hotkey
ctrl alt Q or its view toggle quad view
okay and this is actually pretty handy
because it just saves you time from
having to think around so I'll just drag
this guy over here
and him over here we can get them nice
and centered okay and obviously i don't
have the biggest screen here but we can
work with it if you have a bigger screen
that's great we could press the T button
the letter T there that's the toolbar
and if you forget the hotkey there's
these little plus arrows here that you
can drag out make them bigger and the
same should be oh no that's the the
other one that's the end key okay let's
not go into that so I'll press tab and
here's edit mode and here's the frontal
view okay and what you can do is
basically deselect everything with a and
let's select some faces okay it's this
little face button and if i were to
model a head of a person it would be
tricky doing it from something like this
but it's possible i would actually
suggest deleting half of it okay it is
how you would model a car as well so if
i press B this is like a free select and
I'll just go like this boom and you
notice how I didn't select those guys
back there like mmm what the heck now
down here there's this little crazy
button called limit selection too
visible it's clicked by default so I'm
going to unclick that okay and I'm going
to press B again and try to select ok
and notice how it selected the back I'm
just going to hit delete and what I want
to delete the vertices nope that did not
turn out how I wanted I have half of it
selected I want to delete the faces
there we go and then if I turn it around
it's like whoa we have half a circle and
to work with this we can add a modifier
called mirror
there it is mirror okay and if yours
doesn't appear correctly like mine is
you might want it it should be on the
x-axis you could always try a different
access and clicking these and if I look
at this guy let's go here and zoom in
let's just click render for fun so this
little camera boom and then render okay
such a low quality you won't be able to
notice but the point I was getting at is
when you add a modifier clipping is good
because it will close off the gaps it'll
make this seem like a and that's what
you want ok so we're editing half of a
face okay in this example and if this is
the front of his face the person her
head you just right click this oh we
want to turn this back off so that we
select only what we see boom now you can
just drag it down okay and then from
this view we can actually see the full
head now I don't have a reference image
to look at one thing you gotta remember
when you scroll in here make sure you
hold the shift button if you
accidentally just drag oh it's not let
me do it let me deselect it well that's
great didn't have that problem I guess
ok so with ahead let's just say let's
shape it out here's this I'll right
click right click and kind of move them
in to a more realistic head and the dome
maybe goes out a little more I'm not
sure
and i think the jaw would come out a
little bit more okay but it's his bottom
piece that's that's the problem so in
the front ortho I'll just scroll down
with shift and this time I'm going to
select the little edge select a press a
right click this and now from this view
i'll move him out like that and you see
how having multiple views is pretty
useful i personally like it rather than
always flipping views but if your
screens not that big mine isn't in this
case it's not the best so I wish this
would switch to the bottom view but i'm
not going to bother right now and i'll
go down here and what we have is a
there's a vertice in here where it joins
all together and i'm going to try to
create a neck so this is a little bit
tricky I'll select these well that goes
right under his jawbone let's try
something else I'll press a to deselect
i'm going to press ctrl r if i'll be
able to see this
oops the edge and control are okay there
we go so with that edge select on and
I'm just rotating here um I want to make
it so that his jaw doesn't get like all
interrupted so I'm going to press ctrl R
and it looks really weird from this
point and you just click and then it's
like where do you want to move it well I
don't want to move it in any of these
spots so I'm going to escape out
control-z really what I want is it to go
from here all the way up and around so I
suppose I could try again I think it's
because it's mirrored that it's not
going to obey us you see how that goes
all around that purple line that one
does too but i'm not sure why this wants
to be so troublesome all right that's
not what we want so I'll zoom in and
let's use the knife tool knife and I'm
just going to cut from here to there to
there enter okay and that should have
closed off the faces so now we have some
new faces here isn't that handy and now
i'm just going to say extrude which is
extra region look or the letter e and
we'll bring them down a little ways and
click then in this guy we could move
them more straight and i kind of want to
select these vertices so clicking the
vertex tool and i want to be able to
select the back ones too so I'm going to
turn this off and I'll press a and then
i'm going to press the letter B as a
bumblebee
to select these guys and stretch it out
let's get a good feel here okay all
right and a neck usually goes straight
down you know this isn't perfect it's
just for practice and I hope you can
follow along I know it's it's really
hard at first and I got so frustrated so
many times but it can turn out to be a
lot of fun and feel somewhat rewarding
I'm just looking for why this vertex
looks like it's going inward all right
we're not making a perfect thing here ok
so the tonometry or whatever you call it
on a faith obviously isn't supposed to
be squared supposed to be round around
let the muscle groups and stuff again
this is just for practice you guys so
the pros please don't hate on me I don't
claim to be a blend of pearl so like
these vertices here I'm just going to
select them with shift and pull back
because it'll give them a little more
jawline maybe go up a little bit so he
doesn't look like he's enjoys the cake
too much ok and it looks like a pretty
decent dome if you wanted to add like
saying nose we could also deselect and
let's attempt to use the knife tool so
if this was his eyebrow Ridge in his
eyes were here his nose would probably
start about here and there and I'll just
press enter and then let's press knife
again and will end his nose like right
before his jaw alright and enter and
we'll press a to deselect so um with the
knife tool of the skull we're going to
make it kind of small like this I should
really be using the free
position here ok always press enter
alright so what I want to do is extrude
out that by the face so the little face
tool down here all right click these to
and from this side view I'm holding
shift and middle mouse I'm going to say
extrude okay and he has a very big nose
obviously it doesn't look how we want so
we're going to go to the little vertice
guy here and click and drag them in a
little bit get a little more control
over these guys and track them in ok and
over here let's do B as in bumble bee
and select him and drag him back and be
and drag him oh forgot to deselect ok
let's do it again be and drag him back
and that's a pretty big nose it looks
like my nose maybe a bee select up to
the side ok and why does this no still
look kind of funny it looks kind of wide
all right a click smaller it's because
he's duplicated on both sides so ok and
that's a good start but you can see by
using the knife tool it's a kind of cool
off press tab and this is what our silly
little face looks like it's not going to
be perfect it's good practice let's go
ahead and go to the view undo the quad
view ok and if we just want to render
this and see what it looks like at
we could just turn on the render guy
here looks absolutely funny let's bow
the light so let's go back to the solid
view and what's interesting is we're on
blender render but there's a couple
other renders I don't know what game
does but Cycles render is interesting
because it allows you to use objects for
light sources so if you turn cycles
renders on now let's add a new object
notice where an object mode let's go to
add mesh and wears a plane a plane is a
pretty good lighting source so um what
we have is the camera pointing towards
this dude's face or female and we'll
just drag them out drag them up rotate
and I'm just going to press our and what
do I want this on the z-axis nope our X
I think that's what i want i want to
show light coming at his face so I'm
just trying to make it bigger I'm going
to press the letter S and let's say 50
that's going to be bright and maybe move
it back a little bit okay and what we
want to do with this is assign a light
source so under materials we're going to
click new and then we want this surface
type here to be any mission okay and the
color is white and it might help to
preview the rendered mode and you see
how the emission lights up his face if
we change this to let's say 10
he gets really bright let's try like 2.5
up to you we're just kind of playing
around right now and okay so he looks
like a really hard surface guy kind of
cool I'm going to go ahead and save this
first file save as and I'm going to call
this a standard face save as and what I
want to do just to make it interesting
is add a modifier to him a little wrench
and we want to do a subdivision surface
and this will I smooth them out so let's
click to three no no that's not giving
the effect i want let me close that
let's do something let's click smooth
it's not really affecting them how i
want i don't think i have enough
vertices and all that crap edge split
mirror maze multi stream
this usually let me go to the solid view
I don't even have him selected man
that's the problem i didn't haven't
selected alright so i could say
subdivision surface okay and you'll see
it changes a lot and i'll try and put
this 22 ok and he's getting around
little face the higher you go the
smaller is going to look so with that
you can see some deformities kind of in
his cheeks and stuff because we're using
such a few vertices so i've hit tab and
i were to right click this guy maybe
drag them back you can see you know hey
what's going on again the topology
whatever you want to call it it's
supposed to be circular but let's not
let's not flip a web a wig so with the
edge tool here selected i'm just going
to hang out over here and press ctrl r
oops control our and i wanted to that's
not what i wanted to escape alright
control our mmm he's not cooperating but
you see when you add a cut like this you
can smooth stuff out because it has more
points to render it looks like there's
something wrong right here let me add a
nice cut so here to here enter okay you
see that'll kind of chisel out some of
this stuff only person a control our and
oh that looks bad let's see what it
looks like from the side and the top and
maybe move them out a little bit who
that looks really bad i'm going to undo
that okay so we're beating a dead horse
and we're taking a lot of time i just
want to give you an idea let's just add
a surface of this dude's head so i'll
hit tab
and one thing to know is you can only
permanently apply a modifier when you're
in object mode so you see these objects
are here if I try to click apply it says
you can't do that in edit mode so you'd
have to hit tab 10 go and apply and now
if I hit tab again it's all one surface
but I wouldn't do that so I'll just ctrl
Z that because I don't want to do that
and let's add a little surface to this
guy's face under this little sphere
looking thing and diffuses fine let's
make a male in just something kind of
silly okay and this isn't black and
white if you look down here that's the
actual color you're getting and we're
just going to leave it something simple
like that and we can preview it rendered
he looks really stupid I think I really
butchered the face with the smoothing
but I let's go to the camera view and
finish this up so you see how we reset
our factory defaults we don't have that
little guy there so we can just go back
to user preferences add-ons and I'll say
there it is 3d navigation boom I want it
okay save settings boom all right so
let's go to the view camera and a good
way to work with this or just press the
letter n to pull out this big little
thing and down if we shrink transform
shrink grease pencil and then there's
the view we can lock the camera to the
view and now we can nicely navigate to
where we want this silly looking ahead
and by no means is this anything perfect
it's kind of like a bush but okay and
you know there's deformities and stuff
I'm no professional um and we shall
go to the render and I'll just shrink
down the dimensions well if you wanted a
different format you could change this I
like PNG oh that's the output sorry you
want to go to sampling and the render
value this will make the render take
longer but it will make it more quality
so i'm going to set mine to 200 i'm
going to render it so depending on your
computer speed and all that it will
differ on the quality it looks like he
doesn't have enough a little enough
smoothness to make it look very amazing
but there's other ways to do it and i
just wanted to get this out the door so
that you can have something to play with
if you felt like it okay and you could
save this up at file save as i'll call
it whoops whoops escape escape know that
saves the blender file what is it f3
there we go face test so press f3 if
you're here and you want to save it I'm
going to press escape now boom okay and
okay so that's just kind of playing
around I hope it helps you really the
key things to remember are the object
mode in the edit mode this viewport is
just for previewing the view and toggle
quad view which I really like so change
the viewport frame stuff to a wireframe
I bet if I made the samples higher he
might look a little bit better but I'm
not proud of this image it looks really
stupid and then another thing to
remember is in edit mode tab these items
down here change k so notice how i have
a bunch of crap here and I press tab
there and now I have these three boxes
than this little thing that I haven't
even talked about then this thing which
was there before where that other button
go me boy that would be a hard face to
edit look at you see how many crazy
lines there are I'd be a very difficult
face to edit that's why you want to be
slow with the process where that other
button go it remember the one with the
vertexes and selecting the back so press
be okay that selecting faces oh no that
