tutorial we're going to cover abstract
classes an abstract class is much like a
class and the difference is you had the
word abstract before it an abstract
class cannot be constructed so you
cannot do this okay you'll see can I
instantiate abstract class and it's kind
of like well what's the reason well it's
kind of like a template where you can
tell the children classes what they must
enforce so you'd say abstract public
function attack
I'm just remaking a couple classes here
I'm going to remake one more and just
call this class human extends character
and I'll save this as a human dot class
dot PHP now let's just require that once
again and reopen that to fix the colors
so when we tell the abstract class and
we say has a abstract function it means
that everything every child that extends
it must have that function so we'd say
public function attack and just say echo
one now let's see that let's do user
equals new human and let's do a user
attack and refresh and we get one so if
we had like a dog a pig in a horse
different classes you know of four
characters they would all have to have
attack inside of it and probably you'd
want to do abstract a public function
defend and
sleep you know you do something like
that and then you can have regular
functions like public function set up
and for the set up we could say a B and
we'll say this attack equals a and this
defend equals B hmm
let's typecast these so they're integers
and then we'll say put I'll just do
public for now public attack and public
defend so we can use setup we could even
use it inside here and we could say this
set up five hundred three hundred to set
some variables there or let me refresh
but to have straight lines to close oh
whoops I am missing these methods so you
see that it's great mmm kinda like a
template saying a if you're going to be
a character you need to have these as
well so I'll just add those in let's see
those defend and there was sleep so
refresh that good and let's see here the
set up you already talked about that and
you can also just use the set up from
the global or outside of the class
standpoint such as user setup and
missing an argument whoops will say one
two and good sorry I'm flying through
this really abstracts are good for like
a pretty much
this a template they're a little similar
to interfaces but interfaces are a
little different you cannot declare your
variables is abstract because whatever
extends it it's going to inherit this no
matter what so there you have it a human
character you can also force variables
to be in here so if we attack it has to
have a variable and if you don't do that
it's saying hey it doesn't match up with
this so put an A in there and I think
it'll mess up still okay it's missing an
argument attack one so this is very good
for keeping a set of characters in line
with what you want all the characters to
have hopefully that makes sense and good
luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
