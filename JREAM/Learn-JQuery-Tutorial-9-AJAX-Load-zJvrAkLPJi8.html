this tutorial we're going to do an AJAX
load and this is pretty cool I'm gonna
show you the page fragment part also so
try to pay attention to load we just use
the load function and we specify where
we want to load we could just do it in
the body just for this tutorial I'll
just make a div ID of content and we'll
just load it in content cuz you know for
the most part I don't think we'll ever
just load the entire body unless it's
like a hundred percent Ajax application
and then lo what are we gonna load let's
create a new file and I'll just say junk
and I'll save it as junk dot PHP okay
and what am I going long I'm gonna load
junk that PHP and if we want to see a
callback or something we can type a
function alert let me put this on other
lines so it's not so confusing to read
function alert 1 and if it loads we get
the alert they're good and then BOOM so
it looks like that happens before it
loads anyways we're not going to do that
so that loads just say junk dot PHP you
know you could put anything in here like
actual PHP code and HTML code let's just
make a test div and how about a another
div and this is just to show you the
fragments of loading so we're just gonna
load junk type PHP and we have this okay
now if we only want to load a certain
part of it let's just load other how
about okay you were just after this you
just do the pound sign for
I D other and refresh and that's what
you get it looks like it even skips the
actual PHP here it only loads this
little block so that could be really
useful for tabbing through information
and making this a dynamic selector but
that's a whole nother task in itself
there's another load or it's not really
load it's called get and we can do get
junk dot PHP and refresh and it did not
work and that is because this is actual
Ajax thing so that's system-wide you
don't use a call in there we do dollar
dot get and the page and then we set the
parameters within here usually within a
function and now we put the results
let's say back into content dot HTML and
the data basically this is saying get
junk dot PHP okay and it's getting all
of this and then it's it's not doing
anything yet but it returns it and we
want it to return it in this variable
and let's call it content and then
inside of context I'm gonna call this
just data so it's not so confusing so
data is the content inside this file
here and we're going to put the the data
inside the HTML of the content div okay
now this might look confusing and it
might look like well why would you ever
do this and not just use load well let
me refresh okay it loads a good reason
to use get might be if you need to pass
in certain parameters and let's say in
the PHP code up here if is request age
so if the age is requested you know
something could actually happen I'll
just say echo
age was requested okay let me get rid of
that and so you know if you refresh this
it's not going to show that but you can
actually put this in the URL and type
whoops age and refresh it and you can
send requests through get or you could
actually use get itself and refresh so
the two are different and you know you
using a load is fine there's also a load
if modified but I'm not gonna get into
too many details here I think that's
pretty good for now
just don't brush this one off this is
actually really useful just because it's
bigger and more confusing try to get a
hang of it let's just for fun real quick
I'll just make a button input type
equals submit and let's just give it an
ID real quick ID equals test and let's
say when test dot click function okay
and then we'll pop this in here so this
doesn't have to just be a global thing
that happens you can't have it so when
you click it it loads it and hopefully
that'll turn some wheels and get you
thinking thanks for watching the
