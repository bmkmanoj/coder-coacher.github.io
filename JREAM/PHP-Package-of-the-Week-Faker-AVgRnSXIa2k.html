time in PHP hit up packages org and it's
gonna be faker right here boom and I'm
gonna pick version 1 400 copy him and I
got just a empty folder which runs PHP
files and inside my composer Jason I'll
just write require another set of French
braces and boom paste that in that's
what it looks like okay my index has
nothing but there's my required so let's
open up a terminal and go to wherever
and composer update and that's going to
create our vendor folder so I already
know it's gonna do so I'm just gonna
start with PHP tags and require vendor
auto load dot PHP LS so inside this
vendor folder so CD vendor LS okay let's
look at the docs boom source
there it is faker factory create so
faker equals faker factory great awesome
let's make a loop for I equals 0 I is
less than 100 I plus plus echo faker
name echo faker address let's echo a br
in here boom boom and let's echo a HR
okay and this has a magic get method so
every time you get a name it'll create a
new name now I'm at the page here let me
hide my bookmarks and refresh look at
this if you need to populate your
database with a bunch of random data
that is so awesome
and they have
texts we can populate boom-boom-boom
refresh and we have a bunch of text
there so what else can we do besides
that we have four matters we have lorem
ipsum x' we have persons let's do a
person so I'll say person equals new
faker provider en-us person and let me
stretch this little or shrink this okay
inside here we put a faker okay so in
here I'll get rid of fake our name okay
so we can say person and here that we
can do a name and I'll do a male name
male do I get that right we could also
do a first name too so I'll go ahead and
refresh and we have all male names here
it's so random and cool so we just use
these subclasses by constructing
something and then passing in our
original faker object so I could copy
this guy boom there we go what else I
got phone numbers cool company Wow this
has everything man date times Internet
we can make emails and passwords IP
addresses user agents payments fake
credit cards I mean this has everything
you need this is like the most
legitimate library I've seen in a while
so there you have it faker have fun guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
