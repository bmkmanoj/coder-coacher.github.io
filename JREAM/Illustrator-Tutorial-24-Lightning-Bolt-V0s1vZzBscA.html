dream.com in the store we're going to
make a lightning bolt so press the
letter D to get your colors down here
default and I'm going to swap these
around and get rid of the stroke because
we're going to use some 3d first thing
is to make a square and I'm going to
actually make these green just so that
the 3d shows shading if it's black you
won't see shading and just hold alt and
drag this down and you can press the
minus key to get to the eraser point and
we're just going to erase that and press
V to get to the pointer and then just
drag this up there it's not going to
look exactly like this so don't worry
too much about this shape right now
because we're going to do a perspective
in 3d and that's going to shrink the top
piece a lot so join these together and
then go to effect 3d extrude and bevel
and click the preview button and the way
I wanted to do it was like this because
the tops really fat and the more you
move it up there we go
and yeah that looks pretty good
who's going to click OK and object
expand appearance and then ctrl shift G
which is ungroup right here
I'm gonna press that about three times
just to make sure I'm not grouped up
with those and I'll just select these
and make it all the default or just look
in color actually like that orange
better and let's make a little gradient
to make it pretty pop this gradient on
here and for this color let's just
reduce the K if you're in RGB mode which
you should be I don't know why I'm in
this just double click
oops double-click this thingy here and I
guess just drag down the red compliant
new bolts are kind of reddish well I'm
not going to be too picky about that and
I'll just like these to click I boom and
for this I'm going to do a radial and
then select this radial gradient with G
and my lights going to be coming from
the top so the brightest point should be
at the top left that's still not very
bright though I'm going to adjust this a
second and see if I can make it a little
lighter
ooh that's ugly I guess more yellow and
how about some orange yeah that looks
more like a lightning bolt okay um and I
personally don't like the 3d effect it's
giving on some of this like this corner
here I'm going to move this over and
down here I kind of want this to be
straight up and down and up at the top
here I'm just going to draw a little
edge piece and let's just say and I'm
not exactly sure how perfect the
perspective will be I want to stretch
that out a little bit just because it's
a fat lightning bolt and this point
right here yes straight that download
for this I'm going to make the gradient
go little more up and down okay so we
have a pretty decent looking lightning
bolt um one thing we could do is
actually move this portion over a little
bit so it looks more lightening like
okay yeah that looks pretty cool next we
can add
some white for some shininess so let's
make a circle white and let's see some
transparency how about and whoops
overlay no soft light yes okay so we've
got some lightning bolts yeah it was
kind of silly all right sorry I lost
focus I got a cat bugging me okay so we
got two circles here it looks kind of
silly to me really silly so I'm just
gonna make some custom highlights so
I'll just go boom boom boom okay and
boom boom okay and then down here I'll
do one boom boom and boom okay and I
guess I'll do a little piece right here
since that's kind of a bright point and
you know nothing perfect but never
really is you can just say overlay
overlay and it looks kind of you know
roughed in maybe drop some of the
transparency on these okay I probably
also add a little more custom shading on
these edge pieces too but I think this
will be good for now and what I always
like to do if you've watched any other
tutorials is
merge all these together and we got a
solid object and I like to add a little
stroke to it so let's just make it uh I
think I'll go with a grayish color a
little darker is that changing let me
get rid of that um this gray let's see
transparency that's the problem normal
back up and then just drag this over to
the object send it to the back and there
we have a lightning bolt alright thanks
for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
