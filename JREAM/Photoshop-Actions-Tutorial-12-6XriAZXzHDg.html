today we're going to learn about actions
and these are pretty cool open up your
panel by going to windows and actions
and you'll have some default actions
here you could click one and press the
play button and it'll add a little
something i'm going to undo this though
I'll just close it actually and let me
reopen that picture ok so in action is
something you can record yourself I'm
just going to create a new folder and
call up my actions next we can create a
new action and what do we want to do
what if we wanted to let's say watermark
okay and you wanted to watermark all
your images so this little red button
means record so whatever you do now it's
going to be recorded okay and let me
flip this over to white and i'll just
say copyright got to make that a little
bit bigger 2009 okay and i will move
this down here um maybe up a little bit
and let's just draw a another layer it
also remembers your layers and that's
really cool and i'll just make a little
box here and i'll make it transparent
okay now i'm going to hit stop and we
have a thing called watermark so now go
to your other image and just press play
ctrl tab to go to the other control tab
to go to the other and it remembers your
layers on the side like i mentioned and
this is really cool especially if you're
picky about how you name them and if you
put them in folders and this will save
you a lot of time flipping through stuff
and what if we wanted to make something
that applied to every image again like
maybe an effect we could call this
effect and it's recording right now so
i'm going to select
my background layer and it tells us that
it did that and let's just go to filter
pixelate and crystallize i'll just use
something like this for an example okay
and that I'm just going to press stop
and I'll hold ctrl and press tab and
press play I guess let's see okay you
have to it applies it to the lair I
guess selecting the background layer
doesn't seem to work play and play and
that's a pretty cool little thing now
you can also do image resizing in here
you could make a new one call it image
resizer however there's a better way to
do that and that is in file um automate
and do batch k batch and oops this is a
net file on scripts sorry file scripts
image processor okay and what you can do
is you can go invert them all to jpg
reduce the size let's say I want to do
200 x 200 most of time for the web you
want jpg of course unless is transparent
now you can select a folder if you want
and for example i have this folder right
here i'm just going to use the images
that are open and i'm just going to hit
run and it's going to go through all
these automatically for me so what's
happened i go back to my test folder I
have these images right they're really
big because I was zoomed out but if i go
to my jpeg folder look at that it
automatically does everything for me so
that's pretty cool how these are a
couple little tools that will be some
good and your tool belts so good luck
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
