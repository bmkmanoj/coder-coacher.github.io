make a sword in Adobe Illustrator so I'm
gonna make a new document and I'm gonna
have a horizontal orientation and the
color mode will be RGB just toggle your
advanced if you need to and I'm gonna
press control 1 to get to a hundred
percent and this is gonna look kind of
like a kid sword I'm gonna start with a
square now what the square is going to
be is the tip of the blade what we're
gonna do is grab the pen - tool and
we're going to click the corner okay the
next part will be the long portion of
the blade and I want this to be the same
width is the top and I'll make it about
that long okay and I'm going to move
this blade in a little bit there we go
and this is going to be the half of the
sword and we're going to duplicate it so
let me make this a little thinner
because it's going to be kind of fat
otherwise and for the handle we'll
probably make this look a little nicer
in a minute
has drawn some little squares and I'm
going to hold alt and scroll out okay
and now I'm just going to select this
whole thing and go to the reflect tool
I'm going to zoom back in so that I can
make sure I'm clicking right on this
path click and then you're gonna hold
the Alt key so you see the double arrows
and go ahead and flip it around and then
hit shift key to make it straight up and
down boom and if we zoom out we can see
well that's kind of a fat sword and I
think it needs to be thinner so I'm
going to ctrl Z to undo that and by the
way I noticed that these lines aren't
perfectly lined up
so let me remake this shape from here to
here and I'll just redo that easy-peasy
okay and let's zoom back out again if
you need to resize that I'm just gonna
use the white arrow tool and select this
part and just press the left arrow key a
couple of times that should do us
justice and same thing as we did before
select the mirror tool click the path
and shift rotate not too bad
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make
a this kind of shaded in an either way
I'm going to attempt to anyways I might
do a gradient mesh actually just to try
something different
mmm I don't know yet maybe a great it
won't just be good anyways first thing
I'm going to do is give these pieces
some color so let's go to swatches and
let's open a swatch library you probably
can't see it on my screen well I opened
up with a metal one and what's a good
color for a sword let's just do the kind
of a silver color and for the other side
and the handle I'd like a nice little
brown color I think this piece is
actually usually a metal color there and
down here I should warn you I'm pretty
bad with color so have mercy on me let's
get rid of the stroke on this as well
look over here and this little slash
looks good for the handle whoops okay so
far it's not looking terrible so for the
gradient I think I'm just going to go
with the gradient because it'll be a
little easier and I'll pop this color
here and pop this blueish color here
that's a little too blue for my liking
just pick out whatever your taste is
okay okay I like that and what you can
do is just you reuse the same gradient
for every one of these pieces so I'll
select these and then press I to get
this eyedropper and click now I have a
gradient on all these now what we do is
we just change the gradient around and I
want it to get lighter on the edges
okay and on this side I want it to flip
around
that's not turning out exactly how I
want there we go so it's kind of
opposite and really if you just play
around with this little tool you
sometimes you get lucky with a gradient
that looks halfway decent I guess I'll
leave it at that that's not terrible and
for the handle we want those little
lines and strings across them there's a
number of ways we could do this mm I
suppose I'll just make a wrap around it
so first I'm going to select these two
items Pathfinder and we're gonna union
or unite whatever it's called now we're
going to draw inside okay
and we'll get this little box all right
let's just make a square here and change
the color and we're going to go to
effect warp and arc let's preview what
we have okay I'm gonna do a negative
number so it kind of bends downward
that's not bending at the bottom as much
as I'd like it to I guess I'll just do
it this way and have it go upwards so
let's go to object expand appearance and
then I guess we got to flip it around
cool and here's a little trick with
transparency that looks good let me
double click this and I'm going to
select a dark color and under
transparency I'm just gonna make it mm
let's say 80% and when we alt drag this
we get kind of some layers well I guess
I have to do it further down
hmm that's not turning out exactly how I
had hoped so I guess I'll just try it
there okay there and you see these
little stripes on there I want them to
be closer together so what I'm gonna do
is actually shrink this and move it up
and I guess it looks like we'll just get
one more little line on here just get
too used to alt dragging okay that
doesn't look too bad so with this side
let's well okay what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to group these together first or
union them with the Pathfinder and then
I'm gonna do a warp make it a little
cooler looking and should I select that
okay make sure you select it arc review
and it's I kind of like it going that
way it's a little different okay that'll
be cool okay and object expand
appearance boom okay
and with this bottom piece I'm just
gonna do the same thing group them
together effect warp arc and I want this
to go in the other direction so I'm just
going to do negative 32 there we go and
object expand appearance slide that
beauty up so it overlaps and this little
handle piece has to be longer obviously
well how am I gonna select this
okay good enough I guess I'll just
stretch it and let's send it to back if
you don't know the hotkey I'll just go
to right-click and do select mm-hm
or sorry arrange send to back okay so
here's what we have so far I think it
looks kind of cool I'm also going to add
a little circle at the bottom for the I
guess give it a little cooler look and
that's not centered so if you want you
can just draw the circle according to
this line and hold Alt alt will create
it from the center and there's our ball
and I'm just going to move this down
here arrange send to back
mmm okay a little ball on the bottom
adds a little oomph and for this I'm
just gonna copy this gradient and see if
I can work with it I press the I button
to first I select this and I press the
letter I and grab that so in the
gradient I kind of want this darker not
terribly darker okay and for this I'm
gonna actually double click this color
and go to this little palette and I'm
going to change these values about minus
10 so 150 to let's say 140 to 138 142
yeah it didn't make much of a difference
so don't bother if you don't need to and
maybe a radial gradient will look a
little better on this
and I it's it's really up to you to get
the colors pretty decent and all that
jazz and what I'm gonna do to add some
spice to it I'm going to alt drag this
okay so we have a duplicate here and I'm
going to do that once more but I'm going
to drag it right on top of it I'll move
this up I'm trying to keep it right
above it so it's easy to drag back on
top of and I'm gonna alt drag this once
more with shift so it's straight down
and I'm actually going to move it to the
left and up a little and this will make
sense right after I subtract it so I'm
going to select both of these and
subtract the front okay and I want to
make this the color white white okay and
just drag that back onto here and it's a
little too bright so let's add some
transparency okay
and you know it looks kind of silly but
whatever let's draw a little line here
we're kind of doing the same principle
okay and close it in a little bit there
however you like doing it I guess hey
whatever works best for you that looks
decent
and I guess we could do it along this
one
okay and for the blade no there's a lot
of options with this I guess I'll use
the pen tool also on this top piece and
boy that clicks annoying I don't know if
you can hear it I'll just draw a line
inside here to here boom and kind of to
give it a little style we'll put the
other glow line whatever you call it the
light part of it on the other side okay
so these colors aren't you know the most
impressive thing in the world will make
this a gradient gradient and let's make
it like a sphere so talents like a
crystal or something and I want to flip
these around boom and to make it a
little more cool how about a little
shiny part and this should be white
early or just a light color mm-hmm and
I'm gonna use my control bracket key
let me type that up for you it's ctrl
and that hold ctrl and press that key
and you can keep moving it behind layers
there we go
and let's give this some transparency
you can clearly see that just by
continually adding detail you just make
something look really sharp and it's
hard to do right on the spot in a video
tutorial and that's why I expect a great
deal of mercy from you youtubers okay I
think that'll be good for now
what I'm gonna do is put this on my site
if you'd like to download it and do
whatever you want I'm gonna resize my
artboard I never published this part but
what I do is I resize it and then I do
file save as and
Desktop Oh all right guys thanks for
