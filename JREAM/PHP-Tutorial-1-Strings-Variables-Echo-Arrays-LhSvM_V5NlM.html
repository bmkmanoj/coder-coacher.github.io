ENCOM this is a tutorial about the
basics of PHP PHP is a loosely typed
language and I'm going to assume you
already have your server installed so
that you can load PHP on your hard drive
if you don't you probably want to look
on google for something called lamp
if you're on Windows ma'am they've drawn
Macintosh or lamp if you're on Linux and
that'll help you get started the first
thing you want to do is go into your
working server directory and just create
an index file and that's where I'm here
every page starts with PHP with a little
question mark and to end it you just do
that most of the time I don't end it to
create let's just say to echo something
echo hello my name is Jesse okay I'm
using single quotes here and I'll
explain the difference between single
and double quotes in a minute so if we
load this hello my name is Jesse okay if
you use double quotes it'll still print
the same thing but let's say we want to
make a variable and all variables start
with a dollar sign and then let's just
call it name and name equals Jesse okay
now if I want to put this variable
inside of this string right here I can
type name and here's where you'll see
the problem with the single quotes see
it prints it literally but if you use
the double quotes it will actually parse
the value okay hello my name is Jesse so
most of the time you want to use single
quotes unless you're
wanting to parse a value another
alternative you could do is let's
pretend these are back to single quotes
it's called concoct concoction ation I
don't know how to say it
well you just add a period it's kind of
like adding to a string hello my name is
Jesse C we forgot a space after the
string here is that a space there there
it is and if you want to add on a little
bit more you just add another period and
I like pizza okay so working with
variables it's a pretty basic you never
want to start one with a number this is
illegal you can start them with
underscores you can't start them with
dashes so just try to keep it usually
either with an underscore or a letter to
start it with if you want to do a digit
you don't have to put the quotes around
it and this is a literal integer so age
is 34 I'm actually 25 and I am dollar
age years old hello my name is Jesse and
I like pizza and I'm 25 years old sound
like a real cool guy huh other things
you can do I'm guessing you're gonna
pick up all this variable stuff pretty
quick let's say we want name two to
equal name
you just type name two equals name I'm
going to erase all this so echo name two
and if you guessed right name two is
going to help put Jesse okay
now if we want a three variables to
equal that you can just do the same
thing name three equals that and you
could do echo name three easy peasy
there's also reference variables these
might be a little more confusing and
something you really don't need to worry
about off the bat but they're within a
and sign
so anyways there's a lot of variable
manipulation you can do it's not too
hard to pick up one of the things you'll
be working with a ton in PHP is called
arrays and to make an array you just
type in array like that usually we want
to give an array of variable so let's
just call it a names equals array okay
now arrays are going to take quite a bit
of practice to get used to but they're
one of the most useful things you can
understand and I'm just going to start
out with a simple array and these are
gonna be some names Jessie comma Joey
Jenny and Justine okay now if you want
to echo out names you're going to see it
says array an array has a key and a
value so even though this looks like
this is all it is really there's a
hidden key right here so this would
start at 0 1 2 and so on
so if I wanted to echo names in the very
first slot which is Jessie you use these
square brackets and you type 0 because
names arrays they always start with 0
and refresh when you get Jessie so it
might look confusing that justine looks
like it's slot number 4 but that would
actually be number 3 because you go 0 1
2 3 and there's just in you can also do
what are called associative arrays okay
and those are arrays identified by a
string like this because normally it
looks like this like I just showed you
now you can't have the same keys so
you're gonna have to count these if you
type them in manually same result
associative arrays they have a for this
slot here it's a string so let's call
this oldest boy or a youngest boy this
one's oldest boy this one's oldest girl
and youngest girl okay now if you echo
names 3 since this is an associative
array you're not going to get anything
so you would actually have to do names
youngest girl and that will give us
Justine okay you might say well why
would I want to use an array oh when
you're dealing with like a lot of data
and you can also sort arrays and they're
like little pockets to store chunks of
data and very useful probably one of the
more important things you need to learn
is to use arrays
if I put this back just to how it was
okay and let's just echo names too
and that should give us Jenny okay now
you can do things like sort names and
that'll give us Joey why because it
sorted it alphabetically and as you can
see Jenny was slot - did you see zero
one - since it's sorted alphabetically
Joey - oh comes after Jenny so it really
moved it to here okay there's a lot of
sorting things you can use like case or
and everything but before this tutorial
is over let's do something kind of fun
so that it feels like you're not just
learning about nothing let's make a form
so we end our PHP tags type form action
equals index dot PHP that's the name of
this page and method equals post and
your form tags and let's make input type
equals text name equals let's just call
it name and type name before that and
then let's make a submit button input
type equals submit value equals print
name okay
so we have a little form here you click
this it just refreshes the page right
now let's have it do a post request
so we'll say post and what do we want to
post we want to post whatever is in this
text field and we'll grab that by the
name right here and we call the name
coincidentally so post name okay that's
how we post data from a form and we can
just do echo post name test and there it
is it's printed right at the top easy
peasy
now if you go back to your page just
index dot PHP see there's a problem
because it's trying to post this right
when you load the page so a good way
around that is to change the URL right
here just add a little query string by
doing that you add a question mark and
let's just type in check okay and we do
if I didn't go over if statements but
just type along for now I guess if is
set and this is a request not a post
request check then we will echo the post
name so we refresh this you see you get
no error any more tests and there it is
and you'll see the URL changes with a
question mark check and this is fetched
with a get or request I usually use
request and I suppose that's good for
the first video
