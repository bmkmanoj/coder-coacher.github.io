Linux series and once again I'm just
going to login and what we're going to
do is disable the root login so that we
can have a user logon and that will
enhance security so let's say people are
trying to act your web server and you
have the login left at root their they
have fifty percent of the equation they
need in order to hack you with a lot of
bulk attacks you'll notice i'll try me
loggins like admin administrator system
so don't use names like that just use
kind of a general name so what I'm going
to do is do add user and then you type
the username so i'll just make mine
called Ted so we created a username 10
and there's a lot of options we can do
with this if I go down to my home
directory there it is CD home I created
to other users just playing around we
can create a user not give them a home
directory but I prefer to do it this is
where all the users appear in the home
directory their folders if you will and
the route you know he's a special user
so he's in the very bottom of the whole
system so just remember the root guys
right there and all your other users are
in the home directory so we have our
user we need to give them a password and
we've done the password command before
this time we just type in the username
and I'll just make this password Ted Ted
and obviously that's a bad password but
this is only for demonstration so I
don't forget it and you see I have a
user called Jesse too I want to use her
delete of Jesse too but before that I
want to do
dash are so that it deletes everything
even its home folder okay okay so first
before we do anything we want to make
sure we can log in as Ted you know open
a new window I'll say Ted Ted and here
is and if i do PWD i'm at home / ted
that's where its default places and i
went down to the very lowest level and i
try to get into the root folder it won't
let me good so now all we have to do is
disable the root login and to do that we
have to edit a file on inside the et Cie
folder so I'm just going to go to CD ptc
and it's called ssh because what we're
in is ssh and i'll say see SSH now i'm
typing this out so that you can see it
as i do it and the file i want to edit
is called sshd config so i'll say nano
sshd underscore config and we got a big
intimidating file and usually got to
look up stuff like on Google to see what
you're looking for but in this case I
already know what we're looking for and
to get to the right line mm-hmm I can do
ctrl w to find where something is and
what am i looking for root logon there
it is permit root login so the first
thing we want to do is take her away the
pound sign because that's a comment and
by default they aren't allowed to login
and change that to know okay and control
x yes enter and it won't work just yet
because we have to reload services and
there's a folder called an it d right
here and inside of here are a bunch of
commands that run processes and you're
going to be using the init d folder all
the time and colin commands from here so
most the time you're not going to be
actually inside the init d folder but to
run a command here's how you do it since
I have my file right here sshd I would
do that / which means the current
director and I'll do SSH d reload and
that reloads it now what if I did sshd
reload you see sshd without the dot
slash this looks like Linux thinks it's
a command kind of like if i did find and
that's not a command so I need dot slash
sshd so let me go to my root directory
and show you how you usually will do
this you'll usually type this / ET c and
it d HD reload okay so you got to get
used to typing ET c and it dot d like
that and then whatever command you have
you might have like my sequel restart
and all that so that's reloaded and what
we're going to try to do is login as
root so once again on my testing server
I'll say root and log in
and access denied beautiful so he can't
log in and we'll go back on Ted Ted Ted
and he's in now if I need to get to my
root user I just type su which stands
for super user and i typed in his
password and look I can get in his room
and I'm logged in as root as Ted but
that's pretty cool so there's a basic
start on that and I think this will sum
up this tutorial you learned how to add
and delete a user login as the user and
also disable your route credentials root
ssh logon so that's a lot for watching
us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
