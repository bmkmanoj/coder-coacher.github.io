things rapidly in Photoshop CC this
doesn't apply to cs6 unfortunately first
of all this I info this is like one of
the most important things to me I prefer
to have it up in its own swatch and then
the panel options and I always prefer to
be pixels now your color options are
totally up to you so that I know exactly
the pixel size I'm selecting with that
we have our layers I'm just going to get
rid of these two they're in the way and
our layers this is where the magic
happens so first we go to file generate
image assets okay now I'm gonna open up
Windows Explorer Mac would open finder
and I'm gonna go to downloads so here
let me delete this I was trying to make
a hackintosh yes I can believe that
so here is my PSD location and what this
does it'll create files in that folder
okay so let's just go ahead and look at
this and I'm going to ctrl click I
really hate the ctrl click on this it
never works how I want so here's the
header okay and keep in mind this
background is not part of this folder so
if I just called this header dot PNG
what we have happen is it creates this
folder and we have the exact size of the
header PNG no need for slices now it
might be a little zoomed in based on the
window size here but so we have that if
I were to go down to let's just say this
guy here I believe he's picked to one of
the problems we'll have is that there is
no black background and if we did this
as a JPEG it would come out wrong
with a white background so here's
another way you can right-click and do
quick export as PNG I'll go ahead and do
that
and it's not as quick but you see we can
select that folder or just export it
here I'll just save it as pick two and
so that I can show you it you can see
that this is a PNG so it is correct but
if we were to do this and one more way
is to export as
right and right now it's a PNG if I want
a JPEG you see we get this white
backdrop so I don't know the way around
this besides copying a layer so if I alt
drag this behind here let me make sure
so obviously it's covering that up but
we don't care about that right now it's
gonna make a huge image if I do export
as
so it takes that whole image so you know
one thing you could do this has a glow
effect which is unfortunate and I don't
remember the hotkeys don't work like
they used to where I can't click a
folder and it selects everything so I'm
just gonna kind of rough it in I'm just
gonna draw a box here of about the size
I want and now I have the wrong one
selected so a little box here and go to
the big layer copy this black box and
select inverse selection okay
then delete so whoops what that did was
if I were to change the hue saturation
just change the lightness you see we
just inverted it to do that so now if I
were to right click export as this you
know it would be a valid you know not
perfectly sized one other thing you can
do with this is actually make them 2x
the size and everything another good
thing about this is you could actually
just select all 3 of these and do export
as
and if you're doing PNG it'll be great
but you can just do them all at once
like that if you don't want to look he's
got the background if you don't want to
rename the layers
I think renaming the layers is extremely
cool so I'll call this girl one dot PNG
I'll hide this whoops that and I'll call
this guy one dot PNG and if I go back to
these files notice how I hid the layer
and it does it correctly with the
transparency so it only does what's
visible and you can go so far as like if
you only want the logo let's see the
header we're almost done okay and where
is it a vector shape here so here's the
smart object the old way I'm so old
school I used to make a new layer
selected to control e control a copy
control and and CC is pretty slow make a
new one transparent ctrl alt shift s say
for web right that's crazy
so I can just do logo dot PNG and there
it is right there
so hope that's a helpful tip to speed up
