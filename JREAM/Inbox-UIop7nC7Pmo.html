from this little jump toshiba satellite
you 840 w it's very wide and it was on a
huge discount because they marked it
wrong they thought it was an open box so
instead of nine hundred dollars it was
550 got a killer savings on it so why
don't I open it up it has the
manufacturer seals right here it's very
exciting what I'm gonna do is gently
glaze it
I've been waiting about what do you say
two months or three months to get a
laptop okay one that I could find in a
deal we went to Best Buy four times over
the holiday weekend to look for deals
and actually put this back behind the
shelves because they marked it wrong
open this up what we have
Microsoft Office 2010 a Quick Start
Guide pamphlet and Norton AntiVirus
here's the main piece take off the
plastic it's all nicely put in there so
I can pop it up like so we'll look at
that in just a moment and here it looks
like I have my power supplies to power a
clean machine there simple packaging
that I can mix it back inside now
for the gem this is a very tall laptop
very long
take off this looks like a section on
the inside - like so
look at this channel
look at this channel
I suppose it needs to be plugged in well
I might have to check if the batteries
in there or I guess it has a built-in
battery with these ultrabooks it's
pretty thin it's super tall so if I
compare it to this I guess this is a
pretty old laptop but look at the screen
over squared on this one so that's a
square now this is an old Walmart laptop
this is more of the higher end laptops
as you can see so briefly let me up plug
it in and see if we can't get her
started take these out
really what I'm gonna use this computer
for its programming now you only forgot
the specs that say uh Intel Core i5 so I
don't know if you can see this ultrabook
Intel Core i5 comes with Windows 7 and
it has nice speakers along the sides the
keyboard I played with a lot of them and
Best Buy to make sure I like the type in
the touchpad is quite elegant it's one
of those big ones in there with me just
one moment folks
okay
and where does it power
here goes the first time ever we forgot
wide that screen is might need to be a
little adjusted it has a light-up
keyboard very fancy really third the
inventors of that so let's just think
configure the computer but it's a pretty
sweet device this is like a brushed
metal right here and this is like kind
of like I know what kind of holding this
is what has a nice grip to it
what a deal $350 safe because with my
wife Anna Sophia
so this enter and a couple things to get
her started and we all know Windows is
obviously the best operating system
Eastern Time now my problem another one
like I said it was my touchpad
we're gonna have to do some updates if
you want to and this will be it I think
that's a good summer is there anything
else I should show on mm-hmm you know
try to let me see the phone and get a
good view of it get it in the light a
moment so there's that brushed finish
with a nice grip there and it's pretty
nice-looking piece of machinery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
