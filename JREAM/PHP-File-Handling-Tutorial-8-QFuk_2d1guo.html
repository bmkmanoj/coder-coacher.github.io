I'll do a quick overview on working with
files and I suppose the first then we
learn is called F open which stands for
file open and we do a file name you can
make one up so i'll just call mine data
txt and the second parameter is the mode
there's quite a few modes are w/a x and
they all have plus options also ours for
reading w for writing a fur appending
and X I can't remember off the top of my
head for the most part i'm pretty sure
you'll be using boy hits I don't use
files too often these days our plus is
reading and writing w plus is reading
and writing but also it will create the
file if it doesn't exist a is append and
I can't remember what a pluses anyways
for this let's just do w plus so that we
can read and write the file and create
it if it doesn't exist so refresh your
page and then go to the directory and
you'll see there's data there okay now
we have this file that we want to work
with let's give this a handle there's
call a CH
I suppose what we want to do is write to
the file first since it's empty and
that's done with F right and what are we
writing to the H the handle and then the
text to insert and refresh the page and
open the file and there it is you can
also check if it worked fwrite will
return a boolean and you can do if f
write equals false echo error writing
but obviously we're not getting any
errors usually I don't have a problem
with this so I just leave it how it is
some data to the file real quick
manually I'm just going to change that
to read and write so we've got some
sample data and one thing that we don't
want to forget is to close the file so
we don't waste resources like that after
we're done using it so let's get the
file line by line let's do a while loop
and fe 0 f stands for file end of file i
believe and while we're not at the end
of the file what do we want to do we
want to F get handles and let go
there it is and it prints that out now
when you're working with files these new
lines in windows r / r i believe in
linux r /n one or the other so maybe you
want to do string replace flesh are with
BR and there you have that that's if
you're on Windows and your servers
probably on Linux so you're going to
want a better Stern replace than this
cuz you're gonna have to replace
probably both of them just to be safe
anyways that's how we get each file line
by line let's do a file append and I am
going to do let's see reverb and a plus
or append and right I think let's do F
right handle we want to do a new line so
do backslash are even more more more
stuff and I'll refresh and the data file
it added it in there I wonder why this
didn't horse oh you want to add double
quotes for it to parse this as a literal
entity that makes a new line okay so you
can do all that stuff
there's also a nice little feature
called file put contents and basically
what this does is it does F open f right
f close all in one so let's make a file
called demo and you can put any text
here refresh and then open up the demo
file it created and there it is there is
also if you want to do file get contents
and just the name of the file demo dot
txt and will echo that out and there it
is once again you'd have to string
replace of the new lines two line breaks
in HTML and I suppose that's good for
now I'm not going to put a lot of
emphasis on files at least for now I
think the most interest for people is
databases and I'm trying to move towards
that pretty quickly so if you find a
move along too fast post a comment and
maybe I could go over some other basics
if you need help all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
