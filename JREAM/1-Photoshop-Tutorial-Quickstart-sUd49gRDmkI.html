couple of EE Photoshop tutorials I got
five days left so I'm in trouble
I guess what you want to do up here on
cs5 I just use the essentials because I
kind of like the layout of this you know
getting used to it you just go file new
most of this stuff is good you want an
RGB mode your image for the monitor and
that's good and when you create a new
document you're probably like well if
you type something let's say it's like
what the heck man it's really small it's
because you're a 50% view and you can go
down here and type 100 and then hold the
space key to get your little hand here
and then just drag it now your 200% view
and this is where you usually want to
work if it'll fit on your screen and
most of these little icons have hotkeys
if you get used to those you'll do
yourself a lot of good over here your
layers panel pretty important to use
pretty much one of the most important
things to use because let's say I made a
square like this and if I want to move
it with this little arrow tool you know
I can't move it it's on this lock
background layer so if I make a new
layer and I draw a little thing here and
paint that in I just can move that
around let me do that again but with a
different color now this will be on the
same layer if you see right here now I'm
moving these two together you can also
you know do more layers so that objects
move independently of each other and
that's kind of important if you're
making like let's say a website layout
you don't want your layers all be flat
then you just got a monkey around with
everything you can select it like this
though
and then move this even though it's
still on this layer over here so you can
do that too you're gonna want to get
familiar with this marquee tool and how
it works you select stuff delete
easy-peasy
I mean just play around with it it's
this stuff is really easy to learn yeah
all right now whatever alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
