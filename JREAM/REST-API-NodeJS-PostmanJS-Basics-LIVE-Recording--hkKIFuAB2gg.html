think we have that many people in here
but that's okay I'll just leave it here
so that people if they want to watch it
later on so let us begin
okay test em up there we go there's me
and closed closed I don't think we have
then alright so what I'm gonna do is a
simple REST API over here I have just
Linux installed I want to make sure that
fits on the screen looks like it's a
little out of place good enough though I
have the window here to switch over to
it as well and what I'm gonna do is
first open up postman okay
I left in the description if you don't
have it it'd be cool to get it if you're
gonna follow along I'll try to go to a
reasonable pace
hello whiskey echo Bravo
and I don't care about the latest
version right now and you can this is
for Windows also if you're on Windows so
I'm just gonna put that on a screen
below postman and I'm using nodejs so we
will use a terminal in Windows I use
this guy Oh what is this
there's one called CMD er commander get
SCM is probably my favorite but let me
see
LS projects yeah okay yeah that's really
hard to read there but I should be able
to type no - - version and I can access
that's acute Abul on windows there and
I'm just gonna make this bigger postman
is a get postman comm it's free okay
postman comm this guy so whatever OS
you're on I'm on Linux Windows is just
installer my windows copy is up top and
you can sign in with if you have a
Google account it will remember your
data that you safe looks like I oughta
make a love me and so this is the
Windows version I have going boy it's
syncing a lot of stuff here mercy oh it
has a history so that's really cool
about postman it's all sinking there we
go alright so I'll close that
so postman is there and nodejs obviously
is no gist or let me close something
over there so what we'll do is by the
way there's this program called pipe
aura I just love it so where I keep all
my notes I'm gonna drag it over just to
show you okay and
hockey's but this isn't Windows but you
can run it on anything I just do it like
to remember notes you see I have notes
on a ton of things here basically a REST
API it has a lot more methods than this
but you have your gap which is basically
hitting a site you have your post and
that's generally for creating data but
it's also used for updating - it's a
little a little different put is used
for updating like one thing one value
often and then there's delete for
deleting something the problem with
delete is that you either have to use
headers or a uri string you can't post
data if they can't pass data with it so
if you were to create with post and then
update with put you know there's a tool
one in the HTTP code is okay created
otherwise 200 you guys are probably all
familiar with it means yeah I it's good
so this is just pretty basic rest stuff
there's you don't patch a bunch of them
but let's keep it simple so I'm just
going to make a directory I'm just gonna
call it REST API actually so CD into
REST API and there's a lot of node
frameworks all right
we have koa happy Express sales feathers
how is this programs with notes call do
you mean no - Jas no js' org
it's is the one I'm using 893 okay
so we have a lot of frameworks I'm
probably missing a couple there's Resta
Phi which is pretty light and the most
popular one is Express by a long shot
if you look at it I guess github
statistics and everything the only
problem with Express is that it has no
like certain file structure
I guess I'd say but we'll start with
Express because it's the most popular so
let's go ahead and just do this with
nodejs install make sure you can type
know - - version okay and I'm going to
type NPM in it - why and that's node
package manager if you're not familiar
with note oh sorry this is type aura
it's I'll go to it
things too poor dot IO yeah this works
on all os's it's for markdown and I find
it really convenient it's free by the
way
and it kind of renders your markdown as
you type and what I do is I save all my
files in Dropbox so when I open it I go
down here and I just open like one of my
Doc's folders and it's really convenient
I have a lot of notes that I'm always
tossing in here I try to use OneNote by
Microsoft but it just doesn't highlight
code good enough so if we're to look at
Express get
there we go okay 35,000 stars
wow that's a lot
I know Walmart Labs they use um I think
it's koa koa
but you know this isn't really a battle
framework so express is always a safe
bet
so I'll in it this and if you look we
have a package dot Jason okay and we
will go ahead and NPM I or you can type
install if you want I prefer the short
way and - s to save and or - - save but
collected with the short way and we'll
say Express
okay so there's Express and if I just
look in the package
Jason file we have Express loop we're
gonna want body par-4 - seems that guy
actually might have installed that room
maybe not
I'm pretty sure that this has Victor MPM
okay entry point alright that's fine
okay so I'm just gonna type code for
Visual Studio code you can use any
editor that you like and here's our
package
so what's NPM shoot reload with NPM if
we have a package.json file anything in
the scripts can be called from here so
if I type I believe they called it entry
point but I should have just followed
their instructions and obeyed entry
point I thought it was always start let
me just cat one of mine projects
that's gonna be a big file
there's dev watch that was just start
who cares
I care too much let me just fix that
sorry I can't believe I don't remember
it I'll just do this
LS make their fake going to fake
directory NPM in it whoops
oh it's called main oops uh yeah you can
use note no little run as a server as
well
I'll show you let me just them or edit
the package.json it was called main
Oh I'm gonna change this to server jf
let me increase the view here so a my
package.json alright close this get rid
of that I'm just gonna have a go to
server j/s and what this means is if I
were to run like node start it would
look for a server the name of that file
their server Jas
so you could put it wherever you wanted
so are on the fake directory
alright let me clear that
okay
so if you to answer that last question I
just want to show you something keep
losing my Chrome browser full of je s so
total je s is a it's a framework but it
has no dependencies meaning it's built
in - it's using everything built in from
nodejs like node is super fast the only
problem is that it's not really a
problem it's single threaded but it's
still insanely fast so that's an example
you could even go through the nodejs
Docs this it does a lot of stuff i'll
just go here 8/3 API
let's see the HTTP module and an agent
client request there it is the server
I think it'd be a lot easier to find a
tutorial on this I don't use note as a
standalone I prefer convenient functions
hi
Xion XO I'm all right pretty hot right
now
okay so no you don't have to use one if
you don't want to so right now there's
nothing here it really lives inside of
here
Oh it included body parts are cool all
of the sub modules and nodejs can get
pretty big so if you were to I am a lot
of this I'll just make a touch dot get
ignore you always want to add this to
your getting more I don't know how many
people here are new tech new to no js'
or not but I might as well just mention
it you never want to add that to get if
you're using it so what we will do is
create a new file and call that what's
wrong folder okay server j/s failed to
load JSF library sorry this is to do
with vs code I installed an extension I
don't use JSON I use um yes lint
Eknath Script lint and I find it a
little bit better okay so to think the
benefit to using rest is this a REST API
what we have is basically if I it's
basically framework agnostic separate
front end from back-end easy to manage
basically your decoupling the front and
back end and if you get if you're into
docker containers separation of logic
you can even take it further and have
what's called micro api's but that's a
whole nother topic
so really it's I'd say the best selling
point to start is you separate the front
from the back end so we will do const
express equals require express and if
you're wondering this is echo script six
one thing that might help I don't have a
es lint file here but const is just
basically just follow along and you'll
be good and then we want to make an app
concept
equals Express and then okay
all right so we have an app then we want
to run our server make a request
so we'll do a get request and say app
get and our homepage this is really
basic stuff and I'll do requests and I
think it's response okay um sorry let me
take this the easier way to read that's
uh yes six arrows sometimes it's hard to
read if you're not familiar with it
function there yeah I have my es winter
on so it's automatically gonna convert
it so you could even call this request
like what's coming in this is just
shorthand will say response send hello
okay so we have a cat we need our server
to run at I was going to use a different
framework I haven't done this raw for
ever
where's the loop Express sorry I was
going to use feathers Jas but then I
realized it might be assuming too much
too soon
listen F dot listen console.log so this
is like you put a function here but this
is automatically gonna convert it to
xmas script so listening on 3000 you can
pick a different port if you want so if
I say that what's appearing down here is
just yes six errors so this in my case
would have to be like that so yeah that
should work and we should be able to
just be like node start
oops NPM start there we go
so remember NPM start loads the
package.json the server j/s script and
it was loading it's loading the this so
these are the routes it's pretty simple
and then we can open up google chrome i
suppose and go to localhost 3000
we should get a get request that says
hello really complex stuff going on
there okay
so Florida adds something like this I'm
just gonna duplicate that a post and I'm
just gonna make the word post okay and
I'll say poster we can't do that with
Chrome in terms of just loading the
webpage if I were to go to here and
slash post it's gonna think it doesn't
exist because you see it's doing a gap
so we now have postman what I generally
do is I go to my collections and if I'm
working on a project I create a new clip
new collection I'll just call this one
YouTube okay and then in this connection
collection I do add request give it a
name I'll just say basics
is there any API Doc's Oh swagger
swagger is a pretty cool for document
generation that's a good question our
API Doc's for what specifically put this
in YouTube so I'm just gonna call this
called basics and I'll rename it later
okay so if you setup postman by the way
my settings where is it file how did I
make this dark again I know yours by
default won't be dark I can't remember
if you want to have different API
running yeah
wait will they all run in the treetop no
you have to run for example if I did
this I'm just going to copy server j/s
make a new file save this as server two
dot J yes okay and let me go like this
if I tried to do NPM run first it'll
start start see that ports already taken
up you can only have one thing for poor
so what you could do is just put 3001 if
you wanted and we wouldn't be able to
rely on the default script here so we
could try know the server to Jas I gotta
make this bigger so you can read it okay
what I typed here that should
Nova server - Jas so now I have the same
thing rounding on poor 3001 and if I
were to open up this bad boy
I could go to 3,000 won let me just
change one thing in server-to-server -
okay and enter up after we loaded node
server - there we go server - hello
and then I still had the other one
hanging out on 3000 should be okay so I
mean this would be like I don't want to
jump into docker but it's a you can do a
lot with docker um there we have it and
what we're going to do is attempt a post
request hope that we get posted back
I'll close server - I think I'll just
rename this too
dual server example and I'll close him
up so slash post back in postman
we have basics I would do this it's to
set up an environment so you click the
drop-down and postman I have one there I
want to hit this little cog manage
environments and I want to add one and
I'm gonna call this one YouTube okay
and for the key I'm going to put URL for
the value it's gonna be localhost 3,000
basically what this allows you to do is
have your collection has environment
variables and postman and we won't have
to retype this you are all the time in
fact I'm going to put a slash after it
and I'll add that and go ahead and close
and so I have like YouTube here make
sure that the environment YouTube is
selected so if I go to basic basics and
I do URL okay I wish I could zoom this
bigger I don't know if I
Oh a mess up something ctrl+ I need
something bigger but it doesn't look
right stretch that over you might not
have this response well no but it'll pop
up and you can always press ctrl s to
save it so that you have this and I'll
send it and it says hello normally you
might send something like changing the
headers to application type J son so
I'll go ahead and if I hover over this
guy there's three dots I'm gonna say
duplicate and this is just going to be
called a post-test and here remember we
made the URL slash
post and just remember this URL is
really localhost 3000 so if we wanted to
change it would just change one value
because postman is really cool you'll
see a little bit why shortly so I'll
change this to a post and right now
we're not even posting data but we can
go ahead and send it cannot post to
slash post
we see the feathers okay so it did hit
express not found I type something wrong
and oh I think we're on for point X
express it should just be post let me
just check their requests last hour
starts the router
and away
am i tripping dad was embarrassing
post it should have a closed function
oh there's a next method possible next
can we say those I don't think this is
required though app duh I don't even use
the word consistent
post I need to create a router
that really should work
yeah the I guess I'll try it without
this 3000 you're not post you didn't try
another get get 2 and all you say get -
yeah
I would pause the video here and
probably have to delete stuff get to
I'm so dumb you got I didn't even reload
the server so this time you stop having
everything hot reload so I have to
cancel this out then start it again ok
so then this get should work ok and then
the post should work I hope and there's
post
ok so restart your web servers or your
running thing I'm gonna see if I can get
a tool to make that a little easier
let's see how do I set up this real
quick ok so let's just do this to
hopefully make our life easier I'm gonna
cancel out that running and I'm gonna do
NPM install - D or you can do just NPM I
know mom and this is a utility for
debugging and watching for changes and
we can run it from the command line you
can install it globally - if you were to
put - G on here
get rid of it for global I don't care
I'll do it otherwise you have to run
everything from the project you're in in
the node modules and the easiest way to
do that
oh man that's such a good point with the
slash I got it working but just what
Mark Hoppus said is really good so if I
managed my environments in postman click
you to have this trailing slash let me
get rid of that because it might I don't
know it might be doubling up but it's
working here it seems it fixed it's not
running right now
so with post with note Mon since its
installed globally I can type in old man
and the command line - - inspect server
je s let me close this and then I can do
a port like well this dude 3000 again
that should work all right so I'm just
gonna test this and see what happens if
I delete here okay so that's useful to
inspect so this command if you don't
install it globally that's fine because
we'll just go to package Jason we'll
just add our own dev script and the
command will run from this node modules
folder and we'll say dot slash node
modules and there's a bin folder in here
it's weird that it starts with a dot but
it organizes everything so you don't
have to dig through a bunch of things
and then these are actual binary this
will work on Windows and everything - so
we either do dot bin slash node one
that way you don't have to have it
installed globally and you can call
these scripts almost anything you want -
- and backed server vag is and the only
bummer here really is I'm just gonna
hurt I was doing three thousand five it
doesn't really
I get too picky 3,000 and don't forget
your commas because it's strict so that
you should be able to run NPM Ramdev and
it will run the node inspect the little
buddy I'll try a put request laptop but
I know right now this is doing nothing
and I'm just calling it - but put stuff
ok save cool that reloads first nicely
you're basically just copy paste and
this is like super basic
I'll just duplicate this guy look right
click and duplicate I'm gonna call this
foot tennis change this to what what
cool so we know that works that's all
interesting and neat how does that
benefit us it doesn't really let's just
do one more for a delete I'll duplicate
this and just call this a delete request
delete test let's go down
and changes to delete and I'm pressing
control s a lot that's why you see this
blink because I save it and it syncs
synchronizes you don't have to prefix
local scripts with Dan you can oh is
that really oh well it looks rocked on
the Whoopi nice I didn't know that I'm
in my new manga crap what do they do
right here
so let me shrink up this node module so
you don't usually want to be chilling in
here it's kind of scared and it can get
really big then we're just going to make
a delete request should be down down
I could have sworn this stop down maybe
I'm thinking about different thing yeah
that's that's cool I can't believe it
makes me feel like a clown so then I
will test the delete request okay cool
so we know all these were work let me
change this to get get test and I know
we haven't done much here but what we're
going to do is go over here to where it
says tests so first up over the get test
and go to test and you should have this
popover thing that says snippets I'm
just looking for a two hundred yeah
there we go status code is two hundred
and when I hit Send it's going to have
over here test results yours might be at
the bottom if yours might look like this
okay and that's fine but you'll have
this test results here and these are
tests real tests they will give you some
examples so you can compare the returned
data like here's the body I mean you
just click it some real nice snippets
here and what were we pass them back
hello so I'm going to type hello and
just control enter run it again my tests
pass if I type hello - I have one failed
test okay
now you might say why is that cool
because if I click this I can export it
and you can just select like 2.1
recommended export and rest api was
where I put it
all my typing too fats in the gap method
you should return a JSON file so RM the
question you're asking you don't you're
not required to really return anything
that I mean I would return Jason myself
for actual API I believe as a response
Reds response stop Jason I think let me
look at the spawn stuff
should be able to just do it arrest us
and okay but let me finish this I'm free
to folder and call it test and in here
you can just save this JSON file
typewriter oh I haven't gosh I have to
have my hands warm to do a fast typing
test and then what we're going to do is
cancel out of this in NPM I - Diaz in
development and we're gonna say what's
called Newman &amp;amp; Newman is basically runs
postman tests in the terminal the reason
this is good is because if you use
you're not gonna use it GUI all the time
all right so we have Newman in here and
we can make a test in the package.json
you know where I'm not setting up like
karma or jest so we should be able to
say Newman run test slash startup chase
on my hope okay
so hopefully so with that it's really
wrapped in NPM we run tests and see if
it finds it okay connection refused good
so in that case I would need another
terminal open to actually run the server
so here NPM run dev and I should be able
to run the test there's just a test like
API endpoint saying what happened
iterations ones requests for and one
fails okay so I don't need this very big
status is 200 body is correct I got some
funny business it seems like get URL
this is this looks wrong doesn't it URL
there it's not rendering out localhost
host
yeah all right well scratch that idea
for now I had it working up on my thing
right there
and I don't know why it was working in
here it doesn't want to toast man
alright so that's just a quick way to do
that stuff I don't know if anyone here
has MongoDB installed I wanted to get
into that really badly because it's fun
okay so this is just like super basic
Express stuff okay so when you play
around with this like about this
response dot it's Jason and instead I'll
just let me do Const beta equals name
Jupiter age Jupiter then I'll try this
Jason I should also be able to response
to header and you can pass like if you
were creating something it should be
something like 201 is there a response
header when you use different framework
so you can get so little I always get
tripped up but it's always like really
similar it's embarrassing but it's a
response response had her sent cookies
send maybe it's just send headers
you can do this send
where's cancel that for a second you
just trying I want to see what that does
let me get rid of this because this body
should be application JSON okay so here
this is what you would normally do is
check the JSON body boy they really
changed this up it's kind of hard to
read so this is the JSON data and
wrapped within this function PM stands
for postman and then expect is just an
assertion and it's JSON data dot what we
have our body of the name looks just
like a few weeks ago last one is totally
different I'll do age just because it's
easier not to screw up my typing
interrupt or ctrl enter and that just
asserts like okay my endpoint gives me
what I want right on a very high up
level where this isn't actually like
doing anything and that's beautiful
there's also Jason P I believe you can
return you can I think you can do rezzed
us and the body would be data and then I
believe content tight yeah so res dot
offset content - tight application /
Jason and we try to look at that
pretty sure you can do it that way I
personally don't prefer it yeah that
works also that's a real neat obviously
that's more convenient so going on this
is like the most basic thing you could
like I don't know make a organize the
structure the way you wanted it with
your routes so if I made a new folder
and a cold it routes really what I would
do is separate things logically like I
would make a new file and just pretend
ones called users got j/s and another
one would be called index J s I'm just
making stuff up and how about the
products Jas and what you would do is
the index dot JSP module dot exports
equals whoops oh come on boy type we
could say require products
and sure someone could think of a smart
way to do this products and users by the
way you don't have to do a key-value if
it's going to be if you're going to use
the same name like this it's redundant
you don't have to do that at least and I
think it's at most six and this would be
the case if you have to export something
from here so we would have our routes in
here like module exports equals whatever
your export they be your routes well I'm
not gonna make this whole Express thing
there's easier ways to do it better ways
to save time and what I want to show you
is something a little different its
feather J s because then one could
actually do something with it so I'm
just gonna make a new directory and call
it REST API - and I should remind you
like you can make a REST API in any
language pretty much you can do in PHP
with Silex slim lumen Falcon any micro
framework or a big framework I just find
it really easy because you see how
minimal this is obviously we're not
doing a lot here but literally two lines
to get started yeah it does have some
dependencies I know but it's just really
easy to me
so what I'm gonna do is cancel this guy
out close him I'm in REST API - and I'm
just going to do a NPM in it and I'm
gonna hit enter enter enter I like to
enter enter that's why I do - why what's
up Jhon dev so we have a package jason
Silex is useless bye
seems like a lot of people have moved to
slim so do this instead remove that
package Jason NPM I - gee feathers Jas
let me make sure I got that right
feathers
okay so feathers this is we want to save
time in life but we don't want to rush
through it like we want to know what
we're doing that's why I started with
this this is more naked bare bones it's
not the lightest framework Express I
mean it's like light but you know you do
have quite a few dependencies if you
scroll through this this isn't the same
as so much as thinking about PHP
Composer
it kind of is I guess I don't know
you'll have a lot more node modules than
you would in PHP anyways that's this
isn't something that totally panic about
if you have a lot so if you've installed
feathers yeah that's what you type NPM I
- gee feathers O'Hurley symphony for
Damian this guy's stealing my curiosity
so just type in the word feathers to
make sure you can run feathers and just
so you know you'll see creating Express
middleware this just saves us a ton of
time people like Tim feathers I want to
check out two things
oh crap
feathers I don't remember that at symbol
feathers jus install sorry yeah you're
right man yeah modular dependencies Wow
I never installed the a couple of these
other ones but what are em for teen said
I think they were here the other time
it's two and I didn't know ahead MPM tie
at feathers you know angular's like that
too but there is angular / CLI and
feathers J s / feathers looks I want to
see Li
that means command-line interface every
filter drink
so this guy is talking about this should
install okay so that guy thank you for
your correction I'll press up I'm gonna
leave it down here hopefully you can see
that okay so make sure if I can see my
screen a little bit better yeah install
that guy with your note but do a - G
globally all right so I just want to see
a symphony or
I haven't used symphony for a while I
know this is a little off-topic I did
read an article by a Taylor OTT well and
it was claiming it was there was a 30%
faster 42 laravel I don't know and it
wasn't really in a Taylor kind of
reproduced the stats but you know a lot
of things depend on what makes it faster
what's enabled and everything well
that's cool they're going to microwave
microframeworks are kind of like the way
to go
I'm just curious because I'm a curious
cat symphony or well it's not out yet is
it in beta oh I wonder if they talked
about this most people I know from this
channel that they use PHP so this might
they should be relevant 33% man that
just seems too high of a number
symphonie flex what is Symphony flex
requires application
assets been Confed public SRC templates
I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get all a TD
and Symphony flex you gotta know this
stuff composer plugin for something
symphony okay yeah wait simply flex
creatively oh okay this is the micro
framework okay Oh 33 milliseconds
milliseconds oh boy
yeah I'd have to look into this before I
start going on about it
so with feathers installed we ran our
folder here I can just remove everything
here by the way cuz feathers should be
installed globally I'm just going to
type feathers G app because I don't want
to take the whole work generate out and
then from here I'm just gonna do that
project name empty description I'm just
gonna put it in this folder so I'll put
a period and you'll use NPM but if you
have yarn installed you can use that
I'll just pick yarn because I have it
installed and you'll have these bubbles
I don't know what this looks like on a
Windows terminal I haven't seen these
but if you hit space you can turn them
on or off but I would just leave the two
there I don't know if you'll use socket
IO for real time or not I'll hit enter
and it's going to install all our
goodness and by the way let me just make
sure to show you a gif of feathers three
milliseconds I could have sworn I heard
33% by Taylor a little bit
Taylor well he said something with the
30s it was not a medium article not
cloud weighs well cares what he said
all right so feathers here if we click
okay this is the feather sky has eight K
stars and that's good if you go to let's
just say sales J s I don't know how many
stars I have read a lot of stories about
this that it's not too great to use this
has 18 K stars it's been around a while
there's also meteor meteors a big one
these are frameworks and nodejs I always
look at it get help stars that's not
what I want to see it's get there it is
38k stars all my goodness 38k stars in
meteor meteor is it's like a full think
of it like a laravel i guess yet you can
do the same things with feather Jes and
I haven't lost sales if it's NBC you
know you can do all the same stuff but
what's interesting about this is that
they do have a directory structure that
you follow meteor okay so I'll just pick
Adams alright that's not I'm not gonna
go over meteor J yes just don't use
their template engine called blaze with
meteor you have to use if you're doing
front-end you have to use react or
angular if you do there's a Ola Jas
get up some people you know they like
what they like I don't know 18k Stars
that's okay it's it's this is really the
same thing
so Cola and I get they got so many names
that confuse me let's see other one
happy h api happy and this is the one
this only has 8k stars and it has this
funny little logo but i think this is
the one used by like some pretty big
companies you know so just because the
stars it doesn't mean like it's good or
bad
just one more there's one called
loopback this is by IBM i believe they
bought it 10 k stars and the reason this
is really good by the way it generates
documentation as well and you want this
CLI
because it saves time okay if i just
want to loop back dot io or they got
some examples i have okay
I actually have this installed with LV
if I just did LD leaves that thought I
did
maybe I removed it all right whatever
so this generated our project with
feathers all right so feathers hit enter
and I'll take G I'll do a service no let
me do an authentication and we can have
a user local we can add in Facebook
github or you can use office zero
looks like allows you I don't know how
many is it 10,000 people and then you
got to start paying money and all zero
takes care of I think a whole bunch of
things but I'll hit enter and then the
entity it's just like a model and then
you choose what kind of service so any
DB that's just like it's kind of like
SQLite all right most people use
Mongoose and what Mongoose is is that's
MongoDB but it's a wrapper for it and
it's easier to use than
MongoDB code itself
I thought they had I'll have to do any
DB just because I have to so that's
going to add all that and set up a
service for us and you just chill all
the authentication mean Jas I actually I
get that confused with Mangal expressing
okay it's a real thing I've never used
this I only knew it stood for Mongo
Express angular and nginx I thought oh
no Janus uh yeah I think it's good I do
feel that angularjs is part a little
overly difficult like version it's kind
of hard not not tight script but just
it's a lot for a front-end framework
it's like them it's a big framework it's
I wouldn't use angularjs unless it was a
big project okay so this installed here
so I should be able to let me see what's
in let me make sure I open this and coma
so it looks like all great I got a code
generator and that's usually what I
think until you played around a lot with
just may be expressed by itself no chat
if you want like a bare minimum look for
a rest if I I think we use that at a job
I was on this is like super lightweight
where you I mean this is basically
almost the same as Express just super
super light and you could you would add
your own middleware you might want to
follow a guide or something what death
answered that one on what languages you
use most of work I'm I got let go I
think two weeks ago but I was doing
nodejs
and a lot of docker
and some angular I was struggling with
it in some areas it was because when you
take on an existing project it's kind of
uh it's kind of hard and it wasn't kind
of set up to a standard but usually it
seems like I usually end up with either
a PHP or Python work almost always so in
anything Python it's always with Django
framework PHP it it's just most PHP jobs
it's not that good because it's very few
places I've worked that do PHP are like
set with modern standards I guess I'd
say I don't know the PHP ecosystem is
strange
I'm not saying PHP is bad but like what
places you work it's just like first I
don't know everyone does so many things
in PHP so custom like you don't know
what anything is it's all new you always
have to relearn something but that could
be true for anything else as well so
shrink this down let me don't save him
that's expressed so we have all this
crap here and it's like oh my gosh what
is all this
authentication dot J s ok make this
fellow big you can see all the stuff
that they're requiring they're using
passport which is very popular
authenticate and what are they using oh
that's a lot 2.0 yeah I thought it was
whatever and there should be a place put
your keys in here Oh config oops
okay strategies what this means JWT is a
JSON web token which would be what you
would be using for any ooofff
two sites like Google Facebook github
and all those the path to your
authentication this is a config JSON
file by the way that you can change when
you turn on your click scroll and here's
where you put your credentials I'm not
gonna set up Google and Facebook and all
that your entity that really means your
model or your database record right
actually username feels yeah ok that's
not part of the entity you know your
Facebook client ID what scopes you want
saves a bunch of time
so if I do feathers sorry NPM wrong dev
I think it package.json where's the
scripts start NPM start okay so this one
goes on localhost 30 30 then we should
get them a basic feathers API guy there
yes
yeah it would be easier for me to do PHP
or Python I don't do c-sharp my brother
does that he likes it but he also likes
paint on the event so yeah this is a
globose 30 30 if we were to create
something like this let's just create a
service will say feathers generate
service and we'll just use any DB the
name of the service we could just call
up for hot office and you can set a
route you can always change it if you
want to does it require authentication
now but if you wanted to it could then
we can run the start I could have sworn
there was a doctor narrator for this by
the way if i refresh this what a service
is is in endpoint right so this would be
a service for all products so slash
products
okay that's the get request and if I go
let me close all these other guys if I
go to the guy here models products only
in this case does it have a file name
okay I actually didn't notice that it's
making a separate database for each
service or whatever yeah I guess that
makes sense kind of a separate file I
mean where's the I I wouldn't use
Mongoose but I know nobody probably
hasn't installed our MongoDB or Mongoose
yeah
this creates crud for us I just wanted
to see where the fields are defined that
I haven't done it with any DB so the DB
path who knows where it is others look
for products that DB real quick
not found
okay so I'm just gonna try to post
anything into there what postman so just
using the same test here I have to
change his port to 3030 and it was
called products and by default it's a
content type application Jason the body
I do raw and I'm just gonna put I know
it by default at least in other ones we
have text hello world
save that okay so in the body I have raw
and I will send it okay and then we get
an underscore ID which is similar to how
Mongo database works they call this B
son BSO and like jason with a B and it's
like binary Jason and I'll try to send
another one though this scrambled
control-enter get a different ID so I
should be able to copy that ID and do a
get from 3030 / products first I should
be able to do a get like Venice okay
whoops
I'm going to leave this okay so products
the default get will give you a list if
I create a new one I should be able to
pass an ID to get single should be oops
let me get the should be by ID think so
yeah there we go so I'm gonna test this
out I know it's not good practice to
have a schema that's not the same but
how about food equals an age
okay Ellen there this is ha ha ha so I'm
just added some fake data and by the way
you can put this in a runner but I'm
just kind of trying to hurry through
this so if I do send unlike my sequel
you can have tables this is true for
MongoDB as well that are the same schema
and it's bad practice I just did it
right now because us playing around
wanted more data from getting something
back so I'm getting this back
oops did I paste that right nope
copy/paste okay
we should be able to post while we did
that doesn't update put products /
something actually don't know their
rules on this one I think I can do and
so hunger underscore ID text equals
something like they do put put what are
they doing
Lobos sorry its 30 30 placing multiple
patch let me try this so if I cut the ID
this technically should be whoops like
that okay there we go
so we got an ID back so when you do a
put is to update one field you can use
patch to update many but I see posts
down a lot and if I go to get the single
test that should change
horribly it's a foot test why did I put
that's weird I shouldn't have to pulse
this or never
I don't know why this is empty I don't
even know what I'm doing every war I
thought I was ready for this video but
I'm not
I tried recording I think four videos
before I made this and I just kept
getting frustrated because I just can't
seem to record anything today a delete
method it'll have this got changes to 30
30 products then we would have to pass
in some key somewhere so I'll scramble
delete it doesn't have it you can't pass
on a body sand okay so we got a response
back and then that should be missing now
yeah so that's missing I want to delete
this too because it's nothing I got to
get this patch and put right should be
able to get nothing back so in other
words every time you create a service
this will generate hooks as well
feathers j/s is really convenient and
it's not too complicated I didn't think
that's just one service users is another
and they also create tests little test
areas so then you can put your unit
tests in here which is really nice I
just like how it generates stuff don't
know what happened here
so I'll do feathers show you a few more
features middleware would be like maybe
for authentication hey I think I made a
feathers chat app it was in their
tutorials it was really fun
let me just put on my CD - dev Jas CD -
yeah there it is
NPM start localhost 30 30 and I'm gonna
open up a new window there as well and
just show you I just I just follow their
tutorial whipped it up real quick and
this is using a socket IO oh cool let's
save my defeated face it seems like this
one's broken hey mom and I'm gonna do
incognito 30 30
and that that all show no random
Gravatar hey dude hey yeah it's pretty
cool it's saving to a database actually
saving to any database so it's not even
a real database but this thing's
lightweight and they just show you how
to do that feathers Jas I'm like I got
nothing to do with feathers Jas I just
think it's really cool
if you go to their I think it's
documentation guides
oh yeah the chat application well that's
if you want to do it that way otherwise
yeah this looks way better I wonder what
I did wrong I just rushed through it a
lot of copy and paste stuff it's pretty
cool though socket IO and all that crap
so I guess that's I don't know what else
to say this didn't really go hi will
really intended it to this videos very
embarrassing and I just wish I
I wish I never did it over that helps
somebody I'm sorry this video wasn't
really this didn't go high and really
planned I gotta I gotta get organized in
my brain and life it's so messy here
it's hard having a little kid this here
is a LSB release a Ubuntu 17 but I'm
using good known well oh yeah that comes
to fault with it
what's that called
I'm glad you liked it I just I feel like
I didn't explain how I wanted to I used
- to panel that's this guy some people
like the little things a sidebar I'm
using VMware so press f9 and I'll see
hoopla is about 216 Linux Mint
I don't like elementary very much Arch
Linux Ubuntu
I think Linux Mint I think this is like
proudly rated the best Linux liked by
everybody it's the most customizable and
the it's it's really good I'm not gonna
lie if I was to really get into it I
probably used Linux Mint on top of a bun
- I think I don't know what the default
is but I got X sub unto a bunch of
budgie Arch Linux but you know no one's
got time for all that coupon - lot like
Windows but I think I would probably
rather go with cinnamon ella bun - yeah
cinnamon aha I've customized it so much
and mess stuff up yeah it's kind of
messed up right now I'm always messing
stuff up
yeah that's true
this is a bad example here but Linux
Mint definitely is really good looks
like a little I always put my stuff at
the top I'm wearing when doze has it at
the bottom and then in the OS X whenever
you open something on Apple I don't have
any Apple things but it puts the menu I
think it like the top here that that
always throws me off a little bit and
then Ella bun - honestly a bunch is the
only thing I really use like first
server same thing a bun - I know there's
Debian and Debian I like I hate CentOS
so much
everything's always out-of-date it feels
so Jane kitty that's my opinion anyways
but for desktop environments same thing
on the laptop ahead this is a elbow bun
- which is a lightweight guy this one's
like supposedly really fast like the
first thing I would do is move this
panel to the top but uh yeah this is it
this is very minimal you see it looks
like cinnamon a little bit dunno how it
has all that stuff
let's see ctrl alt T nice oh this is
fast
what's up with that dude
if you're out I do like how fast that is
I wonder how customizable it is now I
gotta watch videos because I'm I feel
like Nome is cool what I'm using here
but you can probably tell there's some
drag to it it feels a little bulky
sometimes and I use a impatience also
right here to speed up the animations
try to turn those off for the most part
- if you do play with no little bit
probably want to like go to NP MJS and
let's say I'm looking for
what's that thing react you just search
react and it'll sort by the best overall
you can sort by popularity that should
reload okay and this will give you a
list of like things you can install that
are the most popular this is front end
obviously not back in but you could say
like what's it Express so remember we're
using Express Wow Morgan that is a
logger but there's another one I had a
different name then passport like what
we saw in the feather CLI or the feather
that made our stuff this is really
popular for the authenticating
third-party places I should star that
JSON web tokens
I thought it had more though so off
Facebook Twitter or open idea I don't
know who uses open idea anymore
300-plus strategies no way
what does that even mean I see five
strategies oh no a bee beam that
bitbucket oh wow man this thing has a
lot of stuff
so the here's our nodejs guy that's
basically authenticating you Oh open
soos boy I haven't used that mages or
sorry I I don't use I don't use open
soos I think there was one called den -
I've never used again - I don't even
know how popular that is some people
swear by arch linux because it's so
minimal it comes with nothing basically
except pac-man
what is this free camping on parcel so
you know how there's webpack Gope grown
those build tools now there's something
called parcel which is like a
application bundler I think it would
have been easier to do a view video
I think it's view CLI is the command
room
if I were just to go whoops CD and
there's CD a little fake folder whoops
deal and in it what pack is that it yeah
you Jas I don't even know if I talked
about this or did I I'm that out of it
but I was recording a video about this
and that's what I was going to upload
today but I get brain farting see I've
been talking for like an hour plus and
it's so hard for me to try to jam stuff
into ten minutes and I watched these
other guys speaking I'm like man how
many times did these guys have to record
to get it right I don't know it's just
frustrating to make one video so
sometimes I was like whatever I'm just
gonna do one run and hope that works
looks like there are some errors there
you are I don't know what happened there
seemed like it didn't install all the
right stuff but UJ s is like I really
like it a lot I I don't know man
haters will be haters I'm all about
what's pretty easy and not gonna waste a
lot of time documents go look at the
angular 5 documentation and then come
back to me and you tell me yep angular 2
and up it's crazy when you get into the
thick of this fundamentalist
architecture okay
in just they they're using a special
scroll bar okay
and this thing too bad right here well
you start going into some of this stuff
you're just gonna be like yeah what did
I get into I just wanted to make a
project I forgot what patient was but I
was like what in the world I promise you
there's more documentation than these
this is just the fundamentals then
there's techniques it's crazy but you
have to have someone teach you to learn
angular it's hard it's really hard
let's see we used to have partes Turkish
Linux but the government I
ah reduce I'm thinking of just I don't
know having a forum or something because
sometimes I want to talk with other
people to write code but I don't want to
be was on the on YouTube because I don't
know I don't like verbal talking
marriage speaking very much all the time
it's tired I have a slack but I know I
won't stay using that so I don't know
mmm what is this oh it's debian-based -
that's good the bunch is based on TV did
turkish oh i thought that government
created it if you want um so if you want
it to learn I don't know an angular man
you're gonna that's gonna be hard
angel is really hard I I would MongoDB
is so fast
it's pretty cool I don't know any videos
but I know nodejs
um no js' it's not that hard
es everything you're gonna look for is
like es6 I don't know the best place but
the reason I wait because some people
use like older versions you want to use
7 point 5 or above of nodejs
because you have what's called a weight
and a sink if you've ever heard of
promises
you know I promise you pretend I have x
equals blog something okay and then
there's like a function in here dot then
got then got then got catch right but
seven point five and up yes I think it's
seven whatever you just you would do
this X equals blah da something and
inside here you would have your function
you'd say try catch air right and then
you do a this would actually have to be
like async then promised thing so
instead of this if you've ever seen this
all this crap getting nested you should
know about all that
you know cuz this this turns into like a
nightmare I'd show you both but I'm
trying to get in trouble for it
they died because I don't do that
you know like show old phone from the
places I used to work I think I removed
it anyways even though it's not like any
increment it's not like bad or anything
or reveals any company secrets just I
just think that'd be kind of weird
shady of me to do so I don't know you
know if you know one back in language
like PHP like you've got yourself okay
what's the reason I want to learn
something different like for me I'm kind
of like obsessed maybe that's how you
are too but I probably look in the PW a
progressive web apps maybe I know they
rank higher on Google view Jas also has
one if I did view and PWA
yeah yeah yeah
seedy high earn and then there's a
there's a few tutorials on PWA apps this
is a little terrible on my thing but
it's pretty cool how it looks on your
phone and then your computer it's like
um what's that called not CSS grid on
the VW and the CSS unit viewport width
Oh V height and V width now those are
interesting to play with in CSS
anyways so yarn
it doesn't matter usually if you use
yarn or NPM by the way I always found
that yarn is faster loading installing
stuff so this is a progressive web app
you can install like Google stuff on
here right so what will happen is shoot
I did one and it was kind of cool but
watch this if you use n drop so I would
say n Gras
sub domain is or 8080
oh one - Oh sub-domain equals what am I
doing wrong
HTTP 8080
I'm just looking what they have here sub
domain equals
and graph that I own all right I'll try
this all right let me just remove
something remove oh come on
anyways this usually works Andhra
http/2
yeah that's working I don't want that
don't want 8080
it's the sub domain sub domain equals
Jessie oh I don't have a token installed
alright so anyways with this you can
have like a site URL this looks like you
guys could load this page right now this
sub domain ain't working because I
didn't authenticate it and then I could
open up my telephone my teleprompter and
I got typing this crazy address but in
grot you know it's just one of the tools
that unfortunately for custom domains
it's it costs money now but I understand
it the guys got to survive Fe f59
b6
all right so like I know I just loaded
and then there is the progressive web
app I don't have anything good to show
on it I'm always talking about these by
the way but you know it's the same site
right here so it works on mobile that's
why pwace are good and Google loves them
I don't know what else is on there and
then one guy wanted me to do some kind
of typing test I'll just do that and
then close this off I want a fun one
that's just I used to take one fast
fingers ten fast finger thing yeah this
basic one all right so I'll set it up
I'll try to do this and then you guys
can try to beat me ten fast fingers calm
and by the way it helps if you have warm
hands actually think I have an account
here let me just see if I can log in and
then be disappointed by how slow I type
right now oh boy I won't even remember
its I'm gonna guess you know I'll do one
more guess
nope alright so yeah set the record
close it off and see if you guys can
beat me and I'll put it down kinda by my
keyboard a bit there so you don't think
I'm cheating all right I'm gonna let me
out of practice all right here we go
eight oh my goodness
1:02 oh it's terrible for because I was
if they have profiles I'd show you too
many errors so I don't like but this
it's not that hard
darn I thought I had a profile somewhere
I think my highest on here was 140 I'm
not kidding I only stayed up it was a
really good day I do have a youtube
video on a channel where I did 120 but I
was like it wasn't my best that was
really bad kind of practice okay so I
think I'm gonna do like stop recording
now and run and hide and try to I'm
applying for jobs and stuff the struggle
struggles real guys I love alerts y'all
later
whole story Tyndale Abbas okay I'm just
I'm a newbie with this alright guys
thanks for watching sorry I didn't
really turn out how I wanted it'll be
better another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
