going to mess with get and get is a
version control system kind of like CVS
and svn i recently switching to get
pretty much because the guy at work and
I'm actually liking a lot more so to
learn how to use it briefly and quickly
i'm going to use github now you don't
have to use github you can use some
place like code spaces or anything but
github really makes it easy and it's
like a big social community which is
pretty cool so to get started you
obviously need an account and you would
just go to a set up get and they make it
really easy for you to follow they say
hey get this program for windows and
it's basically like a linux terminal i'm
not sure if it uses c YG win I don't
think it does so you scroll down and
he'll tell you what to do load up your
git bash so I'll go ahead and do that so
I love this guy up right and I want to
make sure I'm it in my user directory
okay your user directory is up here
wherever your guys my c drive users
jesse and you won't have this folder SSH
well that's what you'll create and they
tell you how to do that like right below
it you just type in here it is the key
gen so you do something like ssh-keygen
trustee RSA see test
test com but you should put it in a row
you know and it's going to generate a
key normally you would just hit enter
here i'll just type in the work test
because i dont want to overwrite
anything and a passphrase is a good idea
it just be like a password and mine
didn't work because my passphrase is too
short just playing around and we go up
here you'll have an SSH folder in your
user directory and we gotta plug this in
to get okay so we take this IDRs a pub
key climb over to github and we'll go to
our little user name at the top edit our
profile and ssh keys who would add ssh
key give it a title I just title mine so
I know what they are obviously open up
this file and then just paste it in the
key add the key and you're good to go
with that ok now I already have mine set
up and you shouldn't give away your SS
your keys so it's a security thing
next we're going to create a repository
and to do that i'll just go my dream guy
up here and i'll say repositories new
repository i'm just going to call this
one Sophie you tell yours whatever you
please and this gives you directions on
how to set this up it's pretty
straightforward and easy so I'll say let
us yeah I decide where you want your get
to chill your project and chill you can
always move it if you want so i'll go up
to work space and I want my guy in here
I could create a new folder in here and
just call it Sophie or I could just go
to CDC drive workspace and LS to list
and let me just remove the dirt Sophie
and you could just to make their Sophie
ok and I'm going to change directory to
Sophie and PWD to see where I am and
that's what I want to do it so I'll be
like get in it and it initiates a empty
git repository which creates this get
folder it'll be hidden unless you have
on your tools folder options I hit the
Alt key by the way to get that menu up
there and press alt to get that out
there folder options view hidden files
and folders I always have mine Shawn so
anyways
so we already initiated get what we're
going to do is just follow these
instructions and I'll kind of explain
what they do touch creates an empty file
so Linux command so i'll say touch
rigney md dot m d stands for mark down
let me see if they have nano in here
nano read me dot nd nope so then read me
md &amp;amp; vinz a little text editor and it's
kind of hard to use a first and I'm not
very good at it so it looks like it's
hard to use so here's how you do it
press the letter A and we'll let you
insert stuff i'll just type in this is a
title so this is mark down so this is
text this is ok and then we need to
press the Escape key and you'll see at
the bottom the word insert disappear now
all the commands run through a colon ok
so I'm going to press colon w to write
and then kool &amp;amp; Q to quit ok and I'm
going to list my directory and i have
read me md cool and we need to add the
file so i'll do get add the letter R and
I'll press the tab key and it'll fill
for me and we can commit that I'll say
git commit now here's one thing to note
see how they put dash M that short for
message and it's a shorter way to do it
and you can sleeve your message in there
and say first commit however I'm going
to do it the vin way just because you
might forget that so instead of racing
this whole line I'll just press ctrl-c
to cancel i'll say get come in and i'll
press the letter A I'll say this is my
first commitment but I'm press escape
colon w2 right colon Q to quit ok and we
get a little message here 1 files change
blah blah blah and they they tell us to
do a remote at origin and the reason I
do this is that so we don't have to do
git push normally you'd have to do get
push of get at get oh calm dream / so
they don't get ok if we want to do a
push we have to type that every time or
if we want to do a poll we have to type
that every time so you might be
wondering ok this is a like svn what
does commit do because usually commit
goes to the server with get everything
is on your local hard drive and it's not
on to the server at all it only goes to
the server if you push it to it and to
get from the server you do a poll so
push and pull come from the server um ad
and
oh gosh I forgot was it delete delete
oops I got a tight KITT get delete read
me that md get remove read me now md
there we go so let's remove so add and
remove sorry I'm not the GIMP master let
me make sure I add that again get ad
grade v dot nd okay and commit just
convince it locally so you have a couple
more steps than when you use scn so we
have read me in there we already
committed it up here we write up there
and we can do a remote add origin but
for now just for fun I'm just going to
get push and i'm going to copy this
right here and if you right-click you
can't pace if you control v you can't
pay since like what's up you can go to
this little icon in the corner and go to
edit paste it'll hit enter and enter the
passphrase if you set one and let's see
what happened in to pass phrase norris
and common unspecified branches master
oh there we go let me press up once more
I'll say master oops I forgot to take
something
I guess I didn't all right
so what I'm going to do is just copy
this and paste it in there so this they
continue and we have our little Sophie
thing and the readme dot nd file is what
shows up right down here it's a markdown
file pretty cool I guess and what we
have here are commands to save us time
so i would do get remote add origin and
i do get a github.com drink / Sophia get
and now instead of typing that long line
i can do get push but i don't have
anything to push so think of it this way
get is some ad commit with your message
and push so that's how you do it to the
server you can also do remove commit
and push and to get from the server you
would do pull and you need to work get
in front of it okay so um and I guess to
make it even easier first and having to
type master after everything I could
just do it get origin no that's a push
command everyone there is one thing that
we missed we need to set up some global
stuff right here you should probably
just fill these in what they get Confed
global user name you know get config
global these are not named blah blah but
i'm not going to type that in and that
there's also a github token I honestly
don't know what this does but they also
tell you to type that in and you're good
to go so what we're going to do is just
create a new file so I'll say within dog
txt I'll press the letter A and say this
is a dog file colon w whoops
escaped OMW tone q okay and I'll touch a
cat all right it's all list those out
and I have to those now I can do get at
cat dot txt and that's added but what if
i had on let's say touch fish pig and a
barn okay and i wanted to add all those
you could just say at let's get at dot
and that will add all that good stuff
and what we want to do is commit so
we'll do it a shorthand way i'll say get
commit message whoops by the way you can
press up and down to get in this stuff
get commit and my life man and that
committed so locally it's good now it's
ready to be pushed so i'll say get push
under in that passphrase and refresh
and there's all this stuff here and you
see how the message shows up right there
it's pretty cool if we want to remove
from the server will just say get remove
barn txt I just type that wrong again
get delete barn txt looks like I need a
little help let's pray RM get RN barn
txt LS cool and i'll do a git commit and
i'll say removed the barn ok and I'll do
git push ok and I'll refresh this guy
here and now the barn is missing and
that's all fine and good however if you
do not like this and you would like to
make your life easier and you don't like
command prompts and all that there's
something called portis get and it's
based off tortoise svn and it's very
easy to use and it follows kind of the
same principles so what you need to
remember just for the basics is pretty
much that and in my little folder here
when you have a conflict or something
like let's say you committed from work
and you come home you would open that
file like this
and there'd be some text in here like
that you just delete that fix up your
file and read push it I think that sums
it up I'm no expert and get but I just
wanted to make a video because someone
requested it and I'm just getting into
and I'm actually really liking it a lot
thanks for watching for watching guys
