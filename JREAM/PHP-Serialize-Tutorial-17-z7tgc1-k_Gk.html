in this tutorial I'll explain PHP
serialized which is a very cool and
useful function I have an array here and
it's just a flat level array you can use
multi-dimensional that's fine and I
printed the results here and it gives us
just the basic output now to serialize
what you do is type serialize and the
array name and let me echo this out
sorry it's called single and when I do
this you get this long crazy
scary-looking string what this is is the
serialized representation of this array
and you might wonder why would I ever
use this the reason is if you had a
database and you had to insert a
collection of things and you don't want
to make a bunch of rows or columns for
certain fields like Pat one pet two pet
threes you could just have one called
content and serialize everything inside
of it like this
and to handle that data you could unsee
realize it so we have our thing here and
when we get the results back from
someplace we could say sir equals uncie
realized this okay and
I'll just echo out ser refresh and we
have an array and if I do print R of
that we have the exact same thing and
that's really cool so what you can do is
you can compact all this data into a
string and then you can uncompact it and
I'll explain what these little things
here mean you don't really need to know
them the a stands for array the 3 is how
many items are in this main array and
you'll see these squiggly brackets this
goes from here to here this means the
array right here is three items the eye
is the slot here and I stands for
integer which is zero
the S 3 stands for string and the string
is three values CAT and then it shows
the actual value and the same goes down
for here and here and you'll see on this
one it says I 2 which is fish right here
S 4 because fish is four letters and
then the actual string and it'll give
you just a letter representation of what
the value is you don't need to remember
that just realize that this feature
comes in use quite a bit and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
