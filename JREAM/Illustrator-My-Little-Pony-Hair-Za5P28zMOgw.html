for a tutorial to draw the hair on a g4
pony which is my little ponies I don't
know much about the show I just look for
kind of a picture and made an outline of
a pony's head this is supposed to be a
horn right here and what we're going to
do is draw the hair which is the tricky
part I'll provide this video or this
file for download in my description if
you'd like and I guess we can get
started I've locked this layer by
pressing ctrl too so you know i can't
select anything and what i think i'm
going to do is draw a kind of hair
coming out over the Little Ponies main
I'm going to start with a square and you
could do a lot of this with the pen tool
but we can get away with some things
using the warp warp can come in handy
quite a bit and then I'm going to check
out flag and always turn the preview on
and I want this to be vertical and bend
it up a little bit more okay now you
might not always get the desired result
you want but we can always modify that
so press ok and I'm going to expand this
object so I can actually edit it go to
object expand appearance looks good and
this is going to kind of be tucked
behind his ear so what I'm going to do
is actually with the pen tool select the
minus 1 delete Anchor Point or press the
minus key and I'm going to delete this
one point here look at that it didn't it
deleted the outline I'm just going to
delete that whole outline their want to
leave that there we go and now we have
kind of a little wave here and what I
want to do is tuck it behind the ear and
I'm just going to hold ctrl alt and use
my mouse wheel to zoom in and then
spacebar to pan around and it's not
going to be perfect but just like make
it touch the ear
and ctrl alt to zoom back out now what
I'm going to do is kind of move this
over a little bit so with my white mouse
arrow I selected I'm just going to click
so nothing selected and select these two
points over here and hold shift use my
keyboard to kind of move the hair away
it is going kind of over the eye I don't
want that so perhaps I could stretch
this anchor point down a little bit
maybe a little bit more looks pretty
good okay we'll get two more detail
shortly she I guess it's going to be a
girl is also going to have some hair
coming over to this side and um I think
I'm going to do a shape so it's going to
be a circle now what you have to try to
imagine is look between the horn and the
ear what I'm doing is I'm just kind of
creating a circle that goes up and the
rest of that's going to be ignored ok so
like boom and I'm going to right click
arrange and hopefully you can see this
on my screen I pic send to back ok and
this part right here where this curve is
we're also going to make that kind of a
piece of hair and I think we can get
away with using this curve because it's
pretty attractive so before I make the
curve for this piece of hair i'm
actually going to finish the bottom of
this one and to do that i think i might
just use my pen tool make sure you don't
have your minus one selected and their
hair kind of goes in a little curl so my
well I think I'll make a bigger arc kind
of like that and then click the little
dot to get rid of that line we got to
find the point where the hair begins and
there it is like that so it might take a
little bit of manual editing and you
notice I didn't close this path that's
because i'm going to select these two
and open my path finder window
pathfinder and with those two selected
I'm going to merge look at that we got
one nice solid piece of hair so what I
can do now is click this piece of hair
hold the Alt key so you see the double
arrows and drag it on over and what I'm
going to do is mirror it so you might
have this little icon it's the rotate if
you press are you'll get to it but you
want to hold this down and go to reflect
and just click somewhere to make the
point where you want to reflect it and
then just start dragging around I'm
gonna hold the shift key so that I well
that's not going to look exactly how I
want it I guess I'll do it manually boom
okay and we also want to send this to
back range send to back okay so this
looks a little silly at the moment what
I can do is move it up a little bit
maybe rotate it so that it goes well
with this curve here or i could just
overlap it to take over that curve that
doesn't look too bad now this hair is
kind of wacky and it's going all over
the place so i think what i'm going to
do is select the white arrow and select
a point here i'm going to hold shift and
make sure I got that point also and try
to move it over just a little bit
and I think I'm going to do it with
these boom boom and maybe move this one
in a little bit also boom boom and
stretch the handles you know it's up to
you how how precise you want it to look
at everything so now we have a basic
outline for the hair what we're going to
do now is add some colors into it and
there's there's really a lot of ways you
could go about this I'm going to try to
do this in a hopefully and easy to do
way so what I would do is click this
piece of hair and press ctrl f I believe
that's this one paste in front k boom
now it looks like nothing happened but
in reality if you move this over well
something supposed to happen edit copy
edit paste them front let's try that
again okay you have to copy it first and
paste in front sorry about that so we
have a copy sitting on top of this and
I'm actually going to do that one more
time edit paste in front and what I can
really do is just drag these over so
that you can see them and i'll change
the color whoops not the outline
okay and what we're going to do is we're
going to make a stripe out of the piece
of hair so if I drag this over here like
so I'm going to do arrange bring to
front and the stripes not going to go
all the way down on this piece of hair
we could manually bend this down why
don't we do that just because you might
want to if I wanted to bend this down a
little more and change this arc like so
and then what we'll do is select both of
these and subtract ok and I'll change
the color this real quick now I can drag
this over here make sure it's lined up
and we have a nice striped there I'm
gonna do a stripe for the side as well
so I'm going to kind of do the same
thing control C which is the hotkey for
copy and then ctrl f control f ok again
it looks like nothing happened but let's
drag these over if you're on a Mac it's
probably the command key in the letter C
and the command key and the letter F so
just pick a random color so we can see
what we're doing and we want to bring
this one to the front this is the piece
that we're going to be subtracting
arrange bring the front and this piece
is going to be on the side ok and
actually like how this stripe kind of
looks the only issue is that this stripe
is going to go straight into this one
and it's going to look funny I'll show
you what I mean let me subtract these so
boom and we got a little extra piece
over there so let's select our white
arrow and select that and delete
okay so if I move this over here and
change the color to kind of a blue you
can see how it really shouldn't
interfere with that thing there we want
the hair to go all in one direction so
it looks kind of cool go ahead and zoom
in and I'm just going to make a manual
kind of a curvy shape so I'll start from
say this point here and maybe go up to
here and make a little curve like that
and then we just want to make sure we
make the rest of the outline go around
the rest of the blue shape because we're
going to subtract it okay so let's
change the color of that and again we're
going to select this little shape we
made here and this is blue and subtract
okay i'm going to press ctrl one to zoom
out and we have some pretty decent
looking hair I'm going to do the other
side we're going to kind of follow the
same steps now problem is we might have
this piece up here the hair is going to
be going more upwards what I mean is let
me try to draw it not with that color
how about black the hair is going to be
kind of going like this but the hair
down here is going to be falling like
that so it's okay if you keep these
shapes separate otherwise you could just
join them so with this we have three
colors total so i'll start with orange
which will go i'm just going to draw a
custom shape with my pen tool I'm going
to start behind the hedges so I'm
certain that I'm covering everything
just kind of drag it like so and click
and it's okay if you go over the line
here a little bit because you know
hair's not like perfectly round or
anything like I had
okay i'm going to press the letter I
which is my little pent my dropper tool
get the orange color and arrange send to
back oops little too far so I'm going to
press ctrl and the right bracket let me
type that out in case you didn't see it
ctrl + fat that's the hot key to move
something forward a step at a time on
the Mac I'm not sure but it might be
command + that something like that i
don't i don't use a mac so not really
sure and we're going to do the other
piece for the blue hair and I'll just go
then we go to the ear here make it a
little different okay looks like I
didn't start this point deep enough let
me delete that and redo it so I'm going
to start down here and kind of go like
that click and close off this shape and
again I'll select my I tool boom and I'm
going to use control in the left bracket
remember I just showed you the right
bracket I'm going to do it the other way
around click that a few times until it
shows up here so I can hold alt and zoom
out so with this piece of hair you know
it looks like we could actually merge
these shapes just so that we get a easy
cooperation when we subtract otherwise
so I'll unite those and we're just going
to kind of disregard this piece up here
so what I'm going to do is control C for
copy and ctrl f control f and I can drag
these over drag these over and i'll go
ahead and change the color i'm going to
put the orange one to the front because
that's the one we're going to remove so
it looks like the blue should be on the
end because it's
well I'm not totally certain if it
should or shouldn't but that's what I'll
do and we're going to kind of follow the
same idea the blues going to have some
thickness right here so maybe I want to
move this down a little bit and for this
one let's drag this all the way over
there we go and since blues going to be
on the outside perhaps i'll make it a
little bit thinner and i normally would
you know something like that just kind
of random so we can select both of these
and once again subtract and looks like I
got a little extra line there so I'm
going to get my little white pointer out
and delete that okay so let's select our
shape again press the letter I and get
the color back to our pointer and let's
move this over here and I'm going to
press my control right bracket key until
I get what I want whoops right there and
you see that's overlapping the green a
little bit we're going to have to make a
little cut so I could just make a square
over the hair there select both of these
subtract and it looks like we have to
move it back once more okay and the
orange is going to be in the very back
this one will be quite easy really the
same thing I'm just gonna sorry let me
do that a little slower so you know what
i did i was holding the alt key and I
just started dragging this kind of maybe
an easier way depends on what you like
doing and I'm going to do the same thing
with the alt key held down i'm just
going to drag up a little bit and i kind
of want the hair to be a little thicker
in the back as in i want it to kind of
start and go like this whoops kind of
like that rather than just some thin
little strip
okay i'll leave that line there okay
sorry i had to sneeze and pause the
video so we have two shapes here let me
change the color of this top one so we
can see what we're working with and you
can see I want to kind of move the shape
there let's see how can we do this looks
like this little handle up here probably
something like that and I'll go ahead
and select these subtract I can delete
this line here and we really don't need
this top piece you could leave it there
if you wanted but really I don't need it
so I'm just going to subtract that as
well oops what has happened oh we got an
extra little piece here sometimes that
can mess up your subtractions make sure
to delete that and select and delete and
I'm going to press I once again to get
my little eyedropper get the little
pretty hair and we're going to move this
right down in there and with the control
bracket once again you've moved to back
now to color the hair this could be a
little tricky I think I'm just going to
do a gradient really and to do that we
could go to the gradient icon which is
right here if you have this on there or
let's see if it's under window gradient
open that up and I'll just click this
gray color and to use gradients I have a
couple tutorials on here but let's say I
go to swatches and I will guess I'll
take a blue to a oops
light blue okay it's a linear gradient
so it goes from top to bottom I actually
like how this looks so I'm going to
leave it like that now for the
Greenpeace I'm just going to click this
blue and we're going to use green but we
just got to change the colors I'm just
kind of picking random colors see that
doesn't stand out enough to me so maybe
have a yellowish color and that green
just doesn't look that right I think
we're going to try pink pink to maybe
pink to purple might look kind of cool
and let's change the gradient with the
gradient tool real quick it doesn't look
terrible and lastly the orange will
repeat the same process now I don't know
what the ponies actually are supposed to
look like exactly but I just looked at a
couple images and thought hey let's do
it okay and then we can get back to our
black pointer click via hair I'll press
I and copy that and with the green one
it was the purple and what's the blue
one it was the blue and you know you
could adjust these gradients any way you
like you could even make them radial
make a more detailed that looks kind of
silly what I want to do is also add
black lines around here so what i could
do is this add a stroke since this
little character it has an outline i'm
going to add a black stroke of two
pixels three because that's the width of
my little character there now in my
example you zoom in and you can see this
line here all right there
and that is coming from a little blue
piece so i'm not i'm not going to get
all picky about that at the moment so
let's just add a stroke to this a stroke
to this i'll just select all three of
these and add a stroke make sure you got
the little outline box selected and what
these three selected i'll just go up up
and with this selected this one doesn't
have one stroke up up and the purple
needs up up okay and it looks like on
that circle in the background I guess
this piece and this piece they could
both use a stroke boom boom and it's not
too bad of a looking pony I'll fix this
little gap here before I let this file
be downloadable I hope this helped you
get a general idea on making some hair
if you really wanted to make it really
detailed in a lot better you could get
rid of these strokes if you wanted you
could also do something like this let's
say I grab my pen tool I'm going to get
rid of my stroke and I'm just going to
make kind of a shade right here
ok and I'm going to move this back
behind the head gonna make it black
looks a little silly right now but we
can always go to window transparency I
guess that's open where would that be
it's right down here on my screen and we
could change the opacity so it's like a
little more cartoony shade we could do
the same thing down here on to the
purple you know I'm going to make this
go on to the orange to boom and send it
back ok and transparency let's dim it up
a little and if I were to zoom out it
looks a little like it has a little more
depth so that's the gist of it thanks
for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
