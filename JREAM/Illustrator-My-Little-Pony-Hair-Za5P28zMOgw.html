for a tutorial to draw the hair on a g4
pony which has My Little Ponies I don't
know much about the show I just look for
kind of a picture and made an outline of
a pony's head this is supposed to be a
horn right here and what we're going to
do is draw the hair which is the tricky
part I'll provide this video or this
file for download in my description if
you'd like and I guess we can get
started I've locked this layer by
pressing ctrl - so you know I can't
select anything and what I think I'm
gonna do is draw a kind of hair coming
out over the little pony's mane I'm
gonna start with a square and you could
do a lot of this with the pen tool but
we can get away with some things using
the warp warp can come in handy quite a
bit and I'm gonna check out flag and
always turn the preview on and I want
this to be vertical and bend it up a
little bit more okay now you might not
always get the desired result you want
but we can always modify that so press
ok and I'm going to expand this object
so I can actually edit it go to object
expand appearance it's good and this is
gonna kind of be tucked behind his ear
so what I'm going to do is actually with
the pen tool select the minus one delete
Anchor Point or press the minus key and
I'm gonna delete this one point here
look at that it didn't it deleted the
outline I'm just gonna delete that whole
outline there won't delete that there we
go and now we have kind of a little wave
here and what I want to do is tuck it
behind the ear and I'm just gonna hold
ctrl alt and use my mouse wheel to zoom
in and then spacebar to pan around and
it's it's not gonna be perfect but just
like make it touch the ear
and ctrl alt to zoom back out now what
I'm gonna do is kind of move this over a
little bit so with my white mouse arrow
I selected I'm just gonna click so
nothing selected and select these two
points over here and hold shift and use
my keyboard to kind of move the hair
away it is going kind of over the eye I
don't want that so perhaps I could
stretch this Anchor Point down a little
bit maybe a little bit more it looks
pretty good okay we'll get to more
detail shortly
she I guess it's gonna be a girl's also
gonna have some hair coming over to this
side and I think I'm gonna do a shape so
it's gonna be a circle now what you have
to try to imagine is look between the
horn and the ear what I'm doing is I'm
just kind of creating a circle that goes
up and the rest of that's gonna be
ignored okay so like boom and I'm gonna
right click arrange and hopefully you
can see this on my screen I pick send to
back okay
and this part right here where this
curve is we're also gonna make that kind
of a piece of hair and I think we can
get away with using this curve because
it's pretty attractive so before I make
the curve for this piece of hair I'm
actually going to finish the bottom of
this one and to do that I think I might
just use my pen tool make sure you don't
have your minus one selected and their
hair kind of goes in a little curl my
well I think I'll make a bigger Ark kind
of like that and then click the little
dot to get rid of that line and we got
to find the point where the hair begins
and there it is like that so it might
take a little bit of manual editing and
you notice I didn't close this path
that's because I'm gonna select these
two and open my Pathfinder window
Pathfinder and with those two selected
I'm going to merge and look at that we
got one nice solid piece of hair so what
I can do now is click this piece of hair
hold the Alt key so you see the double
arrows and drag it on over and what I'm
gonna do is mirror it so you might have
this little icon it's the rotate if you
press R you'll get to it but you want to
hold this down and go to reflect and
just click somewhere to make the point
where you want to reflect it and then
just start dragging around I'm gonna
hold the shift key so that I well that's
not gonna look exactly how I want it I
guess I'll do it manually boom okay and
we also want to send this to back
arrange send to back okay so this looks
a little silly at the moment what I can
do is move it up a little bit maybe
rotate it so that it goes well with this
curve here or I could just overlap it to
take over that curve that doesn't look
too bad
now this hair is kind of wacky and it's
going all over the place so I think what
I'm gonna do is select the white arrow
and select the point here I'm gonna hold
shift and make sure I got that point
also and try to move it over just a
little bit
and I think I'm gonna do it with these
boom-boom maybe move this one in a
little bit also boom-boom and stretch
the handles you know it's up to you how
how precise you want it to look at
everything so now we have a basic
outline for the hair what we're gonna do
now is add some colors into it and
there's there's really a lot of ways you
could go about this I'm gonna try to do
this in a hopefully and easy to do way
so what I would do is click this piece
of hair and press ctrl F I believe
that's this one paste in front okay boom
now it looks like nothing happened but
in reality if you move this over well
something's supposed to happen
edit copy edit paste in front let's try
that again okay you have to copy it
first and paste in front sorry about
that so we have a copy sitting on top of
this and I'm actually gonna do that one
more time
edit paste in front and what I can
really do is just drag these over so
that you can see them and I'll change
the color whoops not the outline okay
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
make a stripe out of the piece of hair
so if I drag this over here like so I'm
going to do arrange bring to front and
the stripes not gonna go all the way
down on this piece of hair we could
manually bend this down why don't we do
that just because you might want to if I
wanted to bend this down a little more
and change this arc like so and then
what we'll do is select both of these
and subtract okay
and I'll change the color this real
quick I can drag this over here make
sure it's lined up and we have a nice
stripe there I'm gonna do a stripe for
the side as well so I'm going to kind of
do the same thing ctrl C which is the
hotkey for copy and then ctrl F ctrl F
okay again it looks like nothing
happened but let's drag these over if
you're on a Mac it's probably the
command key and the letter C and the
command key and the letter F so just
pick a random color so we can see what
we're doing and we want to bring this
one to the front this is the piece that
we're gonna be subtracting arrange bring
to front and this piece is gonna be on
the side okay and actually like how this
stripe kind of looks the only issue is
that this stripe is going to go straight
into this one and it's gonna look funny
I'll show you what I mean let me
subtract these so boom and we got a
little extra piece over there so let's
select our white arrow and select that
and delete okay so if I move this over
here and change the color to kind of a
blue you can see how it really shouldn't
interfere with that thing there we want
the hair to go all in one direction so
it looks kind of cool go ahead and zoom
in and I'm just gonna make a manual kind
of a curvy shape so I'll start from say
this point here and maybe go up to here
and make a little curve like that and
then we just want to make sure we make
the rest of the outline go around the
rest of the blue shape because we're
going to subtract it okay so let's
change the color of that and again we're
going to select this little shape we
made here and this is blue
and subtract okay I'm gonna press
control 1 to zoom out and we have some
pretty decent looking hair I'm gonna do
the other side we're gonna kind of
follow the same steps now problem is we
might have this piece up here the hair
is gonna be going more upwards what I
mean is let me try to draw it not with
that color how about black the hair's
gonna be kind of going like this but the
hair down here is gonna be falling like
that so it's okay if you keep these
shapes separate otherwise you could just
join them so with this we have three
colors total so I'll start with orange
which will go I'm just gonna draw a
custom shape with my pen tool I'm gonna
start behind the head just so I'm
certain that I'm covering everything
just kind of drag it like so and click
and it's okay if you go over the line
here a little bit cuz you know hair's
not like perfectly round or anything
like I had okay I'm gonna press the
letter I which is my little pen in my
dropper tool get the orange color and
arrange send to back
oops a little too far so I'm going to
press ctrl + a right bracket let me type
that out in case you didn't see it
ctrl + fat that's the hotkey to move
something forward a step at a time on
the Mac I'm not sure but it might be
command + that something like that I
don't I don't use a Mac so not really
sure and we're gonna do the other piece
for the blue hair and I'll just go I'm
gonna go to the ear here make it a
little different okay looks like I don't
start this point deep enough let me
delete that and redo it so I'm gonna
start down here yeah kind of go like
that click and close off this shape and
again I'll select my eye tool boom and
I'm gonna use ctrl in the left bracket
remember I just showed you the right
bracket I'm gonna do it the other way
around click that a few times until it
shows up here so I can hold alt and zoom
out so with this piece of hair you know
it looks like we could actually merge
these shapes just so that we get a easy
cooperation when we subtract otherwise
so I'll unite those and we're just gonna
kind of disregard this piece up here so
what I'm gonna do is ctrl C for copy and
ctrl F ctrl F and I can drag these over
drag these over and I'll go ahead and
change the color I'm gonna put the
orange one to the front because that's
the one we're gonna remove so it looks
like the blue should be on the end
because it's wow I'm not totally certain
if it should or shouldn't but that's
what I'll do and we're going to kind of
follow the same idea the blues gonna
have some thickness right here so maybe
I want to move this down a little bit
and for this one let's drag this all the
way over
there we go and since blues gonna be on
the outside perhaps I'll make it a
little bit thinner and I normally would
you know something like that just kind
of random so we can select both of these
and once again subtract and it looks
like I got a little extra line there so
I'm gonna get my little white pointer
out and delete that okay
so let's select our shape again press
the letter i' and get the color back to
our pointer and let's move this over
here and i'm gonna press my control
right bracket key until I get what I
want
oops right there and you see that's
overlapping the green a little bit we're
gonna have to make a little cut so I
could just make a square over the hair
there just like both of these subtract
and it looks like we have to move it
back once more okay and the orange is
gonna be in the very back this one will
be quite easy really the same thing I'm
just gonna sorry let me do that a little
slower so you know what I did I was
holding the Alt key and I just started
dragging this kind of maybe an easier
way depends on what you like doing and
I'm gonna do the same thing with the Alt
key held down I'm just gonna drag up a
little bit and I kind of want the hair
to be a little thicker in the back as in
I want it to kind of start and go like
this
whoops kind of like that rather than
just some thin little strip okay I'll
leave that line there okay sorry I had
to sneeze and pause the video so we have
two shapes here let me change the color
of this top one so we can see what we're
working with and you can see I want to
kind of move the shape there let's see
how can we do this looks like this
little handle up here
probably something like that and I'll go
ahead and select these subtract I can
delete this line here and we really
don't need this top piece you could
leave it there if you wanted but really
I don't need it so I'm just gonna
subtract that as well oops what has
happened oh we got an extra little piece
here sometimes that can mess up your
subtractions make sure to delete that
and select and delete and I'm gonna
press I once again to get my little
eyedropper get the little pretty hair
now we're gonna move this right down in
there and with the control bracket once
again you've moved it back now to color
the hair this could be a little tricky I
think I'm just gonna do a gradient early
and to do that we could go to the
gradient icon which is right here if you
have this on there or let's see if it's
on our window gradient open that up and
I'll just click this gray color and to
use gradients I have a couple tutorials
on here but let's say I go to swatches
and I will guess I'll pick a blue to a
oops
like blue okay it's a linear gradient so
it goes from top to bottom I actually
like how this looks so I'm gonna leave
it like that now for the green piece I'm
just gonna click this blue and we're
gonna use green but we just got to
change the colors I'm just kind of
picking random colors see that doesn't
stand out enough to me so maybe have a
yellowish color and that green just
doesn't look that right I think we're
gonna try pink pink too
maybe pink the purple might look kind of
cool and let's change the gradient with
the gradient tool real quick
it doesn't look terrible and lastly the
orange will repeat the same process now
I don't know what the pony's actually
are supposed to look like exactly but I
just looked at a couple images and
thought hey let's do it okay and then we
can get back to our black pointer click
via hair I'll press I and copy that and
with the green one it was the purple and
what's the blue one it was the blue and
you know you could adjust these
gradients any way you like you could
even make them radial make them more
detailed that looks kind of silly what I
want to do is also add black lines
around here so what I could do is this
add a stroke since this little character
it has an outline I'm gonna add a black
stroke of 2 pixels 3 because that's the
width of my little character there now
in my example you zoom in and you can
see this line here right there
and that is coming from a little blue
piece so I'm not I'm not gonna get all
picky about that at the moment so let's
just add a stroke to this a stroke to
this I'll just select all three of these
and add a stroke make sure you got the
little outline box selected and what
these three selected I'll just go up up
and with this selected oh this one
doesn't have one stroke up up and the
purple needs up up okay and it looks
like on that circle in the background
I guess this piece and this piece they
could both use a stroke boom boom and
it's not too bad of a looking pony I'll
fix this little gap here before I let
this file be downloadable I hope this
helped you get a general idea on making
some hair if you really wanted to make
it really detailed and a lot better you
could get rid of these strokes if you
wanted you could also do something like
this let's say I grab my pen tool you
gotta get rid of my stroke and I'm just
gonna make kind of a shade right here
okay and I'm gonna move this back behind
the head
gonna make it black looks a little silly
right now but we can always go to window
transparency
I guess that's open oh where would that
be it's right down here on my screen and
we could change the opacity so it's like
a little more cartoony shade we could do
the same thing down here on to the
purple you know I'm gonna make this go
on to the orange to boom and send it
back okay and transparency let's dim it
up a little and if I were to zoom out it
looks a little like it has a little more
depth so that's the gist of it thanks
for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
