while I'm a busy man these days but my
new love is falcon PHP have been
studying it for about a month
quite a bit and trying to build some
projects with it just for practice and
this is the best framework i've ever
used in PHP it is the fastest full scale
fully featured framework if you look at
these benchmarks but look at code
another according their to their
benchmarks which you can look at code
owners are still pretty fast but you
know Falcon it's a actual PHP extension
so it's ridiculously fast meaning you
don't have to load a bunch of PHP
libraries when you use it it's loaded in
the memory so basically it's an MVC
framework and it has a or RM looks like
they have something from Mongo - I
probably won't use that for now but
there are M is actually really nice very
easy to use and they have some tutorials
if you go to their documentation and go
down a little bit to the let's learn by
example and this is a pretty good series
to get started just playing with it to
check it out and then they also have an
application called invoke which you can
download from their github if I go here
and you can clone this code from github
just to play around and get it working
if you go to download it
they have Linux UNIX Mac installations
I'm on Windows all I did was just drop a
DLL inside my extensions folder and
added the extension my PHP I and I very
easy for Linux it's also easy you need
PHP 5 - dev package I use Debian myself
I switched from CentOS to Debian Ubuntu
is pretty good same thing as Dee being
pretty much
but you need a PHP 5 dev package because
you're going to have to compile the
add-on and it takes about five minutes
and then obviously the G C libraries and
this is all you do you clone it with get
in your server you might have to install
like get - cor or just get it comes with
Ubuntu and Debian as well by default and
after you clone it you just go into the
directory and do slash install and you
add the extension to your PHP ini file
which would be under slash et Cie PHP 5
and restart your server and you're good
to go if you're installing this on a Mac
it's a little bit different actually
asked on the forums so let's login with
or I'll just search for my question here
we go and this guy right here he just
said do it this way I don't use a Mac
myself they're too expensive and a
fellow at work was able to get it
installed doing whatever this does I
don't know what Bru is but it's in the
terminal and it looks like they have
another thread going on Mac amps
and anybody that's trying to install it
they can get going it's it's really
supposed to be very easy to install on
Windows it took me about 30 seconds on
Mille enix it took me maybe two minutes
to compile but depending on your server
will determine the speed but I really
love this it's makes your programs
really small you don't even have a
framework that's loaded in your folders
it's just loaded in the PHP memory and I
suppose my favorite thing is probably
the ORM uh it's just so clean and classy
and nice I'm kind of surprised this
isn't more popular
working with models if you've ever used
Django creating a model basically you
create your class and this is a
representation of your database table so
if you had a robot's table and say my
sequel and if you wanted the robots to
reference a different table you would
just say get source and return the
robots if your my sequel table was the
robots and their documentation is
wonderful there's so much of it I'm just
gonna fly through here down some ways
I'm looking for here it is they have a
nice little has many many too many
you're probably used to that if you've
used any popular or I'm but it saves a
lot of time so like in this example the
robots here it has many robot parts and
based on the ID of the robot table the
robot parts and robots ID it knows to
link to the has many table you know
there's a little bit of toying around
and all this stuff to get it going but
it's really nice how you can just check
it out they grab the robots they find a
record with the idea of to then win the
robots they can loop through all the
parts and it knows to associate your
table what I like about this probably as
well as that is that you can build a
directory structure any way you want
and you can also load the bootstrap with
whatever you want in it they have a
bootstrap let me find it there it is
okay and there's a public index.php file
and this is basically what you do to
register your directories and load up
any dependencies and you get used to
using this di which is a dependency
injector and you just set your views in
there and you really only have to set it
up once you would set up your my sequel
connection in here and everything
and once that's configured and you get
out how you like it you don't really
have to touch it and to handle requests
that's all it does this handle method
gets the route and loads the proper
controller if you're coming from say
CodeIgniter or laravel or something the
controllers are pretty much the same
they just it's a little bit like Zen how
they end with the word action so let me
go to the controller and you see how we
end it with action like that so that's a
route let me open up a little text file
real quick
so I can show you something what's cool
about this is it has a pattern that it
follows which you can turn off if you'd
like but if I have a controllers folder
and I'd have a models folder maybe a
views folder and then I would have a
public folder this is how they like to
design the layout but you can do it any
way you want okay so the public folder
would have our bootstrap file and this
is where our vhosts would point to just
the slash public folder and basically
this would load up all the necessary
things so if I had a index controller
you call it index controller PHP if you
had a model you would call it in there
example robot PHP and inside the index
controller if I had a method called
index action by default in the views I
would have a subfolder called index
which represents the controller and then
I would have a file called index.php ml
which would represent the method if I
had another action and I called it food
action it would be called food HTML and
if I had another controller called
animal controller whoops
and just index action like that then I'd
have a folder called animal index
HTML so basically just map zoom
controller slash method and you're not
forced to do it this way if you want
you'd have to return a view from the
index action for it to render this they
also have layouts in partials and
everything if you were to make an
index.php amount in the roof of the
views folder and you use the method
called this get content like in your
little each dedicated page if you have
that at the top of the page it would
automatically load this guy I probably
had that wrong actually this goes on one
of the pages that goes in index.php ml
actually or goes on both I don't know
and you can also use templating engines
they have one called volt and you can
rename your files to dot vault and it's
kind of like mustache or ginger where
you do a variable and pretty simple
stuff there and it has caching as all
man I'm gonna be honest I love this
framework it's so thin and it doesn't
get in your way and you can kind of go
wild with it you know what I mean
but definitely check it out I'm really
liking it and I'd like it to get a lot
more popular because it's awesome man
and it's open source it's written in the
C library ok that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
