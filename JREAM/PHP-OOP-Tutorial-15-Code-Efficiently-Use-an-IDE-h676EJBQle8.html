dream.com and this tutorial I'll show
you a little bit and that means it's a
good IDE and first let's make a new
project in PHP and it will be a PHP
application I'm just gonna call my
project test and I'm gonna put it in my
workspace folder and you want the name
of your project to come after the folder
you use so don't forget that so that it
doesn't just create it in the workspace
directory and the rest of this is
usually pretty good I just click next
next finish yeah so they give us a plain
old index.php file you can like right
click all your file all your files are
in the sources folder so if you want to
create a subfolder just right click that
go to new folder and let's just call it
libs or library and others say new PHP
class and I'm gonna call this I guess
demo dot class now be careful if you use
a period you see how this took off the
dot PHP here and if I remove that it
puts it back on so make sure you add
that if you're using another period and
I'll just click finish they give you a
little bit of code that's kind of junky
in my opinion so let's say we have this
little demo class and I create a really
simple method I'd say a public function
testing ok and we just include that up
on the regular PHP page so when you type
it also suggests code completion which
is awesome if you can't remember
anything it also tells you the
parameters in it and also the PHP
comments which are a little bit over to
the side not sure if you can seem
perfectly so I'd say require once and it
automatically knows what I want to do
and I want to require libs demo dot
class dot PHP
now a cool thing is do you even with
custom clash as you make it will give
you hints on all your methods and
everything so that's included so I'll
say demo equals new demo okay
and I'll type demo and it automatically
pops up with the methods within demo so
I could have another method like public
function blah okay I'm just kind of
hurrying through this okay and then it
shows blah and testing so if you're
writing custom libraries this is
extremely useful and another thing is if
you do PHP comments which you really
should it just makes things beautiful
Ida add desk for description and you'd
explain what it does this really doesn't
do anything and this will make it really
easy to pass along to other members of a
team or anyone across the world working
on your project so this doesn't do
anything either and if you had a
variable like let's say data and we're
gonna echo data you put per am and the
type in previous string and data and you
can put a description here if you want
sometimes you want to if it's confusing
most the time you should name your
strings so they're easy to follow mm-hmm
for example some people like string data
or if it was a boolean vln or int for
int those are just Co conventions and
you should find one that you like I've
seen other people do just I for integer
B for boolean asks for string
and so on like that you know one guy no
he uses a t for arrays because that
actually stands for like a table anyways
so we go back here and if I do demo now
you see the description shows up here
and I can click over testing and if
you're working with a foreign library or
anything it can become really easy to
figure out what you need to put in here
and what it does obviously this these
methods are not very complex or nor do
they do anything but you can kind of get
the idea from that another thing that's
really nice is instant code validation
let me just make a block I think you
just saw it was that red line so if I
say eg you know it's telling me hey I
got a syntax error so you don't need to
save the file and then parse it and find
your errors there all the time
it also has cold hinting I think it's a
control space no not code hinting
there's just a function list so test
control space no suggestion okay control
space brings up suggestions anyways you
get the idea it's a really good IDE to
use there's just a lot to this and you
can do tools options and then go up to
your editor and change your formatting I
don't like cold code folding very much
but there's a couple in here you might
want to toggle on like a number of
spaces per indent
I actually prefer tabs because if you
have spaces I find it kind of irritating
see how I hit tab there now if I scroll
backwards these are all spaces alright
that's enough for this video thanks for
