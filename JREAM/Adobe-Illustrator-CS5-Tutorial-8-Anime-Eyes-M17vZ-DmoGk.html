we're gonna make an eye kind of like a
cartoon eye or enemy eye so you start
with a circle there's the pupil or the
iris and that's it
control copy or control C and then ctrl
F okay it looks like nothing happened
but then just hover over this and then
hold the Alt key and hold the shift key
and there you have a circle there I'm
going to fill that in black and get rid
of the outline okay for the iris or the
color part of the eye I'm gonna make
that green because it's my favorite
color
bust open the gradient and I'll drop a
green in there and like that and I'm
gonna do radial okay I want a little
darker okay
then bust out the gradient tool and I
guess it's up to you how you want it to
look okay and then I'll make a circle
for the white that kind of shines like
that and now I'm going to make the
enclosing piece for the Oh what do you
call it the white part of the eye so
I'll just start up here and then I'll go
down here okay and then I'm gonna click
this anchor point
now I'll line it up with here click and
I'll kind of pull that out okay
and then move this to the back arrange
send to back okay now just for fun I'm
gonna make a
big square put it in the back and make
it like a skin color and then I'm gonna
hold ctrl and press to to a lock the
layer now I can get rid of this border
so I can see what I'm working with okay
and on the for the green around the I
think I'm gonna try to do a dark border
and make the stroke inside it make it a
little thicker I think I want it a
little bit darker
okay and now for this piece I want
shading above the eyelid so I'm just
gonna alt click and make a copy I'm
gonna do it one more time and move it
just a little below okay
I'm gonna select these two pieces and
I'm going to subtract it then I'm gonna
pick the eye tool and select this
background color get rid of the stroke
and oh yeah that's a good shade of skin
color and then put it there and this'll
be above the iris okay and then for an
eyebrow I'll just use a square and a
dark brown for his hair color and I'm
gonna get rid of one of the corners so
it's like this and now I'm going to warp
it just do an arc then object expand
appearance
I'm sorry looking for it pretty good
already yeah and usually there's a
little bit of folds like a fat on the
eyelid so I'm gonna get the same color
as the skin here and you know just using
the same eyebrow piece it's good enough
okay there's a little fat there and
maybe we could do that down here also
and I'm gonna I'm gonna make a mirror
okay yeah it looks pretty good and then
lastly what we want to do since the eye
goes inside the head there's usually
some shading I'm just gonna break out
the pen tool and click from the corner
of this eyebrow to Vout down to that eye
down to here then the corner of the
eyebrow and I'm gonna make an arc to
fill it in and then move it back all the
way to the back and then maybe one layer
up now let's mess with the transparency
a little bit okay so then that kind of
looks like it's a eye inside the head
you could play with a lot of gradients
and stuff and if you want to make the
other part of the head I'm going to hit
ctrl alt to and widen this I'm gonna
lock it again let me get rid of that
border okay and ctrl to to lock it and
then I'll select the eye and press ctrl
G and that groups it so we can move it
as one item and then I'm going to use
the reflect tool hold alt and flip it
around and now we have matching eyes and
I think you'll know how to take it from
here thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
