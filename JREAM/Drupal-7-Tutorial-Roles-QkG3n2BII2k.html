tutorial I'm going to show you user
roles and to get to that we just go to
people and then over here we go to
permissions and what a role is is it
allows kind of like groups of people to
do certain things and by default you
have an anonymous user right here and
this is someone that's just visiting
your website and you can change
permissions on tons of things if you'd
like an authenticated user would be
someone that's registered an
administrator would be yourself and you
can really just go through all this and
look at what you would want them to be
able to do for example you can change
the way they post text in nodes
that's a another day down and nodes this
is once again our main content and we
can change what we want people to do so
if I wanted the authenticated user to be
able to create new articles I could
check this off so if someone's
registered for the site they can create
new content and if you don't want anyone
to see your site that was a visitor you
could uncheck you publish content but
that's generally a bad idea what we're
gonna do is create a new role so I'm
gonna go to the very top and this little
button here so the roles it's like a sub
tab and we'll create our own custom role
and this is pretty cool and I'll show
you how you could use this looks like
it's going a little slow oh boy
refresh
oh come on
okay it looked like my internet flaked
out for a second and so we're gonna add
a roll and I'm just going to call this
one clients a troll and now we have a
new clients guy again we can edit
permissions over here if we'd like and
this will let us edit all the things for
clients or you could just go through the
regular permissions tab and it will add
this column in there to give a client
user role more for permissions see here
there's the client area and this is cool
because I have a module plugged in I'll
show you this real quick this is a
pretty nice module where you can limit
content types by the user role so I'll
shrink this down and this and what I
have is called no privacy by role this
is on the Drupal site you can get it if
you'd like and if I went to structure
and I'm going to create a new content
type and here's two content types but
let's say I made one and it will be for
clients only I'll call this clients this
is a private area for clients and what I
want to do is change a couple settings
and that looks good and remember the
module I just showed you here it is
right here no privacy by role I'll click
to expand this and here we have
permissions for what we want the user
role to be able to do in this content
type and I'm gonna really leave all
these blank except for the view I only
want the administrator and clients to be
able to view these types of pages so
I'll go ahead and save content type and
here it is right down here what I'm
gonna do is add some content for the
client type so add content for clients
and I'll call this private area for
clients only and I'll scroll down a
little bit I'm gonna pop in a menu link
so it's easy to get to and I'll go ahead
and save this okay and here's a private
area I'm logged in as the administrator
what I'm gonna do is open up Firefox to
get a new session and let me just slide
this over okay now I'm in Firefox and it
just shows our home tab right now but
let's say what I call that private area
I went to private area and it says
access tonight because it doesn't have
permission to view this and we would
have to be a client type so now we have
protected little areas for us there
additionally I could go up to
configuration and right here in account
settings we can change how we want user
registrations to work I usually want
this off personal contact forms for
users I think that's just if you want a
really big site I suppose and you can do
this
who can register accounts I'm doing
administrators only because that's what
I want and then I can create a client
and he'll get his little email verify it
and so on so that's a basic usage of
user roles and I hope that helped thanks
