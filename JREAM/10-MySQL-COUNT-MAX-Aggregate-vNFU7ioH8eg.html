respect and when I came back to withdraw
I couldn't get anything hey what's up
guys uh in this tutorial we're just
going to do a couple MySQL functions
with aggregating data so open up your
little database here and I'll hop up
over here let me expand this and first
we'll do the usual used learning and
let's do select star from posts and make
sure we're all good okay there we have
it and for this what we're going to do
is use a function called count and I'm
going to do count star okay and this is
a function wrapped in these little
braces like in other programming
languages and I'll hit play and we get
seven now you usually don't want to use
count all and here's why it's a waste of
resources and if you go to posts in
different circumstances it might count
seven here from the ID but it might also
call us call seven here so that'd be 7
14 21 28 and what usually want to do is
play things on the safe side and just do
count ID which is the primary key and we
get the same result and what if we did
something like this select count ID and
select title
if we hit execute we still get one thing
normally this will cause a error if
you're doing it in PHP but what you want
to do is give count ID and alias because
you see the row name is count ID and to
fetch this like in a script it's kind of
scary name so well alias this is total
execute that then we can just grab the
total and you see putting title here it
doesn't list all the titles so that's
almost useless and to get all of these
titles listed with the total next to all
of them you have to do something called
a group by group whoops
group by and where we're going to group
it by let's group it by the title and
execute and we get the total for all
these this is called aggregating data
putting them in a group and if you have
a title that's the same name it's going
to be a problem let's do that let's do
select assign user because I know we
have some duplicates of that and I'll
execute and you see what this does is it
bundles it together okay so you can see
our I have five total of the assigned
user one in one of these there's quite a
few functions in here that you can use
we can do max which would be the maximum
ID let me get rid of the group by but go
over that if you don't get it
okay max ID is total from posts and we
have an error because I have a comma
here and execute and the max ID in posts
is 20 down here you can do min for
minimum and it's one but rather than
going through all these you can hit up
MySQL
and here are the aggregate functions
that you use with group by and we did
min max you can also do some which is
pretty useful sometimes here's the count
1 and let's go ahead and do the sum of
the id's and this should add up all the
totals of the ids so don't get some and
count confused that'd be a problem and
you can do typical things like AVG for
average and it gets the average of all
of them and divides it by how many there
are obviously you won't use this on an
ID field you'd use this on a another
numeric field so what if we said let's
just select count as total title and
let's see content and content okay and I
execute this and once again we get this
problem we need to aggregate the data
into a group so group by and I'll group
by title execute and we get all this now
you can also do order by and we'll say
order by um title group by I think
actually I don't know I don't really
know what I'm doing alright guys thanks
