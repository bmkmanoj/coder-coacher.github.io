going to talk about loops and a loop is
just something that repeats itself over
and over like see these numbers 1 2 3 4
rather than typing them out one by one
what you want to do is use a loop and a
loop can be used for a lot of things
let's just do an example of a while loop
case so we'll say a while true print 1
okay while true a while loop will always
go as long as the statement here is true
okay so what does that mean that means
it's going to print 1 forever
if you press f5 yikes I'm gonna restart
the shell it'll just keep printing 1 so
that's one thing you have to be careful
about loops here's a better example
let's say X equals 10 and we'll say
while X is less than 10 we'll print 1
but if you know it's this X isn't
counting so if we run this it's just
going to repeat itself or sorry x equals
10 while X is less than 10 let's make X
0 if I hit f5 you see it's going to do
the same thing so what you want to do in
your wall statement is say X plus equals
1 and this will add 1 to X so X is a 0
it's gonna say okay X is less than 10
I'm going to print 1 and I'm gonna say X
is 0 plus 1 so now it's 1 it's gonna say
it's still less than 10 do the same
thing and this is going to keep counting
up until you get to 10 and it shows this
number 10 times or you could print out
the variable and there we'll go 0
through 9 which is 10 or you could say 1
and 11 there we go
that might be a little more readable you
know you don't only need to use while
loops for counting so don't worry about
that there's also a for loop and
or loop it can do a couple of things
I'll first do a range if you type range
10 let's get rid of this help here
just type range 10 press f5 let's say
print range 10 there we go
it'll create a range of numbers in a
list from 0 to 9 which is 10 places and
what you can do with that is say 4 we
can pick a variable let's just say X in
range of 10 okay so it's going to say 4x
in range of 10 and we're going to say
print X okay and press f5 and this loops
through it 10 times and basically that X
is automatically incremented for you you
could do it like a for each loop in
other languages also you can say let's
make a list and say l equals um cat dog
and link and you could say for a in L
let me just call this animals okay for a
and animals and we'll say print a okay
and I'll run that and it prints out all
the animals and basically what this
doing is doing is saying alright we're
gonna say animals is going to go into
this loop right here and it gives us all
these and every time I go through this
loop a is gonna represent one of these
places
okay so goes through once it says cat
goes through another time it says dog
and that's really how loops work I'm not
sure this is well explained or not but I
hope it's good enough to get you
familiar you can also do multiple loops
I mean there's really no limit you could
say
for I in range of 10 and then whoops
will say for I in which use a different
variable for II in range of 5 will say
print dog okay
and then this one will say print cat so
this should print cat 10 times in print
range or dog 5 times so if I run it oh
boy I guess that didn't turn out how I
want it but you get the idea
guess player all the loops thanks for
