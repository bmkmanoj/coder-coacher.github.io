everything's treating you well and right
now I'm gonna talk about PHP 7 I've been
reading the RFC for PHP 7 a couple of
features time to time when I get the
time I want to talk about the scalar
type hinting which is very exciting for
a number of reasons this is about the
fifth time I've tried to record this
video so what I'm gonna do to shorten it
up is provide the installation
instructions for PHP 7 in the
description it's very easy
I'm not going to provide comic compiling
it because that's a lot of time so a
couple of things one I lost most of my
notes which is really depressing because
I had been planning this out so I'm
gonna kind of freeball it so give me
mercy so assuming you have PHP installed
at this point PHP 7 this is where we're
going to start just an index dot PHP
file and I'm purely gonna use the
command line interface and to know you
can type PHP dash dash version and you
see I'm using 7 release candidate 2 for
now and what we're going to talk about
is the strict types so the first
argument if you want to use strict types
is declare strict type equals 1 sorry
that's plural okay that even comes
before error reporting or mostly pretty
much everything and one thing you need
to know is there is no global declare
strict types otherwise let's say you're
using composer you get a bunch of
packages and they're not strict
everything's gonna break so maybe in the
future I don't see it happening globally
I think PHP is not going to become a
strictly typed language but it is nice
to enforce it
and you say why because it's gonna
prevent a lot less errors you know you
have a simple project or you have a
super large project if you're super if
you're simple projects just pretty
simple you don't really need to worry I
guess but on a complex project using all
these types is gonna prevent so many
errors and problems it's not even funny
because you're forcing the programmer to
use it a certain way what you define
with all that said let's go ahead and
just make a regular function I'll just
call this foo okay and I am going to
return a okay so a and I'll say foo you
guys already know all this stuff let go
foo and I'll just say - okay so PHP and
I just call the index right so
oh that's annoying but there's the two
right there let me do echo in escape
there maybe that'll be more readable
okay so we have a two there I want two
lines nothing special
now scalar types are these we have
integer boolean float float slash
decimal it is your boolean float decimal
and a string non scalar types are array
object whatever else
okay so whoops there's already type
hinting for this stuff now what I want
to show you is the they kind of
abolished a few things so integer you
don't use that in PHP you can use it but
that has become int so it's shorter
boolean has also become bull float I
think it's just float and string I think
it's still string but it might be string
okay so like I said I lost some of my
notes so bear with me so what we're
gonna do is we have strict types
declared what I want to do is force us
to be an integer and I'm gonna make B
let's do string okay and I'll just echo
B actually we don't really need to do
anything okay but so we'll run that
we're not passing anything here we'll
just say the letter S run it and we get
s2 so you see this is enforcing a string
let's change this to a five and we run
it and it says uncaught type error
argument to pass the foo must be the
type of string okay
that's exciting to me so when someone
else is using your code it's going to
tell you specifically what you
to have now this is already implemented
if you had an array of people the non
scalars and the objects specific object
names are implemented what I want to do
is in case you want you could do error
reporting negative 1 and that will
report all errors I already have mine
showing up so with all this said let's
do a couple examples and then we'll get
to the return values so I'm just going
to go ahead and leave that guy and I'm
just going to do a function called bar
and here let's do a float of income and
a float of death okay
and we'll do return income minus debt
I'm not a banker and I know this is
boring so I'll say bar let's say our
income was 12,000 for the day and the
debt was 5,000 for the day ok I don't
make that kind of money at all so we'll
run it and I'll shoot let me fix this
so we'll hit run it again and we get
12,000 and 5,000 now the question is is
why is a flow acceptable here when I'm
passing in what's seemingly not a float
this is just an integer so far it
appears it's just adding point zero like
that so if I did point one like that let
me clear this UCI I'm allowed to pass in
a float value let me change this to an
int okay and I run it and now it doesn't
let me so you know you can do that with
floats and ends which is pretty cool now
what I want to do is a return value in
order to do a return value let's just
copy this function here and I'll just
repay stit and what I want to do is
throw a return type and we can type what
we want to return the types so I want to
return a float I believe in this case
I'll change this to a flow okay so if
this does not return a float it would be
a problem what's this red guy here I got
Oh bar let's do bad okay so I'm going to
run it and
okay so it's returning a flow which is
kind of confusing because you know it's
point seven thousand points zero you
know whatever it's not a totally done
thing I don't know what they'll do with
it
with that said someone mentioned PHP eol
so it's more friendly that's the same as
a newline character so that's pretty
pretty sweet you can also do it with
regular functions so if I had a thing
like this let's say substring of 501
okay first of all 500 is an integer not
a string I'll hit up and run it and
fatal error expects one to be a string
now if I get rid of I'm actually kind of
curious this strict type and run it I
don't get that fatal so I do like that
strict type there obviously again let me
just reassure you a function foo Baz bar
I don't know what comes after foob as
bar for the sample names
how about VAP that makes no sense we are
going to do an array of dog dogs and
we're just going to return a string okay
so it's kind of funny
this guy here a colon after the function
and then the type you on our turn I love
it especially if you're getting the
what's it called a definition
I forgot what other people call it's not
a definition it starts with an A or
something so let's say we have dogs so
if not empty dogs or turn dogs I'll just
return the top one make it simple
because this video I don't want to make
it too long because this is just one
feature and I'm falling in love with it
deeply because I already know a lot of
PHP rather than learning the language
and I'm excited about it
else we will return it has to return a
string and dogs would have to be a
string by the way none okay so but this
this is nothing new this right here
however this is new where you force what
you're returning so I'm just gonna call
the VAP let me just call it pet that
makes more sense and inside of here I'll
say pika I'm not gonna spell all right
Pekinese Doberman I'll just call it a
pincher okay so my gosh echo pet so
we're passing Pekinese and pincher okay
inside this array here of dogs and it
has to return a string so that should be
correct I'll run it substring sorry
okay so we get Pekinese now what if
somebody had like a 1 here excellent
return value of pet must be a string so
this also I mean in this simple case
it's controlling what we're getting back
and what's going into it and that's
gonna make a lot more secure code okay
so let's let's end this this is the
fifth or sixth I don't know time
recording I know you lose interest after
a while but I just want to give you a
brief history if you don't know I know a
lot of you are already really smart
probably have college education x' and
maybe it would make me look like a fool
that's okay I don't care about being the
best so let me just say this I'll type
it out most c-type languages are typed
and compiled okay this would include C
C++ C sharp Objective C and Java which
is a C type language this one has an
auto garbage collector I recall okay
PHP however is kind of a C type language
but it's loosely typed
okay now typed language is a lot more
stricter so in a type language if I were
in Java for example I would say string
name right like that so every variable
even you have to declare the type so in
PHP this is type hinting in PHP we can
say you know var equals name that
doesn't make sense
var equals Jessie like that okay so when
you do type hinting it's not actually a
type of language does that make sense I
hope so lastly one benefit to a typed
language
is that when you compile it you will get
compile errors PHP is a runtime when you
hit it you'll know you get an error
which is why unit testing is good and I
believe based on the fact that this will
kind of sort things out a little less
unit testing might be needed you know
less rules to check you know is int is
var is blah blah blah because if you
enforce it in a strict mode your
functions and classes or whatever you do
is gonna work as well you can also
return boolean so let's run that okay it
has to we have an error because it has
returned a boolean so I'll just do
return true and false okay so that works
that sums it up guys sorry for the long
video and I appreciate your patience and
if I learn some new stuff or if you have
any other tips suggest or advice let me
know because I do read the comments I
just don't I don't always comment every
day because I'm spammed on a lot of old
videos having so many old videos not
spammed sorry just the same questions
repeated and all right take care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
