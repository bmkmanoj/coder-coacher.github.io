to show you a game I play in my downtime
for fun it's called continuum you can go

previously called subspace it's free and
it's pretty addicting so if you don't
want to get addicted don't play it

going to load a little bit and what we
have here is just our login screen my
favorite zone is probably extreme games

with my screen recorder going and you
probably can't see the entire screen so

hold alt I can see the entire map and
spectator mode right now page down to
pick a player and to pick a player you
just press control you can spy on them

happen to you

lot of bullets and I'm going to get on
team zero so i'm going to press the
equal 0 I want to get up in on some
action you can't see at the top I have a
health bar on the side if you install
the show icons you'll have to get used
to boys I've been playing this for like
10 years so I'm used to the old way of
doing it where they use test
and let's look into some traction the
yellow guys are on my team blue guys are
not and if you look down there come some
guys

little goodies for your ship they're
usually in the center and what they have
going on here

tries to defend them and take them and
that little yellow all is a flag if
they're not on your team they'll be be
just like you're so let's get some
action going in on here this little
green area on the map is the safety zone
