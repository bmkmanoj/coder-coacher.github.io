going to do some more Zen framework and
I'm going to show you how to create a
form through Zen framework and the
reason why you want to do that so the
first thing is go to your directory
inside your console you know just see
the data editor and wherever it's
located is where - and you know where
yours is because of the dot ZF project
and the first thing we're going to do is
create a form by typing ZF create form
and I'll call this register at some
point we'll tie this all in together but
we need to learn some of the basics in
order to use it and here I am in the
forms folder Zen D application forms and
I have my register file and this is
nothing but a form just like an HTML you
know input type equals text all that
kind of stuff and we create it through
here so these are separate from models
and controllers they're like their own
entity which i think is a really good
design decision cleans things up so the
first thing to consider is let me type
out a form real quick
in HTML you know we have a form action
equals the page the method is post
you should already know this stuff if
you're watching input type equals text
name equals blah and we're basically
going to make one of these and to get
started what we have to first realize is
we have a class that we made call the
application form register okay and this
name looks scary but I'll break it down
for you if we go to our sandy folder
first you go to application right here
then you go to form form I guess this
one's plural no big deal and register
and that's where this is located if you
see something like Zen form that would
be in the Zen library anything that
starts with is end and basically what
you're doing to find out where a file is
or why it's named what it is you could
just replace these with slashes and
they're like directories like C Drive
but we're not really going to do that so
Zen form we're just going to use this
object so I'll start with this and this
refers to a Zen form and we're going to
add element and I want to add a text
element like this input type equals text
and then we give it a name I'll call
this one email and let's add a couple
more let's do another text field let's
call it a login and this one password
password okay and I guess one more I
press ctrl D to duplicate that line by
the way this will be a submit button and
I'll just say save okay and we have this
component just sitting over here and
what we want to do is get onto this main
page and to do so we route everything
through controllers right so over on our
controllers this is going to be the main
page and that would be my index
controller and it would be under index
action remember everything ends with
action that would be an actual page so
I'll tab over and what I'm going to do
is create a new instance of this form we
just made so I can double click this
name because it's a lot to type and I'll
say form equals new application form
register and if I save that it's not
going to do anything right now refresh
and plug-in by name passwords what did I
do wrong whoops password sorry about
that so it's not going to do anything we
don't see a form because we have to
assign it to a view so we don't want to
forget that so we're going to say this
view form equals form okay so now the
form will have this instance available
and lastly I can go over to my views
scripts index index P HTML and I can do
a PHP tag and say echo this form now
make sure you don't accidentally just
say form you got to do this because
we're on an object and refresh and you
see I have these form fields here and
you might be saying what's the point of
this I can just type this all by hand
there's some benefits and I'll show you
it's because it has validation and the
filters a lot of good stuff
so if I view the source like this I have
this thing form and type how do I set
the action and the method it's actually
not that hard but it is hard to figure
out because the documentation is a
little scary to do that you would say
this set a trip and the action we're
just going to say how about save okay
and that would be like a URL that will
go to slash safe to set the thing to
post if it's not we can do this set
method to post and let me refresh this
and you see how I put the action there
and it put the post there if it wasn't
for egg type I think that might be a
attribute that you could set
nevertheless let's get to the fun part
the text we have an email here and what
we can do is pass an array with more
requirements to this and I'm also going
to show you another way how to do this
so if you want to give it a label which
is a name we'll say email and if i
refresh oops let me close that I have a
label up here and don't panic about the
layout that's just a CSS issue no big
deal you can do things like required
meaning they have to fill this in in
order to get a valid form post and I'll
say required oops true and we can do
filters
and this would be an array if we wanted
to add some filters like boy I don't
know any off the top of my head string
trim that's one I got a page open by me
okay
and you can also add validators
validators and we'll say array and we
want to validate this as an email
address now you got to get used to these
camel cases they're kind of scary aren't
they might want to tab this over got to
be picky when your code okay so this now
has all that stuff to it if we were to
submit the form it would go to the save
and we'd have to create an action for
that like this public function save
action and we're not going to do that
right now though I want to show you
another way of doing this so let me go
back you don't have to do this in the
array context like that and another way
of doing this is in object context
whoops what I push oh so I'm used to
being in NetBeans so here's another way
to do it which I kind of like I'm I
haven't decided yet I'll say this
actually I'll say name equals new Zend
form
element text and this will just be
called name and what we can do then is
do all the attributes and object context
like this so name set label will say
name add filter we can strip tags we
could set required to true oops don't
want culture on that oops how
embarrassing
okay I can delete all this stuff I could
do another one I'll say password equals
new Zend form element password and I'll
call that password it might be a little
more typing I'm not sure but in my
opinion it looks a little cleaner set
label to password and let's add filter I
guess strip tags again I don't know all
these filters set required to true and
we have a password and lastly let's
create a submit button so submit equals
news and form element submit submit and
the name will be let's call this Subba
so that I can show you why and lastly
submit let's just do set label to submit
son and if we were to refresh this we
get nothing undefined variable password
oops sorry
this is so embarrassing I keep spelling
it wrong refresh ok we get nothing and
that's because in the object context of
doing this we have to add it to the Zen
form here with this remember in our
previous example with the arrays we were
using this we need to do this
add elements and rather than adding one
by one would just pop out an array and
I'll say a name password and submit and
I can refresh and I have that good there
now I view the source here's the sub
element input type is submit name is sub
ID is sub and that's what goes in right
there so it might look confusing so go
ahead and rewind if you need to there's
a lot of stuff on the internet practice
that's all you got to do and then you'll
be like find out which way you prefer
making your forms and there's a lot more
than what I've showed you so good luck
guys and thumbs up if you liked it
