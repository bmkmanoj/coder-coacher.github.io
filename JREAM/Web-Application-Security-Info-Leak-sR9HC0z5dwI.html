a series for web application security
and the first one which is a basic one
is known as an information leak and this
has to do with bad coding or not knowing
a language thoroughly and what this does
is it reveals a sensitive data to the
user so that they could potentially no
more information than they need to and
I've come up with an example using just
a very simple database connection and
we're using PDO here and you know we
store our items in a string I have my
username and my super secret password
and the error is if we don't put this in
a try-catch statement let me just first
erase this bundle what we'll have is go
ahead and refresh and we get a PDO
exception access denied so this gives
away our user it gives away the
localhost but that might be known
already but also gives away a little bit
here it gives away my user login for my
sequel and it almost gives away the
entire password I'm not certain if it
will give it all the way if it were
shortened so I'll just change this to
super and refresh and it looks like it
does so potentially a person could see
your entire database connection info and
that's really bad you might be saying
well this will never happen to me but it
could if you decide to change your
database connection or if my sequel went
down this error would appear on your
server and that'd be pretty bad news so
fix to this and this one scenario is to
do a try statement and this will catch
the exception so if i refresh with this
it just says database error now what I
suggest the best way to handle this if
you don't know
language and all that there's a lot of
frameworks that come with different
things like production levels so let me
go ahead and undo that and there's
production levels like oops these are
staging and production sometimes there's
a couple in between basically staging is
displays your errors and production
hides errors but it logs them okay so
when you're going to production perhaps
a good idea would be to set an error
report on 20 so it won't display
anything if there's an error so I'll
refresh and you see we don't get that
error from the PDO exception rather what
we would want to do is know our language
pretty well we could either look at the
PHP error log time to time or we could
create our own log class and we would
just log exceptions here you know
something like that I don't know you
know a log class is very simple to use
throughout a system it'd just be a witch
imma call it I totally forgot oh yeah
static method so that's basically it for
an info link just watch your error
reporting and keep your sensitive data
sensitive and then you won't have any
info leaks thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
