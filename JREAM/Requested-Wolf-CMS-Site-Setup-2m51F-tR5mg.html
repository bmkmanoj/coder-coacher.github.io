how to build your own website and
customize will see ms I just have this
installed on my localhost and these are
all the files one thing you'll notice is
that I don't have my HT access enabled
so i just have the little ? things i
don't want a monkey with that right now
so to get started it comes with this
default theme and we'll just go to
question admin and login if you're
wondering where this theme is I don't
know if the frog or the wolf guys listed
it but you can download it in my open
source section on my site if you'd like
it so the way this is laid out is your
sites are based on layouts so if i go to
my homepage and i go to the Settings tab
and you see this layout it says wolf
here's non wolf simple Dada Dada what we
want to do is first create a layout and
we're just going to use wolf and rename
this to default and it has a bunch of
stuff in here you might not need to mess
with all of it I'll just delete some of
these things I don't know what they are
and the style sheet is going to come
from our themes folder okay and let's
just call this
test you could name yours whatever you
want and i'll call this style dot CSS
got to get rid of this print okay so
we're going to have a theme folder
called test and i'll go ahead and open
my files and i'm going to go to themes
i'm going to create a new directory and
call this test okay and then i'm going
to go in here create a new file and call
this style.css okay and that's where
this will be called from the themes
address next is kind of like the
structure of your site you know div ID
header a lot of this stuff I don't like
how its laid out so you know for a
header I thought I'd probably clear that
out your navigation rather than have a
separate navigation I'm just going to
put mine in my header this unordered
list there's a bit of PHP in this it's
not terribly complicated though all
right I won't get too picky about these
tats basically this just matches on all
the links on the root level I guess you
could say sorry what I mean this one
anyways and then it has a bunch of other
divs I usually clean up all this stuff
because I don't like it so I'd maybe do
div ID equals content and this will
automatically generate the title all
that good stuff
and looks like there's a whole bunch of
stuff I want to delete here you know I'm
not going to go into all these little
things here I really like things to be
simple so I'll close the div for my
content so I have my content here and i
have my header here i can go ahead and
very SAT and here's my footer I don't
like all these notes okay and this I'll
come back to this this extended part but
basically this echo content will echo
the current page you're on that once
content it's all safe and let me view
this site ok now it's now it's pretty
naked and what i would do is open my
style CSS and maybe do a body whoops
background gray and remember we made a
header we made a footer and we have
content and i will say um background is
white and border 1 pixel solid silver
just a couple of styles to make it look
a little more attractive and a header I
suppose I'll leave that alone for now
text-align equals center and the footer
mm-hmm so I'll go ahead and save this
case a refresh and you can see or
customizing this how we like so if we go
to our pages let's go to my homepage and
right now it's automatically listing
stuff you could always save these for
later if you wanted to use them or
basically what this is it's just listing
articles from what the blog and stuff if
we were the homepage I don't really want
that if you decide to delete it that's
fine you can always get the coat back on
the wicked
wolf Wikipedia thing and here is some
sample content okay and I'll just paste
some of this in save and refresh now I
have more of a customized home page one
thing I'll mention is that there are
filters and you can turn these on there
are what you see is what you get
editor's those are plugins and those are
easy to install I prefer using just
plain text myself so we have metadata
here and a breadcrumb is usually it's
not listed on here I guess I'll leave
that alone keywords description this is
for your meta content settings the
layout default is usually what you're
going to want to use if you wanted to
have a different layout with a different
structure you could always you know pick
a different one you know there's a lot
of settings here I don't need to cover
and back to the layouts under default
remember how I said I'll come back to
this here it says if this has content
extended echoed this content extended
and what that means is the name extended
would apply to the page we're on which
is let's just say the home page and this
sidebar would be one but let's rename
this so i'll call this extended and i'll
say this is in the extended area okay
and i'll save that so now we have like
another block there so i'll go ahead and
let me view the site and here it is
showing up right here but what you could
do is let's say something like this back
in our layout I could just adjust this
there's a little bit of PHP here just
nothing too fancy and what we're
basically saying if the contents there
we're going to echo out the content
but we're also going to echo out a div
so let's say div style equals float
right width is 200 pixels something like
that and we'll also echo out the end tag
for the div ii and i'm just going to pop
this before the content here because if
if you know CSS if you're floating to
the right it has to be before the
content you want it to flow besides so
i'll go ahead and save that and refresh
and there it is right there let me go
ahead and change the height just so just
so i can give you an example i want to
actually do it this way exactly but
something like that okay so then you can
have an extended area and if i go back
to my pages and let's say about us you
see this doesn't have the extended tab I
can go to about us and it just appears
like it's not there I could add that
here and say extended and blah blah and
save and I'll refresh and there it is
right there one thing I will mention is
that we first install wolf down here
your default setting usually on draft
and you can change that under your
administration settings and where is it
Oh default status I like going to be
unpublished so I'd save it that way if I
were you let's see so basically we can
also create pages that are hidden and
you create a subpage I just go to the
top level and say hidden and the layout
when it means inherit it means it's
going to inherit the parent so remember
the homepage that layouts default so you
don't need to select default for like a
subpage you want to be like the page
above it
and this page will be hidden status will
be hidden and what that means is that
it's not going to appear on our
navigation but it can be accessed if i
go to hidden and that's good like if you
just want to link some random pages up
for some of like the snippets what you
have is let me step back a second in our
layouts ok we have a header here right
and with a snippet what we can do is
just kind of make things easier for us
so if we had two different layouts we
won't have to repeat our header with all
this code like let's say we're going to
take all of this and go to snippets
header and just select all this and
paste and I'll save that and then here I
have to include the snippet so PHP this
include snippet header ok and I'll copy
that and I'll paste that
and I'm going to do the same thing for
the footer ok and I'll save and go back
to snippets footer since our footers and
headers will probably stay the same most
of the time and we can view the site and
it's it's the same and snippets are a
pretty cool tool for reusable things I
really like them you can create new ones
and get away with a lot of cool stuff so
that's a basic overview on how to create
kind of a real basic site in wolf you'll
have to work on the CSS and everything
if you go to files lastly under themes
test I'd also put a reset file in here
and in your public folder you can upload
all your images in the images folder and
I guess the rest is up to you have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
