breakdown of Linux permissions and if
you know this you'll be happy in life
so what we have is Linux open right here
I just have a bash open you could be SSH
den and I'll just type LS and I have two
files now I want to know the permissions
on these files so I'll type LS - LT a to
list the details so I'm just gonna copy
this here and paste it into sublime text
okay so these are the permissions here
this is the owner this is the group and
then this other stuff is like size and
then last modified and then this is the
name okay so pretty basic stuff there
and what we have our ten fields so if I
copy this or I'll highlight it you
probably can't see a but at the bottom
is ten character selected and basically
the way permissions work is you have an
owner permission a group permission and
a public permission okay and these all
have three factors to them what they can
do so xxx xxx and it's like okay that
adds up to nine but why are there ten in
here the reason is the first character
can be ignored it's just kind of like D
in that case it means it's a directory
so you really need to only focus on
these characters so
what you want to do is let's say I have
the owner Jessie and there's three types
of permission types of permissions
there's read/write/execute okay
and for a read these are in a decimal
format I don't know how to explain that
right now but it basically represents a
numeric value so a read would be a for a
write would be a 2 and M execute would
be a 1 okay and this uses decimals and
those always add up to 7
okay let's do sets so that's the mole
okay so they always add up to 7 so if
you had let's say 6 6 7 and if you were
going to add a 1 to this in decimal
notation this would change this to 7 0
because it shifts the number over okay
so it's always in 7s so what we can do
to understand this is basically let's
look at this one and break it down ok so
the first thing I'll do is I'll just
delete the first character because it's
not going to be relevant and every three
characters I'm just going to hit a
couple of spaces
okay so these are permissions and this
is for the owner you group and public so
what can the owner do he can read and
write
so here's read and write 4 plus 2 is 6
this also is read and write right here 4
plus 2 is 6 and this one can only read
one so the permission would be 6 6 1 or
you could even say a command like oh six
6 1 ok if you like to work in that
format let me do this okay
little funny so if we wanted to change
this to allow the owner to execute this
would have to become a 7 so if I did
this two seven six one that would change
this to our W X so let's go ahead and
try that I'm gonna say let me shrink
this over chmod that's modifying a file
and I'll do it to cat and I'll say seven
six one on whoops eats my seven six one
on cat you know LS that's LT a and now
if I copy this
I get the following I'll delete the
first character okay
and the last character is a one
I totally read that wrong read is a four
I'm sorry there seven six four seven six
four cat all right and there we go it
should look like this okay and it should
be an R so sorry I just read that wrong
the read here what's not a one I jumped
a little head of the gun you can also
put a zero in front of it if you want
you don't have to so if I did zero seven
six four I should have the exact same
result which would be here like that
okay so what what does this really mean
it means that the owner being me Jesse
as the logged in user inside Linux
should have probably the most
permissions meaning I can execute it if
it were say a shell script or a Python
or PHP script if it's and then if there
was another person named one like Jose
that logged in he wouldn't be able to
execute the script because he's not the
owner okay and we're putting all the
sudo commands and everything aside right
now just pretend Jose doesn't have that
power because you know we want a secure
system where people don't mess around
what you can do is have a group
permission so you see this is in the
group Jesse
so what I'll type is cat et Cie
password and here's um my username here
and shoot let me try group okay there's
a list a group if I just cat et Cie
group
I got a Redis group I'm looking for the
WWD there it is that's a common one for
nginx and Apache so what I can do is
chgrp of cat 2ww data and I put that in
the wrong order like that yeah I have to
sudo okay at LS - LT a there we go now
anyone that it's in the group will have
certain permissions based on the second
row okay so it looks like they can read
right if I wanted to allow the group say
Jose logged in I could make it
774 so I'll say CH own of Waco Siege mod
I'm sorry
Oh 774 of cat and we'll list it out
again and now what we have is this
deleting the first line
okay so now both could actually execute
a script because it has group
permissions to do that and then the last
one is public so let's say you use a
Content Manager or something public
facing you really don't want it to be
executable I don't know why you would
for any reason ever that I can think of
it's a file because somebody could go to
your website and if you had to say a
shell script or something there's
definitely some danger in there so be
very careful with the public one a
read/write is okay where it's six seven
seven six meaning you can upload files
but if you do execute 777 that that's
scary to me even if you're uploading
images there it just doesn't feel secure
so to show you all day I'll say chmod
you can do oh seven seven this time of
dog now LS LT a and I'll just copy that
and this one is 777 okay now that's rwx
read/write/execute read/write/execute
and yes I know that's done a lot in
WordPress and that scares me at the very
minimum I would do seven seven six by
the way I'm not a wordpress user I don't
like it like that
but executed like that is at least a
little bit safer now with all that said
there's a little bit easier way to do
something
so there's permission types that are not
octal which I don't use often because
I'm so used to the sorry not octal
decimal so non decimal modifiers so we
have all four owner group and public
okay don't worry we're almost done I
know this is kind of a boring topic so
an owner would be you a group would be G
and public would be a or all users okay
so those are modifiers and then for the
Reaper execute you can actually use the
let's do it read write execute okay
so readers are w.x okay so you can say
chmod owner - X what is that gonna do
oops owners you sorry
see I don't use this a lot see its mod u
minus X cat okay so I'll go ahead and
paste this in LS LT a and you'll see
here it got rid of the X there let's get
rid of the X for the group so we can say
chmod group is G minus X cat okay and
we'll just list it out again and there
it is so and then if we wanted to make
let's say public right let's do our W X
oops we need to do a plus okay soft
paste and LS LT a and at the end of this
we have our W X so basically what we're
doing is we're saying change mode of a
file type plus or minus RW x the
permissions okay so it's up to you what
you like to use I'm kind of trying to
turn more to these because they're more
readable and sometimes whatever so
hopefully that helped guys and thanks
