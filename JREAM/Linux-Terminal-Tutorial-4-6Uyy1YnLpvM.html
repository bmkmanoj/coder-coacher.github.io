our little Linux series we're going to
do a couple things here we're going to
learn how to output stuff into a file
with commands and we'll see what happens
from there so let's say I type the word
testing hit enter it's not a command if
I type the word test apparently it is
something I honestly don't know so if we
want to output like our own text into a
file just real quickly we could say echo
this is my file and we use the little
arrow bracket and then we give our file
a name I'll just call it Jessie txt and
I'm going to list Jesse txt and there it
is this is my file and you're like well
that's not our handy it will be handy
later on and I'll show you a neat little
trick first of all let me give you this
little tip when i type head j I didn't
type out the whole name i press the tab
key and it automatically filled in my
file for me and that's really easy to
use and you see that little carrot with
the letter C all I did was press ctrl-c
to cancel the command that I was doing
ok but I've gone over that quite a bit
so I'm going to make another file
actually let's do echo new into Jesse
555 and I did this on purpose because if
I list it I have to jesse files and i
want to show you that little tab key
trick if i say head Jes and I press tab
it'll only suggest up to the word Jesse
because now the next thing is either
going to be a five or a period so if i
type 5 and
tab it'll fill in that one it has to
know which one to do you can also do an
asterisks so if I did Jesse five star
he'll do that but that's a bit more
dangerous to use because if I did remove
of jesse starr and i forgot to put the
five here and i didn't consider that
this is going to actually remove all of
these to start with Jesse so you got to
be careful with that and no no actually
I'm going to remove everything in this
director move RF everything ok so let's
go a directory down and see what's here
if I wanted to list a bunch of my
virtual hosts I don't have any on this
server but if we pretended these were
virtual hosts these folder names we
could do something like this LS output
to route / vhosts dot txt and i'll go to
CD route it'll type head v host and it
just nicely gives me all the file names
in a text file pretty cool so it's not
too hard to output stuff into a file you
can group your commands and I'll put
those two for example i'm going to do
chkconfig check configuration which are
your system services so if i wanted to
just output the status of this line in
there this is a little tricky but i'll
just type the command again I'll do the
pipe character and I'll do grep which
looks for a line of text and type httpd
and I will output it
and i'll just i'll put that this into
abc.txt okay so i'll type head abc.txt
and that outputs um the file the
contents in that nice little folder and
while you're sitting here you might be
thinking what is check config it's
basically your system services that are
running and what's important about this
is let's say your server crashes or your
urge your reboot depending on the status
of these levels these are what will
automatically turn back on so you can
see I have httpd installed which is the
Apache server you'll most likely have
this well a lot of people do when they
use Linux maybe you won't anyways so if
I want that to turn on all the time
right now it's set to on because two
three four and five levels are on i'll
be honest i don't know what all the
levels do all i know is that for the
most part it's two three four and five
that kind of need to be on so what I
could say is check config httpd off and
i'll do check config
congrat httpd just to see that one line
and now it's off now if I go to man of
check config I believe there's a levels
command there is its dash dash level
levels okay sometimes you'll see it
written like this so let me do Q to get
out of there so i'll try a check config
that's one word HTTP d levels 01 01
level config- tlie not playing will
check and fig day and night that much I
just use the word on and off so maybe
that's what i'll just stick to let's say
check config httpd on ok so i hope i
didn't throw you off with the check
configuration thing sometimes it's good
to get a little bit of random stuff
thrown in even though it's not a full
explanation because later you like I
remember talking about that a little bit
the last thing I'm going to show you it
might come in handy handy it's called
the history command whoops history and
this is the history of commands you
typed in isn't that beautiful so if you
had like a long command that you
couldn't remember and you keep hitting
your up arrow and you can't find it just
type the word history and what you could
even do is look for something like this
you can type history whoops the pipe and
say crap and I want to look for
everything let's start with an L and
that didn't find anything it should have
what did I do wrong crap head okay well
there's my head commands I wonder if I
did Nana crap nano yep I did some nano
commands and it just shows a history of
commands ok cool I guess we'll do one
more thing and this will be relevant if
you're using linux or mac and you're not
using putty where your pre configured to
connect to another server if you wanted
to connect to another server what you
could say is SSH and then you need a
username so i don't actually have one
for this example but let's just say test
that's my username I'll say username at
and then the host your host could be an
IP or it could be a domain name as long
as the records are mapped correctly so I
could just say 192 dot little dodo dodo
dodo and when you try to connect to that
it'll usually actually for a key in a
password that's not a real address but I
thought I'd throw that in there with you
also i would suggest um maybe getting
something like a notepad and just
writing down commands or a cheat sheet
those help too because uh there's a lot
of stuff to remember and I'm always
learning something new but I hope this
tutorial helped you guys and have a nice
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
