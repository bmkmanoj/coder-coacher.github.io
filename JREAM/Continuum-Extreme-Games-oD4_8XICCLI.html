little game that's not too much to think
about this is a really fun game called
continuum it used to be called subspace
and virgin interactive used to promote
it i mean back in 95 96 and over five or
six years they developed more features
and now it's kind of open to the public
so it's fun to play so if you'd like to
play it you can meet me up in there i
mean they're a lot download continuum
and if you're running Linux you can
either compile from source or use wine
or you can use virtualbox with windows
XP in it so after you download it you'll
have this old-school looking guy so you
have my little continuum icon and what
you'll do is you'll probably have this
popped up first you would just want to
download new zones and make sure that
extreme games is in there because this
is the best zone and it's fun to play in
don't play in trench wars because this
is retarded and you shoot like one
bullet at a time it's so boring extreme
games is the funnest it's I'll show you
in a moment so make sure that that's
highlighted see how this isn't added
it's in gray I would click Add zone but
i'll go ahead and cancel and the other
thing is if i go to view options my
display i I don't have the main defaults
on like the weapon gouge and the status
bar which you'll see and my graphics I
turned all these on for you guys to see
the bullet trails and stuff I find some
of them abstraction because I've played
so long so these are settings that i
normally change but i'm going to leave
them as defaults so you can see and my
resolution i'll just play at a small one
so it records on the screen and down
here i have window mode checked off
obviously you create a profile which
just takes a moment and if your names
it'll tell you when you click play so I
have extreme games highlighted I'll just
hit play okay so this is just a welcome
entry screen here let me make sure i
turn the sound 0 music 0 so this is the
default and here's my guy right here one
of the keys you'll use all the time is
the Escape key okay you hit escape and
then you have all these items here like
the stat box this is the box here I like
to divide it by team but if I have
escaped open and I press f2 I can see my
name the squad wins losses ratio average
and the frequencies total points who has
all the flags and if I prefer a single
list and with this open I can also press
f3 so see name tags you can turn all
your name tags off and it looks bizarre
and you can turn them on so it shows
everyone's name tag but yours people are
warping out a center right now well
press f3 again and there's mine the
little crown there's just king of the
hill it's like a little side jackpot and
that spinning shield their means I have
the highest score in the zone since my
escape box is still open i can press
page down and make this less longer if i
wanted but you know it can kind of get
in the way the help ticker is really
annoying i would turn that off with f6
then f8 turns off the engine sounds so i
have all my sounds off right now and
these are your ships so with the escape
menu just hit escape i can press one and
i'm in the warbird and this guy's mostly
for you know doing good old stuff of
pro pro maneuvers and these little green
packages this powers up your ship and
this zone is it takes some skill because
it's one hit one kill extreme games and
I have visible thrusters and rolling
Ship on and all that and you see I
picked up something a couple of things
I'm going to press the insert key to
warp to safe and this um looks like a
repeal I know this is stealth and if I
hit home I don't have sound on see I
just repelled that guy and then stealth
makes it so you're invisible on this
radar the guys in yellow are on my team
and the blue guys are the enemies and
then the yellow chat is team chat and
the blue chat is enemy chat or public
chat sorry you can't see enemy chat and
sometimes they have these games just
going through here and all that so to
play you just use your arrow keys and
the control key is to shoot your bullets
it looks like i don't have my standard
weapons college on i forgot to change
that setting but that's how you shoot
there is a multi fire you activate with
the Delete key sometimes you have to
green up and another repel and then tab
shoots bombs and depending on your ship
they all have different abilities so
i'll just attached to some guy he's not
doing anything how about this guy and it
looks like they're in a zone right now
trying to get in and i have a brick on
the left looks like a brick so press f4
you get used to the hotkeys um and to
repel i press shift ctrl
so there's a mine it looks like it's a
team mind so it didn't repeal and this
isn't the best ship to be using in a
base because the bout the bombs don't
bounce that's a decoy once you play
enough you'll be able to tell who I got
killed I'll just reattach I keep
attaching to the wrong guy what I'm
doing is pressing page down and pressing
f7 so Omega Red and these guys I don't
know who has attaching to this guy is
two flags that's why there's a colon by
his name and the goal is to win the flag
game so i can type question jackpot and
say 3 million and that's a nice score
you can attach the people and just sit
on them sometimes they don't want you to
sit on them but you can do that it's
kind of fun there's a lot of commands to
learn but i'll switch to the javelin a
lot of beginners like this this is ship
number two so javelin and this guy oh
that's a decoy sorry that's not stealth
that's a decoy see and it's to fool
people sometimes you start with some
goodies so he shoots fast but you see
when you shoot it uses energy and he
dies easily and there's the spider this
guy can cloak which means to go
invisible and people can only see him if
they have X radar obviously I'm not
trying to play that well because I'm
doing terrible but his bombs you see if
I shoot a bomb it bounces one two boom
so he's good in bases and he shoots
really fast and they can shoot bombs and
bullets really fast at the same time so
he's good at rushing and dying basically
a kamikaze
I let to get to a flag base like if I
hold alt down you'll see these guys our
entire basis looks like there's four
main bases here and the middle is the
safety zone those blinking dots are
balls and they are to give you a power
up and you can make points with them
i'll ship to switch to ship for this is
the Leviathan and this guy is a bomber
ship you usually is really slow at first
until you get them all powered up but he
can see bombs on the radar if you look
down here you can see every bomb that's
getting shot try to ignore the Greens
right there looks like a mine but this
guy is good if you're sneaky and you say
you get powered up you can just shoot
from far away and then just run when
people are out in the open ship number
five is the terrier and this is pretty
much the dominant ship when you have a
flag in a base because it has the most
bounces the bombs do so I'll bounce a
bomb one two three that's kind of fast
one two three it hit the wall one two
three see that so it can go around a lot
of corners in these bases so if I'm in a
base like this you know I can try to get
around with a lot of tricks you can
bounce against the wall to shoot it
faster and stuff like that that guy
probably doesn't know I'm recording this
video I don't think anyone does so up
here is your energy dodge I'm really not
used to this layout so I'm going to quit
and then continue the rest of the
explanation so I'll just go to view
options and i'm going to change this to
text to text
and energy bar standard was the one
that's why I left it on subtle and
that's how I prefer graphics so I'm
going to turn it off how I like it I
like to turn everything off and accept
the Stars and it doesn't look it's cool
but that's how I prefer it ok so I'll
press escape and let's go into ship 6
the weasel once the Welcome banner goes
away ok and this little guy you see how
the settings are different my ship's not
rolling there's no backgrounds and no
bullet trails it's less distractions the
weasel has a lot of energy health this
is my health bar this little blue bar by
the way this red is just my framerate
how many frames per second I just have a
decent video card so it's pretty high
and you can still play with 60 and then
here's my thing on the side that I
prefer this way so I have stealth which
is home ex radar which is end and then I
have bombs 3 dash 0 and the 3 is the
highest level bombs you can get and
they're blue then there's level two
bombs that are yellow and there's MP
bombs and regular bombs this one has em
bombs so if you look the bomb looks kind
of like static those are regular minds
and you see how that looks kind of like
static and those this one will just hurt
yet this mine will hurt you and it'll
hold your health down for a few moments
so that's a good thing to have who's
this guy think he is he's got a flag so
he's read if flaggers have extra power
and his bullets are purple and bombs are
purple because they're level 4 and those
things kill easily alright so the next
ship would
the Lancaster 7 and this guy is good if
you're the front of the base and people
are rushing in so for example if I'm up
in a base I have x-ray tower on and
let's say people are coming to attack us
you can quickly drop all these mines and
when he shoots he shoots backwards not
many people uh uses that our beginners
because this one takes a lot of practice
but it's really good and he can shoot
multiple bouncing bombs it's just that
he doesn't shoot them very hard because
it gets pushed back you see that and the
next ship would be the shark ate this is
the last ship this guy is basically he
always comes with cloak so cloak is I'm
invisible I can't show you that on my
screen but you see he's highlighted
their enemies can't see me on the screen
unless they have X radar which is this
guy enabled and the only ship that comes
with that by default is the land cast
iron warbird you would also need stealth
if you want to be hidden on the radar
stealth is for the radar cloak is for
your guy right here so I'll drop a brick
with f4 and I don't want to use this
ship personally but I can spectate oops
escape s and then I can see what's going
on with all the players and just press
control then move my arrow keys now
these guys are trying to defend a base
ominous there has two flags pomplun the
bomber has four and that criminal guy
has ten and you see people are rushing
in to try to get in there there's Romeo
and it takes some practice but it's it's
pretty satisfying to keep killing people
so check out extreme games and I might
see you there
I will mention if I hit escape and press
a there's other arenas and sometimes
they have events to playing there's also
other commands and stuff that you'll
learn as you play like ? jackpot whoops
but give or go and look for a dream if
you're in there you can private message
to like / test and i'm messaging Romeo
or i could type colon r om test and then
i can press colon colon 2 message the
last guy that message me or you press it
again and it just flips through people
that message me and then team chat is
just a old is that a quote test or slash
slash test and then there's a different
chat in red that says test I just has to
do with your chat that's more like a
special thing all right I think that's
about it have fun playing and I hope to
see you guys in the extreme games peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
