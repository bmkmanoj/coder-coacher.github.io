tutorial for Python we're going to look
at the words break continue and pass
this kind of relates to a loop and we've
done a loop before let's make one let's
say for I in range of ten okay now what
if we just wanted to type this out but
not put anything in here
if I press f5 we get a syntax error pass
you can use the word pass like this it
doesn't do anything it's just a
placeholder so that will be
syntactically correct or if you had a
function let's say def my thing and you
know you didn't know what you want to
put in here you see even if there's a
comment it still won't work it there has
to be at least one thing in here what
you'd use is to work pass just mean say
maybe I'll edit this later press f5 even
though it doesn't do anything so let's
pass whoops it looks like my Python
might be crashing okay there we go
on now back to the other stuff we have
this here and let's just say print I and
if I run this I get zero through nine
let me do range 1 to 11 and I'll press
f5 and I get 1 through 10 so what a
break statement does is it breaks us out
of a loop so I would say if I is let's
say 4 we'll say break and this will stop
the entire loop okay and below this
let's pray type print next one going
okay now press f5 and it's going one
next one going to see it's going past
this if statement and once it gets to
four it prints for in this case but it's
saying if is four which is true and
break
got of this whole loop and that's good
if you ever need to stop looping over
something so in this is probably not the
best example let's make a list and call
us users and I'll just say Jesse Joey
Jenni and Justine okay and we're going
to say for I in users print I if I use
well let's just run that so it lists all
our names right and what if we had a
huge list this might not be the best way
to go about it but we could say if I is
Jenny will stop okay we could have
something here that would be like save a
file until we get to this user okay and
hit f5 and it would say Jesse Joey
Jenny save the file and break what
continue does is the opposite will
continue the loop which well it's like
the opposite of break you'll continue a
loop if you just go like this but
anyways these are just a couple of
tricks that you should get familiar with
mainly break and pass I don't use these
very much to be honest
alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
