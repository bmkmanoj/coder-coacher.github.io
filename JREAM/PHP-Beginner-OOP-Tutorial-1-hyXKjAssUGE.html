to start us out with object-oriented
programming if you've never done it the
reason to learn it is because it's
awesome and that's a good enough reason
I think and so object-oriented the
hardest part is starting out that's
going to be the very hardest thing to do
because you're used to procedural code
and procedural code it usually reads top
to bottom and you know once in a while
sometimes you have a nested function
inside object-oriented code uh you
usually have a bunch of you have a
hierarchy and things uh extend each
other and you know it's kind of
complicated to explain right off the bat
won't get too scary on you though so if
you've ever looked at object-oriented
programming you've probably done the
class animal I'll just do this right
here real quick with you and then you do
the brackets and you create a method
inside of a class you just type function
a name just like a regular PHP function
and let's just say echo one and this
would be a class and to use this as an
object we just say a new animal now you
should always put these little brackets
after the word of the class because
you'll find out later
for constructs and you want to assign
this a variable so just say animal
equals new animal now this looks a lot
different than regular coding huh but
I think we'll just jump right in it'll
be best and then to use a function
within the animal object so we have
access to the animal by this variable so
we say animal and we do a little arrow
there it's - greater than sign and you
just type in the name of the function
I'll note that these are also called
methods well that's what they are called
functions that are inside a class but I
usually get them confused with just
remembering the name right so don't
worry about that if you've messed with
the Python or Java or JavaScript the way
they usually do this is with a dot
method but that's not how PHP does it
now if you don't include these brackets
it'll be a variable so let me refresh
this you will get one now what if we do
animal name undefined property okay
since this doesn't have these little
parentheses it's not a method and this
assumes it's a property and the property
is PHP for you would type var name in
PHP five you usually just don't type
anything or type public public I'll
explain scope and everything eventually
but so we have name we refresh the
property is defined but it's not
anything so that's a general overview
there's there's really a lot to this and
you're probably going to get really
frustrated over time but that's really
how you're going to learn and you'll be
very glad that you did it's it's really
worth your time and once you learn
Google P I this also you can use a lot
of the same concepts in Java and Python
I think JavaScript
- and it's really worth your while it'll
just it'll expand your boundaries with
all programming you do from here on out
and since PHP is not a very strict
language I think it's it's good to learn
on here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
