how I've been quite a bit busy since my
lack of video updates and the reasons
I've been working on three projects over
the past couple of months so I'm just a
dream calm if you want to check it out
and just scroll down I have my three
projects listed here the first one I'll
talk about is the jQuery book and I'm
allowed to give out three of these for
free so if you post a comment I'll just
give it to the first three people that
post a comment to hate I want the jQuery
book however you need to make sure i'm
able to contact you like in the
notification settings otherwise you know
i can't even send you a link okay so
this book it's really it's a very simple
book for people that are kind of
familiar with javascript kind of
familiar with jquery and you want to
start doing some UI stuff it's really
cheap otherwise just under six bucks i
ordered a print copy because i never
published a book yes i ordered my own
book but uh it's uh it's a pretty good
book it's not super long it's supposed
to be super simple and i hope it helps
some of you guys if you're interested in
the topic on to my next one PHP beginner
course this is a call PHP punch in the
face I was just trying to make something
catchy and this is hosted on you to me
and it's not like YouTube it's kind of
like more premium courses this one took
me about three months to write sorry
record and it's been out for a while I
think five months maybe and basically
what this does it's for a beginner so if
you're a beginner it's not necessary to
take this otherwise it might help you a
whole lot because we do quite a bit
it's got like quizzes and stuff so you
make sure you know what you're doing has
about five hours of content and I had
fun recording it will even dive into
creating objects a crud class and just a
very simple application and it'll kind
of get your your ears tickled with PHP
if you're not into it yet it cost $15 I
can give away three of them so again
it'll be the first people that request
it you'll have to say what you want
because I'm going to have three items
nine total things will be free and again
make sure I can contact you you know I
can't give everything away for free but
this is just kind of a promotion and the
last one is PHP codeigniter I feel like
PHP codeigniter is more for the
intermediate or the people between
beginner and want to move to
intermediate in their skill level and
this is actually going to get you pretty
brushed up on JavaScript as well let me
go back PHP codeigniter and this one's a
little bit more expensive this one took
two months to record and I do work full
times so it's quite a bit of work to put
this in there but I really feel like
this is a quality course it's my
personal favorite put a lot of time into
building it you can see what we're going
to build we're actually going to build a
user login system and everything and
we're going to use a javascript to make
a Ajax dashboard with to do's and notes
it's in this play video is seriously
view it something you might be
interested in so if you're interested in
this one just post a comment and I'll
just give it to the first three that I
am able to contact sorry I can't give
out more
because I got a baby on the way guys and
I'm just trying to get by you know what
I mean but this it goes into codeigniter
understanding the model-view-controller
I know I've talked about that a lot but
I kind of made this video a lot more
quality and in this I use netbeans to
work with a project we log users in
register users create a whole API and
it's pretty involved so you know it
might take a couple weeks to go through
but hopefully it helps you a lot one
thing about you to me that I do like is
that they also have a section when
you're registered to a course where you
can ask questions back and forth if
you're having problems so it's a lot
easier than say YouTube comments youtube
comments I get a lot of them but I don't
like the way they're organized I wish it
was more like a forum with nested
comments or something but that's it for
my little promotion I know you guys
won't hate me I hope for this shameless
plug but I'll keep publishing youtube
videos I really enjoy it and I really
love getting emails when people when
people talk about how they learn
something and they're so surprised it's
a blast I don't think there's many more
things satisfying than finding out you
guys are pick something up for me and
that's not to say i know everything
either i learned so much from work and
other people so you know I'm not a
know-it-all at all but hopefully uh this
sounds like something you guys are
interested in and cool I guess that'll
wrap this up thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
