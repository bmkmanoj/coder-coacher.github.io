gonna make an Israeli flag it's a good
country and let's see it has six points
to it so bust out the star tool and I
believe that's correct okay and you can
hold control to try to get these lines
as straight as possible okay whoops
there we go and it looks like the lines
connect kind of to the walls so they go
like there to there here to here and
actually I might just be easier to make
a little octagon shape inside of it
that's what I'll do whoops so after you
get that star made pick this tool and
looks like
that's enough sides I'm holding shift
and try to line that up okay that's
obviously not lined up so I'll just move
it down and make it imperfect I'm just
trying to give you guys the idea of how
to make it you can move these little
corners right into the corner like so
okay boom boom okay and then we will
change the border uh let me just copy an
image off the internet and get that
color okay so that blue is kind of their
color others leave that up actually in
them for the border color will pick that
the same for this border color now let's
make the border thicker okay it looks
like the border is kind of coming out on
this piece right here so for the stroke
outside inside well it's kind of hard to
tell with this big border in it can't
really tell where it's gonna go I'm
gonna do it on the inside let me change
this to 20 okay and I'll just drag that
up to that point and then just drag
these on the outside points that looks
like I don't think I'd have so much
trouble with this little star okay and
then you can hit control G to group it
shrink that down by the way if you try
shrinking stuff and the size doesn't
scale you want to check this scale
strokes and effects okay and there you
have an Israeli star thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
