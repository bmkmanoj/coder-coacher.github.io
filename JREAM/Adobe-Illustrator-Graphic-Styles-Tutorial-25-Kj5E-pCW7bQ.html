this tutorial we're going to check out
graphic styles and you can get to that
with the window graphic styles or the
icon is this little uh I guess three
squares graphic styles are they're
pretty handy time to time so let's say
we're working on a human face okay and
I'll just hit x and d get back to my
defaults and if this was a human head
and let's say some eyes we're not going
to make this very detailed and how about
a mouth yeah so pretty lousy looking
right and if we wanted to add a gradient
to them what we'd go to open swatch
library skin tones and I already created
the gradient down here and I'll just
drag it up kind of like this because if
you're working on skin tones you're
usually going to want to use some type
of gradient and with the eye as we could
do a bit of a whitish blue and there and
I'll do a linear gradient instead and
discounter sure I get like that and
let's say some lips I will give them
some big red lips I want some orangish
red lips don't be too concerned with how
ugly this is I'm just trying to show you
how to use the graphic styles and let's
give this had a stroke sorry make sure
you click the stroke icon and I would
say pretty wide little darker and how
about a little border like that and
we'll kind of do the same thing with
this and we'll do it with a grayish
color and how about his lips too so we
have this what we do is we click the
face and this graphic style we click new
and that saves the face style and you
can do it with the lips
and the I so if you wanted to make
different heads and stuff let's say we
had a head here and you had a big chin
we'd group these together and how about
a about a real long skinny head
something like this and let's give them
both eyes will just make it real quick
and over here and how about a mouse ok
so to save your time you could just
select these two boxes go BAM select
these go boom and select these and go
boom so graphic styles can be useful if
you need to use them all right short
