on making a store with WordPress and I
know there's a lot of places like
Shopify and stuff like that and I'm not
saying they're bad or anything but I
found this to be a really nice solution
it's called WooCommerce W little ole
commerce it's free now I'm not
associated with WooCommerce and I'm not
getting paid or anything to make this
video I just thought it was a pretty
quality product so it's free but yeah so
why would they make something free like
this that's gonna be pretty cool so you
say because they have extensions to like
do a lot of fancier stuff that would be
pretty nice my favorite one would
probably have to be the stripe extension
and stripe is basically an alternative
to PayPal who ever heard of stripe com
it's ridiculously easy they have a
plugin for this that you can buy and
stripe only charges two point nine
percent in 30 cents per transaction you
do not need a merchant account
there's no well it says it right here no
setup fees no monthly fees no card
storage fees no hidden costs you only
get charged when you earn money you know
PayPal has services where you pay
monthly for a business account or
whatever and PayPal can also lock your
account if you don't meet their
requirements PayPal has been useful but
I think in next couple of years there's
gonna be these competitors like stripe
and Braintree that are gonna be a
serious threat to PayPal so if you were
to use a plug-in with your site like
Braintree or WooCommerce this is not it
by the way Braintree payments calm and
they're the same prices as strike if you
were to use this you just need an SSL
certificate for your website and those
run about 15 to 20 bucks a year that's a
year and anything more expensive for a
small shop in my opinion
very necessary so with all that said you
might be asking why are you telling me
about all these third-party integrations
the reason is I recently had a person
ask me you know I like this wool
commerce but I want people not to leave
my site to check out and that's what
PayPal does so if you use something like
the plugin for stripe the person would
actually you you'd have SSL on your site
and when they check out it would feel
like they're still on your site because
they would be and by the way stripe pays
to your bank account in a couple of days
automatically so what's this wool
commerce business all about let me go to
my WordPress area so here's a clean
WordPress installation and you'll go to
a WP content plugins and in this folder
is where you would download that's not
it downloads WooCommerce there it is
and the reason I have stripe is because
it was for a client I don't have a shop
of my own I want to know what to sell
okay so we have wool commerce in the
plugins refresh and activate it
and here we go now if i refresh my page
i'm not going to see anything up here
change what you want to do is install
the WooCommerce pages so awesome
not a refresh and now I have a cart a
checkout and all this stuff also have
products and everything so to get this
started let's first create a few
products I'll go to categories I think a
category is what I want to create first
I created a fake one here a moment ago
and I'll call this food slide I'll just
call it food add product category
oh it added it cool so then I'll go to
add a product and I'll call this jelly
beans
okay just uh it's almost like making a
post but then below we have all this
product data we can give it a SKU I mean
some of the self stuff you guys would
know better than me what all this needs
to be so some jelly beans I'll say it's
$10 although it says pounds we'll change
that and if you have a sale you can set
schedule which is it's really cool
very clean has this drop-down you can
group products and stuff but if I were
to make a store I'd keep everything
pretty simple
they have stock management so on this
particular item I could say I have 15
and every time someone by someone it
would say hey you're out of stock
it honestly blows my mind that this is
free it's it's a good product at the
plugin a bunch of other stuff here with
shipping and stuff I don't really care
about you have custom fields so if I
were to make one called colors red okay
I have no idea what that does to be
honest I didn't get that far in it and
then short description down there I'll
just say they are good okay so I'll
check off the food category and I'll
just publish it and when i refresh the
page it's not even going to show up
because we have to change a setting
which would be under settings reading
and it would be a static page and the
front page we would change it to the
shop like that Save Changes and the home
page this is if you would want your home
page to be the shop so now we have jelly
beans for 10 pounds it has settings so
I'll go to WooCommerce settings and I'm
in the United States
Florida so I need to change that and the
money this is all easy stuff you can
change wherever you live and allow
countries you could just allow it to a
certain country I'd probably only ship
to USA cause it'd be the cheapest and
that's where I live
okay a bunch of other stuff here that
you can just want to install it you'll
be able to look at all this good stuff
okay there's a catalog tab and a pages
tab and an inventory tag and pretty much
every option you're ever gonna need
shipping my main interest was the
payment gateways like I said there'd be
a third party where you could use better
stuff than PayPal if you wanted I would
disable check and direct bank transfer
because if you're selling candy and
someone's paying by check they're really
out of date and it's gonna take a long
time to get it and then cash on delivery
and bank account transfers unless you're
selling something really serious I can't
see a reason to use bank account
transfers and you'd also have to follow
some strict PCI compliance guidelines to
store bank account information so I just
have PayPal enabled here back to this
I'll just refresh now it's jellybeans
for ten pounds you can obviously add
pictures in the product no need to for
me to do that right now I'll add this to
the cart and let me just click this and
see what the actual product looks like
jelly beans 10 the short description
they are good the product description
these are really good and taste
fantastic and obviously it would show a
picture here now you may be wondering
well I think your site's really ugly and
it is it's just a default WordPress
thing you can change your theme and
it'll just fit work with it I mean
unless your theme was like crazy and who
knows what happened so I'll activate the
older theme in WordPress actually that's
the nor theme refresh and it's a little
cleaner looking I mean I really had to
do no work to get this going so I could
go to my cart and I have these items you
can remove them apply coupons you can
disable site-wide coupons in the setting
there's no need for me to go through
every detail there's I can't believe how
much there is I'll just say Jessie not
I'll just put some stuff in here okay
and you can pay with PayPal State is not
valid Wow
where's my state
Am I
Oh Grand Rapids Michigan how about place
order and then it takes you this PayPal
and this was all of what I was talking
about before right now it's in a sandbox
mode and I don't even have PayPal
plugged in to this to actually do that
you would have to go to your WooCommerce
settings and your payment gateways
PayPal and you put in all your PayPal
stuff here and you would uncheck this
sandbox mode once you wanted to receive
real payments but I strongly recommend
looking into an SSL like this SSL for
your site that's where the little
padlock shows up it's this little square
here this where you had your name is an
expensive one really expensive and you
don't need that for a small shop and
then I would also look in the like the
striped plug-in or the if they have a
Braintree plugin cuz those are cool but
that person's up kind of what this does
and I just wanted to bring it up because
if a lot of you are looking to make
money online you you have a lot of
options I know there's stores like Etsy
and a cafe press to kind of do the work
for you but if you were just making some
jelly beans which in the USA would
probably have to be FDA approved or some
comics or something you want to try to
sell them this would be a good place to
start
so that about sums it up for this guys
if you have any questions I'll try to
answer them all right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
