show you how to install Django using
lamp on windows because it's a pain in
the butt and you can use this with WAMP
really easily so the first thing you're
going to have to do is obviously you're
going to need python so if you don't
have this installed just download it I
did this one two point seven point three
and I use a 64 bit okay so that's the
obvious thing the next thing to save you
a lot of headache
once you have Python installed is you
need to right-click your computer and go
to properties to get to this window and
you want to change your environment
variables and you go to advanced system
settings environment variables and down
to path and you'd edit this so I'm just
going to copy this whole string and just
open up notepad and paste it out and it
might be easier to edit this way so I'm
just going to look for Python and you'll
probably won't have it in there wherever
pythons installed you put that there so
C Drive Python and then the semicolon
you also want to do it for the scripts
folder that's what you don't want to
forget when you're going to do this okay
because you want to be able to call the
scripts from command line so don't
forget that once you get all that you'll
just copy it all and just paste it back
in there and hit OK ok and what you
should then do is open up your command
console so I'm just going to open up CMD
on Windows you guys know how to do this
just you can look in search for CMD and
then just type I thong and you'll see I
aversion to point seven point three and
I'll just ctrl Z twice or once whatever
the next thing we want to do to save us
a lot of headache is get something
called easy setup to get that I'll just
go to Google and I'm going to look for
easy setup pie and it's right here by
peak so you do you just copy all this
and I guess I'll open up notepad again
paste it here file save as easy setup
dot pie I'll close it out and back in my
console let's see I'll go to desktop and
i'll say python easy setup dot pi and
already have this installed if you do
have problems installing it it's being
funny to try doing - you set up tools
and sometimes that'll just put it in
place and it only takes like a second to
do it okay
so you have that and then now what you
should have is a command available
called easy install okay and if I go to
my C Drive Python scripts remember we
included this see there's an easy
install folder that's what easy setup
did it gave us this easy install right
so I'm going to do easy install pip and
pip is a pipe Python a package manager
and here's pips see it would have
installed that in there and then we will
just do pip install Django
right and already have Django installed
you see it's right here Django admin and
that's how we actually do our commands
so just make sure you have your scripts
path and your system variables and
basically the whole goal of this was to
get the pip manager because you can
install a lot more crap with that and
it's easier then the next step is to get
mod WSGI to run your python stuff on the
web browser through apache and this one
i'm going to paste this URL this was
hard to find their unofficial and i'll
paste this in the description this long
URL and here we have mod WSGI and if you
look in the description Python 2.7 is
what i download it so that's what i'd
use in my case i'm using 64-bit apache
so if you can't get it to work with one
of these just try the non 64-bit or the
64-bit so I would just download this guy
and it's just a dot SL file in here and
what you do is you throw this in your
WAMP folder so I could copy that go to
workspace sorry C Drive lamp I had a
little bit too much Starbucks coffee
today I'm a little hyper bin Apache
modules and you just paste it in here
and you see I have mod WSGI dot s so
right there and then I would go to my
apache HTTP d config and i'll just look
for a load em there we go
and all we do is load module module
slash the name you could just copy a
line and paste it very easy you can
restart your Apache server and then you
now have Django enabled with that you
can start going to Django the
documentation and just go to part one
and it says creating a project so I'll
just do this real quick I'm going to
open my command line again I closed it
out so let's go CDC drive workspace I'll
make a folder called test
and I'll say Django admin dot PI start
project my site enter and let's see what
it created created a my site folder so
if I go to workspace test my site here
it is the manage pi file and to start
your server I'm gosh I just forgot is
like start server run server that was it
so you'd say PI whoops
we got make sure we're in the same
directory it's managed PI so if I'm in
here I'll just say Python managed PI run
server and actually you can provide a
port and I suggest providing a port
because your Apaches listening on port
80 and if you just leave it by default I
believe it'll go to port 80 so I'll just
do like 83 and then I can go to
localhost port
83 and there we go now you can go
through the python django tutorials i
hope this helped because it drove me
crazy for a while also one thing i do do
is once i finally figure out the easiest
way to do something i like to make a
Google Doc and remember how to do it and
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
