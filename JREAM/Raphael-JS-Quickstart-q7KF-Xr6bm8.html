Raphael the JavaScript library and this
draws graphics on your website and it's
pretty cool it uses scalable vector
graphics so go ahead and download it and
once you download it we got to plug it
into like a page or something to make it
easy for you you could go to my site of
lab slash open source and I'm just using
my website template to make these
tutorial shorter and I'm going to go
ahead and show you my folder here it is
this is what you'll get if you download
it and here is my index.php file I
basically stripped everything out of the
middle and I'm going to make a div ID of
draw a place we can draw in and up here
in public j/s you're going to want to
drop your Raphael J's file in there and
you can open up custom j/s which is
where I'll be
typing coding and right now there's
nothing in there
and don't forget to include your script
tag right at the top we want to include
Raphael's yes so without further ado
let's get started I can go ahead and
close these
and they have a nice documentation by
the way right here you could go through
this there's a couple things I'll show
you that will quicken you to start so I
was playing around with it there I'll
refresh their stuff in there and back to
this so since we're in jQuery I'm just
going to do a function for the Dom ready
and always make sure it works let me
refresh looks good I can shrink this
down a little bit and what we do is we
create a Raphael instance so VAR paper
equals Raphael and we're going to assign
it to the draw div that we just created
and we give it a size I want it to be a
400 wide by say 250 tall and start at 0
0 okay and when you do this you're not
going to see anything it's just white
and for the easiest thing I guess we
could do is make a circle so let's say
VAR c equals paper dot circle
and I'll make this 20 20 20 okay
and what these values mean is like the
size of it and the placement so 20 down
20 to the right and it's 20 radius so I
should may move that to 40 40 refresh
and there it is now if you right-click
this and do inspect element got a shrink
this down a little bit what we have here
is a SVG tag and a circle here so this
is a bit different than canvas I believe
that's pretty cool so we're going to
have some more fun with this and we can
add attributes if I open up the Raphael
I can go all the way down to the bottom
further further okay where it is
yes I missed it
where are the attributes here we go
attributes nope those are intimated
parameters here it is sour possible
parameters so what we want to do is
let's say create a fill and to do that I
would say C attr now attr is short for
attribute and I know in jQuery that's an
actual command if you're using just
plain JavaScript or prototype you can
still use this because it's part of
Rafael we're going to make an object so
I'll say fill red whoops and what else
do we do I guess we could do cursor
Poynter and I'll refresh this and see
when we hover over this we get the
cursor:pointer and the cool thing is we
can actually do stuff with this we can
give this an ID and use it with
JavaScript so what I could do is go see
node ID and remember see right here is
referencing the straight up paper circle
okay and I'm just going to give it the
idea of circle okay and I'll refresh and
right click and inspect the element and
you see over here it says ID of circle
since we can give that an ID we can do
anything now so I could say circle doc
lit function
alert one okay so click and we get an
alert now they also have a way to use
like an inline way to create a function
on a node I think it's C dot no dot
function like that something like that
see that node on click so I'm just going
to try that out real quick click yeah
that works also I prefer the jQuery way
or just the plain selecting the ID so
what we're going to do is make a couple
more things to make it fun I'm going to
create a rectangle so I'll save our R
equals paper dot correct and I'll say
60 60 that's your x and y-values
and the size of the rectangle will be
let's say 100 by 20 refresh and we have
a nice little rectangle there's also a
fourth argument so let's say five and
that will give it rounded corners this
argument is optional refresh and now we
have a rounded rectangle so if we wanted
two of these to be the same what we
could do is make life easier and just
cut this thing out and give it a
variable let's call it X let's call it
filler okay so now we have an object
called filler and we can just pass in
filler and we can do it for a rectangle
so r dot attribute filler boom refresh
and they're both the same we can also
change I mean you can you can do a lot
in this it's not just like drawing like
this I'll show you with a loop in a
minute so let's say we make this stroke
a little different I'll say a stroke and
let's say my room I hope that counts as
a color and stroke width I believe
stroke width now you see since that has
a dash in it we gotta put quotes on it
I'll say for save refresh it's pretty
cool so what I want to do is make these
touch each other so I'll say put that at
30 and 30 refresh and you see how the
rectangles on top of the circle one of
the cool things you can do is move it to
the front or back so I could say r dot
to back boom and it sends it to the back
now watch this if I do C dot to front
here it doesn't go to the front because
the rectangle was created after it so if
you're creating something overlaps it
appears what you have to do is send the
position wherever it is created I didn't
make much sense fit it you can create
lines I guess we could do that let's say
VAR l equals paper dot path and what
what you do is M I'll say 0 0 L I fur
okay I just had to check the documents M
means move
okay so 0 0 basically there's an
invisible cursor that says moved to 0 0
we could start at any position and draw
the line from 0 0 to let's say 10 50 and
refresh and we have a little line there
we could hit this up with some
attributes too
I'm not sure what the Phil will do yeah
it doesn't have a fill the lines just a
stroke okay so let's make it so when
they click the circle it hides the thing
there so in circles click I will say R
is the rectangle R dot hide refresh boom
okay
and I haven't tested this but I'm going
to try to tattle that's a prototype yeah
that doesn't work we have to obey
there's our hi there's remove if you
actually want to remove it there's our
show stuff like that that would actually
cause a problem because you can't show
what's removed you can create text let
me get rid of that you know you're the
my line too I'm just going to go back to
the circle and I'm gonna save our T
equals paper dot text and the position
to start it at I'll say 100 by 100 and
I'll say hey my name is Jessie and slash
and backslash and it means a new line
okay so refresh and hey my name is
Jessie
I could say T no dot ID well I'm not
going to do that you can change a lot of
stuff like this like T dot attributes
and let me check the docs real quick of
text oh shoot I'm always looking for
that a area with the parameters here it
is possible parameters font so let's try
some of these I'll do a font the Arial
font size we have the dash so we need to
hold it up 25 might have to be 25 px and
just look at Rio Pass City
and I'll say it's a number so I'll just
do five refresh oh it broke
I forgot the comma here boom hey my name
is Jesse it didn't say it was a float
but I'll try a float I guess it is a
float opacity they said it was a number
looks like it's a float okay and that's
a good start you got to be pretty good
with math if you want to make something
cool on here let's make a loop so I'm
going to go for VAR i equals 0 I is less
than 10 I plus plus just a regular
JavaScript loop and we're going to
create some circles or lines let's do
circles so I'll say
push I do this
C equals paper dot circle of 40 I i plus
45 plus 40
I don't think that's gonna work well it
did work but it didn't turn out very
pretty
what I'm doing is I'm creating a circle
and the x and y-coordinates are changing
so if I did I times 40
so it'd be 40 80 yeah that looks a
little bad you know we could always add
our attributes of filler refresh so what
you could do is populate dynamic data
you could make grids graphs you name it
one more thing I'm going to show you is
the gradient F radial gradient and
linear and it's a little tricky so I'll
say fill we move this over actually have
to look at this
so it starts with the angle of 90
degrees the color and the ending color I
guess we can try that one more
and Phil will be that to that and
refresh and we have a nice linear
gradient I hope that's a decent
introduction I know it's not amazing
one of the tricky parts to figure out
was finding out how to give it an ID and
that was node dot ID okay now if you
went to the Rothfeld jasmaine site they
have examples that are a million times
better than me because I'm not very good
at math but if you're good at math
you're going to be in the money see how
cool this is they also have one that you
can stretch and it was this one nope
anyways thanks for watching guys hit me
up with a thumbs up if you found this
helpful
