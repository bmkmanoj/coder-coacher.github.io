we're going to play with some blend
tools and right you see little hand or
you see a pen the dodge and burn tool
and also this little triangle tool on
not so much but the smudge tool so we
got a picture of a woman with no makeup
and you know her skin might not look the
best and if you ever need to touch up
your photos you can pick this little
finger and that's the smudge tool and
then right click and change your brush
size the hardness this has to do with
how hard that edges this would be a soft
edge right here how it kind of gets
blurry when you're doing a face you
probably want to do kind of a soft one
so I'd actually shrink this down a
little bit and just kind of smudge it up
if you wanted to get rid of these lines
here oh we could try this I'm not sure
how good it'll work if you look if
you're not careful and you zoom out you
see how it looks like a dark spot it
doesn't look normal so let me control
alt Z which is to keep on doing what you
could do is use the patch tool the clone
stamp tool sorry and what you do you
zoom in and hold alt and let's just
click about this general area let go and
then just drag your brush over it and
that is cloning kind of like in this
area over here and that actually looks a
lot better I like in cs5 it kind of
shows you previews of what it'll look
like now if you did it over here you see
it's going to look kind of funny because
it's repeating kind of like a map so I'm
going to undo that if I want to get over
here I probably
click over here and drag some down here
and let's try okay well it's not perfect
but you kind of get the idea you can see
the blotches and everything now if you
do have blotches like this you can
always resize it go to image image size
and if you do a percent like about 80%
they'll actually improve it usually but
i guess not in this case due to the
funny colors back to these tools so the
smudge tool you could use this to make
your eyebrows kind of a little better
looking this one really takes some skill
the smudge tool and then if we go over
to here with the little finger let's see
what we're going to burn tool burn is
pretty much what it sounds like we're
going to burn something and let's get it
a little smaller okay and this is just
going to add some eyeshadow I'm just
going to click likely okay okay if you
do it too much it'll make it way too
dark but I guess we'll do that anyways
there's some burn add a little shadow
under under her chin just so it makes
her look a little skinnier maybe and
maybe the ear a little darker nah yeah
that actually looks kind of good you
want to darken our teeth you could but
then the sharpen tool uh sorry the
triangle this just kind of makes things
grainier I rarely use this there we go
if I keep doing that you see how grainy
that becomes I don't find myself using
that much the blur tool that's obvious
it just kind of blurs things you need to
blur it make it real pretty
the Dodge tool is kind of like the
opposite of a burn tool so dodge you do
it on brighter areas like let's say the
teeth and I'm getting a little bit of
the lips in here no need to be a
perfectionist and a little tutorial but
she's kind of looking artificial might
want to brighten up the white in our
eyes and maybe some of the eyes too and
yeah it doesn't look very realistic but
you can have fun with it it almost looks
like a guy this let's go funny very
another thing that's pretty cool is
liquify so you go to filter liquify and
it opens up a pretty big screen let me
resize this so that we can see what
we're working with okay I can't make it
any shorter for now you don't really
have to worry about all the stuff on the
right so much has a lot of fun stuff you
can play with you know if you're really
bored but what we're looking for is this
one the forward warp tool and with this
one we can modify stuff so if you wanted
to make your face skin here like you see
our cheeks are kind of chubby there
let's change the brush size for this one
you usually want it a little bigger okay
so I'm just going to hold ctrl alt and
then use the little wheel on the mouse
and I'm just going to drag this in now
if you're doing this for say your
facebook photos uh I won't do it too
much because you know it might look
obvious and it's just kind of no point
you know but people see your real face
they can tell let's Baker knows a little
thinner and let's lift our eyes a little
bit
okay that'll be good and yeah her eyes
look pretty gross she looks like I don't
know not trying to solve Britney Spears
but because that's who this is and if
you look and if you compare them what a
contrast it creates isn't it I'm just
going to copy this paste this on top and
you see the difference you can make just
buy some makeup and touch-ups obviously
you should probably take more time with
it and play with these tools also if
this looks too fake what you can do is
go to image adjustments and where is it
desaturate here it is and take out the
color of the lips to love too bright but
sometimes that can make it look more
believable and I think that's good for
this tutorial thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
