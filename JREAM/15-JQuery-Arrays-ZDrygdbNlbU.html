some jQuery arrays and this is important
to know because the same principle
applies in every programming language
that I've ever touched and they're
really useful the reason I like
programming is because it's the only
thing that listens to me all right so to
make an array let's just make a variable
I'll say var ARR for array and I'll do
equals and we do these square brackets
okay and then we put in values let's say
cat dog fish you say well I already know
this that's all right I'm gonna show you
some tricks with it too and then I down
here I have a div idea of box and I'll
do box dot HTML array and I'll refresh
this and nothing appears because it
can't print all these out into it so you
can do with something similar to Java
not JavaScript but Java this is also in
JavaScript that sounds confusing and we
do two strings so it turns this array to
a string and there it lists it out to us
and another one you can do is called
join and this one's a little bit
different
well it's actually pretty much the same
but our dot join and I'll do a plus and
this will be the space between each of
these items isn't that pretty cool and
an array is a it's pretty handy
they hold pockets of data obviously
alright let's do a couple functions on
this array let's say we want to
add something to the start we do array
dot on shift I'm having trouble
remembering ok unshipped and let's say
food and refresh and that adds it to the
front they say what kind of thing is on
shift what does that mean
well if you type array dot shift this
will remove the first item just just if
you put your hands in the air and just
move them to the left into that like
shift to the left and that will remove
cat ok and unship is like shifting it to
the right and adding something in there
hopefully that's not too confusing but
this is true in PHP as well so shift and
unshift those are good ones to know if
we did our dot length we can get the
length of the thing so in this HTML just
pop in array dot length and it tells us
how many of these items we have if you
need to do that for some reason there's
also one called pop and kind of like the
opposite of shift pop will remove the
last item
okay I'm just gonna put this back into
string again and you see pop just pops
the thing off the end the last item
pretty easy peasy so far it just takes a
little time to remember these you know
let's see who did a very pop let's do a
race slice sliced so we've covered slice
and Python
maybe PHP and stuff it's all the same if
I wanted to select 0-2 position
I guess one it'll go to cat only let me
refresh that you have to assign this
slice there we go basically what slice
is doing is it's saying slice from
position zero and stop at 1 and this is
0 this is 1 so it's gonna stop right
there or my little blinking cursor is
and you know you just slicing it up you
have to assign it okay it's not
referenced but if you have a variable
that's referenced I believe that splice
is and I'll refresh that and that one
actually works in splice is kind of like
the opposite basically where we're
moving 0 to 2 so 0 1 and then right here
where that blinking cursor is is where
we're going to stop or moving ok and if
I did 0 1 it's only going to remove cat
okay and this is a reference meaning it
changes the actual value the same item
in memory okay but the slice you have to
assign it
okay so let's do some funner things if
we had an item let's call this a submit
item input type equals submit mm-hmm and
we wanted to get a series of values okay
let's just say 25 and we're going to
make a fake tag called I don't know ID 2
equals fish ID 3 equals dog we'd have to
use jQuery to pick up each one of these
one by one
and it'd be a little messy an easier way
to do this would just be to put it all
in one field
sorry about the highlighting it's hard
to read okay so we have 25 fish dog I
like to separate my items with these
pipes because they're easy to tell
what's what so I'm gonna get rid of this
out of the box real quick and we can't
get rid of this so we'll say let's get
let me give this an ID actually ID
equals submit so submit a dot a tribute
of RAL okay and let's say data equals
that okay so our data in here is going
to be this right here so let's do data
let's see what it says okay so it has
that in there and what if we wanted to
get one of those one by one what you
would do is I just forgot
each no that will loop through it split
that's it okay so we could say var of
data equals data dot split and we want
to split it by the pipe okay and if i
refresh good it doesn't show up now we
have an array okay so I could do de 2.2
string oops forgot the little things
there refresh and that will show it or
we could use this as an actual array in
our little square items so that'll only
print out the first value and you can
imagine that could be quite useful if we
needed to do something with the data
itself
okay so splits a pretty cool one you say
well what if I want to add an item on
the end of the array also you can do it
this way to data push on let's say hey
and let's do that to string again to
string refresh and there's hay on the
end you just push an item on to the end
and lastly let's do a each loop you're
going to use each loops a lot okay and
this one you start with the dollar sign
or it could be jQuery you know the word
each
so dollar each okay and we pass what we
want each of we want to do each of the
data array okay so this is what it looks
like down there 25 fish dog and it has
an array for each one of those and we're
gonna do a function and pass in some
stuff for the loop and kind of like a
for each loop in PHP I'm sure most
people are using PHP from now if you're
using jQuery I'll do eye and value or
you could say key value looks just like
a for each loop and I'll put this here
instead of HTML I'm gonna do a pendant
so that it adds on to each other and
what I can say is key plus let's say key
is
the Val plus new line so that looks a
little scary to read refresh and we get
each one of these elements of the
placeholder and the value and if you
ever needed to use that there it is
I'll make a real normal array so it's
not as confusing so we'll just say data
equals Jessie cho-jen
just okay and there's what it does with
an actual array there is also array
sorting as well which you just do dot
sort and I think that's that and thanks
