going to talk about some frameworks and
content management systems and what ones
you should use if you look in the PHP
there are so many frameworks and content
management systems it seems like which
one do I use or even start with and I
think the best answer is it comes down
to your personal preference it really
does for example if your neighbor drives
Porsches and you really want one and you
drive it and it just doesn't Drive how
you want because there's 40 I'm kind of
stiff then you'd probably get maybe a
Jaguar you know if you can afford these
expensive cars so it really depends on
the person using them if we look at done
framework and symphony these are pretty
large systems and they have a lot of
configuration options they don't
necessarily work out of the box very
easily if you've monkeyed with them and
you're familiar with them then they're
probably very easy but the learning
curve to these top two are the hardest
if you look at cakephp CodeIgniter
and E or Y I I these ones have easy
learning curves and easier harder in my
opinion doesn't make one better than the
other the more complex are the more
simple it doesn't make one better in my
opinion either
so which one is better I think it just
depends on what you want to do and which
one is the easiest for you to work with
and for your friends or coworkers to
work on together if we go over here what
we have is a Model View controller which
all these frameworks use except the Zen
framework doesn't use a model as I
understand
and what do you really want in a
framework what are you trying to
accomplish at a very basic level the
first thing you want is the MVC pattern
because it's clean and easy to work with
second you want a database connection
third you want let's say a form handler
to handle your post values and
everything requests and get you probably
want to file upload Handler and possibly
a thumbnail creator and you probably
want some caching maybe on a template
engine and these are just a few things
okay obviously not everything you could
do but in very simple terms you don't
need a ton of things in it I don't think
it needs to be overly complex so in your
search for a framework which one should
you use in my opinion if you have the
time I think you should try to develop
your own for one it'll be very very good
practice secondly you won't be conformed
to one framework and that's good because
if you were a car mechanic and you fix
Cadillacs for a living yeah there's a
lot of Cadillacs but what if you had to
fix a Ford or a Chevy it'd be a lot more
beneficial for you to know the workings
of engines in general and in my opinion
if you know the working is a PHP and
object-oriented design and some patterns
and how to write your own modules and
all this I think you'll benefit a lot
more than just learning one thing
then if we go over here there's a lot of
content management systems WordPress
Joomla Drupal mod X wolf CMS which one
do I use I know a guy who's learning
WordPress Joomla and trying to learn
Drupal I said what are you doing that
for he said I want to know all three of
these so that I can work on any one site
who requests it and I thought that's
kind of silly I think it'd be better to
be an expert in one and then you have a
niche market for that rather than just
saying I do generally also released and
from using these Drupal is very good it
has a lot of plugins and a lot of
configuration options and the learning
curve will be pretty big it's difficult
I haven't used Joomla for years I hear
good things about it but I don't really
care much anymore
there's mod X that's pretty neat looking
and there's WordPress and this is very
popular I personally don't like it one
bit again it comes to personal
preference you see being a wordpress
expert in my opinion isn't very
impressive because most of the time
you're just popping in pre-made plugins
or just theming it with HTML or CSS and
maybe a little bit of procedural PHP I
I'm just not that impressed by WordPress
but it has its uses you know so I'm not
saying it's bad I guess it's a matter of
preference for myself I prefer wolf CMS
mostly because you can customize
everything it's very lightweight and
it's fast but that's my opinion
if you want to do a lot of custom things
you'd probably want to use Drupal or
wolf CMS but this one has such a small
learning curve and I've had I've used
this for two or three years when it was
previously called the Frog CMS and back
to the frameworks which one do I use I
think you should use the one which is
easiest for you that you enjoy using and
you don't get frustrated over learning
or build your own you will get
frustrated building your own but you'll
have a lot of fun doing it and you will
learn a lot that's my opinion thanks for
