going to do a jQuery little price
calculator here and I've got some
checkboxes and you click and it just
adds stuff up and I was playing around
with this so we have a blank HTML page
here and jQuery in the same directory
and let's get started I just have a
regular HTML file here when i refresh I
just test the alert out so first thing
let's make an input type equals checkbox
and let's give it a class and call it
option and give it a value and let's
just say 200 and let's just say name let
me move over a little bit okay so line
break let's do a couple of these okay
300 400 and just fill these in with some
values okay and refreshing we have these
to check off and lastly we need a div id
of total and I'm going to be working in
US currency so I'm just going to put
dollar 0 okay and I'll refresh and
here's what we have so let's make jQuery
make this cool and to do this I'm going
to do a input click and I will say let's
see input or how about option
in case we have other input fields on
here so option dot click function and
we're going to create a variable for the
total down there and we'll say var total
equals zero just by default and we're
going to calculate every one of these
when we click one so when we click one
it's going to recalculate them all at
once every time some things change and
with that we're going to do the each
function so we're going to say options
colon checked dot each function and
we're going to take the total and we're
going to add to it and the value is down
in this value thing here so to get that
we're going to do this Val okay so for
each one of these when we when we click
the option click it's going to say are
the totals is zero now and for every one
of these classes that have options we're
going to take the value and add to it
with this plus equals okay and before we
do that we're going to have to parse the
integer so down here in the div ID of
total let's put the value in there I'll
show you in just a second so total HTML
is total and let me put a little dollar
sign in here okay so refresh click and
nothing's happening because we need to
parse int right here otherwise it's just
going to read it as a string and it
won't add it so parse whoops
and of this value okay and refresh click
click click nothing's happening what did
I do wrong option all right here option
there we go
and now we click and it just adds stuff
up that's pretty cool
now what I did was so that they could
click these fields the text I did um a
label so I actually wrapped a label
around here instead label just wrap a
label around each one of these and boom
boom boom boom and instead I just said
label now you could give these a class
if you wanted but for this example I'll
just use the label click and um what
else did I do okay label click Save okay
and click click okay yeah that works and
to highlight the fields what I did was I
said let's see this dot parent dot CSS
background of gold okay and the reason I
did this parent is because we are inside
if you look at this little loop here or
inside the options checked okay and in
the document object model or in this
item right here and I want to make the
background of this whole label and the
text change so I'm going to this item
and its parent which is label and then
I'm applying the CSS and I'll refresh
click click click and you'll see that
when you unclick it it doesn't go away
so what we could do is maybe another
loop and let's do option not checked
um yeah look sorry dot each function and
we will say um let's change this copy
this this background is FFF okay so this
might be a little quick to follow so you
could replay the video if you need to
and let's refresh this click click and
there we have it pretty cool alright I
hope that was useful guys go through
this tutorial slow if you didn't
understand it or nesting an option in
here also and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
