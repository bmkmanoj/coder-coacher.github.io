to you today about green sock it's a
JavaScript and ActionScript animation
library and from what I've heard around
the office is it's been around for quite
a while and it's pretty much the number
one animation library my boss and
another lead developer use it and
they're pretty good at it I'm not very
good at animating but you know you can
use one line of code versus you know
five lines of code and jQuery animation
or prototype animation and really make
things sweet so if you were to head over
to greens.com jumpstart j/s you can go
through this and this entire
presentation is made with green sock now
the reason it might look a little
jittery on my screen is because I'm
recording my screen but if you actually
play with this in person it's extremely
smooth and you can get GS ap a
JavaScript or ActionScript probably get
action or JavaScript if you're following
this they also have a demonstration of
speed tests and animation of green sock
versus say mootools
jQuery and all that stuff and this just
blows it out of the water you can do a
lot with green sock many animations at
once without slowing down anything it's
really cool so what I did was I created
a project in NetBeans for this video I
just made an index file
and in my index file I have just a
stylesheet with Twitter bootstrap and
the reason for that is so that my
example is not so ugly not so plain and
with Twitter bootstrap what I have is
just heading items' my three paragraphs
and a loader bar and that's all pretty
easy to use in here I also include a
jQuery
it's my library that I like to use for
selectors and stuff you could use sizzle
j/s if you wanted it just for selectors
but for now I'll just keep this here and
what I included were the two twin max
libraries there's a twin light and a
timeline light and those are basically
just
the same things this with fewer features
it's not going to make a huge difference
if you use tween light unless you're
going to use like specific features
those are listed on their site and
documentation I'm not super advanced
with this so I don't know the ins and
outs I just prefer to use the fancy
version I do know it has a yo-yo feature
in the max so down here I just have a
progress bar and a class barn here just
the standard Twitter bootstrap bar and I
have a little percent symbol in here
what we're going to do is use tween max
to animate that so what I'm going to do
is just select the bar and to use tween
max I'll say tween max dot and here what
it has are things like - it has let me
do a couple of these it has from stagger
to and stagger from those are ones that
you'll use a lot all four of these and
basically the difference is this let me
try to explain this when you do
something to something so let's say we
have an element that is 10 pixels wide
when we do - we make it let's say 100
pixels wide okay from if we have an
element that right now is 10 pixels wide
and we want to make it 100 pixels what's
going to happen with from is it's
actually going to start at 100 and then
go to 10 so it's kind of the opposite
and that's pretty cool so I'll get rid
of that get rid of my little comments
here now stagger this works with groups
of things so if I had a group of
paragraphs which I'm going to show you
we can fade them all in kind of like a
step phase in one line and we'll get to
those for the most part I like to use -
I'm still a beginner with this but bear
with me I hope this makes your life more
interesting so I just have a bar here
I'll save our bar equals bar now you
could pop this guy down in here if you
want it
I just don't like how it looks with all
the parentheses let's all say bar the
element or elements I'm selecting and
I'll say the duration I want this to
happen it will be one second you can do
like 0.5 1.5 and all that is to 1.5 and
then we have our parameters here in an
object and if you have the latest
version you no longer have to type CSS
and then put in your parameters you just
type in a parameter straight up so what
we're gonna do is say width will be 90%
okay so that's super simple let's
refresh the page and it's animates that
to 90% now remember it's a little choppy
because I'm recording my screen it has a
lot of easing functions and easing you
can find all those if I click this slide
down here and I go to easing and they
have just so many things and you can get
an idea of it so like let's say quad
easin it's kind of an odd one looks a
little slow see what happens if I do to
one second elastic easing that's a funny
one I mean the way you want to animate
it is really your call but you see they
start with the name so ease is the class
sorry the object property because we're
not object right here
then we just like pass something in like
this so for ease which is optional and
kind of makes it look cooler I can just
go like that so go back here and refresh
and see it kind of crawling to get to
the kind of crawling I want to try ease
out I think that might look cool it once
it gets near the end it kind of slows
down yeah that doesn't look very cool
so we I have a bunch of paragraphs here
what I'm gonna do is we're gonna fade
those in so I'll save our P equals P now
again I'm doing the same thing as I did
up here so that I'm not passing in a
sloppy looking variable and I'm gonna
say tween Max and this time I'm gonna do
from now we have one issue I have
multiple paragraphs here so what I want
to do is a stagger from but first I'm
gonna do it this way just to show you
the difference so I'll pass in my
element P and how fast will want to
happen I'll say one second and I'm gonna
say opacity zero and basically what this
means is from opacity zero make the
element whatever it looks like untouched
so untouched its visible at one opacity
so this is kind of gonna do the opposite
so let's go ahead and refresh and you
see how it fades in that text okay so
what we're gonna do now is the stagger
from and this makes it look a bit cooler
and we do the same thing except our last
parameter we can define how fast we want
it to happen for the next one so I'll
just say 0.25 refresh and see how it
kind of clocks down like that and a one
line of code you can really make
something very interesting let's go back
to the percent bar and I want to show
you a kind of cool function that I was
monkeying with I want to make this
percentage count while the bar grows so
I'm gonna do a tween max dot - and I
need to start off with a variable so
I'll say var percent equals zero because
we're going to start a zero percent and
var percent target equals let's say 90
percent just because we're
there now obviously if you this were a
real application you would give 90 a
variable and you won't redefine stuff a
whole bunch so with this what we do is
we target in the window and then we just
I was put in the number one and for our
object I'm gonna say PCT : PCT target
basically what that's saying is between
from percent this variable which is a
digit to the percent target which is 90
and we need to on update method so comma
update did I miss something yup the
functions are got too many of those
semicolons and what I want to do is say
percent plus plus so I'll increment at
once and so basically this tween is
going to happen each time this updates
going to happen every time it just
animates this and I just want to
increment this percent by one it's a
little more complex but then what we're
doing at first I just want to show you
because I'm like it asks so what I want
to do then is say bar dot HTML and
remember bar is already signed up here
so really it be the same as copying this
and saying bar dot HTML and I'm gonna
say PCT plus percent like that so I'll
go ahead and refresh the page
and it's crawling up now that the 45%
which doesn't seem right at all and it
doesn't look like it happened in the
right amount of time so down here for
the easing I don't know what easing its
using I'll say ease linear which is a
straight line you
none and let's try it again see if that
fixes it it looks like it's still
counting up a lot of the at the bottom
and I think that has to be because of
this ease here which isn't really
matching up with how far it's stretching
I wonder why it stopped at 45 well let's
see I got percent is 0% target on update
function % + + bar HTML is % that's a
little curious maybe too many things are
happening I don't know that almost got
there see it seems like something's
clogging it up I think this video
recorder which would be very curious is
clogging it up so I'll leave that there
you guys can try this if you'd like I
hope this gives you a decent
introduction between Macs let me show
you timeline real quick also now
timeline is crazy
I'll say timeline max let me do VAR T
equals new timeline max ok so we have to
instantiate it and I'll say T dot ad and
T dot and okay and the timeline
basically you add crap to it so what I
do is I actually put on my tween max
animations in here if I want things to
happen in a consecutive order so what
I'm gonna do is create a paragraph let
me give this a id equals dog let me do
one I'm alert actually
class equals alert alert warning error
so I have these out I will just give
these IDs ID equals f1 ID equals foo
whoops boom two one
okay and we're gonna I'm gonna show you
the time line with those guys so let me
delete these paragraphs here and I'm
gonna comment out my paragraph guy here
so what I want to do is I'm gonna say
Queen max - how about from from yeah I
guess I'll select those IDs full one and
foo to full one
boom boom
so from fool one and one second I want
to do something and I'll just throw one
more down here okay and we're gonna do
something I just want to add a div
container div div div and I'm just going
to do some dirty inline CSS real quick
so that we can move this around
to some quick and dirty CSS so that we
can get this right basically I made a
container for these paragraphs to hang
out in looks like I had a typo somewhere
one second order one pixel solid red
position:absolute top:0 border 1 pixel
saga read what here is that error where
is Z error I delete it that's why I like
an IDE you get these little red things
let's see oh I forgot my colon here okay
and let me just see how that looks
refresh okay so there's my paragraphs
right there okay and they're just in
funny positions so let's say I want to
move this from top of 400 pixels and I
want to move this one from let's do this
one too
top of 200 pixels and down here we're
just gonna pass in the easing value I'm
not that using value the how much time
it takes until each one happens so let's
try that out refresh it looks like that
didn't want to cooperate so I'll check
my console that says twin max is not
defined that's why I love the console
and let's see what that does
refresh I'm something close that refresh
so that one slides up looks good but
that other one didn't so let me double
check this once again oh it's the same
one who on heckle that had more things
to the timeline I'll do the food too and
then food too will also be 400 so
refresh and you see how these things
happen in a nice order this would
probably be 1 and 1.5 change it up a
little bit boom boom and you can mess
with that with a bunch of animation you
can also do something like pause I
believe nope I don't have the right
parameter let me double check ok I found
it I just typed it wrong it's not here
it would be T that pause okay so let me
refresh and doesn't do anything so let
me just quickly make a button to show
you I'll just say
make two buttons Ron and reverse all
this is in green socks beautiful little
library so let me just give this an ID
reverse and run so
we'll say run dot click function T dot
run okay and reverse dot click function
T dot reverse now I should prevent false
so let me just pass evie team here
the reason I'm passing EVT in here is
because one uh diet work brought it up
and it was a pretty good point if you
just pass in E and you search for e in a
big document you're just gonna get
highlighted YZ everywhere but you do EVT
then you can specifically search for
that and know exactly what you're
searching for so i'll do EVT dot
preventdefault okay and hopefully i got
that right refresh and i'll say run run
run reverse nope because it's start not
start so run not sure why that's not
behaving object has no method start so
let me just make sure I have this right
it's paused T dot start so let's take
one more stab at this object has no
method start which I don't see what I
did wrong
timeline max I'm pretty sure it has a
start let's see what reverse does let me
refresh and try reverse not exactly sure
what has happened let me unpause it
refresh so that animates it reverse that
reverses it looks like Start is just not
correct so it's running and reverse does
the reverse doesn't look perfectly
accurate either way I'm no expert at
this I'm still kind of learning it but I
wanted to bring it to you guys attention
so check it out play with it and let me
know what you think about it in the
comments thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
