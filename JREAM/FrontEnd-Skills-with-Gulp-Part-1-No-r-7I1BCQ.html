front-end and we're gonna be using
nodejs and gulp to learn how to make
task runners so this is a pretty cool
stuff and I have to give credit to Dan
Sackett I'll link his bitbucket in the
description I pick up a lot of tricks
from him and he's a fast learner smart
guy so I'm in my Linux development
environment I'm using virtual VMware
Workstation and you can install this in
Windows and everything but I'm not going
to go through that because it's the same
thing once you get it installed so I
have no js' installed already but I will
say I do have a git repository here if
you go to github slash dream and look
for configure Bunton in the main a
readme file I've just left well I'm not
at the right spot one moment
there that's nodejs okay so I have a
section for noches
and you just want to add this for posit
or E and do a update and install node J
s now I do this because when you do sudo
installs sometimes under your folder
you'll get a permission problem this
might be true on a Mac as well so this
just prevents you from having to type
sudo for everything you do so what I'm
gonna do is first type node - V so I
have version 10 and I'm pretty sure 12
is out to be honest yeah 12 so I'm a
little bit behind that's okay I don't
mind right now and then I'll just type
NPM to make sure the node package
manager is working now the actual word
for NPM let's make sure I got it right
the package manager for node I got
something wrong maybe that's I don't
know okay so let's go ahead and make a
directory and we're gonna call this I'm
just gonna call it practice saw CD into
practice okay now my terminal over here
might be kind of small so I'll just say
sublime period to open sublime text
because most of you are familiar with it
and in here there's nothing what we want
to do is a few things we're gonna create
a few files so I'll say touch gulp file
j/s keep in mind we don't have anything
installed yet and this will be for the
task runner we're also going to do
package.json that's for making a list
for node to install third-party packages
with the package manager
I'll hit enter and I'll also MK der of
dist for distributable x' and SRC for
source so if I go back to sublime I have
these files now and so that this video
doesn't take a whole lot of time longer
than it should
I have pre-written some of the code that
we can use so for the package.json file
this is what NPM uses so we write this
with our little braces and let me go
ahead and increase the font I actually
have a new monitor that I'm financing
because it's kind of expensive and I'm
not made a gold it's not a Mac one of
those Mac tiger display ones or whatever
they're called it's one of those Asus
wqhd so I got all this room and I love
it it's a lot it's a bit better than
1080p in the for case they're kind of
expensive so back on topic let me just
make the font bigger so I'll say font
size let's try 14 okay so this will be
so you can read it better
and we start with a name and let's just
call this practice
and we can have a description if we want
and that's more for I think for
distributing it bla and let's give it a
version we'll just say one point 0.0 and
then we'll have dependency lips
dependencies here okay and all safe now
for the dependencies this is kind of fun
so no js' is installed I'm going to
assume you'll be able to figure that out
now we'll go to NPM j/s org and let's
just type the word grunt sorry not grunt
gulp grunt is also a task runner
I like gulp I've used both and right now
the version is 3.8 11 so let's grab the
newest guy so in here if I kind of
shrink him down I'll say go and that's
the version number okay so there's a lot
of packages in gulp and Escala well
where do I start
but you just think about it this way
let's just have fun and find out some
things we want to use one that I
definitely like is sass so I'll tell you
gulp sass now there's gulp less if you
prefer less I personally prefer sass and
you just highlight this little guy here
and the name there so I'll say go sass
and make sure you're using double quotes
in your Jason okay and you see how I
have that trailing comma right here if
you left that as is you have to delete
the last comma or else it's not valid
Jason okay I'm just looking at some of
the packages some that mr. dan Sackett
introduced me to saves me a lot of time
smart guy very very smart guy in fact
yeah if you hear the name Dan Sackett
watch out that kids going places well
he's not a kid but so let's do concat
and it concatenates files if you don't
know what that means it just say you
have five files it joins them all into
one and it's called gold can cat and
remember not everything is limited to
gulp there's a lot other stuff you see
here's one ken cat stream don't know
what it does but does something we want
definitely one called watch okay so
watch is at 4.11 go - watch 4.1.1 and
what this does is that make sure
application just keep listening so every
time you make a change it recompiles and
it's really fast so it's it's like
awesome so you don't have to rerun a
console line every time another one I
believe Plummer okay
whoops plumber and this prevents pipe
breaking so
gulp - plumber so without this for
example if you type in the code that's
syntactically
incorrect it'll stop the task from
watching and you'll have to fix it what
this does is it prevents it from
stopping it shows the error you can keep
saving until you fix it so it's really
useful there's one called autoprefixer
and i like this one a lot so notice it
doesn't have gulp before free fixer ok
and this basically let's say you're
right CSS with some of those funny rules
that aren't in all browsers like you do
a border-radius
when you compile this it'll add all
those - Moz border-radius and all that
stuff but in sass you could use mix-ins
that already define those but it's not
necessary because this will do it for
you so it's a time-saver we want to do a
minify CSS and here it is go p-- minify
CSS i like to put the gulp ones all
bundled together go minify CSS
okay
okay and let's see rename I don't want
plumber did it to uglify that's what I
want I think that'll be good so let's do
Uggla fie okay and we'll get gulp uglify
because we want to compress down our
JavaScript and all that so say gulp
uglify now we're gonna make this work
I'm not saying this is the all-inclusive
best way to do it but obviously you'd
have to look to dance Sackett or
something like that
so here we go we had this it looks all
valid I'll go ahead and move this over I
believe that's all we'll need mm-hmm now
let's type LS and we just type NPM
install and if there's the error we're
gonna see it and you'll notice that it
made this folder called node modules so
let me just make a new tab here and I'll
just say git init okay so now we have a
git repository and while that installs
I'll just make one
call it learning gulp
it'll be on bitbucket so this will be
the repository learning gulp let me
change it to the ssh-1
and this will be public so if you want
to download the code so in here I'll
just say get in it and paste ok and I'll
just touch get ignore and I'll just
close that window inside of get what is
this I don't know what did I do
get status ok so hopefully I did that
right and what I would do if you're in a
get file I would just ignore node
modules and let's purposely make an
error in here ok so I just added some
letters npm install and we should get a
debug log populated in here npm update
oh it doesn't care about my version
let's do something that doesn't exist
okay I'll try MPM install there we go
there it is okay so let me undo that the
reason was I wanted to see what this
file was and I want to get ignore that
also NPM - the bug blog okay so we don't
want that stuff in our repository and
okay so now to our gulp file the way we
do this is we define variables in
JavaScript so we'll save our gulp equals
require gulp because that's one of them
now we can do this line by line I like
the way mr. Sackett does it with a comma
and just does each one like one var
definition so I'll just copy all this
stuff here paste it and it will say sass
equals
require cult sass I'm cat is cult Tomcat
whoops
so there's gold sass concat let's have
watch let's add plumber okay boom boom
and minify CSS is a long one
let me see what I call it in a different
one okay minify CSS uglify
okay and autoprefixer okay so you at
this point you could pause the video if
you want and type that in but the source
will be available for you and I would
prefer to tab these out to line them up
oops was that they perfectly line up
with the autoprefixer length it just
makes it easier to read I don't know of
any standards in JavaScript and I like
lines of demarcation so this guy here
you can't see the bottom of my sublime
but I like to make it 72 long because
that usually works good if I were to tab
it over it still fits like that alright
so what this does this takes the node
modules and puts them in a variable so
we can use them so what we do now is to
make a task so we would probably want to
define some paths so I'll say let me
make sure I don't do this wrong okay var
destination for j/s destination for CSS
and our source for sass
whoops and source for jeaious
and you could always go online and get a
really nice sculpt file too but I want
you to know how it works so for the
destination of CSS let's do or J s will
do this / j s and this slash CSS so in
here it's gonna create a folder I'll
just make a new actually I'll commit
that code once we compile stuff for the
source we'll just do SRC slash sass and
then SRC / j s and boom boom boom boom
okay and we'll have a little line of
demarcation there so let's make a task
and we'll start with sass so I'll just
say sass - CSS and we do gulp task and
we'll give it a name and a anonymous
function I'm just looking at my notes
because I don't remember everything by
heart and will say gulp that source and
we will use SRC sass and with that
source we're gonna pipe a bunch of stuff
together so we'll just do dot pipe and
in here we want to run plumber sass
and notice these are the same guys up
here here sass here's a plumber so
plumber would allow it to keep going if
there's an error fight and we want to
minify CSS make sure I got that right
and I believe once we compiled the sass
we want to save it into CSS and then we
want to minify it and then we save it ok
so let's set the destination pipe gulp
deaths will be deaths CSS okay and then
we'll just duplicate that line under
there okay now that we're in here let's
just see we'll just try to type gulp
sass okay so there was no errors that's
good there's nothing for it to do right
now and I'll copy my line of demarcation
and I'll say compile which is called dot
task and you just call it J s you can
really call these anything you want
so gulp source will be source J s the
that folder there and we're gonna pipe
it along it looks like we forgot the
autoprefixer in the CSS but we'll get
back to that so let's turn on the
plumber to prevent errors I'll still be
uglify it
and plate concat and we can catch this
into a file that we want to call it
let's just call this on app dot Minjae s
whoops okay and we'll pipe it and should
save the destination to dest j s okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
