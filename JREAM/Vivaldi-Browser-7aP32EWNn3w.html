a web browser that's pretty new it's in
beta 2 it's called the Val D it's a
funny name but it's from the creator of
opera the web browser or CEO or some
high up guy there and it's based on the
open source chromium what that means is
you'll be able to use any Chrome
extension that you want for example
right up here I put last pass on to this
guy and some of the features are kind of
neat I don't know all of them right now
but I'll show you a few we have the
sidebar here which is toggleable so you
have this little icon at the bottom
where you can hide it but the sidebar is
pretty cool when you start monkeying
around a little bit like what's this
notes here is a page so let's just say I
wanted to have like say Python Docs okay
and I'll do 2.7 Doc's and rats I'll copy
this I'll hit plus and I can add a new
web panel there okay and then I could
just you know go home here and here's
the Vivaldi but this will stay on on
every tab if you have what's called a
web panel open this one is some booking
side I just made and I thought that was
kind of interesting so if I were to
navigate like over here
and I click home at Bursley back to
where this is and I could just
right-click it and remove the panel and
get rid of it like permanently otherwise
if it's opened
I forgot how you close it I guess you
just click it
NASA is hiring they must want me because
I can close all right
they have their bookmarks folder which
is cool I really like how easy it is to
use from the side menu just drop down
same thing here
downloads you know Firefox has their guy
in the corner chrome has a separate tab
for downloads this it lists them all
here and you can even pause downloads
and restart them with these buttons here
if I download the valve II see and let
me click him and pause no stop
oh there we go so he's just chilling
there and then I can play and if for
some reason you won't had a Donald ahead
priority or I could just clean them up
kind of neat and notes you just created
a note and say hey mom
I could tie it to a URL if I wanted but
I don't want to picture if I want to
know that's all I really want
I haven't actually created a note so let
me do hey hey hey hey
so I guess that might be useful at some
point let me close that out now like
Chrome you can press control shift B to
get your bookmarks folder here you can
press ctrl shift I to get your inspector
the only thing with the inspector that I
did not see which might be disappointing
to me is I don't see a way to attach it
to the window if anyone using this knows
how that'd be cool to know so what's
more is if you don't like these colors
you can change a lot on here you just
click the Val D tab and go to the tools
settings
all right a lot of stuff in here you
know just the basics where you want to
go the appearance the status bar at the
bottom you can hide that if you want and
this has a couple of features at the
very bottom so I'll just leave that on
you can change your interface color to a
dark browser that looks kind of cool
actually
Bob just leave it as default for now and
you can have horizontal menus so that
you have the file up here file edit view
and so if having to click the V so they
give you a lot of flexibility to
customize you can put the address bar at
the bottom too which is kind of neat I'd
be hard to get used to for me bookmark
bar there and you can put the bookmarks
at the bottom too if you want to and you
can display only icons text text and
icons cool then there's tabs obviously
you probably want your tab bar to be
shown but you can press the letter the
key f2 to get a list of all your open
tabs and a bunch of functions I won't go
through everything here I want to make
this video kind of quick
you can put your panels to the right
side so this guy's over here if you
preferred the quick commands I think
that's the f2 key looks like you're
gonna sign a bunch of shortcuts
downloads webpages stuttered at it okay
so I'll just quickly press f2 and you
see it'll list the tabs okay so press f2
and I have all my tabs here I could just
tie speed and it'll show tabs history
and all that that's pretty cool to me
and the speed dial guy is basically
whenever you open a new tab you can like
add these to lead them and like booking
I don't know what that is
News this is like a folder you can go
back and navigate it you can create your
own folder and you can add your own
stuff I'll just add that and it looks
like it's fetching a screenshot of the
page that's kind of cool and I should be
able to rename this to my stuff adds it
up here as well
and this new folder here looks like it's
chunk okay
so that's kind of cool how you can just
have a new tab and just flip through
things and then your bookmarks are
listed here or they're listed here as
well and your history of course and the
trash can at the top that shows your
recent history I'll go to a few sites
okay
so I go to those sites and then I'll
just close it and now click the trashcan
and it remember the last night I was at
but usually this keeps a history of old
tabs that you closed and you can always
clear them all and for fun down here
this little image icon it's a it's a
mountain actually you can show no images
and you might say well why is that
useful you can show only cached images
and show images because this is good for
a developer I you can do bunch of stuff
like make it black and white filter
grayscale the filter intensifying this
isn't even with a plugin also some
people don't like how like let's say I
go to Twitter you notice how this top
bar changes colors to blue it just
determines the site color you can change
that let me try alt P
okay I'd that's just to get to the
settings it probably under appearance
use page theme as user interface color
so no I'll make mine dark okay and then
you know it wouldn't change the tab
outline and everything and that's cool
you notice how I hover over and it has
that nice little drop down guy so yeah
you can go to the Chrome Web Store
I wish the search bar wasn't here but
you can stretch this out too if you want
and I just left DuckDuckGo as my default
so I'll just do Chrome add-ons search
for something this one's pretty popular
I don't use it but add to Chrome and mmm
there it is right there so it's a pretty
cool customizable browser if anyone has
any tips or tricks to post them in the
comments the reason they are making this
is cuz every browser now is going to
kind of a minimalist thing and it's very
limited and you're not really allowed to
customize your browser as much as you
used to and they want to give us back
that control if I right-click you know
they have the inspect element that I
showed you already this is basically
chrome underneath the hood alright
that's it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
