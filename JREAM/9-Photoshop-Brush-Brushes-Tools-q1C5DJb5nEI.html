and the story we're going to cover
photoshop brushes if you're working with
a tablet even better I don't have one
but if you do you should check this
little box here and depending on how
hard you're pressing your pen down it
will change the opacity and it'll look
more realistic so with the brush tool
selected I'm just going to go to window
brush or press f5 and we have all these
presets like regular brushes and you can
just change a lot of options in them
it's pretty impressive so we can just
paint something plain like that well it
gets really cool is when we want to use
all these features in here so let's say
I wanted to do a bow kyo effect which is
when you have a camera and you take a
picture and you get a lot of circles i
could do it with the brush tool so I'd
select the circle let's say shape
dynamics and I want to jitter the size
so that there's a lot of different sizes
and I want to scatter it so it's all
over the place and you can play these
controls and get a better feel for it
and then transfer this will make it look
a transparent and just put your opacity
jitter up there so I paint with this you
see how cool that looks there's a lot of
other settings here I mean what you can
do with this is really up to your
imagination the options are almost
unlimited but i'll show you what i mean
with this background first let me create
a gradient real quick and I'm just going
to do a green and a little bit darker
green and I'll go like this okay I'll
make a new layer and go back to my brush
tool and I'm just going to scatter some
of these across the top and this is it
might be a little busy but this is
generally what a bow kyo effect looks
like
now if we go to the mixer brush this is
actually pretty cool to a mixer is
exactly what it sounds like it mixes
colors like a real paintbrush and if I
just paint over things you can't tell a
whole lot but let's say I use on a
different color what would complement
that I'll just use a blue and if you mix
blue on the green you're getting kind of
a turquoise color let's try red a
brighter red and you can see while
you're painting it kind of smudges along
it you can play with it to blend the
color this would be really good if you
were painting a human face there are a
lot of brush presets that you can get
off the internet that are free you'll
probably have a good old time with and
to load those are just right click and
you click this arrow here and you would
go to load brushes and you'd probably
put it in your Photoshop folder way down
deep in here looks like it's all the way
down here I don't have any but then
that'll append to your list and there
they have some for you I don't think you
should use them kinda like these leaves
in the star because it's obvious that
you're just using the default settings
and it just doesn't come off as very
professional okay also there's the
pencil tool now this isn't the brush but
the pencil is more like for making hard
edges and for the most part I generally
use this for a 1 pixel line so I'll make
a new layer and i'll just select black
and you can make simple lines and you
might think well why would I want to do
that you'd most likely want to do that
four straight lines and different
elements for example let's say i had
this was a website background if it was
a little cleaner obviously and i had a
some content here and this was going to
be the content block
um let me make this white actually okay
so if we add text content in here we
could say all right I want a couple of
fancy lines to look decent I'd select
the pencil tool whoops and I'd hold
shift and just drag all the way across
and I probably select maybe another
lighter color and it kind of gives it
that nice little border I should mention
that you could also get this border with
the blending options right clicking here
and going to blending options and doing
stroke not sorry on this layer the white
layer and stroke size one but if you
wanted to do a couple lines you just
draw them manually okay so there's
really a lot to brushes that you could
do to make something really cool i'm not
going to go through every detail i
actually don't know everything but like
i haven't used the color replacement
tool for the most part i don't use the
brush tools because i'm mostly making
pretty simple layouts with gradients but
if you have a tablet you should
definitely definitely try that out
alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
