tutorial we're going to do jQuery AJAX
post and just start out as usual you
include your library and which have a
document ready function and down in the
body let's just create a div I'm just
gonna say div ID equals content and
close the div and that's where we'll
output stuff I'm just gonna do style
equals border one pixel solid thread so
that we know where it is and I guess
we'll say yeah let's just leave it like
that
okay and then we're going to make a form
and we'll just say form and end the form
and let's make a input button input type
equals text and the name let's just call
it name and let's do another one and
call it age and let's do a submit button
and whoops okay and let's give the form
an ID of form just in case we had other
forms on the page we want to call this
by the ID and I'll just pop name age and
a line break boom boom okay so refresh
and we have this name age submit and
there's our div up there and alright
let's get started so jQuery post we're
going to want that to happen on an event
that we submit the form so we're going
to do idea form dot submit function and
let's just do alert one as always make
sure it's working okay looks good and
now for the post to do post it's a lot
like gets you just do dot post and this
will be the URL and then we do a
function for the callback
and for the URL you're going to use
probably a separate page I'll do that in
a second first we want to take care of
function and the data that goes inside
here between these brackets is what's
going to come from this URL so this data
lines up with whatever the URL gives us
back so we're going to say um content
content dot HTML data and we're going to
put the data from the URL into there
okay and one thing we also want to do is
when we submit the form if you click
this it refreshes the page but we want
to return false so that only clicked the
form it's not going to reload the page
it's just going to do the Ajax so let's
make a new page and this will have PHP
code in it and I'll just say this as PHP
dot PHP let's just do a print our post
okay let me reload this document so I
get the colors there we go and for the
URL we're going to do PHP dot PHP okay
and right now it's not going to do
anything because it's not passing
anything into the form like you can
click this and we just get an array you
see if we fill in these forms it doesn't
do anything and that parameter goes
right here afterwards you can do like
little brackets here and say name Jessie
and age 25 and refresh submit and we
have an array here okay
so to do the form I think the best way
to do it is
to serialize it and that'll give you all
these things all these fields in the
form automatically so what we would do
we would say the form dot serialize and
what serializing does is kind of like
the URL when you're ever like this up
here okay
so let's pop this into the post instead
of just our predefined values and get
rid of that little line there so now
this will serialize the form for us and
put it in the post
okay so I'll refresh and just a this so
the name of the vet the name of the info
item dis which is name is going to be
the associative arrays name and the
value is whatever is inside the form so
what's cool about this is you could just
add more fields and let's just say
height and weight height and weight and
refresh and let's say name Jesse age 26
25
I'm almost 26 all right I'm height 6 for
weight 500 pounds and submit and now we
have this data to work with that's
really useful because like what we could
actually do is if we know the names of
the fields which you should which our
name age height weight you'd say post
name it was age weight height and height
okay so we'd have these and you can do
whatever you want you could do a a query
to insert data and you have to know PHP
to do this obviously or some other
servers
language and we can return something
let's say return it worked
let's do an if is so if is post
let's do if it's not empty if not empty
post then you grab all these posts else
return it didn't work okay and if you
want to do a DB you do all the stuff
here you could return errors so let's
see what happens we refresh click looks
like nothing's happening
the return isn't working sorry you have
to echo it okay echo submit it worked
I guess post is being set so that's a
pretty lousy example but hopefully this
gives you an idea of how to do this you
can also do jason encoding and you just
put comma jason afterwards and you have
to I think I believe Jason decode in PHP
and to send it back you do Jason encode
okay so you return like JSON encode and
if you're doing that your data you could
do it like HTML data age plus data dot
wait and that's uh maybe I'll do another
tutorial on Jason if I get the time and
that stands for JavaScript object
notation alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
