and it's python tutorial we're going to
assign variables and work with strings a
little bit so you have your little vital
program open here and it's not really
that interesting but we're just going to
use it to play around so let's assign a
variable and to do that you would give a
variable and name so the name then you
use the equal sign and you give it a
value so let's say 50 okay and hit enter
on the left is the variable name and on
the right is a value so if we wanted to
get the value of name we type name it
gives us 50 if you wanted to assign a
name that's not a digit you have to use
little strings so name equals John okay
and I'll do last equals Smith okay so if
I type name and last John Smith if I
wanted to combine those two on one line
I could say name plus last he says John
Smith now I'll make a middle name also
all sayings or a middle initial say
middle equals J just to show you that
you can use these quotes as well as
single quotes okay so I'll say name plus
middle plus last and we get John J Smith
if you want to put spaces between the
letters we'd say name plus then we use a
little quotes and make a space and then
plus middle plus and plus last and we'll
get John J Smith and let's work with
some numbers let's say a equals five and
B equals 200 okay and you say a B and
you can say a / b 0 b / whoops a is 40
you can do all the math as you would
normally in here if you're familiar with
math you could do parentheses to give it
a group so you could say a plus B times
a and you get some high number now
you'll notice if you want to reset this
shell how I can just type these
variables in there here if I go to shell
restart shell and I type it again these
variables aren't there so whatever
you're typing in here saves it for the
current session you're on until you
close it or if you refresh it so don't
panic if you lose your data if you do
you should usually do a file new window
and save your Python data in this file
but we're not going to do that just yet
and with strings what if we had
something like boss equals my name isn't
Ted okay and do you see how this black
comes out here it's because we're using
a single quote and Python thinks that
it's ending right here and this is
common in a lot of languages and it's
called escaping to fix it so we hit
enter we get a problem so boss equals my
name isn't Ted what we do is we add a
backslash like that and this just
escapes this so that Python knows it
isn't the last character this backslash
won't actually even up here it's just
escaping it so I hit enter type boss
says my name isn't Ted alternatively
alternatively you could say boss equals
with the double quotes
my name isn't Ted and you just say boss
you get the same results and you can
escape anything that you need to so if
we said
just say employee employee equals my
name is John okay
now same things happening we'd have to
backslash that and backslash that enter
cool another way to do it I'm not sure
how to pronounce this it's called
concoct ination something like that but
you could say let's say friend equals my
name is okay and then to connect another
string we say plus Jesse and enter and
type in friend there we go there's also
a ways to do different lines of text and
this is called a newline character and
it looks like backslash N and let's just
say pal equals I like to talk slash end
which means newline about a lot of
things slash and for another new line
and I like to sing okay so hit enter and
I hit pal and that did not work let's
say print pal there we go so if we just
typed owl pally gives us the variable
value and if we print it out it'll
format the newline characters for us so
to get started with Python just remember
you start with a name name of a variable
and you give the value over here if it's
a number it should pretty much be a
number if it's a string it should pretty
much just be a string but you can put
numbers in here like that
enter and name plus Bank
and you can't mix those because ones
that integer another's a bank so those
are not the same types okay I think this
is a pretty good start and I hope it
helped you out thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
