about sessions and a session is used to
transfer data from page to page or say
when a page refreshes because as you
know every time a page loads the data is
reparse and a session can pass data from
page to page okay so a good way to show
you let's just end the PHP tags and
create a link now let's call that other
page I've already made the file here and
I'll just make a link back to the index
page so what we do to start a session we
type session start and the next thing we
do is let's use the super global session
and let's give a little name here let's
say user equals Jimmy okay and if we
refresh the page other page index so our
session started but we can't see it go
to the other page and since it's a
separate page you want to do sessions
start once again and echo session user
and as you see Jimmy we passed it along
the other page and the session will stay
consistent as long as you just keep
going mm-hmm one thing you'll want to
know is in your PHP ini file your
session saved path
this is where PHP saves your sessions
and what that looks like is this and it
looks like a crazy-looking file but if
you look inside all it is is serialized
data and you don't really need to worry
about serializing and on serializing
right now there's also something called
session name and you see it here and
what you can do depending on your
settings is type question mark PHP
session ID and take your session here
and type it in there and you can hijack
someone's session so a good suggestion
might be to regenerate the ID by doing
session regenerate ID and what this does
is you see this temp folder let's go
back and forth a few times and you see
we have a new ID every time and I guess
you could imagine this is going to get
kind of full if you had like 200 users
and kind of ridiculous
these will delete themselves after they
expire but if you want to keep things a
little tidy or just pop in the word true
and this will delete it the old one
after it renames it so let me just
delete all these click back and forth a
few times and f8 kay see these letters
refresh a couple times and you see it
changes it just makes it harder for
someone to hijack your session if you
want to destroy
a session you would do session destroy'
let's make a link and just do destroy
and we'll do if is that we request
destroy session destroy
okay and the session was destroyed now
if you want to see if that's working try
to put in a session superglobal well it
looks like it did not work so oh that's
because uh right up here it's starting
it and then destroying it and still
setting the user so this will probably
work in a different circumstance like
this is session destroy' is not set then
we you know i think that makes sense
and so sessions are good and you know
pretty basic to use you can store a lot
of things in them and that should help
you get started with sessions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
