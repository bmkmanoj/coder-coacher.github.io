tutorials we're going to start learning
Python now I'm not an expert in Python
and I'm gonna learn a little bit while I
go through some tutorials but I'll try
to help you as well along the way python
is really easy to type and it looks very
attractive it's not like many other
programming languages except it looks
like Ruby which I've never used I've
just seen the syntax it runs on all the
operating systems you'll need it can be
used for games websites and operating
system GUIs
here's a game that uses Python called
continual and they use this to program
box that interact with the users they've
got some pretty complex things in there
I've looked through some of the Python
code and there's Django
which is a framework this is Bill
somewhat like a Model View controller
but it's Model View template the one of
the developers calls it there's TK enter
which is 4gu is a GUI again is like this
window you see here and there's also WX
python 4gu eyes as well and they make
these little windows and you can program
these to do things so to get started
let's go to Python org and download and
I downloaded the 2.7 windows installer
you just get what you need and after you
install it just go to your file area and
open up idle
it's called idle Python GUI and you'll
get this little white window and it
looks a little confusing this is where
you can type in Python code and learn it
little by little if you just type in the
number 5 it'll say 5 if I say print
hello it'll say hello and I'll go
through the syntax fairly slow and you
can also go to file new window
if you wanted to let's say you had a
couple lines of code and it just won't
fit on this little thing here you could
say print hello print my name is Jesse
and you would have to save it so file
save as test just replace that then go
to run and run module or just click f5
and you can run it inside this shell
here
one other thing to know is that if you
create a function and don't worry about
knowing this right now but let's just
say def hello and let me move this up
here and tab these over whoops okay
I'll save that impressive f5 and you see
it does nothing that's because the hello
function wasn't called
but this is now registered inside the
Python shell so I could type hello and
it'll give us those results okay so now
we're gonna go over the syntax and let's
just start with a couple basic you can
use the pound sign to make a comment and
the comment is something that won't
appear in the software it only appears
to the person programming it so if I
needed to tell someone that this
function says hello now it's pretty
obviously obvious what the function does
but this is an example of it and if you
hit run and you type hello it just
outputs the same stuff
there's also multi-line comments which
is three quotation marks like this and
you could tell you this could be a
document block blah blah blah and from
here to here this won't appear because
it's a comment we rerun it I'll just
type arms hello and it gives us that
so it's always good practice to comment
your code obviously not with something
this useless and the way Python is
written is with tabs so these tabs make
a difference if I said def hello if I
put this line here and it wasn't tabbed
over the only thing that would be in the
hello function would be this one and
even though this looks like it's right
below it if I hit f5 and I type hello it
only says hello so the tabs are
important and okay I think I'll make a
couple other tutorials and we'll start
working on the syntax and doing some fun
things hopefully this is a very easy
introduction to what we're going to do
not everything is going to be done in
this Python shell either you can do a
lot with it but this will just help you
get started alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
