go over some GU eyes and some of the
most popular Linux distros so I'm
running VMware Workstation yes I paid
for and it was worth the money I love
this application so the reason I can run
all these is because this PC has 32 gigs
of memory
I bought it over time it's Corsair
Vengeance I don't play video game that's
really to run virtual machines and 32
gigs is kind of expensive over time so
I'll boot into Debian and I'll boot into
Ubuntu and well look at these two first
reason being is so we don't get too
confused
okay so bunt is gonna boot Debian is
gonna boot now Debian uses gnome 3 let
me log this guy in I just use a simple
little password for my local guys and
then a bunch of boots up so I'm gonna
fullscreen this and if you're not
familiar with a bun - it comes and it
looks kind of dated with all the square
icons in the unity bar it uses something
called unity rather than gnome so we
have like cinnamon gnome - gnome 3 in
unity and they switch from gnome to the
older bun - to gnome or to unity in a
bun - and it's pretty good
you obviously want to change these icons
to what I have in my opinion this is
called new mix and um IX I don't think
it'll show up here yeah but this little
guy up here is the main button so you
would press like your windows key to
search for seis lime text and you could
open it there
or Firefox and you can change your
filter results here like I don't want to
search Amazon or online stuff I always
turn that off because it can slow stuff
down and then they have stuff down here
which I never use video audio and all
that honestly just go straight to my
file manager like that and this theme
again this is not the default bun to
theme I used tweak UI tweak UI let me
get rid of that what's interesting also
is on my virtual machine I get this to
cover the whole screen on a laptop or
solo not inside of a virtual machine it
only covers a certain amount and I can't
remember why so don't know what happened
there I might have to reinstall it but
unity tweak tool lets you adjust your
icons and themes
the other one is compiz that's a great
one I haven't tried these out on the
other operating systems but with this
you can customize everything so we'll
take a look at opening two chrome
windows let me do a new window here okay
and I'm gonna show you the alt tab and
here we have so I'm focused on Google
Chrome now the blinking is not normal
it's probably because I'm in recording
mode right now and then you go over here
there's not two so it just shows that
okay all nice see if there's a super tab
nope
and then there's the nah shoot
okay so this thing is the virtual
workspace switcher which is really nice
I bound mine to super key s and it works
great you can just drag windows over
whoops
unless you let go I've had this happen
before
look at that haha what a pain so I press
Super S again to get back it happens
once in a blue moon I think it's if you
let go like that no it still works I
don't know how I get it to happen but
for the most part it works good I just
used ctrl alt and my arrow keys to
switch desktops and obviously in their
settings you can change your workspaces
do they have workspaces in here no
that's a comp is setting whoops
con pays and we're spending a lot of
time on this work what do they call it
that deducted workspaces well I think
it's tweak UI which I have to fix the
package for so I can't show you that and
the keyboard I just found some shortcuts
like terminal by default is ctrl alt T
and then the file I did the windows way
of super e whoops and seems like version
15s causing me some problems so I'm
gonna close down a bump too cuz that's
using eight gigs of memory and here's
the Debian this is gnome 3 they put the
clock in the middle it looks very clean
and minimal I do like that right-click
the desktop just change the background
see what they have has a cute little
loader icon alright so they come with a
few backgrounds
this one looks pretty select okay now
one thing I don't like off the bat is up
here in settings you see the icon there
kind of overlaps that I do kind of wish
they move it over a little more maybe
there's a way to mess with it so I'll
just click that and this is where things
get interesting you don't really have
anything here but you can press
activities or the super key and you have
this this is your main area to do
everything like that so I'll open
calculator just click it I'll press this
again and let's open terminal okay and
it's a little strange because right now
terminal is only here and now
calculators there it doesn't show them
as a list like you would maybe in Nome 2
or windows which I find a little
frustrating but what we can do is check
the whoops settings by searching and I
believe it's either displays or let's
check this place I don't think this is
it yeah looks like they changed that
setting around a little bit does there's
a way to change the windows at least an
Ubuntu I don't know if you can do that
natively in here that would be nice
and what that would allow is basically
well actually they wouldn't allow that
because that would put this icon or this
the window options to this down here but
they're already right here so my mistake
alright so let's open up to calculators
not used to these icons so sorry
there's calculator
did it not open another one okay right
click new window okay so we have to and
let's do alt tab and here this I really
like versus the Ubuntu way where it
doesn't spread out your taskbar but
rather you now have to use the arrow
keys to go down and it's easier you
can't alt tab and flip to it though
see if I alt tab it goes off it but
that's really nice so back to this area
our virtual desktops are right here so
right now I'm on the second desktop and
I'll go to the first so if I want to put
this window over there I should be able
to drag it there and you probably can't
see my cursor but it has a hand and an
arrow and I'll slide over here and now
this appears here and it just creates an
extra one an empty one I'll drag this
calculator in a middle spot right here
and you see this little light up guy
that just creates a new one rather than
using that guy there okay so let's try
super s okay so super s is a little
different it shows all of your desktops
on the side I'm sure there's a way to
customize this and probably some hotkeys
to flip through these so just briefly
let's just check these settings
and do they have one for workspaces I
feel like it's missing some settings
honestly all right I'll try keyboard
navigation move window switch workspaces
ctrl alt left ctrl all right okay so
this okay I see they're all up and down
okay
this control all up and down I am NOT a
fan of at all
they don't have previews and also if you
press down it just disappears
immediately
I'm sure you could customize it to look
a little bit better overall I think
they're onto something kind of cool here
show applications huh oh it looks kind
of Mac like this stuff that area that
nobody uses but I think it's kind of
cool my issue is the productivity I
don't know if I could actually be super
productive in it but you know it took me
a while to adapt to a bunt to a little
bit from Windows also their menus here
are very beautiful
I would say this is a beautiful
operating system
and if you like gnome 3 it's it's
definitely a cool option with that said
you do not have to use Debian for gnome
3 you can use it in other os's ok so I'm
going to power on elementary and Power
on Mint and Elementary has gained
massive popularity over time it has a
pretty little boot screen
Ubuntu does too I feel and that's an e
for elementary now Elementary is it
reminds you of a Apple Computer OS X so
the benefit is that it's free and they
don't charge you for everything ok so
that's ok there we go
now they have this down little intro
sound they have the stock at the bottom
and what I like about this if I go to
system settings watch this little icon
jiggle I know it's like 2015 and that
should be common but for some reason
unity on Ubuntu it doesn't seem to
animate for me I don't know if I could
get used to a bottom bar like this it's
a little too Mac like for me but if you
like it it's cool and similar to gnome 3
we have the clock in the middle here the
no the gnome 3 clock or calendar looks a
lot better in my opinion this is just
kind of clustered together too much so
if I go to applications it's a lot
different it doesn't open up a whole
window it's more like a gnome - ish
kinda or cinnamon which you'll see
shortly and if I just let's say calc
calculator let's try to quell again try
to open two of them
okay did open - okay and let's look at
the alt tab okay so the alt tab is a lot
different it's it's unique at the bottom
you see that it doesn't bundle them up
so there's two which is fairly
interesting so it's like there's bottom
bars like King got to get used to that
bottom bar I'm sure there's a way to
adjust this doc I don't know how to get
to the settings right now let's see
multitasking with you all right so this
is the virtual desktops here it's a
little strange I don't know why this
one's so little at the moment so I'll
press super s and that's the usually the
view like this and then we have a
desktop over here that we can go to and
if we click it again we're in it so I'll
open some photos okay open up the file
browser my hotkeys aren't bound so I'll
have to just type files
and just looking at this it reminds you
of a Mac I think it looks pretty nice
and clean control L you know you can do
all the same commands to type in a full
path if you wanted so it's all
relatively the same you can see all the
commonalities between these it's just
this is this is really just GUI changes
it seems Ethernet connection Bluetooth
notifications and same thing with
logging in and out using Freya so this
is still pretty new I thought this was
still in beta but maybe it's not and you
can see I'm only using two gigs of
memory for this because I don't use it
yet I just play with it right now
so our virtual desktop switcher let's
try the hotkeys all right they didn't
work let's try settings keyboard
workspaces and move to the left okay it
looks like they have a Apple symbol I
think that means option they really I
don't have an option up what is up
option right me
oh it's just option right okay okay cool
and if you try to go more says no no
well that's nice so left and right it
looks like it's a horizontal one maybe
you can adjust it and if I press it down
I can look at this if I want to add a
new one I can press I guess I have to
click I'm not a master with the hotkeys
okay this video is getting long and
let's lastly look at Mynt
okay so for the benefit of mint I just
changed the background because the
current background it comes with it it
seems kind of dated I also moved the
menu to the top because growing up my
dad always had a Start menu on Windows
95 at the top so I've always had that as
a habit anytime I had this so mint
there's a lot I like about it not just
men really but the cinnamon UI that's
really what we're focused on it's very
customizable and just boom right in your
face
so if I click menu and let's just say
what do I got on here I'll just type T
Chrome okay so I want chrome to be in
this quick launch I'll right click Add
to panel there's Chrome right in the
quick launch and I can click that guy
and it actually animates which is nice
I'm sure you could change those okay and
don't mind the speed here it doesn't
really have much to do with anything I
don't know how much CPU or whatever I
dedicated to each of these I think it's
just one core in only two gigs of RAM so
the animations and stuff will be quite
slow
let's look up chrome again yeah
right-click and add to favorites and it
appears here you can just drag it around
terminal and I really like that and just
like everything else
we should be able to do an update with
the apt manager it's quite nice now
let's look at the virtual desktops
let's press Super S which is strange all
right so I'm gonna go to settings you
might be saying why are you looking at
virtual desktops so much because
productivity bra is it there like is it
general all settings okay and they have
a lot more settings here than say the
elementary you can just tell cuz the
scrolls workspaces okay
I know a hockey to switch left and right
but I'm looking for the expose type of
thing if I hold ctrl alt I was like a
windy noise well that's interesting ctrl
alt down it shows all oval ok sorry let
me slow down it's hard to remember all
these operating systems and I'm not good
with all of them so ctrl left and right
will switch control out down is like
what windows are open on your current
screen and then control all up has the
workspace switcher and at the right we
can add another one and another one
looks like we can just keep adding them
and nice we can drag them so that is
pretty cool open the home folder and
control all up and I'll drag this all
the way over here and that's cool if you
don't want that workspace display there
you can change that and work spaces and
OSD I believe means on screen display so
just take
other than that the rest of this is
pretty much the same stuff pretty cool
so it really depends on what you like
using I think that would probably
summarize this again Linux Mint does not
have to you do not have to run cinnamon
which is the GUI on Linux Mint you do
not have to run gnome 3 on debian and
Elementary I actually don't know what
that is called I don't know if you have
to use that it almost looks like its own
thing so choose what you want for a GUI
if you want they're all free which is
wonderful I still use a bun - because
I'm so familiar with it but there are a
lot of things to be desired mostly with
the GUI if I if you want my opinion on
what I think is best GUI wise
I'd say Elementary visually maybe ties
with Debian visually functionality I
think mint or cinnamon is the best and
then second place in functionality would
be a bun - and then maybe I think a
bunch is the ugliest but one of the most
efficient ok this video is long thanks
