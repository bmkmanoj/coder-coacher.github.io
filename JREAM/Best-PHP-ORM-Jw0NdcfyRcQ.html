going to show you an or RM for PHP
that's possibly one of the nicest I've
seen to date it's called red bean PHP
and you can go ahead and download it and
you'll get a tar.gz file and once you
finally extract it you'll just have one
file called RB dot PHP it's a little
smaller than 300 kilobytes and what I
did in my local host is I just created a
red bean folder and an index file and
I'm going to show you how to use it with
crud operations and it's extremely easy
first thing you do is require RB or red
beans dot PHP and setting it up is just
like setting up a my sequel connection
with PDL or you could use SQLite or
whatever you prefer and then your login
and password so let's get started the
first thing is this thing works with
beans all right so let's create a bean
and I'll say book well that's in there
tutorial let's make it a little more
interesting I'll say user equals our
dispensed user and what we do is this is
an or I'm an object relational mapper so
we're actually going to map properties
to the object so I'll say user login
equals Jessie user password equals sha-1
fish
user email equals test to test comm and
lastly I'll just do user money equals
100 and you'll see why I went I put that
there because we're going to go back to
it so to save this I'll say Fred Beans
store user and this will actually create
the table I already have my database are
be here created so here it is right here
and what I'll do is I'll refresh the
page I'll go back to my database and now
I have a user table and look at that it
created an auto incrementing ID and all
this other junk in there extremely easy
to use this we can also give this an ID
and echo out the ID of what's created so
refresh there's the ID so that's how you
create ok and I will say this when you
actually use this - for a live thing
you're going to want to run red beans
fries - true and this will prevent new
rows and tables from being created
dynamically you'll want that because
I'll just use a lot more power to keep
checking it and creating it if they
don't exist but for development purposes
you don't need it at all
so that's how we create so great let's
do an update
so an update what we do is our load and
we just type in our table name and we're
just work on one table now so I'll say
user and I have an idea of one I know
because we already created one and I
need to give this a variable I'll just
give it the variable you just so it
looks a little different from this guy
up here so this is loading an existing
guy'll say you log in equals Dogface and
then i'll say our store you refresh and
I'll go here an ID of 1 is now Dogface
extremely easy to do updates this just
grabs it based on the ID okay let's do a
delete oops I'll say mu equals our load
user 1 once again and I'll say our trash
of U so we should no longer have an idea
of 1 after our refreshes so it's here
right here idea of 1 now refresh the
page and there it is it deleted it
easy peasy I mean this is extremely nice
very good job to the author of this so
we also need a lot of things like
finding and all that so I'm going to go
ahead and delete this crap and we're
going to do some finding I'll say user
equals red beans find all users
and whoops I'll refresh and if I'm
something but I got to print it out let
me I call it a pre right up here so it's
easier to read and boom we'll get an
array of all these red bean objects so
with all these red bean objects if we
actually knew what we wanted to load we
could actually grab it out of this array
we could say red beans load of the user
table user 3 ID and I'll call this block
just running the sample let's see if
that works for us refresh and we have
this object here and what we can do is
bla logon equals Pigpen and our store of
blah okay so we search for something we
just created our own little section of
it that we want to update and let's see
if we get a blonde here or sorry Pigpen
and there's Pigpen and let's go back to
this here you see I have money here I'll
change this to dot 43 and you can't
store an integer or a float inside of a
tiny int field so what's red bean new it
takes care of it for us refresh whoops
let me it makes it a double and here it
is 100 point 4 3 it's a pretty smart
system man
we're going to do a couple of fetches
because you always want to fetch stuff
so I'll say are get all and we can use
plain my sequel queries so I'll say
select all from user I'll just call this
data and printout of data refresh and
look at all that crap sweet we can do
get ro now this is in their
documentation and it's pretty much
almost exactly what I'm going over but
you might like to see someone do it
because you actually realize hey this is
kind of cool you can also get you can
bind values to player ID equals question
and I'll say since it's a question mark
I'll say three it'll probably just give
me like a value of already done so three
actually don't have a oh there it is
Pigpen refresh and here's Pigpen
ridiculously easy you can also bind
values so I could do : ID and pass an
associative array and we should get the
same thing whoops and there it is once
again so oh yeah I will say that this
little array thing here I'm doing this
is in PHP 5.4 you might have to type it
out like this if you don't have the
latest and greatest and that's pretty
much it for the basics you can also
create your own models with something
they have called fuse but for very easy
crud operations this is probably the
number one best forum I've seen pretty
much due to its simplicity and how easy
it is to use
olessa i'll say you can also do our
exact so if you wanted to believe from
user
user ID equals set I'll just say three
boom refresh and there's no more number
three super super easy to use and I hope
you guys think it's cool
