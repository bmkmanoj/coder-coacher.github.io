we're going to make some orbs or balls
that look kind of like this and they
don't really mean anything but it's kind
of fun to play around to get ideas with
so these are pretty easy first we're
going to hold down this will drop down
box on the square and select the ellipse
tool and I'm going to hold shift and
make a circle pretty easy and press the
letter v as in vicky's on your keyboard
and you get your black arrow tool and
when you're over this you see the arrow
loses the little pointer thing that just
means it's on top of an object and I'm
going to hold alt to get that little
white air under it and this means we're
going to duplicate and I'm going to hold
shift as well and then let go your mouse
key then you can let go your alt and
shift key and I'm going to press ctrl D
as in dog to duplicate and that's a good
one to remember I brought that up a lot
it's under object transform and
transform again you'll use that line if
I did it again it make another circle
but I only want three and i'm going to
select all of these i'm going to flip
these around the color swatches and i'm
going to get rid of this white one okay
that's just so i can see it and to get a
nice gradient color to save us time we
can go to swatches and this little menu
here we click this and all the way at
the bottom you see something that says
open swatch library and they have a ton
of pre-made colors that are really good
for people who struggle with colors like
me I'm color retarded and let's go to
gradients and I picked um gems and
jewels
okay and it'll pop up a little box with
all these so pick some colors you like
I'll do that ruby color this time and I
didn't like the orange much so how about
blue ok cool and one by one we're going
to make these a radial gradient don't
select them all or else you're going to
change all their colors so first select
one of them and go to your gradient tool
box and you see the ticker here how it's
kind of a darker blue in a darker blue
on each edge we want to get rid of one
of these so you're going to hold down on
the left one I'm holding my mouse right
now and you can tell because I'm able to
move it I'm just going to drag down okay
you don't have to drag it down fast I
was just being dramatic and let's slide
this one over to the left okay and this
color isn't very dark here so i'm going
to double-click it and with this little
tool box open i'm going to drag some
blue down or green down okay that'll be
better and for the type i'm going to
change this to radial arrow though and
let's change the rest of these two
radial just click it type radial click
it type radial and you can see why we're
dragging off this edge color just drag
this off slide this over and you can see
that this one looks really faded and
there's this little diamond piece at the
top and this stretches how much of a
transition you want and where to go so
you can slide this over until you think
it looks good looks good to me and one
more looks like this red has a couple of
colors so I'll just get rid of two of
these move this over
there we go all right so far so good so
for the this or born first is what I'm
going to do first of all first we need
to actually change this gradient you see
I have the gradients kinda at the bottom
let me do that first I'll click these
and select the gradient tool and a
little below this thing where it's
already made so this tool doesn't pop up
just kind of drag down and I'm holding
shift so that it's you know fixed I'm
going to make it just a little smaller
than the circle okay and you don't have
to stop using this tool and go to your
black arrow to select another one hold
the ctrl key down and click this and
then let go of the control key and now
we can use our tool again and just kind
of do the same thing control let go boom
click and that's pretty cool so back to
this we're going to make this little
glow at the top kind of so well let me
press V and I'm going to hold alt and
use my mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and
I'm going to click this and hold alt so
I can duplicate it and I'll hold shift
as well just to move it up okay and what
we're going to do is resize this a
little bit so first I'll go to one the
corners hold alt so that it resizes from
the center and a whole shift as well so
a little smaller and I'll just drag this
on top
okay and then I shall stretch this
smaller like so and this thing's all out
of whack so we're just going to make a
totally different gradient I'm going to
click this drop down thing and do fade
to black instead of black here i'm going
to do white okay and this black color
over here this should also be white okay
not too tricky and I I don't like the
shape here because it doesn't it's not
round with the circle so I'm actually
going to draw a new one I'll just move
that over there and with the circle tool
I'm just going to drag and I need to
move this I'm going to hold space and
find something that you think looks good
I think that looks pretty cool and now
let's select our gradient tool and I'm
going to try this way once again oops
this is a raid this is a linear gradient
sorry I forgot about that I want to
drive from top to Bob I don't want to go
too far down
ok and I'll press envy and click and
that's not too bad looking it's kind of
cool-looking ok so i'll delete this
little one and for this little kind of
shape thing nothing too fancy or
spectacular i'll just make a circle and
this went over top of this ok and i can
use the same gradient to have a lot of
fun with two others drag this one
upwards you know these are going to be a
little bit different no big deal and I'm
going to hold the Alt key and drag up a
little bit and then press ctrl D now
you'll notice that this has these
circles here still so what we want to do
is either draw inside create a layer
mask or um use the pathfinder to cut it
and I'm going to use the pathfinder to
cut it because I'm a little bit old
school like that so I'm going to click
this red shape and hold ctrl to copy
ctrl c and i'm going to press ctrl f the
letter f as in food and it looks like it
did nothing but hold your horses a
second because this just paste it in
front and you're like and paste it in
front of what well it pasted the same
object in front of itself and it doesn't
look like a do anything so i'm going to
do is hold ctrl shift and the right
bracket it's right next to your Enter
key and that will move it to the front
okay and what I'm going to do is we have
three little lines circles here so I'm
going to do that two more times ctrl c
ctrl f ctrl f boom okay so i'll just
select one of these bad boys and i'm
going to select the circle to
I click and then I hold shift and I'm
selecting two of them and then let's go
to our Pathfinder tool and let's do
subtract oh bummer wrong one you see we
want to subtract the outside not the
inside so I'm going to select this and
I'm going to move it to back with ctrl
shift and the left bracket and I got to
unclick and click again to move these
ones also okay so that's a little
confusing huh let's try that again it
didn't work again looks like I'm out of
luck today so I'm just going to skip
that for now let's do the same thing
over here but we're going to draw the
circle inside okay looks like i have the
color i don't want so with this still
selected i'll press I and click that
little circle and here's a cool thing go
to UM transparency and i'm going to
select this type of transparency and do
soft light okay and i want to change the
direction of this well that's a little
too light when it says soft light it
means soft light like real soft okay
and I can alt drag these on top of it
and that's kind of how I got that affect
a little bit except i put these
ingredients and to do the shadow i just
made a circle i'm going to press the
letter X sorry the letter D to get to
the default colors and make a little
shadow shape here and get rid of this
little stroke and for the gradient I did
a kind of the same thing here fade to
black and with the gradient tool you're
just going to drag down to whatever you
think looks good and of course we need
to send this to back again you could
right click and say select oh sorry
arrange send to back and these are the
hotkeys i'm using shift control in this
left bracket okay and I'll just drag
this over here and I'll do it once more
cool now sorry about messing up on this
part a little bit I'll actually try to
do that right now I'm just going to
select a square so I'm selecting all
these and control x to cut and I'm going
to click this and I'm going to attempt
to draw inside so let's see if we're
drawing inside now cool it looks like we
are so I'll press ctrl V and we'll get
all these things here and let me delete
this thing that I messed up here it
looks like it's going to be hard to
click that thing
because it actually it almost looks kind
of cool like a plan it okay so I don't
want you guys to get stuck on something
like this okay so I'm just going to drag
this shape up and click this circle and
delete it and I can move these up okay
let's move these down and double click
to get out of there that's kind of cool
looking and I'm going to alt drag this
once more over and just for fun I'm
going to change these to soft light to
show you that it's kind of cool that's
under transparency and the type will do
soft light looks like this one had a
little trouble with the color there but
you can get a lot of cool effects with
soft light and all that jazz so you I'll
make this available for download and
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
