to work on a Zen framework project to
get familiar with how it works if you're
not able to set this up just watch my
previous tutorial and what we're going
to do is go to our working folder here
mine just happens to be in workspace Zen
D and our public folder here this is a
where this is actually going to URL
however everything Maps through this
application controllers folder and I
will show you so what we're going to do
is create our own controller the index
controller is obviously the main page
and you see all this code you can copy
this and create your own controller if
you want and rename like this part here
- what you want to rename it however I'm
going to use Windows PowerShell and I'm
going to go to my directory where it's
located and I know if you're on the
right place you'll see dot CF project
XML now we can use the command line and
I'll say Z F for Zen framework create
controller and I'll call this one test
okay and what happens is we get a new
test controller here and it just wrote
it for us now controller
this handles the URL and where it goes
so it's called test controller and
basically if we go to slash oops test we
now have a script for test our URL
address and what loads is the index
action if you don't type anything else
as you know websites work like that so I
could say echo one and refresh and we
get a one there and what is nice about
the controller creation is that also
creates the views for you which is in
views scripts and we have this test
folder and this is for all the test
pages that we're going to create so if I
go in here and I have the index pH tml
and you can see index action lines up
with index.html and what we're going to
do is create another action so I'll just
create a new text document and I'll call
this chat P HTML open I'll just say chat
thing and a horizontal rule I guess
let's see what index has um okay and
what we're going to do is make a new
thing here public function chat action
and I'll say echo I'm in the chat method
okay
and if I move that down a little bit now
I can go to slash chat and it loads our
view and it also outputs any data here
pretty cool so what if we wanted to
assign variables from PHP to the actual
page it's quite easy I could do
something like this instead of putting
this all here I could say on this which
refers to the test controller here this
view
a sign and if you ever use smarty it's
very similar so I could assign msg this
is a message old data okay so now I can
access msg inside of the view and I'll
just say echo this msg and refresh and
this is a message that holds data now if
you have short tags on you could also do
it like that which is how it would be a
little shorter it's up to you if we
wanted to create a layout that was the
same on every page which you probably
will what you would do is you would go
to you want to enable layouts and these
aren't on by default so you would type
ZF enable layouts looks like I didn't
type that right was it layout err
ZF enable layout okay and that will
appear in our application folder and
layout scripts and layout P HTML and
this is basically like a wrapper for all
your content so you could put a div id
equals header in here this is my header
welcome to my gf okay and I'll refresh
that and you can see on every page will
have this layout we can put it at the
bottom to Twitter okay
and refresh and it's pretty easy one
thing you might notice is if we have
let's say application controllers test
controller let me create a function I'll
say public function other action and if
I'll just say echo 22 we're going to get
an error so slash other and we have an
application err and it's kind of like
well what's going on and we have no idea
what we need to do is make sure Zend is
in development mode so that we can see
errors now just the way I installed it I
just quickly went through it and don't
have that environment variable set and a
quick and easy way to do that would be
to go into public here HT access and
we'll just do set and
application and development okay and
what this does is in configs application
to i and i these are our development
environments testing development and
basically we just set the environment to
development so that the PHP settings
will show startup errors display errors
and exceptions I know this is probably
very confusing if you're new to this it
is it is difficult to get started with
but hey
and I'll refresh and here's the message
script test other dot PHP ml not found
and this will save you a lot of time if
you start creating methods and you
forget to put something in there so I
would go to scripts test and I'll just
call this other refresh and we don't
have an error and obviously in
production mode you would remove this
and probably change this to whoops
production alright so that's a quick
start on Zen framework you may have to
go through the video twice to understand
what's going on because we're doing a
lot and good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
