going to step into the command console
in mysql and if you're using Windows
I'll show you real quick you need to
right-click your my computer icon and go
to advanced system settings and on the
Advanced tab head over to environment
variables and down here under path the
variable of path you would go to edit
and include your executable for mysql
okay and once you do that you'll be able
to use command prompt in windows to load
mysql just by typing mysql and you know
you would also use this if you have
linux connection to your web server so
it's pretty good so here's how we do it
you can do this in an SSH by the way you
type mysql dash you and that stands for
passing the parameter of the user if
you've ever used linux you're probably
familiar with commands like this and i'm
going to login as root and if you need
to type in a password type dash p I
don't need to but i'll just type this
anyways and for password i'm just going
to leave the blank and now we're in
mysql a couple commands first i want to
show you to type exit okay and that's
how we get out of it just type exit so
let me get back and I'm back in we would
start with show databases and if you hit
enter you'll see there's this little
arrow coming here because you always
have to end your command with that semi
call one to execute the command now the
casing isn't important in here if it's
just easier to type lowercase go ahead
and do that and like before let's do use
learning okay and then we can type show
tables and we can see what's in here if
we want to see let's say how a table is
built we could type described posts
and this is actually a very clean thing
to copy and paste well I don't maybe I
have to use PowerShell to copy and paste
here oh that's embarrassing you know you
can use the same commands like we can
say drop well I don't want to drop
anything let's do a select star from
posts and we can see everything prints
out nice and pretty so you can do all
your same stuff we could say create
table blah and we'll say of ID int 11
not null auto increment comma primary
key will be ID and query okay now I'll
do show tables and there's blah and how
about drop table blah ok and show tables
I don't really need to go through all
this with you guys because we've been
doing a lot of this I will just say when
you're typing out a command let's say
you're typing a query let's say select
star from you can go ahead and hit enter
and it will let you do a few more lines
it doesn't end until you do that
semicolon so no worries there I will
just say posts inner join users as you
on you to ID equals post sign user it's
not as a friendly in here as it is in a
little hidey SQL but it's nice to know
the options open if you're ever on ssh
alright guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
