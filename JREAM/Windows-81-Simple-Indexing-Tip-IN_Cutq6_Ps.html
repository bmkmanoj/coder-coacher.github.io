video about a little trick in Windows
let's say you need to search for certain
files and it doesn't want to cooperate
like with special dates you see I have
these numbers 7 15 2013 if i go to my
files you'll see they'll have dashes and
when i try to look for stuff that
doesn't actually give me what i want and
you can index separate hard drives I
just have this one edrive I don't know
why I called a mattock but it's just to
hold my videos because I have a solid
state hard drive that's only 128 gigs
and you know videos take a lot of space
and i'm on windows 8 here I know it
looks like Windows 7 and actually paid
five bucks for this start menu windows
8.1 is actually on here too but they the
start menu brings you up to you know
this screen and I really don't use it
that much but that's off docket topic so
if I hit start and just go to index
that's all I have to type and indexing
options you just have to go to modify
and then you can select which strikes
you want to index like I think external
storage would be useful as well but you
see I kicked automatic and I just had
that indexed and I hit ok and it shows a
pause button here and it looks like
indexing for 15 minutes so once I do
that I'll be able to find files much
better
so here we go i'll paste this guy in and
there it is it found the file yeah if i
did not have indexing on um it won't
find the file because it's not smart
enough so there's a little trick for you
windows users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
