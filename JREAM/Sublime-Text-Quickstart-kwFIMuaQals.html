sublime text in the comments so I'll do
a video about it and you can go ahead
and download it it works with every OS
Windows Linux and Mac so what I have
here is sublime text and right now if
you download it you might not have the
sidebar the way to get the sidebar is
just to go to file open folder and from
here I'll just pick something and it
opened a new window for a folder and
this is just a code another project so
while we're sitting here it looks like
well what's this file and this is what
confused me it's just sitting here and
it's not really a file so I already test
in it and it's really not a file until
you save it so if I hit control s I
could save it if I like or I can close
it and it'll warn you not safe but one
of my biggest confusions was this when I
click a file I think it's open but
really this is just a preview
so if I click index and I'm kind of
scrolling through it I might hum oh I
found what I'm looking for right here I
click htaccess and then we go where'd
that file go so the biggest habit I had
to get used to is double-clicking a file
and you'll know it's open by up at the
top one of the things you might be
wondering is why does yours look a lot
different and it's because I installed a
few plugins and I'll show you which ones
you've probably heard of them already
but one is the sublime package control
by w bond and to install it you just
look for sublime package control on
Google and to install it all you have to
do is copy all this stuff
and then in sublime view show console
and then you just paste it in here you
press ENTER and it says please restart
sublime to finish installation and then
you have your package manager now I
already have that installed so the first
thing we're going to do is install the
soda theme and what this does is it puts
icons beside your folders and it's
actually easier to read stuff in my
opinion so in sublime in order to use
the package manager you press ctrl shift
P ok and it opens up this window here
and I'll type install and this is how I
get to the package install so ctrl shift
P is just something you want to remember
okay and I'll just type install and I
have the package control enter Al's type
soda
what is the name of this
so delight
well it's because I already have it
installed but you look for sodalite and
you install that and then you'll get
icons right here and then you can change
your settings so I'll go to preferences
settings user and you see I have soda
right here you have to add this string
in here and the one above it as well if
you want to folder icons now I could
change it to dark and it'll be dark and
I will mention I am pressing safe yeah I
guess I'll leave it on dark okay so
there's also another setting if you look
at these closed boxes the default
sublime has them kind of slanted and
they actually mention this on the soda
site I'll scroll down a little ways to
the configuration here it is soda
classic tabs so I'll go back to sublime
and I'll put comma paste and you see now
it has those classic tabs but I kind of
like them to be square
oops can't type that wrong
okay so that's just how you can install
plugins I'll press control shift P and
type install and there's a couple of hem
of plugins here like bracket highlighter
this one's kind of handy and down at the
bottom you probably didn't see it it
happened really fast but it installed
the package so what's good about sublime
it's pretty lightweight it's very fast
and it has a lot of configuration
options that you would probably like and
I'm going to go through a couple of them
with you so I'm just going to go to
preferences settings default and this
has everything in here and basically
these are just default system sends what
you can do is save them in your user
settings to override them like tab size
here I always want minus 4 so you can
also click down here which is indent
using spaces and tab with 4 so I don't
need to mess with those but if I go a
little ways down I'm going to search for
bold ok and the way I searched was I
just press ctrl F and bold folder labels
now you could change it in here if you
want but I'm gonna pop mine right in
here I'm gonna change this to true now
watch my folders once I save it see they
get bold
there is um another one that I really
like this setting officers for trim
automatic whitespace I always want that
true I think it comes on by default
there we go
trim trailing whitespace on save I want
that to be set because you know when I'm
typing I don't ever need whitespace
after the end of the line so I'll set
that to true whoops
when you make a typo sublime warns you
and this is just the pop-up you get for
an unregistered copy so to say cancel
there's another one that's whoops
remember open files so when you restart
sublime do you want all of these to
appear at the top it doesn't bother me a
whole lot but that's how you can
customize the settings you can look up
on Google how to customize a whole lot
otherwise all the descriptions are in
the default they're the key bindings if
I go to a default I had to change a
couple of these and I look for duplicate
line whoops that was it
right here and I change mine to control
shift down because that's what net being
Jesus and I'm used to using netbeans so
changing your hotkeys is pretty easy the
other one I changed was to delete line
here it is delete line and I changed
mine to control
E because I like the NetBeans I will say
that this is not like a full IDE at all
it's good in certain instances I have
been using it it worked to type in
Python and trying it out it's pretty
good with that but I do notice a lot of
limitations so I'll go to controllers in
a project I have and just let's say
client right and I can search this whole
class by pressing ctrl R and this is
good because you know you're used to an
IDE say with a sidebar where you want to
look up functions and I have a mall
listed right here so I can just click
ctrl R click but again that's pretty
simple usage if I wanted to jump into
something like this file model I don't
believe there's a way sublime knows how
to do that
so besides looking extremely nice
there's also a feature to have multiple
windows open if I go to view and layout
you can change how many columns or rows
you want so say I wanted two bars open
I'll go ahead and close this guy out and
company double click I could just drag
this guy over here and client that's
where I come over here and obviously I
have things shrunk down right now but
you can work side by side
if it helps you if this were a
controller and this were a view it might
be convenient for you and again one
thing you probably notice right away is
you can scan your code by sliding down
these bars I think that's a really cool
feature
another feature there's there's a lot of
little things that the coder would
really appreciate so if I hold ctrl and
click a couple times you'll notice that
I have a big cursor and you can type it
once and this isn't anything new but
sublime does have a way of making a
little more convenient because I can
control click this I can control click
here in here and highlight this so I
have four things selected and I can
destroy test and change all those at
once really the highlighting is the cool
part another feature which is not
anything new is to select vertically and
all you have to do is hold down your
middle mouse button and you can do the
same thing like that
you can also right-click whoops
right-click and hold shift in Windows to
select vertically
because you may need to do that and of
course no text editor is any good
without a find and replace the hotkey
for that is control H and you can find
and replace I will mention that you can
find and replace based on case
sensitivity regular expressions and you
can replace one instance or all
instances nothing really new that
notepad + + doesn't have but it is
presented in this very nice GUI it also
has the ability to find in folder so if
you need to find a certain string
throughout a whole project that's really
helpful one thing I will add is one
plugin that I don't have on here is
called enhanced sidebar
let me see sidebar enhancements there it
is so I'll install that guy and now if I
right click my folder I have all these
options which is a lot better than what
it comes with because you can open in
the browser you can open your Explorer
or finder window where the file is
located so that's pretty cool other than
that I mean there's like a lot of
hotkeys you can get used to or format
your own that any text editor can do but
it's kind of cool and sublime to
you feel like a real colder there's a
distraction-free mode also there's a
full-screen mode and then distract
traction free mode you probably can't
see it on my computer but it just
basically takes everything away and I
want to turn that off now exit okay so
that's kind of a summary of sublime I'd
rate this about a nine out of ten for a
text editor for an IDE I'd probably say
it's about a six out of ten because it
just doesn't have what say eclipse
netbeans or aptana can do but it is a
very very good text editor it's starting
to come become my favorite I think I
might like it more than notepad plus
plus now and that is my summary of
sublime text thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
