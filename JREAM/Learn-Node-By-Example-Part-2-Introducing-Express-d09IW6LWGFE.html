and start using Express which is for
nodejs it's pretty much the most popular
framework and it's absolutely wonderful
it'll save you so much time so the first
thing we're going to do is head to our
project where we left off we're going to
say npm install express dash dash safe
okay this will install the express
framework in our node modules right so
if i LS in the node modules you'll see
there's all these extra add-on or
dependencies but expresses right there
and these dependencies can come with
many other things so i'm going to go
ahead and actually edit the package
Jason because we don't need to connect
and serve static at this point and make
sure you get rid of the trail and comma
or else it can break not to mention you
can also add in star here because these
are usually bug fixes the last one and
you could just do that and then we can
do NPM install NPM help this is a 10pm
update okay LS node modules I don't know
why that's not cleaning those up and TM
uninstall and let's see LS of node
modules or will uninstall connect all
right just making sure and then serve
that static
alright whatever so let me clear this
and we can do see what we have here okay
so we have our Express package here and
the first thing we're going to do is
just use Express raw so app that Jas we
can get rid of all of this and we'll
save our Express equals require Express
far app equals Express and this is
straight from the tutorial and it's very
simple after listen and will again we'll
do 3000 and we do an anonymous function
in here and we'll do console dot log so
that we don't forget listening on port
3000 okay and what we'll do here is just
a app get and this has routes built-in
function and this has two arguments to
your request and the response so they're
just short for request and response and
we'll just say response dot send hello
world just like in their example and
let's go ahead and duplicate this and
we'll do / test to see if the test draw
it works okay and then we should be able
to say node fjs and let's see serve
static did I save this I don't see
served static in here
alright so what I'll do is just R M dash
RF node modules and NPM install just so
that we have expressed not sure what
happened there okay so try again of node
fjf okay so we had some dependency maybe
caching up in there and again we should
be able to go here and refresh says
hello world if we go to slash test it
goes with test so it has routing built
in but what I highly suggest is
installing the node generous are the
Express generator which will basically
build out a whole application for you
and what we'll do is we're just going to
make a readme markdown file and in here
we're just going to call this node and
instruction good to keep notes npm
install so that's how we install the
packages and then this is a markdown so
i'm just making it code and then we'll
do npm install express generator
globally
okay and this will be for any new app
and this is what we're going to run i'll
just copy it paste in here okay so now
we have our Express generator there are
two things we're going to want to do
when we create this so we should be able
to just type Express so say um Express
okay by the way it says of the youth
they're using the view Jade they renamed
it the pug that's just their template
little rendering thing which I really
don't like if you decide you like it
feel free to use it let me just see
what's in here
Express help for the options we can
change the view engine we can add pug
support which will be the new one I'd
rather use something like mustache
personally so i'll just say dash dash
kit because i'll add a get ignore the
view oh it supports twig to which could
be kind of cool and we can always change
that later for CSS I prefer sass I don't
know what styluses handlebars engine
support that might be good no not handle
bar so i'm thinking a mustache okay so
and the directory let's just call it app
okay so it created this all of that so
if i go here in the app it created all
of this stuff we have a bin file a
public folder i'm not a fan of how they
named this plural but no big deal routes
and views and more could be added to
this a lot more but we're keeping it
simple for now so one thing we have to
do is go into the application and do an
NPM install okay and we also want to put
that in our readme file so CD how about
that or you could run these as two
commands if you wanted like that but
easy to do it one kill
and what this is going to do is it's
going to put an old modules folder
inside of the app folder okay so LS and
CD into oh I'm in app so yeah there's
the node modules here's the packages and
that's our main entry point and to run
the two run express will say run express
and we'll say in the command line debug
equals app star asterix npm start I
should probably put linux and windows is
a little bit different let's do this
there's as you have to set a de buzz
variable equals the name of your app
which is called app and the ampersand
for background I believe start and this
is what i'll be using let me go down the
directory and i'm just going to remove
the index.html and remove the app dot jf
well exhale keep it there for now but
it's not going to be needed so i will
try it from here and the problem is that
i have to first make sure i believe i
thought it was version for it was only
compatible with but i might have to be
in the app directory and there was a way
around that which i totally forgot so CD
app try running it from here so that is
running and it triggers been www so if i
go down get rid of this guy and press
enter ok so here's Express totally
simple so we know that works just run it
from the folder they're killing me and
I'm just going to move fjs to solo
Express jf ok whoops move solo Express
Dodgers two fgs sorry let me go down the
director I meant to do that in the note
directory not the actual app so move app
that chest to solo express j/s and also
this NTM debug log this is something
we'd probably want to get ignore you
know it's just kind to our local
environment so CD back into app and will
dig into this a little bit more but just
to look here are Jade template and it
it's quite weird you see this will
render
into full HTML so if i did say another p
I don't know you could mess the
paragraph in a paragraph that be weird
oh it's double spaced so change my
spaces to two and hey this is a test all
right save that and app this npm start
i'm just starting it without debug ok
and then hey this is a test and just to
give you a look this you see to me this
is hard it's just weird but maybe some
people like it i'm not a fan now when it
says extends layout it's extending the
main layout here so you see how they do
a link here it's pretty interesting to
say the least just something I'm not
accustomed to so whenever you you can
make different layouts and then just
extend the name of it which is cool and
if I go to index jf here's our / the
request their request the response and
next would be related to middleware so
that's pretty straightforward I could do
something like this just like we did
before and I'll say error alright that's
kind of silly let's just make one call
animal that's so stupid but animal
and then these are the variables we pass
into so let's say animal will pass in an
animal variable and we'll say a dog okay
so then we create a new view I can just
copy the index new file and the title
will be the title variable and this will
be a very well the title there okay and
this since that should be animal and
this should be animal and this would be
an amoled Jade and if I had that right
okay hopefully that works / animal and
not let me try to restart it okay and i
just restarted it and there's welcome to
dog so that's a quick primer on using
this stuff and of course you have all
your JavaScript and styles in here and
that'll be it for now thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
