I had a setting I had to change with the
broadcaster so feel free to get ready
and we'll start shortly this will be a
pretty short live cast it's kind of
spontaneous I know if you do happen to
see this video afterwards just feel free
to skip over this black area I've made
that on purpose so it's obvious you can
just hover over the little YouTube skip
skip skip there will be five people
receiving a year of VP and services for
free so make sure you're in the chat and
we will have fun with that now just bear
with me as we prepare I just hopefully
want to get some people active because
what's the point of a giveaway if
nobody's there let's see
okay
and I am live and I'm just gonna get the
URL you don't have very many people at
the moment not even enough to give away
but we'll get there so let me just type
in here
live-chat we make this a pop out
done and and there's good reason to use
VP and Virtual Private Networks I'm not
going to cover everything but I use them
daily besides besides pride to see
there's a lot of reasons okay cool let
me just get the URL to this maybe I have
a friend or two somewhere out there in
the ether copy this that's that
edit link anyways
great good good what do you send me that
URL to the chat here it's only letting
me edit it in phone I think I got it in
phone settings YouTube changes their UI
quite a bit well where is it
humbug madam madam amendment and that's
your name again if you're watching this
after it's saved just fast forward I'm
actually gonna put a little pop-up there
I apologize for the messy room
I'm just messy Jessie lately it will get
straight down to business
okay we're in the heavens usually what
this would be is a just like a intro
screen and it says waiting for broadcast
show okay that's thank you
calm /watch here
and what is this copy link
and I said yeah that's me okay so let me
hit up LinkedIn we're all quick and
login you guys are the early birds I'm
not sure the best way to schedule these
I know I can do it way ahead of time and
I'll probably have to do that more often
two-factor authentication always use it
okay so eight nine zero A two eight
these codes change so it's all good
and then let's try to get a few more
people
okay and last of all those twitter it's
not like I I don't know like a whole lot
of people but I think it just will make
it a little interesting it's kind of
like the previews to the movie but it's
gonna be like a quick film and I hope it
benefits you I do have some useful stuff
and I think giveaways are pretty fun and
just to let you know I'm not getting
paid or persuaded or anything to promote
anything I actually never done a video
like that I probably should because you
probably wouldn't make good money too so
it's a verification code for that and
I'm all about security and you say
probably a lot of programmers are but
reason being especially was because I
actually had been hacked a few years ago
and it was actually really bad I had my
credit card stolen as well and as you
know you can just read on the news
there's a lot of people turn to hack
cryptocurrency
I'll just tweet
I always get VPS and VPN mixed up
okay I'm just gonna fix the background
for a moment just hang out for a minute
if I play some music but then YouTube
will take the video down because you
know copyright issues can't get away
with anything here just gonna toss these
up that was a whole lot of cleaning
there I see okay we got Manny in here
okay close this close this
no this is not a hoax why would it be a
hoax 5:30 a.m. Oh Fox reality welcome
I've only done two live streams and I
know it frustrates a few people like why
aren't you scheduling this and I usually
do or I usually have tried but
something's always coming up and I don't
want to be like yeah I'll do this and
then no I don't do it well right now
what I was doing was I was playing with
a local host and I'm like man I gotta
test all this stuff and besides VPN
being what it is for privacy
I wanted kind of a tunnel to a port
that's one thing to make my life easier
because authenticating all these
third-party api's and I'm aware of all
the tools like firebase and a lot of
things you can use but I prefer not to
have vendor lock and all right so let me
just check make sure we have enough
people so that nobody gets mad at me
because people it's 2:30 6:00 a.m. and
5:00 a.m. wait where are all of you guys
what's your locations
I'm in the USA so it's 8:30 p.m. Eastern
Standard time zone 236 a.m. boy that's
got to be Europe or Turkey area 530 item
530 could be no that's not Pacific time
UK man I got it I got a figure I got a
look at the metrics for the people 836
oh okay he's Eastern Standard Time false
reality that's a cool name from the UK a
demo Germany hey Simon good evening to
you sir where do I check this time
stamps
boy it's pretty quiet tonight I want to
go on with it and not hold you guys up
because it's going to be a short video
but you know it's no fun if there's like
a couple of people here and they're
gonna be like well this is unfair
you know tonight I was I was trying to
program and I was having I was just kind
of flustered so I just excited to take a
break
respect for the fellow dev North
Carolina Georgia Tennessee in the face
with this similar voice so I do have a
few videos where my face is on there but
I was wondering what people would think
if I recorded long sessions of me
programming I'm worried it might just
kill the channel because I'm just
literally sitting here writing code I
don't know if any people would find that
interesting I looked at twitch but
that's usually for video games and I
don't play any video games time is too
short for me for to play video games I
looked at a few others and it doesn't
seem like there's really anything
because I don't want to bore people of
death off this guy's live with barely
talking it's usually people want to
learn something and you know keep it
short okay let me refresh yes
and just since it's not a lot of us in
here right now it's probably the worst
time what is it it's a Tuesday usually
two days you're not a DD that's good
unfortunately I am I'm I'm glad that
they've helped and I've been debating
doing some videos either on react or
huge a s honestly they're both they're
really close
Wow I didn't know you could do that hey
thanks man
that's really nice you I don't I'm not
sure her that probably goes into Google
Wow
I yeah well I mean you've just paid me
as much as YouTube pays me a month they
don't think you know this is really kind
of a hobby yeah you can't make a living
off this unless you got like millions of
subscribers so we're only at eight forty
and this has been going since wonder why
it says 5:20 p.m. maybe they have the
timezone wrong I'm here
professionally PHP for a while finally
ready to move to react North Titans do
what they have yeah I know this is all
off topic but I'm just I'm gonna get to
the topic of the whole thing soon yep
I've worked in the note stack quite a
bit - pretty good positions - with a lot
of know dressed api's I've used a lot of
frameworks from Express rest of I I
don't like happy h api feathers J s the
notes back is life-altering it really is
and then as far as front-end I'm not
like a master react guy I kind of favor
view J s a bit more due to its
simplicity and already it's just so easy
to get started with the folder
structures and everything but react it's
it's also good you just end up typing a
lot less code and view from my
experience but again it's kind of like
here's my view experience and my react
is a little bit here so it might be a
unfair balance we didn't start the price
yet
now although I'd love to give Simon it
one of the prizes I don't want a favor
people just because they donated it does
it you know I want to be fair I mean
with this few people I suppose I would
also think there'd be more people if
that minutes
I guess they just sound like that forget
this loser I don't know I don't care
about being popular I just wanted to
have a little fair competition so what
I'm gonna do first is go over VPS the
service I used and then will I'm just
going to give some very simple examples
I might have to uninstall it before I do
it actually so let me make sure I quit
some of these and skyfox
oh the money goes to youtube yeah so
they'll probably take about 90 first day
I don't mind man don't throw your money
away YouTube there they're filthy rich
I'm gonna do a clean slate uninstall of
this VP and VP NS provider VPN sorry
what OS do you most mostly people use
most of you people I sound so rude
as you can see I'm here right on Windows
99% of the time I'm inside of a virtual
machine but I have Windows running
there it is I can uninstall this fellow
it's really a hot night I did market
research and I was taught that Tuesdays
are like very hot days but I think it's
because it's early really just randomly
scheduled oh that's cool well thanks man
I could get some bananas and some coffee
live a little bit Windows iOS and a
Bunton while I don't I don't have iOS I
don't own an Apple in where fusion Linux
cool well good news is VPNs work on all
platforms yep I'm the same way Simon or
Simon whatever it is I would use Linux a
hundred percent if it weren't for Adobe
that's literally it well I guess for the
screencasting - there's well there's OBS
studio which is really good I'm using
was this extreme broadcaster but
actually like OBS it's free by the way a
lot more so this is a very long intro
I'm gonna have to put a tag skip to the
good stuff we don't have a lot of
viewers that's okay so I'm gonna go
ahead and make sure I get my windows
ready
and then we'll get started I'm doing
this on Windows you can do this on any
OS just so you know I'm not going to go
into the more advanced CLI stuff with
OpenVPN there will be instructions for
that which you can do I mean to people
that don't use the CLI its advanced I'm
going to get a beep okay this fellow
okay well if your your okay see you
later Paul if you use it personally it's
great so this intro is going to be way
too long hopefully I can cut it short
and let's get down to business I am
going to open the intro well that comes
out wrong and what I'll be using if I
could zoom out a little bit and make it
look attractive is VPN secure kinda
looks like an Amazon level from a
distance now let me just say I know
there's like 10 million VPN providers
okay I've used quite a few of them yet
this video will be available after the
string I'm just going to give away some
years or subscriptions to this provider
to five people in the chat it'll be a
silly little game and what I want to do
first is make sure this is even viewable
so actually did I set this up desktop
region let me make it bigger
sorry let me add another one
screen-capture I had it I know I did I
have to make it 1920 by 1080 so it
doesn't look like garbage and then we're
ready 1920 walk close enough okay so I'm
gonna do the corner of my screen I can
hide this guy and it almost fits perfect
and I'm just gonna toss my face up here
so it feels a little more personal let
me shrink it down okay I actually
probably had this set up in a different
scene so what I'm gonna do is I'm at VPN
secure da mÃ£e they've been around for
quite a while and what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna sign up for a free account
okay now if any of you keep track of the
news at least in the u.s. they're
talking about the whole internet not
being open which really stinks and I
hope that gets shut down so if you're on
a Mac even Linux and iOS we're gonna
have this GUI here okay and I think the
site's nice I always look at a site's
design first I always want to check the
locations to
I've used a lot of I mean like end rock
and everything you know but uh so just
looking at some of the locations I
usually want something that's kind of
close to me it's faster so I'm in
Florida
Izu min looks like there's one right
here in Florida Australia Brazil Canada
Chile Costa Rica Egypt
okay this list is too long to go through
I'm going to go move this guy I can't
move them over there let me try for free
activate account so free 30 days two
gigabyte limit okay what are you looking
for and I'm going to put in an email so
I'll do hello plus VPN YouTube at dream
comm I do have an account but I don't
want to add it username okay I'll just
do that I better change my password and
I might have to do that on a different
screen because you guys are gonna get me
if I you activate oh I don't know if you
care so let's do this by the way it's a
VPN secure me slash check out slash free
I'll paste it in there if you want to
try it it's always good to try something
now I love trials 30 days is great I'm
just going to move my screen real quick
so I can type in some kind of password
sorry
you can follow along if you want or not
okay and then it's gonna give you a pop
up of your username and take us to the
download page
I got owned so it takes us here I love
this UI I swear I
this is UI and then back end is a lot of
work so I'm gonna download for me I'm on
Windows you would download whatever you
want for Linux they do provide
instructions on how to set up Open VPN
which is pretty good and I'm using
Windows 10 here I'll just download it
getting up and running they give you
common overview other stuff I've used I
don't know three four five I think six
different ones because there's so many
VPNs out there it's almost like I don't
even trust the review sites a whole lot
because there's just so much and they
all have different opinions like why is
this number one why and they try to give
you credible reasons but they're usually
because of an affiliate link yeah
equipex so I'm going to install a VPN
secure the one of the reasons also is
because this is stupidly easy I know
some of them are pretty easy but for me
I'm in love
whether you're following along or not
that's okay I just want to show you how
easy it is and what this is gonna do is
it's gonna anonymize your IP address and
they do not log your traffic now that's
kind of been a big deal because there's
always this fear your traffic's being
logged you know nobody wants their
traffic logged I'm gonna open up VPN
secure for me it appears in the Start
menu and then it should probably come up
here and here so I'm disconnected and
there's my IP address please do not hack
me I'm trying to be nice and I'm going
to go to settings well it looks like I'm
already logged in because I have a real
account you'll get this screen sorry
about that so I'm gonna login with my
username which was this crazy-looking
name and then my simple password and
I'll sign in so you guys saw my IP
started with a 5-1 I typed that right
don't worry this happens because I check
my gmail so I did a life I did a live
stream previously and it was so
embarrassing how much I messed up I I
don't know if I say yeah I think it's
still there there's complete humiliation
I'm not on the black web I don't know
what if the stream will suddenly stop
because the IP will change oh that's a
good question
dang it you bring up a good question
anything about that I don't know if this
is connected through web RTC that is the
best thing you've said Simon thank you
shoot I might have to do a video to
actually demo this darn it so this isn't
how I wanted to go but let me do the
giveaway so to make this a little
interesting I'll open up a little
terminal I'm on Windows so give me mercy
zoom in on this guy all right so there's
gonna be five winners for the lifetime
at VPN secure ME and they have a
dashboard by the way if you're using
Linux you can also do it gives you the
all the configuration files you need so
if you don't want to use the client and
you just want to use your own VPN with
Open VPN it's super easy so let me just
write a script because it's a little fun
most people here do PHP so I'll just say
them random dot PHP and it looks it just
looks great in here
so function random we're gonna do a
random number okay and I'll call random
oops I don't want to pass in a number so
how do you guys want to do the random
number should I just do random what am I
on PHP 7 is it Rand int and how high
should we go let's go from zero two
since there's not many people 200 just
so we hopefully don't get any and I know
this isn't very beautiful all right and
then of course it always has to screw up
commander so let me open another one so
let me try a PHP random winner brand int
maybe it's random in these P - a random
int all right that's it sorry about that
them random EHP it's rhythm is really
slow on here come on look at that undo
undo undo a okay
and we'll go over here and we'll try
again right I didn't echo it out sorry
is so embarrassing I claim to be a
programmer but I'm a phony
what's with Windows there this command
thing echo random end winner will be
random how about we do this and then
I'll just echo any line just in case
come on Windows get out of there VIN
doesn't behave this way
83 winner whatever we're not making it
beautiful guys I'm not lying I should
just open it up sublime text or
something all right so all right so
everyone please pick they want to
participate please pick a number one
through 200 if it happened to be a zero
it's a do-over
Gail only one number per person and the
person that is the closest will be a
winner there's five year subscriptions
for you I'll make this bigger so pick
just post it in the chat to participate
and I just want to make sure I'll type
in here okay number one 200 okay you
guys got it
oh I'm sorry that delays a little
broadcast till the broadcast is a little
bit delayed okay we have two of the same
numbers okay I better copy these I'm
gonna open up notepad because it's so
amazing
pay some of these guys out oh that looks
so great
all right so I know there's a little
delay on this okay and he left otherwise
closing okay I'll give it a moment
there's another one
and we're going to close them once I
type it then we're gonna rattle it off
and it's going to be who is the closest
just waiting for the delay closing
guesses so let's do it guys the first
one random sorry clear HP Envy HP 160 so
let's see we have QW QWERTY noob that
looks like they are the closest to this
okay if I make a mistake let me know
okay all right we've got a 59 I'll toss
it in because even though you're late
that's okay
so 14 new by the way here's the list
guys I'll shoot it doesn't do multi-line
you guys know your numbers so wordy noob
email hello +
so you see that email just send me an
email it can be empty and I will send
you the code okay so lets we can go
ahead and go to believe it's slash for
dean okay
this this one looks a little bit
different let me get the link but i
can't open this because it has all two
codes
let me i'm just going to turn off the
desktop one moment because i want to be
fair and you guys can enjoy the whale
okay we're back sorry yep just make sure
you email me okay that's hello plus VPN
at dream comm the plus matters okay
let's clear it out and you guys here we
go first second one HP I could have
wrote a better script and five is the
winner let's see we have a 31 mana men
and M you if you look like the closest
number with 31 okay if you guys see an
error let me know I'm being careful mana
men okay so let me move him because
there's no reason to have to yep that's
you sir
just make sure you just send me an email
just let it be empty or anything just
mention your name please same for you to
QWERTY new just in the subject am I
gonna validate these can you private
message on here
alright I'm gonna I'm gonna live
check-in my email so you guys don't get
screwed alright next next one random
keep doing same thing
PHP random 57 alright we have at least
tourists who came in a bit later
oh gosh I feel bad for Simon I think you
would have won that 57 that's in sorry
eat Ilyas Taurus
okay alas Taurus are you still here alas
Oh a YouTube message okay you can send a
YouTube man once a
I can't do it from here Simone's a good
sport Rand so let's see we have three
winners we got two Moore's 168 so looks
like - Vick oh boy I got do the math
Ellie James might be closer sorry I have
to do math and I'm not very smart
right now it's Ben sorry if I did say
it's the closest from the distance to
the point okay
I'm gonna open this handy calculator
right here so la James chose 200 and the
winner would be minus 160 clips 168 so
he's 32 away and then juvett chose 123
so 168 - 123 is 45 so it looks like my
friend la James wins that if I'm wrong
tell me
la James
yes QWERTY already already won I I
separated the list and again this is for
VPN I'm just zooming in here VPN secured
and E they've been around for years gosh
I would dare say a decade possibly more
just so you know
let me move la James down and we have
one more to do so I will say I'll get it
right this time looks clear
PHP rent PHP 50 is the winner and that
is you on the money
Simon perfect pick man alright so here
is the YouTube chat by the way what it
looks like
let me send you the links

connotation of broke I mean yeah just
sohow instead of emailing let me how do
I private message you I wish I could
just do it from here add moderate or
high put timeout go to check okay I'm
gonna try to go to a channel and I'm
doing it on another screen just so that
I don't owe you would think someone with
a decent amount of viewership would have
more people atlas or know how to use
YouTube but could you explain where I
send a private message because I don't
want to do it in a discussion I don't
think that's private
oh do we have to do the email way

had emailed me okay QWERTY newb QWERTY
new does your email start with a ra yeah
that was your tutorial QWERTY newb I
want to confirm your email starts with a

in a search
Oh send message okay I'm going to send
you guys messages the one okay query let

dumb stuff and let's see I'm going
backwards so you know la James don't

17 years are wait let me check
oh sorry Mandy you didn't windy life are
the year the year-long this is mostly
code works good okay
please all winners if you don't mind
could you please just ensure the code
works because I will find a way to
correct it if it is not
okay
if you're someone that did not win you
know I'm just one person try the free
trial
it's literally you're going to get the
exact feel for it I use it why online
privacy and if you're from another
country I'm just mentioning this I'm not
telling you to do it one selling point
is that you can unblock content I know
China they're strict on that and you can
also use this on your Android iOS you
can even plug it into your router if you
want it ok and you can choose any
location at any time you want obviously
the location that's closer to you is
going to work the best but if you're
like well I won't talk about things you
shouldn't do let's see so 47 countries
there's actually a lot of features on
this let me I'm gonna log into my
account just to show you guys cuz you
should have an account whether you're
just gonna try it out okay this is a
fake little guy I made I gotta zoom in
373 days oh man
ok thank you were tea I don't know why
it's 373 I that one I can't fix I'm
sorry LA James okay so I'm just gonna
quickly go through this I have a profile
smarter DNS servers there's an affiliate
system I'm such an idiot
I should have used this and maybe tried
to make some money and referring people
but I didn't oh well
smart okay awesome awesome and I think
there were just two more so let me just
checked off La James works
Elias works simone if i have your name
right works fourteen new and mana mum
and just want to know if qwerty new and
maniman works i don't want to
shortchange anybody it's just basically
like a raffle you know and honestly i
never win a raffle whatever it is okay
they're using the current date 2018 i
want to tell you how long they've been
around
look mine let's see i made a free
account expires in 31 days i can
download the software and see what it's
like now okay maniman and then just oh
you confirmed okay cool
everyone's works oh good I didn't want
to look like a dirtbag I'm glad
so VPN I didn't actually realize this
but Simone brought up probably the best
point that I might get disconnected from
the stream so this didn't do what I
wanted it to do I wanted to show you
guys some examples so for starters some
examples being illegal is one a VPN is
going to be a lot faster than the tor
browser that don't use the tor browser
kay I don't want to get into all the
technical details about it but please
don't use the tor browser it's not
really what you think it is second I
would also install an extension for
whatever web browser you use that blocks
cryptocurrency miners okay it sounds
silly but you know that stuff is getting
rampant you don't want that to happen so
I'm just going to summarize with this to
use a VPN it's gonna help you keep your
browsing private
without having it tracked now some
companies still track your data what
happens is your ISP or whoever you get
the Internet through all they're gonna
see is is it you keep going to this IP
address your virtual private network
that's all your traffic is going to
appear as they're not going to know what
the crap you're doing the only way they
could know they would have to go get
some legal order and bust on the doors
but they can because you can do it in
any country man what are they gonna do
they're gonna have to go to this company
which is Australian based and you know
them they're laid-back drinkin beers
have shrimp on the barbie and they're
not you know go ahead go go to Australia
you know what I mean so I don't care I
also I thought let me just I'm just
gonna double check one thing by the way
when you're using a if you've how do you
know that you can trust your routing VPN
provider you're now routing above your
secrets for them I know the owner of
this company and he is the most I've
known him for a very long time and that
is why I I don't talk to him very much
though he's a busy fellow so for your
secrets let's say you connect to SSH
using your IP it like SSH keys right
your ISP alone doesn't track your SSH
keys you know that would be like a file
upload what this is it's transferring an
encryption your encryption key to
connect to a server the only thing
you're using is this pipeline I guess
you know your question bags that how can
you trust your ISP to keep your seat
yeah yeah I think that's a very valid
question and I do like your your I like
that inquisitive mind um really all of
the Internet is kind of a series of
trust you know because if you consider
github do you know they could just
destroy half of the world basically by
shutting down or just taking someone's
code get help my goodness
any web server you use you know you all
of our enterprise code they host Netflix
they better trust them but I'm sure
someone like Netflix has like a whole
legal thing with them I wanted to see a
list of feature products features I
recall and by the way you can pay on a
weird crypto currencies for this 48
countries bypass censorship cipher
strength cipher strength if you do use
open or sorry if you do use Linux I
would not use open PPT I believe it is
it's it's not secure use you know AES
encryption and they let you dock you can
just download your keys and the open SSH
configuration from the dashboard here
pay your VP enjoy stealth VPN I'm trying
to look for
I know oh it says it right up here no
logging ever and yes I realize people
can say that anywhere but you can go
right to their website at the top right
no logging ever okay if it does make you
feel a little safer I don't know where
else you're gonna go no matter what VPN
you go to you know they're probably
going to say no logging and it just
comes down to trust
and you know I I can't answer that you
could trust nobody
you know you - who knows they might be
using my video here for a psychological
study that I don't know about on people
that really need mental health as an
individual in fact you can't trust your
eyes people that again with millions of
clients yeah I guess but hey it's really
up to you guys um I I personally do use
a VPN I'm not a Salesman besides that I
find it useful for me to test out a few
things and some things I'm not allowed
to mention
which we all might know about I do the
best I can
but when it comes to Internet privacy
there's more than only a VPN like a VPN
isn't like a brick wall to everything
your isp without a doubt if you live in
the USA with when they took away net
neutrality the ISPs it's scary what they
could be capable of now it's scary okay
I'm not trying to I want that whole
thing repealed you have by the way you
have a Amazon github or sorry Google
Apple and a whole bunch of giants they
are doing a lawsuit against the federal
government or FC federal FCC whatever to
rollback net neutrality because what
this allows is for ISPs to rate limit I
mean they can do anything they say they
won't but obviously they will or else
they won't spend I forgot how many
billions I think five billion to get
this pass it is the at least for the
u.s. you guys might be another country
it's the worst they can do anything they
want with our data without telling us
they can you know sell it stalk us they
can limit us like let's say they have a
competitor let's say I'm with whom I
with Bright House it's called bright
house with this past they can say we
don't want you to use t-mobile
we have you know a partnership with AT&amp;amp;T
so I go to the t-mobile site you know
they'll be clever about oh they'll make
it slow they're gonna make it a pain in
the butt they could even block it so
then okay I want to move to a different
ISP I do that they'll have the same
thing going on and that's just an
example so you know for us people cross
your fingers that they roll that stuff
back because it's terrible I don't know
why it even passed or how so
on the flipside of all of that that's
one huge benefit of the VPN
yeah even before that I still did use
one I think that's my rant and two years
USP yeah um the thing that's cute
defended Jay big the thing that's really
curious about me is why they spent so
much money to roll it back you know if
there wasn't a problem to begin with and
then President Obama had implemented it
which was one of the things I thought
was good
why roll it back like it's very curious
I may be a little paranoid because
source will not support bad ISPs the
thing is ISPs you can't just switch that
easy you know they're kind of
geo-located yeah same here la James they
have a monopoly it's I mean I can I can
choose Bright House or I think maybe one
other one but you know which is owned by
Comcast so you know I wish you know like
you know that I said the Republican or
whatever they choose to yeah we won't
support you we don't have a choice
a lot of us don't have a choice we have
to use it to have the Internet you know
so and then like let's say someone
starts up a company it ain't cheap to
start up an ISP unless you're like rich
man I wish I could grab some I wish I
could put another person on this cam
that like to socialize because it kind
of sucks to talk to yourself just if I
could have your guy's opinion I don't
know is it worth my time to make a forum
I probably one right one by hand I don't
know if people like I don't I wish I
could connect to people more without
only having to be
the livestream a lot of people have
really silly code questions and it looks
terrible on the YouTube comments
and then some things are just so old I
don't know it I know wet forms it's kind
of more like live interactive forms or
you get alerts and it's more real-time
so either I whip up a note json' or
maybe make a community team forms are
dead
I hate slack and I know you guys won't
like me for that but I don't like
discord what's Facebook groups my
problem is I don't like Facebook owning
all discord oh I had downloaded this
this thing was really odd Dwight I had
uninstalled it because I was it's time
to ditch typing teams this might be kind
of cool I downloaded it but it really
confused me because I don't want to you
know feel like I'm just talking to the
wall and the whole people listen I want
to talk to people know what you guys are
interested in because I don't want to
make I enjoy teaching people stuff and I
don't want to teach people stuff that
they think is pure garbage and I've had
a lot of those videos if you guys have
seen some of the comments over there
over the years I had about if I was
really insecure I would be dead the way
people come at you but YouTube they've
made a pretty good dispenser a lot of
things I'm not I'm not a huge fan of a
huge fan of Facebook either la James so
ah let's see that is discord free
well the thing with Google Hangouts is
that it's one-on-one I would really love
to see what you know just random people
that maybe don't watch alright okay I'll
check in if it has a web-based thing
that'd be really cool
my assets meaning I made some little
logos to toss up here great yeah those
aren't my friends
okay so I downloaded discord I just made
a channel called
dream I'll probably happen yeah you just
make a slack a channel server create
text and voice channels and it's pretty
much like slack the net neutrality yeah
okay so oh yeah I know this has a chat
or why is that my name I think I was
just messing around on some other chat
I'm trying to figure out where the heck
to go I would like to make this like
open and I would like to change the
theme color user settings oh boy
appearance light now that's too late
font scaling yeah I'll have to play with
this a little bit I like it a little bit
bigger streamer mode so looking say
click on the server and generate an
invite for us okay
what's this click on the server this
looks like I'm the new getting tutorial
eyes by the YouTube pros we're so here's
the server
I don't know Oh Grammy
cool I don't know where you mean servers
understand that all right well it was
create instant invite copy-paste there's
a carrot
this carrot invite people copy oh do
this one okay now I can't guarantee I'm
sure I'm gonna use this or not oh I
don't know how it works I'm gonna have
to like check it out you know find a
group what is lfg i don't know who these
people are
discord
heythere's sighs Minh place the wine
text ha I have a lot to learn about this
Heisman
oh man I'm still on YouTube gosh sorry
this is embarrassing
Wow does everyone have this I want to
change my name
hey you can talk I heard us someone's
hit Enter
wait do you guys hear me talk while I'm
talking right now that'd be weird voices
connected
am i speaking through this thing really
what I wanted is other people did our
developers and stuff to challenge each
other challenge me you know toss around
ideas doesn't have to be anything like
hey how did you chat alright sorry one
site let me get off the YouTube live
chat just to summarize I should have
advice chance if you click on the icon
next to voice correctly Bell
disconnected so there's two types of
channels with voice channels and thanks
chance okay okay
okay guys thank you for the
participating congratulations to the
winners and tryout VPN s the reason I
recommend it is because I have a high
level of trust with the company and the
ownership of it and they've been around
a long time and I've used a lot of them
so good luck and if I don't see you
later good morning good evening and good
night that's copyrighted The Truman Show
