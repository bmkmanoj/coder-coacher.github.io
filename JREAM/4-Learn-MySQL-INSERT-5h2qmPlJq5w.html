database just like in the last tutorial
but we're gonna use this one so this
tutorial is kind of important so let's
just do a create database and call it
learning and execute okay
refresh over on the left side yeah I
click and let's do use learning and
we're going to create table and let's
call this one you users okay and we've
done this already will say ID name and
primary key will be ID so for the ID
we'll just do an integer of 11 we're
gonna do not null and Auto underscore
increment it's like you say hold on
there what are you doing I'll explain in
just a minute of our car of 40 so what
are we doing we're saying the IDS an
integer it can never be nothing you know
we always wanted an integer and every
time we insert a row it's going to add
one to the integer and this will make
sense later you don't need to totally
understand it the name just a text field
and the primary key is ID and execute
and if we click this we have our user
stable cool I'll show you another way to
create a table I'm not use these because
it can get confusing if you rename your
database but you could do learning dot
users if you want it to if we're going
to create one
let's do um use learning once again and
for this table we're gonna call it post
now this one's gonna have an ID also is
its primary key it's going to have a
title and it's going to have content
let's make that one text and it's also
going to have a foreign key and I'll
just type it out first we're gonna say a
sign underscore user and this one will
be int of 11 and run let's make sure
this works learning there we go so we'll
go to posts and let me make this a
little bigger so we can look at it
here's our table so our primary key is
the ID K this is where we we can we have
a bunch of rows of data and we can find
something and we want to know who posts
it we're not just gonna dump in the
physical user name because if we have a
user's table and ever change their name
and then the the post says all right
John posted this and then it looks for
John in this table but he changed his
name to maybe John - it's not gonna find
it so we identify things by these unique
keys okay and for users ID is the
primary key for posts ID is the primary
key the point of a foreign key is to
refer to a primary key in another table
so a sign user is going to refer to the
users table primary key if that's
confusing don't worry because you know
life goes on and you'll understand it at
some point
alright let's insert some data so we're
gonna say insert into users
and this is a little bit different of a
command we do these little parentheses
and this is the fields we want to insert
into we only want to pop in a name
remember the users table has a ID in the
name and then you type in values and
then we put little quotes here make sure
you end the command and let's just do
admin and I copy pasted that in let's
just do John quickly it's a good idea to
do all lowercase names which I won't get
into explaining so let's execute that
take a look at the user's table and go
to data and you can see here's our
primary key that auto increments meaning
this ID will always be unique and this
is how we'll identify our users and the
names the name let's go insert some data
into the posts insert into post values
and and so let's take a gander the posts
table and let's see the ID will be
automatic we're gonna do title content
and a sign user all right so let's type
that out title content a sign user
I'll just tab this over you know if you
want it more readable it doesn't matter
how you type this whatever works for you
I have a certain way I like to do it but
I'll just play around with it a little
bit so the post title is welcome for the
content let's say
this is an example and for the assigned
user you want to assign a user that
exists based on their ID so if I go to
users and browse once more sorry go to
data if there's one and two for the IDS
I'm gonna assign it one which will
reference the admin I'll just pop a one
in there and play so I go to posts data
here we go I know I'm moving kind of
quick I'm trying to keep these tutorial
short because I know they can get boring
we'll just do one more thing let's
assign one for to and cause one I'm new
now you see I use this apostrophe here
I've talked about this in other
languages when you're using apostrophe
like this hmm
my SQL thinks this is the string here
and then you're continuing it here and
it kind of messes things up what you
need to do is escape it with a backslash
like that if you have a conflicting
thing there
then just answer some sample data
execute and under posts we'll go to data
and refresh and here we have it those
are some basics of insert and thanks for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
