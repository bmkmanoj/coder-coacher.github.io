this is Jesse and in this tutorial we're
going to do custom functions in jQuery
and once again I just have a standard
header you can type this up if you like
and below I just have a button with the
ID of button and we'll use that to
create an event and the page just looks
like this nothing very fancy so the
first thing I'll do is I do button when
that's clicked okay and just to make
sure it's working let's just alert one
okay and next we'll create a function
now a function can be outside of you
know document ready because it's called
on demand and to do a function you just
do a dollar sign period and FN for
function and then your name here and
equals function okay and I'm just going
to do alert Jesse and then if I want to
call the function you just can say this
dots your name okay and refresh and
click Submit and I get Jesse let's say I
want to insert data into here it's also
very easy you can put a variable here
I'll just use STR for string and this
will alert string then if I pass in this
parameter here I'll just say Joe so I'll
hit refresh and submit and it puts up
Joe if you're familiar with functions
and other languages you can put a comma
and let's say age alert string plus
space plus age and I'll say Joe 27 and
I'll refresh submit and outputs Joe 27
pretty cool so you could work more
efficiently by creating your own
functions if you had to do a lot of
things let's do a little CSS to make it
interesting so let's say let's grab the
h1 tag remember that's right here and
we're just going to do CSS and actually
we're going to a custom function so
let's just say custom thing okay
so we'll create a new function and let's
say dot FN custom thing equals function
and we'll say return return this dot CSS
background let's say red okay let me
make sure that works okay yeah that
works now in functions you can only have
one return so if you had to return a
couple things perhaps you'd say dot
fade-out refresh click and there it goes
okay so you can only have a one return I
think that's pretty much it for
functions going to keep it pretty simple
and I showed you how to pass parameters
up here try to remember that if you want
to customize this a little more we could
say function color and for here we could
say color and for the custom thing we
could just type in blue so then we would
have a blue background there and the
reason you would want to do that is if
you have a library of functions and
these would be included in a separate
file so I'll just create one here if
this was in another file you could just
dynamically set your settings really
easily all right that's it for
