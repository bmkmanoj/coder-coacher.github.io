in this tutorial we're going to look at
some selection tools are there these
three in this l-shape we have our
regular marquee tools and these I don't
think I need to explain you know you
just make a square and then press
control D to deselect the lasso tools
are like ropes and just the regular
lasso tool you just drag around the edge
of what you're trying to select and if
you go the edge of the document you see
it creates a straight line and you just
let go to finish or close the selection
there's the polygon which is where you
click click click in your drawing lines
to select something and you can either
hit enter to have it closed
automatically or you just reach the end
point and then there's the magnetic
lasso tool which is like the two
combined you just drag and it will snap
two edges for you and you can change the
frequency and the amount this looks
pretty lousy I know you'd have to change
whoops hit escape to get out of this
you'd have to change some of these
settings let's say 20 and that gives me
some more room to mess up but anyways
I'm not going to mess with those too
much then there's these tools over here
the quick select and the magic wand tool
first I'll show you the magic wand let's
say you click and we have a selection
here I'll press delete and I have a
green background I made the background
green earlier and this usually works
pretty good most the time for simple
things what you can do is let's say you
wanted to keep this background but you
want adjust the characters off of it you
would go to select inverse and now this
selects the opposite which is very cool
now we can just move around
characters now if we go to another
picture of let's say Batman and I select
the quick selection tool I really like
this one I'm going to make my brush a
little bit bigger oh I guess a little
more and it as you drag it intelligently
selects things so for going through here
we're trying to get rid of the
background let's say and I have his ears
aren't selected so I hold the Alt key
move the mouse if the minus sign doesn't
appear inside of it or just select this
key if you want it I prefer to hold the
Alt key and that will subtract from it
so I'm going to change the size we're
going to hold alt and drag up still
looks a little bad so what I need to do
is be a little maybe a little smaller
and I'll just all track these or add
these sorry and if you're doing with
something like hair that has a lot of
little details you would probably go to
refine edge right up here and I'm just
going to pick a setting let's say on
white no I guess on black however i'm
selecting the wrong thing let me
deselect and select Batman himself so
i'll just select him up here okay so
i'll go back to refine edge and i will
pick C overlay on white on black I think
on black is going to be the best since
it has that brownish color on the edges
next I'm going to enable smart radius
and turn it up a little and you can see
that it's getting rid of things you
don't want it too high because
might get rid of too much what you can
do then is you can actually draw on here
and it'll apply the radius to it okay
and this can fix a lot of things mmm his
face looks kind of scary doesn't it I
don't like that that's really scary okay
anyways then let's see show radius and
this just shows the little places we
drew and the races radius looks a little
big or something went wrong here and I
do not know how to fix it anyways I
think you get the idea for that sorry I
couldn't give you a better example a
couple other things that you'll probably
want to know it'll be good to have in
your tool kit let's say we just select a
square let's go to edit stroke and will
say one pixel okay now if we wanted to
make the another box inside of here
without having to redraw this and try to
get it perfect we do something called
contract let me add one more stroke so
that I can redo it k I guess I selected
that box almost perfectly okay select
modify contract and I'll just contracted
by one pixel and I'll do edit stroke and
select modify contract one pixel stroke
and you get the idea you can also do the
opposite with select modify expand let's
expand it by 5 pixels one thing i don't
like about expand is that it rounds the
corners there's a couple other ones one
let's see
we have a selection there let's go to
select modify smooth and this will give
you a hard-edged corner radius item so
smooth there will go and let's paint
that in and you see we have a rounded
box which is very good because you could
use that for a lot of web elements let's
make a square and do feather now this
one I don't use because I don't like
what it does so the same thing seven and
it looks the same as this with rounded
edges but it's actually feathered so if
I paint that in it's all over the place
it looks kind of good but it's faded
however if this was a pixel perfect box
that needed to be a certain size we just
have all this fading over here that
we're not factoring in okay so it looks
like i've ruined this Batman picture I
think that's a decent overview and these
are things you'll have to play with just
my personal preference i usually use the
rectangle and elliptical marquee tool i
almost never use these two for this I
use the polygon once in a while
otherwise I rarely use these tools most
of the time what I'm using is the magic
wand and the quick select tool usually
the magic wand but the quick select tool
if I'm kind of trying to tailor images
with a little more detail and for refine
edge I honestly don't use this very much
but that's just my personal preference
and whatever you find most useful you
should use alright guys thanks for
