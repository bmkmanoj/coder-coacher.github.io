this is a tutorial on creating an RSS
feed in PHP the output could be handled
by a database but for this example I'm
just going to use a multi-dimensional
array the first thing we're going to
want to do is set up our Dom document
and secondly so we can see the output
we're going to create a header and then
echo the output and if you go to your
site you can see it doesn't do anything
but we are outputting an XML document
we're going to create an RSS feed like
this through PHP and it's not too tricky
it just takes a little bit of practice
first we're going to create an element
and an element is this between the tags
and first one we do is RSS so dot create
element RSS the second one is Channel
and inside a channel is title link
description and language and then
there's item and inside an item is title
link description okay we got all these
we're going to want to assign variables
to each one of them so RSS is equal to
RSS channel and these are our children
of the channel title link description
language so I'm just going to call them
see title see link whoops
and item is inside of channel right
items inside of channel yeah so I'm just
going to call these now I'm just gonna
call them item and the item children
I'll just call I title
okay we got all of these it's looking a
little sloppy I'm trying to get through
this before ten minutes and you'll
notice that this doesn't actually do
anything right now it's still the same
because we have to upend the child and
I'm going to do that below here and
first is RSS so doc appendchild RSS and
if you refresh we got the RSS tag and
nested inside RSS is channel so we're
going to do RSS appendchild channel
whoops forgot to say and there's Channel
and inside of channel are these four
things title link description language
so we'll do channel appendchild
and if we refresh we have all these if
you want you see these are self closing
and for these we just put in these
manually so after we well when we create
the element we put the stuff in here
comma my site and now they appear in
there next we're going to work on the
items let's see the items are also
inside the channel so we're going to
want these to be generated dynamically
and normally you could do let's say a
database connection and fetch the
results I'm going to do it with the a
multi-dimensional array and for these
let's the needs title link description
and I'll just copy this down to number
two so if you were to fetch your SQL
query you'd have a multi-dimensional
array kind of similar to this and you
just do a for each loop so for each data
as V and I'm gonna put these inside the
loop look at all the items listed out
and for the value between the tags like
we did before we're going to put it
right after the create element so for
the item let's see there's nothing
between item except the tags and then
title so we're going to do title is a
new title
okay then we have to append the items
into the channel so for item right here
first we want to append these three
things inside of item so we're going to
do item appendchild
a couple of times and then we're going
to append item inside of channel just
like we have right here whoops this
looks a little confusing I think I
couldn't think of a better way to do it
but then once you do that refresh and it
creates the RSS feed ready to use I was
through site - I hope that helps thanks
for watching good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
