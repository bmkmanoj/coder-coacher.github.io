story we're gonna look at object methods
you might say well objects is kind of
ahead of the game well we're gonna just
kind of slowly walk our way into these
here and there so like I said before
everything in Python is an object so
let's say a equals hello it's got to put
little quotes around here okay so a is
now an object to use an object method
this is a string so in the Python
documentation you could look up string
methods okay
string is the object right here
and the methods are things that like
functions so I'd say I could say a dot
lower and a method just like a function
has these little curly already call them
parentheses and I'll say hello now
notice this if you type a again it
doesn't save it okay now that's cool so
if you wanted to save a lowercase
version you could say a equals a dot
lower and type a and it saves
alternatively you can do things like a
dot upper it says hello and once again
just remember it doesn't save it unless
you assign the variable what about list
let's say a let's say B equals dog and
cat and what have you said bead upper it
doesn't work because that's a list and
it's trying to do uppercase on this list
object when we're really trying to
uppercase string so what you would say
is B and the placeholder which is zero
that B dog dot upper okay and it says
dog
you could also say B zero equals B
zero dot upper and let's hit B and it
will save it there there's quite a few
string methods and you don't need to
memorize them all but it's good to
realize that they're here let's say we
have a variable called a and I'll just
say is 500abc okay and I can say a is
digit and enter and it's false why is
that false because it's a digit and it
has text in it
what if a equals 500 ADOT is digit and
it's true even though this is a strength
okay this isn't a literal integer it's a
string but it's saying is the string
only digits okay
you can replace things like let's let's
make B equals bhag bhag bhag okay and
we'll say B dot replace and then we tell
them what's the what do we want to
replace this is cool
I want to replace O with hi okay and it
gives us a big big big and once again
press it you'll see it doesn't save so
you have to reassign it like B equals B
dot replace oh and I and hit B and it'll
replace it another cool thing is that
you can limit the amount of times it
replaces like bead replace or in place I
because remember we reassigned it right
here or in place I with just some big
O's and how many times we want to
replace it
since there's three eyes let's just do a
one time okay and there we go so you can
really limit what you want to do there
there's there's a lot of them you can
just look up B dot swap case and that
just inverts the character case if you
ever had to do that for any reason but
this is really cool
how these are kind of built-in to the
string object makes it really handy you
can look for things in the object you
could say be dom.find find B I guess and
it gives us a negative 1 as our bead
find this well I don't know I'm not
gonna monkey with that I don't have all
these memorized on the top of my head I
don't think you really need to either
just know that they're there and learn
to use a few of them they're pretty good
so real quick you might be saying well
why do I want to know all this let's say
let's make a new window real quick we're
almost done and let's say a equals on
dog and be spayed okay we could say like
in our last tutorial and if statement
were to say if a equals dog print true
okay now if we had a capital letter here
this could be a problem so let's save
this a second as test dot pi and I'll
just run it and it's not showing up let
me do else print false whoops and it
gives us false why is that that's
because dog is lowercase and up here it
has one uppercase letter so this isn't
an actual match so to fix that we could
say if a dot lower so that we're working
all with the same case and it's only
going to check the letters and I'll save
that and hit f5 and it says true pretty
cool so these will come in handy if you
need to memorize a lot of these or do
whatever alright guys thanks for
