to show you how to get started with
Amazon ec2 and that's elastic cloud
compute and you can use it to run a web
server and this will be the example I
show so what we can do is we can launch
an instance which would create our web
server but there's a few things we might
want to have first which would be the
security group an elastic IP and I
believe that would be it but I'll do it
the easy way so if I were to launch
instance I'm just going to do a basic 32
bit here with the star because if you're
a new person you can get a free free
hosting and all that stuff for a year a
bunch of goodies attached to it
and this is loading a long time
I'm not sure why there goes a number of
instances we just want one availability
zone to me doesn't really matter and if
you click the instance type you see free
tier eligible and that's good enough to
learn and practice and we just want to
launch the instance so that it's pay as
we go next and all this stuff is
advanced instance options so we can skip
this and we can skip this also because
I'm not smart enough to figure that out
and when you get here the key pair is so
that you can log into your server
through the terminal and what I would do
is create a new pair and I'll just call
this test and we can create and download
and we get this PE m-file and with this
p.m. file we'll come back to that and
now for the firewall we're going to
create a new security group so that we
can access our site through the web and
everything because this is for a web
server so for this others call this web
the description will be web and for the
rules what we really want are all TCP
UDP and ICMP and some of those have to
do pinging stuff like that I'm going to
throw on SSH SMTP for outgoing email DNS
which I'm not sure why I don't really
understand all this HTTP extremely
important since it's going to be a web
server pop3 is incoming email IMAP is
email on the server what else do we got
HTTP if we were to do secure HTTP pages
and I'll just add MySQL at the end and
continue
and this all looks good so we can launch
that let me close this and close
and I can go over to instances I was
just playing with one right here and we
wait for it to load now a couple of
things we'll need one is the putty key
generator and you can just look this up
on Google as putty key gen and what we
have to do is create a key in a friendly
format I'll get I'll do a import key and
what was that called dreamed PE M naught
was test out PE m okay and here's our
key which we're going to save and I'll
just call this test in the comments so
I'll go ahead and save without a
passphrase if you put a passphrase in
here if someone were to have your key
they'd have to end our password as well
I'm going to leave that empty for now
I'll just call this test so on my
desktop I now have a file called test
dot PPK and if we go here we can
go down a little ways and right here is
our address which we can connect through
SSH now if we went to that address
it's not going to work and to make this
a little prettier what we probably want
to do is get an elastic IP and assign it
to this so down here under elastic IPS
allocate new address to ec2 and we need
to right-click and associate this with a
instance and yes associate so now this
IP address will be able to access this
URL here and I'm going to go ahead and
open putty right here and type in that
address 107 22 32 220 and by default
it's port 22 for SSH next we need to pop
in our key and down here under SSH off
we pop our private key in here under
desktop
boom okay and backup to session you
could save this if you want I'm just
going to show a for an example and open
yes
except the key and we log in as ec2 -
user and there it is we're in so I'm
going to go sudo su and now I'm the root
and I'm going to do yum install httpd
which is Apache and I guess that's all
I'll do
okay that's all installed and now to
start it I'll say what service httpd
start and that is now live and I should
have copied this thing here I don't know
if I can copy that
oops nope so I'll just type it up here
1:07 twenty to thirty 2.2 too low okay
and in a new tab let's open it and here
we have our Apache server on Amazon ec2
and you can do everything you want in
your thingy here like you would in any
other SSH server so thanks for watching
and I hope this was useful bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
