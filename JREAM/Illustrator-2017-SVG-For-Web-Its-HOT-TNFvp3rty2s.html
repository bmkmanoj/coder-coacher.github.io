video on making SVG graphics and the
reason is SVG for the web is wonderful
and you always want to fall back like
you'd convert your SVG's to PNG and then
use modernizr or a tool like that to
fall back with it so what I'm going to
do is just go to my downloads folder and
I just downloaded all the JetBrains
logos and I'm just going to pop it into
here and what I have what's that looks
like I made a line okay and we have this
placed in here and what I do is an image
trace now you can do very high quality
but it's going to make the image size
really big so I'm going to do a live
trace notice I just drag this in here I
click it and I have this menu at the top
and I do have a subscription here to
2017 so image trace drop down and I want
to do 16 colors and this can kind of
bought my computer I'm a little
surprised because illustrator and
Photoshop are very heavy and I have a FX
8 core processor it's just not like the
newest because you know ribbons coming
out and there's i7s and 32 gigs of
memory and it kind of it's not like the
fastest so anyways we have this and we
want to expand it okay and this is all
in a group so I'll right click so in
case you don't know the hotkey where is
it
ungroup' okay and that on groups at all
so with this red arrow okay so we got
like a little guy chillin there I can
delete him okay so if I select him okay
so what I'm going to do now is hope that
these are all the same size but we're
going to do artboards so I don't know a
faster way to do this besides grouping
these one by one
it just makes it easier to move these so
I'm just going to group these intellij
it's one of my favorite programs
jetbrains they make just incredible i
des for programming and I really do like
this kind of style they have here if
you're wondering the difference between
IntelliJ versus say pycharm phpstorm
webstorm is the IntelliJ offers
everything so back to this I'm going to
go to the artboard tool let's first move
one of these over here to the corner
artboard tool and I'm just going to slim
it down here okay
and I don't need a perfect right now
what I do want you to know is if you're
using this yeah this little align to the
art and pixel grid sometimes it's on or
it's on by default but I usually take it
off when I have to make an artboard so
everything snaps correctly it's really
annoying so now to get this perfect
I'll just go like this and it snaps I
just want to make sure
okay and I'll zoom out let's see 4 8 12
13 14 15 17 boards we need so I'll go to
my art boards and make a new one there's
1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 I
don't know how you move these have that
tool make it go down a level if anyone
knows please leave a comment because it
kind of drives me nuts
so I'm just going to loosely toss these
in here just so that we have them
actually don't know what all of these
are and I think you'll get the idea so
I'm not going to do them all it looks
like watch if I undo looks like I messed
up that one so first I'll ungroup or is
that grouped ungroup and regroup
we're sorry I was pressing ctrl G on
Windows to group by the way if you can't
see your outline here you can probably
barely see it on my screen if you go to
view preview on CPU what's GPU preview
you'll likely see that outline box
alright so let me just move a couple of
these down so we don't spend all day
doing it so will it take sealion as in
the letter C
you
so I'll go to file export export for
screens I'm just going to clear
selections and I'll just select these
three and I want SVG and I'm going to go
to my little options here SVG and I
prefer presentation attributes rather
than internal and inline CSS Styles
meaning it makes it all like the SVG
code without styling it with CSS and we
can monkey with all that later if you
want it to animate something like a SVG
there's a lot of libraries I'd suggest
green sock you would probably want two
separate parts like if you add a logo
you maybe take this black square off and
make two SPG's
and layer them on top and so the object
IDs is probably going to be the artboard
name I don't care right now and a
decimal point how many vectors obviously
the higher the bigger the file and I
like to minify mine responsive just
means it's going to add something in the
SVG code because this actually creates
code it gives it a height and width I'll
take this off to show you and also for
your fallback you're going to want to
add another thing of a PNG now I'll just
put this at one times the size okay so
I'll export the artboard okay this all
went to my desktop so let's see how big
this was okay that's a good size and
then let me open up a new instance of
Chrome okay
and I'll just open our board so this
cell is called AC AC you know you would
rename these okay so then we go to view
details and you see AC PNG and SVG are
pretty close to the same size in most
cases that's not really happening so
I'll just try to export again export
four screens and clear I just want these
three and I'm going to adjust the SVG I
usually always have it on two here
by the way you see the size here I'll do
a responsive now it doesn't matter
because you can always manipulate this
and save settings export replace all
right let me delete these two all right
so we save like two kilobytes maybe and
then here's with responsive off and
that's fine let me grab a previous one
let's compare export four screens
actually I don't think the see the curve
the curves here and the curves here kind
of break that really has a lot to do
with my trace the goal is to keep it
really small though and then you would
create a sprite of SVG's basically like
a font you know there's font font
awesome things like that so I will go to
show you what I was doing
I was doing a bunch of SVG icon some of
these were downloaded but you'll notice
all are like one and two kilobytes data
dog was one I did he was 11 kilobytes
there is there
but if I were to take all this
that's 117 items I'm going to make these
available with back of icons also I add
to SVG icons does it and whoops parroted
so that's 170 kilobytes for that many
icons now if I open this with sublime
text you'll see that these have Heights
and widths and these aren't really
necessary because we can adjust that but
the reason for the size is how much code
is in here so if I go to data dog look
how big that is and you see here's my
title and that's something that would
have to be adjusted there's also tools
to minify your SVG I made a script on
github you probably won't want to use
this because it's more like dorkiness I
used nodejs and grunt and basically I
added some source files so here we have
three SVG's and when you run it it
creates a master SVG and also PNG
formats did I add that actually Wow cool
I sometimes I don't sleep for two days
just I'm a little obsessed with
computers yeah it looks like I convert
them to PNG s also and it just shows
like what it does so if I go to here
this was the example you can fork it and
copy it and everything it's just these
are SVG's here so really there you could
do anything you wanted with it I gave
these a class of item wrapped around
now I just want to do one more thing and
now this is a work in progress so just
let me be pleased
okay whoops so this is an SVG oops there
and I use this as an image SRC SVG and
in the JavaScript using
modernizer it automatically says okay if
it's not an SVG then open the PNG so
I'll copy this link address and just go
to PNG and then there it is there
so the sizing is a lot different and
overall it's pretty cool hopefully that
helps you and have fun guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
