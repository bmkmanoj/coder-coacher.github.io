tutorial we're going to make an american
flag first thing you're going to want to
do is go to view show grid and make sure
you press ctrl + 1 to get to one hundred
percent and i'm going to press ctrl k to
get the preferences and i'm going to go
to guides and grid and for the grid line
you might have it at 1 inch i'm going to
put mine at point three and okay we have
some gridlines real close together then
you also going to want to go to view
snap to grid make sure that's on and it
will snap while you're creating the
object so first let's see it has 13
total stripes and it starts with a red
stripe so make sure you soo min enough
so that you get it on a grid edge and
I'll just make it really long okay and I
have the Old Glory red color here and
you can see the colors 178 32 and 34 and
52 and it's on the internet if you want
the exact colors I'm going to click this
and from the top hold alt and drag down
hold shift as well and then this is just
a plain white color okay now what we can
do we can select these reports we can
select these two and press ctrl G to
group them together now if I move this
it moves the collection of them and what
we'll do is we'll do the same thing we
did before and don't deselect anything
just press control D control D and
there's four red bars where the blue one
stops so it's going to stop here and
then there are let's see three more red
stripes so one two three and with this
group we have to get rid of the white
one okay so we have a nice uniform thing
here next we're going to do the blue box
and the colors to this are right here 60
59 110 and that's assuming you're in RGB
mode if you're not you could double
click this and put in the RGB values
here and i'll give you the CMYK however
let's get back to this and I already
have the blue color selected so the blue
part goes down on for red bars whoops
make sure you get it on top of the grid
and there we go okay so zoom out looks
pretty good and then for the stars let's
see where's the star tool there are 50
stars so that will be it has six across
by five so just for fun let's try it in
these little blocks here this would be
one two three four five and it looks
like the spacing could be a little more
so I'm just gonna shift drag now that's
a little too much let's say I'm just
going to click the down arrow twice for
each one of these and I guess I'll do it
once more one two one two one two one
two okay and for the very top 1i let's
do 12 okay so these are going to be
white and let's let's do a transform on
this let's say edit or sorry object
transform and let's see move okay and we
want to move this horizontally not
vertically and let's just say one inch
that's a little far sorry I didn't do
the math perfectly i'll just say point
five okay and we'll do copy and ctrl D D
D
okay and I'm going to select this back
here the flag and press ctrl to to lock
the layer and let's make these stars
white okay I'm just going to hold shift
and move them over a little bit we're
going to have to get the spacing on this
correct so it has six across we're one
short so you could drag this to one more
cross I just eyeballed it not going to
get too picky about it and I'm going to
do the same thing once again one two one
two one two one two one two and
according to the picture I'm looking at
it so I would do this one more time 12
on not two times then go back one more
111 just shift it into the side okay
that looks good and this these down here
will let us know where our new flags
need two new stars need to go E and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to select
all these and press ctrl G to group them
together and I'm just going to alt drag
down to this one I can't seem to line
that up okay I always press the up there
well it doesn't want to line up
perfectly that's all right then just
drag it down to here also okay so we
have these stars here and the next set
I'm just going to alt drag these an old
shift and these are kind of on a angle
and with this one we're just going to
delete and these little color ones we
can erase there were our reference
points actually don't erase that one and
we'll just drag that down a little bit
and we'll drag that down a little bit so
it looks like we're missing a row of
stars
so three one two three this is 6 12 18
19 20 21 22 23 so about twenty seven
stars and it looks like we need another
row of these like that and what we could
do is we could shrink them down okay and
we could space them out quite a bit more
so this I'm going to actually have to
ungroup these now so shift ctrl G and
let's say shift and write and write just
kind of group these together and hold
shift and press the right arrow key
hopefully have enough space we'll just
make the blue a little longer if we must
ok and ctrl alt to to unlock the other
layers and let's drag this over ok that
looks pretty good so what I'm going to
do is group this the red one the red and
white group and then I'm going to select
all the stars and hold shift and unclick
the piece here and then just press ctrl
G so now these are their own separate
objects and lastly what we're going to
want to do is select all of it and group
it and now we can apply a little warp to
it what I would do is I would make a
copy of the flag so that you have the
original in case you were to expand it
and go to affect warp and pick flag and
this is just exactly what it sounds like
and you can play with this however you'd
like and you'll have a nice American
flag I'm just going to leave mine kind
of plane hit ok and you can download
this file on dream calm / lab /a I
