I'm going to show you how to include a
file now Python considers an included
file a module module okay and first
let's have a new file i called my blood
at py ok make sure you say that i just
saved mine in the python directory
that's blood at py and let me just print
blah ok we're on that and it says blah
we all know how to do that already let's
go to file new window and we're going to
make a new module or a file new file
module okay and just save this as other
that py i'm going to replace my old one
and let's just say print other and let's
run the blot py nothing happens so let's
import other save and run and we get
other so basically the way this works is
the name of the file is other dot P why
the name of the file is the thing that
you're importing very very easy now I
try to explain this in a tutorial but
I'm redoing this so that i can try to
make it make more sense sometimes you'll
see something that says this at a bottom
of a file it says if name equals equals
main then print you know do something
let's run that okay and basically what
this is is the main file is the one
that's being loaded into Python okay so
let's just say um blah is main okay and
let's also put one in here and say other
is main so if name is equal to main than
blossoming so blah is the main file even
though we're loading other in here it
knows that this file is the main file
being loaded into the shelf I hope
that's pretty clear and makes sense
however if we load other dot py first
it'll say other is made because this is
the file being loaded so try to think of
this name equals main as your main file
okay so if we wanted to oh shoot I just
lost my train of thought okay I pause
the video on its back um well I just
lost it again okay let's type a name
just so you can see let's do print name
and hit f5 and the name of this file is
blah ok let me get rid of this and other
and say print name and when i run the
blah file the name of others other okay
so i hope that makes sense to you and
how do i use things from the other file
let's make a function let's call this
some other now let's say print writing
from other okay and i'll save that let
me get rid of the name and we first have
to import other so that's already there
and to use a function from the other
file we just say other dot other okay
however with your function names they
should always start with a lowercase and
the reason is because further on you're
going to name your classes with an
uppercase letter so other other and I'll
run that Oh what did we do wrong other
def other okay my apologies i had to
pause the video i'm not doing so hot
today i forgot to save the other dot py
file I'm gonna read in this video yeah
maybe not so embarrassing I don't even
know if I should do this anymore it's so
embarrassing alright well we have our
definition in the other file and says
hey sorry the function
and we do other hey you do the imported
file which is other hey okay and run now
we'll do something if name equals equals
main then we're going to run other hey
and let's create a function in here
let's say did I just call a main print
the main function is here and will say
main ok and I'll run that now what's
happening is the functions within the
blah file which is this they're just use
like regular functions like we've used
before the files within an imported
module like this use this period and
what that means is go to the other class
sorry the other module and grab the hey
function which is right here and the dot
is how you connect things an object or
in programming in Python and I think
this video is good to stop now before I
embarrass myself anymore and if this
video is really bad you guys have mercy
on me okay thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
