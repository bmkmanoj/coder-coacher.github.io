to try to make the Batman logo okay cuz
it's really cool and really popular so
what we're going to do is we're going to
start with an image and what we're going
to want to do is use this as a reference
so let's lock the layer with control to
and let's go ahead and start tracing and
what we're going to want to do is
basically make a line through the middle
and we're only going to draw half of it
and then we're going to mirror it okay
and to make it easier on ourselves let's
just kind of use the pen tool and click
and this curves a little bit and click
next we want the straight line back and
we're going to kind of arc it over
that's a little too much so let's just
make a straight line and let's just
start curving it from here it's super oh
that looks great and then we're going to
just kind of round off these corners
with a little stretch and I think we're
going to have to clear this line a
little bit awesome awesome now i don't
know if that wing goes too far how about
like that that looks spectacular next we
want to kind of stretch the wing down
here and then let's see what the curve
gives us here great and let's just kind
of top that off now before we get
confused we're going to want to flip
these around so that we just have a line
wonderful let's just do the same thing
over here let's see what we get from
here it almost makes the lines for us
okay and then we'll attach this line and
let's see what we get here that looks
awesome now let's go ahead and make this
red oh that looks great and let's move
it over okay now what we're going to do
is click this and then press 0 and we're
going to mirror this
over a little bit and boom next what
we're going to do is combine the shape
Wow Batman logo that looks really good
I'm very excited about this I feel
really happy about it too and at the
center of this logo let's just hold a
circle on this point and then hold the
Alt key and if you can get it the right
size go ahead i'm not going to be too
picky about it and let's just drag this
over to the batman and send it to the
back and if you want to line these up
perfectly you could open up window a
line and let's Center these out ooh
that's not looking hmm hmm oh I have to
cite both of them silly me there we go
and then Center and that looks good and
let's paint this black and it looks like
this is going to have a little silver
border I'm not going to get to detail
because I don't want to waste
everybody's time and let's make this a
silver color and a little bit sicker and
let's make the stroke on the outside
there we go and when the inside again
had to be yellow we can hold ctrl alt to
and I'm not this and delete it and now
we have a very simple Batman logo very
cool very easy and you can download this
on the website in the description guy
