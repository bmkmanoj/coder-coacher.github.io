try to make the Batman logo okay cuz
it's really cool and really popular so
what we're going to do is we're going to
start with an image and what we're going
to want to do is use this as a reference
so let's lock the layer with control two
and let's go ahead and start tracing and
what we're gonna want to do is basically
make a line through the middle and we're
only going to draw half of it and then
we're going to mirror it okay and to
make it easier on ourselves let's just
kind of use the pen tool and click and
this curves a little bit and click Next
we want the straight line back and we're
going to kind of arc it over that's a
little too much so let's just make a
straight line and let's just start
curving it from here it's super oh that
looks great and then we're going to just
kind of round off these corners with a
little stretch and I think we're going
to have to clear this line a little bit
awesome awesome now I don't know if that
wing goes too far
how about like that that looks
spectacular next we want to kind of
stretch the wing down here and then
let's see what the curve gives us here
great and let's just kind of top that
off now before we get confused we're
going to want to flip these around so
that we just have a line wonderful let's
just do the same thing over here let's
see what we get from here it almost
makes some lines for us okay and then
we'll attach this line and let's see
what we get here that looks awesome
now let's go ahead and make this red oh
that looks great and let's move it over
okay now what we're going to do is click
this and then press o and we're going to
mirror this
over a little bit and boom next what
we're going to do is combine the shape
Wow Batman logo that looks really good
I'm very excited about this I feel
really happy about it too and in the
center of this logo let's just hold a
circle on this point and then hold the
Alt key and if you can get it the right
size go ahead I'm not going to be too
picky about it and let's just drag this
over to the Batman and send it to the
back and if you want to line these up
perfectly you could open up window a
line and let's Center these out ooh
that's not looking hmm hmm oh I have to
select both of them filling me there we
go
and then Center and that looks good and
let's paint this black and it looks like
that's going to have a little silver
border I'm not going to get too detailed
because I don't want to waste
everybody's time and let's make this a
silver color and a little bit thicker
and let's make the stroke on the outside
there we go and when the inside again
had to be yellow we can hold ctrl alt -
and I'm not this and delete it and now
we have a very simple Batman logo very
cool very easy and you can download this
on the website in the description guys
