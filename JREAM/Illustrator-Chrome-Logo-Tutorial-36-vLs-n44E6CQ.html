you how to make the new Google Chrome
logo in Illustrator and the reason is
because I thought these shapes are kind
of strange and by doing this you might
learn a few tricks so to get started the
first thing is pretty obvious we need to
make a circle and I'm gonna make the
outside circle first I'm holding shift
and alt to have a perfect circle and it
doesn't have to be absolutely perfect if
you need to slide it around just hold
your spacebar and you can move it so
right now I'm holding 3 buttons down and
let go there's our circle so I'll press
is V and move this over and then I'm
going to draw the inner circle like so
and I'll just make this a different
color we can move this over and we want
to place this from the center point we
want to select it and drag it right on
the center point of this one ok and the
way they did these lines I'm not exactly
sure they're kind of bizarre what I
would do is start with a square
and with this square I'm just gonna drag
and cover about that much okay this will
all make sense shortly and with the pen
tool what I'm going to do is from let's
say about this point I'm gonna go all
the way up I want to match that line a
little more like that then kind of come
over here and close it okay and it looks
like I don't know what I'm doing but I
kind of do I'm gonna take these two
shapes and go to Pathfinder and we're
gonna join them if your shape shows the
line in the middle still you're probably
using an older version you just have to
click the expand button and next what we
need to do is create a mask a clipping
mask and this is where the magic happens
so I'll just slide this over here I'm
making a copy by the way so I'm holding
alt okay and now I'm gonna select both
of these right click and do make
clipping mask okay
so now I got this shape that I want and
let me make this a different color I
have to double click to go inside of it
and let's just make this oh what color
was that it's a red
okay I actually didn't want to move my
circle so I'm gonna undo that
double click once more there we go make
that red and I'm gonna move this up a
little get back to my lair and I can
drag this over here
I'm gonna use my arrows to try to get it
right okay
that does look a little bit off I'm
gonna move this to the front right click
arrange and you probably can't see this
by selected bring the front and I'm
gonna create the stroke of white and the
stroke is gonna be kind of big so
basically what I'm trying to do with the
stroke is have it cover these corners
here and if I click the stroke text I
want it on the outside so where it says
align stroke I'm just gonna say outside
and it looks like we need a couple more
there we go and for the color of this I
want this that blue color I'll just
select my eye tool with the letter I and
click that but it looks like it took
away my stroke so I'm not happy about
that how about I go to my swatches i
deselect everything and let's say blue
drag it in here
I can select this again and make this
swatch color we'll just add it okay
so for this part now we just have to
flip it around once more it looks like
it goes from there to there so I'm just
gonna say ctrl C to copy or you could go
to edit copy and then paste in front
and it looks like nothing happened but
it did so I can drag this down because I
have another copy of it
I guess I'll first change the color to
the yellow double click double click and
how about yeah that's good now we just
need to rotate it to match this up and
we can do that with these little corners
hover your mouse over the little corners
and shift drag looks like it could go a
little more whoops I just did something
bad we want this line to be straight so
it looks like I got to manually try to
get it straight there there it is okay
and I'll pop this on to here with my
arrow keys I'll just slide it over
and which is on top okay and here we
have this kind of matching it's not
perfect this will give you an idea if
you really want to get pixel perfect
that's up to you and lastly this one we
just changed this to a green color okay
and what we would have to do is add
gradients on here I can't totally tell
if there's a shadow going across here it
looks like there is so what I'm gonna do
is maybe not worry about that okay and
you can add the gradient yourself
manually but hopefully that gets you
started and that'll show you a trick or
two about clipping masks guys thanks for
