some includes and functions and this one
we're going to cover are some loops and
I did this video for about two minutes
and I redid it because it was a little
too complicated to get started on
anyways if you look at these numbers I
equaled one two three and what a loop
does it makes it so you have to type a
lot less and it keeps repeating itself
the first loop I'll show you is called a
for loop and it looks like a function
and it has three expressions and the
first one is where we set our number to
start at I'll start at zero our second
one is the condition that we want it to
loop through we want I to or we want the
loop to keep going as long as I is less
than 10 and every time it reaches the
end of the loop we want to do a post
increment so maybe that looks a little
confusing but after you do that a few
hundred times this will just be stuck in
your head because you're probably going
to use this quite a bit and let's just
do echo I dot a new line okay and their
counts zero to nine let's just do it
zero to ten we'll start at one and will
end at eleven okay you could even do is
less than or equal to ten and you'll get
the same results there is also a while
loop
I see people use this a lot when getting
data from a database so really what this
statement says is while something is
true do this
okay so we need something to be true for
a little while I'm going to use numbers
again for this example
so while let's get a variable up here
and say I equals zero while I is less
than or equal to 10 we will say echo I
dot B R okay and there's going to be a
problem here because I is always going
to stay a zero in this loop because eyes
not manipulated so if you refresh you're
gonna crash PHP or do something pretty
bad because it's never going to end so
you want to make sure to do pre
increment or post increment and there we
go
the while loop you know I guess it's up
to you what you like using you should
really get familiar with the for loop
first I think the one I showed you at
the start there's also what you call a
for each loop now this is a little
different it deals with a race just like
a function it it looks the same so let's
make an array and I'm just gonna pick
some food let's say cheese apple bread
yogurt and fish okay I'm actually going
to call this food you always want to
name your variables for clarity now for
each this one's a little bit different
so we're going to do for each of food as
value okay
and we're going to echo out the value
and we get all of these let's do a
little BR so we get them on a new line
so that way we can print out all the
elements of an array now there are also
keys in an array so let's say we had a
we wanted to print the keys you would do
forage food as key and then the arrow
equal arrow sign this is not a greater
than sign by the way or a greater than
or equal sign those ones look like this
or that with the sign before is more
like a pointer so if you want to find
out the key add a little space there and
there's the key so like in our previous
examples when I talked about arrays a
little cheese has a key of zero unless
it's set to something else you define
and it just counts up if you had a an
associative array that means it
associates by a string rather than they
did it cheese is what dairy Apple is
fruit and I'll just leave those like
that and let's see what happens there we
go it still produces the key even though
it's an associative key so you'll be
using the for each loop quite a bit in
your PHP and loops quite a bit actually
just in general now things can get
really complicated when let's say we
have fish as a key and another array as
a value now things are going to get
complex and this is what you call a
multi
dimensional array it means that there is
an array inside an array and you can
keep nesting them down you don't need to
worry too much about this but I'll just
introduce you to it so fish now let's
just make some fish salmon
I think Pike is a fish I think there's a
bass guitar or bass yeah that's good
enough for now
now if we do the for each loop when we
have an array here you see we get fish
but we also get array so what you want
to do is if you wanted to do this a
quick and dirty way to scan the array
that's multi-dimensional you might do
something like this if key okay because
we're dealing with the key which is this
let's just see if this does anything
okay
sorry I meant the value if value is an
array echo 1 there we go
so this might be a little ahead of the
game but hey that's life you know so if
the value is an array which we're
dealing with right here now we're going
to want to for each that one for each
value as K a you want to use different
values than what you used up here or
else you could run into conflict and we
will just echo out K dot a dot BR and
let's see what we get there we go
I'm going to actually space these out
I'll just add a non-breaking space and
you can see we still get this array here
so we want to put an else statement here
there we go now I'm guessing I probably
lost you you don't need to concern
yourself with multi-dimensional arrays
right now but that's an introduction to
loop so play around with some of those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
