to show you how inheritance works with
PHP object-oriented programming this
will be a real simple example and it
might not be the most practical but
it'll give you a good idea okay if we
have three classes one of the settings
and emailer and messages and we want to
pass settings into each class you can
imagine that this could become very
bloated with a lot of classes so what
we're going to do is we're going to have
one parent and then there's going to be
two children to inherit this settings
okay so let's get started I'm just going
to make a three classes I've already
made these I put them in a libs folder
called emailer messages and settings
okay they're all blank right now just
class settings class email or class
messages by the way this is an auto load
function you can just copy it and type
it in and it's pretty easy to figure out
okay so with the settings I'm just going
to create some some settings okay so
let's see a function construct one of
when this is protected it means it can't
this actual object cannot be constructed
unless it's from a child okay so you
won't be able to construct this you
won't be able to do
okay you won't be able to do this
because this is outside the scope of the
class so it seems like a problem but it
won't in a minute so I'll just get some
features like let me create a function
public function make this will make our
settings this site email this site name
this user ID okay I'm just putting in
some example info okay and then we're
gonna once this settings is constructed
we're going to make it so self make and
this will call this once we create a
settings object that's good for now this
could be something like a database where
you do MySQL you know something like
that let's go to our email or class and
this is going to extend settings extend
settings whoops
extends first thing we're going to do is
public function but parent construct
okay I'll create a couple more functions
this message this would be a sample
email sender
so if the message is not empty you know
this would actually be the mail function
here but I'm just going to return
message from this site name okay
else so this site name you can tell it's
not whoops let me do something right
here private message private okay
private means that it can't be accessed
anywhere except in the email or class
protected like this means it can only be
accessed in this class itself or its
children and then there's public so this
is called encapsulation it's just a
security thing you'll realize how useful
it is later so we got this and let's see
I'll go to index and test it out set
equals new settings so instead of new
settings see we can't construct settings
because it is protected so we're going
to do a new email err
okay it's blank but let me fill
something in okay here's just a sample
message and then I'll check the output
okay
now that in here it's the settings and
settings becomes kind of invisible it's
almost like it has not much to do with
anything but it does and this could be
made a lot more useful and then if we
have messages it's going to be kind of
the same thing you know public function
I should just be very clear on this
we're making the child constructor
public so that we can construct it like
this okay
but we don't want that to be done with
settings because we only want settings
to be used inside of these children
classes don't forget to type extend
settings
we're going to do a parent construct
I'll create a couple functions public
function create message string let me
just do a private post okay
public function post message return
let's see this site in NK once again
we're grabbing this variable which is
inherited meaning it's available inside
messages because it extends settings
which is right here and it's available
because when we create the messages on
it constructs and then it constructs the
parent so once the parents constructed
it does make then it makes all these
variables okay that might sound a little
confusing but if you do it a couple
times you'll get really used to it so
I'll just finish this off with a couple
more from the parent side email this
user ID and this post okay and I will
try that one out
let me just echo oops
we'll do a message equals new messages
you just have to remember your function
names here you know I created the
message object I'm just using these
functions or methods as their proper
name the send message same thing
fatal error to undefined message send
messages oops it's called post message
there we go so that's inheritance in a
nutshell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
