hey guys welcome back in this tutorial
we're just going to upload some effects
we've already gone over a couple of them
but I guess we'll just cover them just
to be safe I just have my script
included up here my tag here for the
document ready if you didn't have this
just do the previous tutorial and then I
just have some HTML here with an
unordered list and I made a button here
with the idea of button so if you go to
the page it just looks like this nothing
fancy and let's uh let's do something
with that button first let's say when
the buttons click so button dot click
function okay alert one just make sure
it's working and good so in effect let's
say let's do the h1 h1 dot and here's an
effect fade out okay and then refresh
and that is not working because we
didn't click the button there we go and
you can set that to slower like 3,000 I
believe that's a millisecond so that
will be kind of slow and you click it
and there it goes cool there's also fade
in but item has to be hidden first so if
you want to do that you'd say H 1 dot
hide when the thing loads Oh we'd have
to change this to fade in ok so we load
the page h ones hidden and when we click
the button we're going to fade in the h1
tag ok so it's hidden and click there it
comes easy peasy now our faith in you
could also use show we've kind of done
this and shows just show and hide
nothing fancy so so there's also slide
up bursar so I
down can't remember which one okay you
can slide it down like that I'm gonna
slow it down to about 2,000
there we go and there's also slide up
and I guess it has to be if you're
hiding it may be okay slide up there she
goes it looks pretty cool for the
default settings and there's a whole
bunch of documentation if you open this
up you can create your own animations
and set your all properties and there's
quite a bit you could do if you wanted
delays fade and fade out slide up um
yeah there's not a ton of effects um but
you can just create your own and it kind
of looks like everything works together
if you use your own animation on the
jQuery site I think they have sufficient
examples of how to do stuff if you just
go down to one of their examples so you
can do a lot with that this tutorial
doesn't need to be any longer so thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
