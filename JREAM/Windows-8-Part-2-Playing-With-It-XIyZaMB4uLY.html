installed obviously you've probably seen
a lot of the stuff and people
complaining there's no start menu and
really the trick is to go to the corners
of the screen and I'm used to having my
start menu with the stop at the top so
it's kind of weird for me because I'm
used to going like right here for the
start menu but this brings back a list
of open applications the Start menu is
down at the bottom left so it's also a
little tricky on two screens because if
I move my mouse over i go to my second
screen and to get to the this menu here
I have to slowly go to the corner down
here and if I don't then I get to the
start menu on the other screen because
it'd be down there so that's something
that needs like a snap to or something
so you all know the start menu here and
it's a matter of getting used to it I
put my desktop here so I can just
quickly click it hit my windows key
because that's what I'm always using and
then my most used applications there's a
lot of Windows things that come with
this that I'm probably never going to
use like the windows mail and Bing and
all that like here's Bing so I could
right click this I don't have an xbox I
could right click that I could click
this down here to unpin from start I
also don't have a camera so I don't need
that you can customize this and make it
look kind of nice you can make it larger
each one of these if you'd like like
Photoshop let's see opening the window
in it looks like you can't make these
larger because they're not native
windows 8 whatever the these things are
so I'll unclick that you can zoom out
and name your group if I am zoomed out I
can name this as
ms stuff that's what it is it might call
this one main now on a PC using this
without a touch pad or a touch screen is
a little it's a little strange because
the best buy it was really really nice
mostly because moving your mouse to this
bottom corner and this corner I think if
you didn't have dual screens it'd be
about 10 times nicer that's probably my
only complaint is the dual monitors and
at first I hated this thing and now it's
growing on me a little bit I would like
if you could make this background
transparent so I could see this desktop
while I'm here and then it wouldn't feel
like an entire separate chunk of
software so Microsoft has a store if you
use Android or Apple it's kind of the
same thing and you can just click
something install
and go back I'm not going to spend five
dollars on angry birds space because it
was a lot cheaper on the phone it
doesn't look like there's a ton of apps
they have a good amount but nothing
compared to apple or android but all
this listings I've been 71 apps for
music and video that's a decent start I
thought that weren't going to have
anything let's see they have games like
top 3 90 games that's a very good start
in my opinion one thing that's weird as
you're chillin like saying the store is
like hey how do I get back to my other
area or how do I close this and you
actually can't close it just normally
which is weird so I could go to start
and if i go to my top left it's still up
here alright so you can flip between
apps like by clicking this it's kind of
interesting well here's my open apolis
if i actually wanted to close it I'd
right click and say close now still
longer on there i will say that i did
read windows idols things so like it's
literally not doing anything if you
leave those little guys open so a neat
little trick i found with the windows
apps me oh let me show you how to move
stuff i could drag skype and create a
new group or let him join a group and i
think this interface is actually really
nice to use i really like it my only
concern with it as see how these icons
don't look as cool is not to say these
look cool but the colors are flat and
like the font here it just doesn't feel
right with all these different things
so I'm giving it the fair college try
i'm starting to like it my thing is I
want to be productive in it too and
that's the kicker the hard part so an
interesting thing with this is if I want
to open hulu plus how about skype and
well hey I don't have a webcam I don't
know what that I don't really use skype
much so I'll go to my Start menu my
desktop and with my open apps chillin
here I can actually drag skype out and
put him on the side and that's very
interesting I don't have skype setup but
uh I have a skype account so i got my
desktop over here and then a windows
application right there that's crazy man
okay sorry i had to pause the video and
gather my thoughts up here we have a
keyboard on every screen it's a touch
keyboard because this is made for
touchscreens too here's one thing that I
did not like look at the boxes and
designs here it's kind of like really
plain and they also throw this icon here
and I think I think that I times usually
in the application but this is more like
a couple colors 256 colors or so versus
two colors so it doesn't feel like it
fits look if I open up Windows Explorer
by the way my desktop icon showed up
because i'm using stardock fences and
that doesn't have to do with windows 8
these little boxes aren't part of
Windows 8 it's just a free application
so as I was saying see these icons and
then you go over here and they're all
playing this icon isn't part of Windows
8 this is displayfusion for multi
pull monitor settings and you see I have
a solid state hard drive I don't have a
ton of free space you know consolidate
hard drives are really expensive it's
only 128 gigabytes so I don't know if
it's windows taking up all the space
because i just recently updated and
reformatted my hard drive so i will find
out eventually they also have these
ribbons so i'm not used to reading
things like this this is like a
microsoft office things to me it kind of
scares me to read these it just seems
weird to me I'm not used to it and this
little chat box with paper doesn't look
like a property button if someone wanted
they could click this little pin icon
you manage on that at first I hated it
now it's just like yeah you can hide it
so I don't care and they took my windows
old I think that was windows 7 and they
put all of it in here that might be
taking a lot of space not sure
so with the skype open which I don't
really need I guess I want to close it
so I could just shrink this bar all the
way to the side oh yeah microsoft bought
skype that's why forgot about that what
else do they have settings so one thing
that I didn't like as well its settings
to turn it off you gotta click them
buttons and go to hear click power it's
not a big deal i guess tiles show
administrative tools that should show
them on here it should load and second
air is so that I guess I could just name
this but who wants a scroll guy huh what
do i need to me that's kind of weird so
i might prefer the old-fashioned way is
i'm just chillin here I hit the Windows
key and you can just start typing so
i'll say device well that's no fun and
then find device man so let's all your
apps there that's one thing that's nice
you just hit windows key and start
typing as if you were on windows 7 as
well so i'll say a photo and there we go
i guess maybe it makes sense that they
don't have the same icons these Metro
icons is these otherwise you might get
the windows that were used to confuse
with these applications load up some
Netflix
put my desktop up here if you had one
screen it might be cool to all that be a
little bar maybe throw up some kind of
search bar something I supposedly
installed google but I'm not seeing it
here all apps oops there's a get google
for your computer because you know Bing
Google a for windows
I'm just used to pressing the Windows
key now there's a touchpad that i did
get but i'm not going to really talk
about it because i haven't used it long
enough to get a feel for but i probably
will be returning it it's cool but i
don't need it and i don't want to spend
the time to customize it it's just that
corner piece man so the admin tools
tiles it's weirder that's the only
option there it's not sure to hide those
cool I think someone would really like
Windows 8 if they get a laptop a laptop
/ tablet or laptop touch screen because
it makes using this awesome you know cuz
I on a tablet you usually open one app
at a time you go in there and that's all
you do I prefer Spotify on here however
with the windows 8 on a say laptop thats
also has this stuff it feel like a
tablet and a desktop which might be kind
of cool so throw up big on the side
whoops boom
let's see our alt tab there's our alt
tab stuff just like a normal windows
system man just kind of changed it up I
think people will really like it they
just play with it a little bit i'm
starting to like it I thought it was the
devil at first but uh it's pretty
exciting I think that'll wrap it up
