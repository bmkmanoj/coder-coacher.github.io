off in part two and that was deleting
and creating users with the admin panel
so first we're going to add an email and
the password is the arguments here and
to delete a user will add a user ID so
for the main admin page if we go there
we're going to need a view called admin
so on my side I'll go to my views folder
now and I'll create a new PHP file
called admin and this will be our admin
okay and we're going to create a form
and we'll create an input box input type
equals text name equals email actually
type would be email html5 and this isn't
styled right now that's not the
important part at the moment
okay and the method will be post and we
want to post this to the admin
controller so let's see we want to
create a user so I'll say action equals
site URL and that's short to put in the
code igniter site URL admin great user
ok so if i go here let's see if we go to
admin we have our admin here but i'm not
seeing my form so wonder why that is i
must not have short tags enable what if
i do this nope so back to the admin page
this load view of admin the view name is
admin so something's kind of fishing
well let's type in a number two after
the word admin to see if that's changing
it is so I have a problem with my form
and I'm guessing it's right there so
i'll go ahead and refresh again there it
is and that is the problem so let me try
that again it looks like a site URL that
might be a helper so I'll put that back
I'll go to my auto load and my helpers
and I'm going to put in url so i'll go
ahead and refresh that and it's still
there cool now it works next I need to
submit button
I'll say input type equals submit okay
and we can also use the input class for
now we'll keep it dead simple when I
rethink about this we actually don't
need these in here we're going to post
them it's all post email post password
don't worry about the security just
right now will harden this up later ok
so I'm going to create post the email
and the password what I want to do is
return result from this create so in the
user model I'll just return the result
or turn that result and let's see what
we get if we create the form test to
test calm test what's a better refresh
it and we'll get one success so in the
database the user table data here's test
and test work on the corruption and
everything at some point looks good next
I want to create a login controller now
there's a couple of ways we can go about
this we could have a login for the
general user and a login for the admin
so instead of making a log and
controller how about I put it under home
and I'll say public function log in this
load view of logon and this will be for
the public so let's change the main
index you to home because that is
confusing and we would create a view for
logon so I to just copy paste i'll call
this logon and email and password the
only difference is this is going to go
to a different URL and be home long
we'll get to that part actually what we
also want to do is create a folder
called public so I'll just go under the
source files and create a new folder and
call it public a new folder called CSS
and a new file hold style dot CSS give a
body background of silver okay we will
implement this just yet but it's
starting point so inside the views we're
going to want to have to make it include
folder so I'll make a new folder called
ink and inside of here we'll have a
reusable header i'll call this header
and this one footer and really it is
just going to say footer just some
standard HTML and for the doctype HTML
okay we'll just call it my site so what
we're going to do real quick before the
video gets too long is include these
when we call our controllers so in our
admin we load of view I'll do ink header
and ink footer and refresh there's our
footer did the header work yep so that
will easily include a top and bottom for
the site easy-peasy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
