dream and this is gonna be a video
mm-hmm a livestream about react j/s it's
pretty popular and I'm sure a lot of you
have heard the wars between view angular
I have my window you've heard the wars
between angular react and view j/s which
one is better I will be including JSX
in this video and really when it comes
down to it when I compare react to view
they're the most similar it's hard to
decide which one is better I'd say react
there's at the moment more jobs but if
you look at the trends UJS has grown so
much I think it has the potential to
take over the benefit to react at this
point in time is that there is a react
native so you can make you know native
applications with it
where is view j/s you use something
called week's w ee x believe it's by
apache and really what I'm focused on is
the website now so we're gonna just
start with a new folder and I'll go
ahead and share my screen I'm working
with the new the OBS studio and trying
to transition smoothly
so I will go to the desktop yeah okay so
I have vs code open and hopefully you
have no js' installed I just made a
folder someplace I called it red 101 so
you can make a folder anywhere with no
js' well on your system that is whether
using Mac Windows doesn't really matter
and the first thing we're going to want
to do in our empty folder is NPM make
sure you have that installed you should
be able to type in hit enter we're just
going to do NPM in it - why so it just
creates the defaults for us I'm trying
to go a little slow just in case right
now if anyone's trying to rush they can
catch up and here in vs code you can use
sublime text or any editor you look like
I have my package.json file which are
generated and there are quite a few ways
to go about react I want to do it first
the most raw in purest way because when
you just jump into any generated
application which is nice it's not as
easy so I'm thinking about using
something called parcel and that doesn't
require any configuration so let's just
start out with some basics whoops by the
way I use yarn a lot that's just an
alternative to NPM but I'll stick with
NPM that's probably what most do you
have installed so what I'm going to
install our few packages that I do
pretty much for everything and you can
do I for shorthand shorthand for install
and I'm gonna do es lint
you know es6 and all that stuff you
don't have to install this but if you
are using vs code sublime text or
anything there's always a eslint plugin
and this will help make your code pretty
and avoid errors and find errors and
then I'll just do es lint plugin -
import and hopefully you guys can read
this okay and one more is es lint
- config - air B&amp;amp;B - base and I kind of
picked up this from a previous job
mm-hmm the Airbnb base style all this is
is a linter cleans up your code for you
and you can turn settings on to save it
and all that if you want there are other
things like Jas hint I think there's a
jslint and I was using a few of them but
I decided to just cut down to one it
just makes things easier okay you can
read it fine that's good okay now I have
a few repositories open on another
screen and what I'm gonna do is install
something you guys may have never heard
of I'm not sure if this is the best way
to do it because we can use CD and so if
I switch windows if I wanted to do it
the Ross way
it's funny a view pop-up comes up while
I'm trying to show react let me just do
reacts see the end so we do have the
option of doing this and including the
production min file one thing to keep in
mind is I'm not certain if this file
here includes the react to Dom ok so
there's there's two files there's just
react by itself when you get to the
brass tacks of it and then there's the
react dum and that has to do with the
JSX where it looks like XML or XHTML in
your markup and I will be using both
react and rhythm and react Dom is
actually very large compared to react if
I go to NPM j/s calm and just look up
react
we have react and rat down they are the
top two they usually go hand in hand and
I don't see many projects that do not
use read Dom and if you think of jQuery
jQuery is a Dom manipulator as in
document object model and it looks like
this it looks a little bit weird where
you have this render here okay so that's
rat down and we're just gonna go ahead
and install those and just give me one
moment to look at a few of my demos
mm-hmm so that I can hopefully make this
as easy as possible I feel like if I add
parcel which is
parcel j s org so this is a very
interesting packaging
I guess bundler you'd say where it can
lazy load things on the fly if it's not
needed it doesn't load it so it's pretty
cool if you test it out and all that so
I will probably do this I think it'll be
the easiest way to do it I'm gonna do
NPM I and I believe it was called parcel
just don't want to get it wrong and
really this should be kind of like a
zero config so I'll do parcel - bundler
now I want this to be under my dev
dependencies actually I even want these
to be there - so I'm just gonna do the
word dev dependencies I may be being a
little picky here I just like things in
the right place but that's okay so we
need the parcel bundler let's see let me
read this those questions for
performance reasons should we use just
react without jQuery or do they
complement each other
um you don't really need jQuery when
using react or view that I've seen
because you're trying to keep track of
your state where what the state is of
each component in your Dom imagine you
have one for users and another for
products and you have user a logged in
you want to remember that the user
component for that given session is user
a and the other is a selected product
whereas jQuery wouldn't be needed for
any of that but as far as Dom selection
I don't believe you you need that either
you kind of do that in line with JSX
so we'll install a parcel bundler and
we're gonna do a Babel
so Babel preset env as an environment
now there is a tool called create react
app okay and I would like to show you
that but I want to do this it's kind of
raw as possible so that you get the feel
of it anything you do in es6 and above
you're gonna have to monkey or just have
a wet pack set up or something UJS has a
nice generator but you know that's
optional one more Babel thing we need is
Babel - preset - react okay I forgot the
- D so I'm just gonna cancel and do - D
and what that does is it sends it in the
dev dependencies okay now if you're on
Windows I did notice that things go a
bit slower with no js' and actually in
the terminal in general but I am when
I'm in Windows I use a emulated terminal
I don't know if that has anything to do
with it like con mu or CMD ER okay so
that installed those guys and you should
have something with a couple of things
here and it might scare you because if
you were to look in your node modules
folder it looks crazy
and that's a lot of dependencies but
it's something you should not be
concerned about next we're going to
install the actual dependencies so NPM I
react and react - Dom okay and it might
help if I there we go like that and that
should go into the dependencies because
that's what we actually want to mmm
those are like our real dependencies
okay so dependencies is down here and
you know I'm a little bit of a weirdo I
like this to be up here don't don't
bother doing this because you're you
might mess up your Jason and then feel
like you're falling behind and I will
upload this to YouTube as well so we
have this and we don't really have
anything here sorry losing my voice what
we're gonna do is make a babel RC file
if you're not familiar with babel this
is a transpiler
and really what that means is it Trant
it kind of translates an older laying a
newer language down to a compatible
older language I suppose that's the best
way I could put it and this can read a
dot babel RC file okay
and in here we just have to put our
preset of if I can split this
oops a package Jason
I'm gonna need some more room let me
maximize this I had to do 1920 by 1080
resolution so it could fit on the screen
so you see we have our env here for
babel and react the way we set those up
for babel is pretty much Jason
so we'll say presets env react okay let
me just check the comments Thursday
listen there's a lot of things you can
do you can use react as a CDN you can
have a web pick web pack setup I'm just
trying to do it raw right here I know I
keep saying that it probably sounds
silly but the point of it is so mm-hmm
you guys get the kind of the feel for it
and by the way if you're using a view V
Yui
if you were to do it raw native or
whatever like this you do pretty much a
very similar thing they both have
generators now if you were to do this
with angular good luck you probably
can't wait too much to set up so one
thing we always want to do is make a
file called our git ignore you guys are
familiar with this always add your node
modules I'll just save that and we'll
make a new file and this is going to be
very simple I'm just going to call it
app dot J s with a capital A and this is
just going to be our main react file
very basic we're gonna make another one
app dot CSS okay and make sure I have my
packages right okay
and I thought I had something else in
the get ignore I'm just double-checking
so I don't pull it doozy alright so make
sure this is safe we should be able to
close this safely and be able RC also
and we want to lastly make an index.html
now if you're lost and confused that's
okay because we don't have a folder
structure set up at all what we would
normally do is have a components folder
and if you've used angular I forget what
they call it I think they call it app
but app is kind of like your route to
the whole application it's the main
entry point so what we're going to do is
in index.html let me close some of these
I'll close others we'll just do some
simple HTML sorry I don't have a snippet
for this but I'll do a doctype whoops
HTML I don't care of all the capital
letters and some English language a body
tag gonna have to have a head tag in
here if you're wondering how I'm
magically completing tags it's because
it's Auto close tags and I always have a
habit of making the character say utf-8
and one thing that's really important
that you don't want to forget is the
viewport name equals view port and you
set a content width content equals sorry
okay
looks like my virtual machine wants to
be a bully at the moment there we go
sorry alright so its width equals to
twice - width and this is in like any
template you can find and I apologize
that I may be going a little slow and
initial scale is one point we can do a
skip to ie compatible stuff for now and
I'm just gonna have a title I'm gonna
color react 101 okay so at least we have
a HTML to work with and we have our body
tag in here we need a something to place
what our app is going to go into okay
and please keep in mind that whoops I
got that autosave on and it always makes
it look hideous let me turn that off for
the sake of this
yes lint editor on save
okay let me try again okay okay
I don't I like things a certain way I'm
a weirdo probably most to you
so yeah I really need a snippet thing to
generate something like that so we're
gonna make a div ID equals root you can
call it whatever you want I'm gonna call
it root and what we're going to need is
an entry point script you know we put
our script tags at the bottom mm-hmm and
I am going to do in index.js file so
script SRC equals index J s nothing too
complex here index J s and from here is
where we're going to import the stuff we
want and look I know it's like dude you
have a lot of files hanging out here and
it's it's true because it's it's not
really organized yet and I think we'll
get to that when we kind of cover this
rawness the pureness and the goodness so
for our index.html we're just going to
do some imports so import ryoshu import
let's capitalize react from react and
keep in mind this coat here last I
recall you can't do it in the note jsut
have to actually use the require and
then import react oops
dum-dum and you could really spell that
anyway you wanted those variables there
and what we're gonna do is make a sample
application and let's just say we want
to import the app we could put these in
a separate folder I guess for now we'll
keep it a little confusing import app
from App okay so that's going to import
this app.js file that might it make this
might look a little confusing if if this
is confusing to anyone let me know and I
will put it in folders okay and I
realized that the recording is I don't
know 15 or 20 seconds behind so just let
me know if that's kind of confusing and
I'll back up so then we just want to do
something simple like react
there we go Dom render
and what we're going to render is a app
okay this is JSX and then we choose
where to render it to and as I believe
it was our ALM s mentioned you could use
jQuery I haven't done it in here to
select a Dom element but with es6 you
can get away with a lot you know you
have document get well I'll use by ID
but you also have all of these you can
get element by class name name which
would be and notice there's plurals on
some of these so that would be multiple
elements maybe not as pretty and a
little bit longer but you know it's not
totally necessary to add an entire
library but jQuery slim is pretty good
so just to recall remember that our
index.html we call this route so we're
placing this app element inside of route
okay let me save what's this squiggly
unexpected token I may not have wrapped
tools on here I should if this if this
becomes a problem I'll fix that so then
we have this which is going to insert
whatever's inside of the app okay so let
me kind of draw it out for you in a
comment well I'll comment it out after I
type it so we have our index.html and
then we have what's happening is
we have a container for our react app
right and then the index dice can mal
loads index touch oops
dr. s you know that could be whatever
whatever you want to call it and then
the index J s and I'm sorry if this is
slow for you but I did say this was
quite beginner this loads the react
library to react Dom as you can see
above right up here and we're also
loading an app which is our main
component a shoe is trying to do
something smart up there okay and then
we render the Dom with read okay so what
we're going to do is we want to place
things within the app component because
this is our main component so if you
come from angular or view I've used all
of them I'd say angular is by far
without a doubt the most difficult we're
trying to this is going to basically
create this it's going to create that
app in here and then we want to put you
know XYZ other components in here and
react is going to dynamically manage
them so I'll just undo that
and I can comment this out I'll just
call this basic flow okay and I might
spruce up those comments before I do a
git commit so that it maybe makes a
little more sense who knows we might get
far so we have this happening and we do
need one thing I think this
that should actually work okay so I'll
just go ahead and test my browser where
did I save that we should be able to
open this index.html now I can do run
code and I should open it in chrome okay
let me do this source to see what I
screwed up and I have the wrong view on
this guy
hey console all right indexed ah yes I'm
escaped identifier is it really gonna
give me that shindig so I must not be
lonely parcel correctly
I have index J yes
Oh shoo I made this library with like
just one second
flustered let the little child inside
yeah that's okay I think sorry that's my
phone
I think parcel may have a config but I
have it in a distribution so I'm kind of
confused this is a this is some github
code I did a while back that I'm looking
at so I could have prepared a little
better index J s react is included here
in index J s and here and we're
importing here
I'm just looking where I'm missing one
thing babel RC okay index dot J is
packaged Jason oh that's my mistake
package Jason if you're not familiar you
can run scripts in here let me close
this let's see if we have scripts so
open your package JSON file and we're
just going to make a new guy here and
we're gonna call this start that
shouldn't be a problem that just means
this directory I mean you really you
can't you can do that but you guys it's
uh it's because it doesn't know to use
parcel at all which is basically the
little bundler so we just got to add a
little tag here and I'm pretty confident
this should fix it so we want to run
parcel with index.html and by doing that
it should bundle things so boy let me
move my phone so it's not vibrating
once you add this okay package Jason
you're going to want to open up a
terminal so
you can open a terminal in vs code if
you want but I don't have to do it here
and clear and you should be able to type
NPM runs start well if that start
sometimes I think if you can just do NPM
start yeah so you see how parcel is
building this and then it says built it
gives us a little localhost to play with
so just make sure you look at my code
here where I put scripts not the lock
file never touch the lock file we're
just using parcel to interpret all of
this stuff so if I just right click and
open a link of one two three four just
I'm gonna open the box so let me brief
what happened here
rat create element type is invalid
expected a string so this to export or
we didn't even make a component yet all
right we're good
okay is long if you guys have this
you're good so we just need to make any
component here for our app because right
now it's not even doing anything so
we're just gonna say import react
from react and we're gonna use a
component so the rack library natively
we can do it this way come on it ok so
this here this is the react library I
don't know if I have a hotkey for it to
jump to it there we go
now if I go to through this this is
crazy this is typescript which gives you
in our case nice references this is what
angular uses but if I control R and
there to react
the main guy here yeah I'm not even
gonna go through this is just going to
confuse everyone just believe me when I
say we're importing react and we're
using the component ok and from here if
you've used view Jas usually they have a
separate component with CSS but in here
we can import our CSS we can just say
import app dot CSS and now for the
component part okay and one thing i do
not like to forget is to export so we
want to export default default app and
i'm just gonna make a class app ok so
that's it's not right yet but we'll get
there our class name is app okay we're
exporting app close this out and where's
the index J s I'll move this guy over
here and if we look at the index J sorry
the index J s we're importing the app
and whatever this returns this class
which has returned from here there's you
export and then you import and then
we're using this app here with JSX right
here and this might seem extremely
confusing
we might be learned this the hard way
well a harder way and I could probably
show you like you know the auto code
generated way but to me this is the way
you learn it you do it the hard way so
we need to extend the component okay
because as you know es6 has classes and
this is not too bad we have a render
function okay let me just see what
Simone says index J s unexpected and a
file at line one
column two index
- yes
okay well don't be you don't go in your
browser just right now we've got we
don't have anything here yet let's
finish this don't worry you have an
error in error just yet and what we're
going to do is return something whoops
okay yep let me open Babel RC over here
okay it looks like my Auto format it
here for some reason but I had it like
this there we go
so presets is plural the env is the
Babel environment and then react is the
Babel react dev dependency got to make
sure you have that right one benefit to
this is that you will be able to use it
just to play around once you get it set
up with anything you want so if you
haven't noticed a dist folder appeared
after parcel ran okay and remember when
we had an error it created these files
here for us also the index.html which I
didn't know it did that part just to
rename stuff awesome okay
he's on the same page so with render
let's return something we're going to
return some JSX so we'll start with a
div tag and I know this is gonna look
really weird if you're not used to JSX
how about a h1 and we'll say welcome to
react okay and if we wanted to add a
class name to this this is one thing
that comes up a lot we cannot add class
because class is already a JavaScript
term so I forget the other one off the
top of my head but we have to do the
class name in camel case it's not that
big a deal and you know we could just
call this I don't know I'll call it the
same name here so and this would be our
CSS so close this if you're typing this
along and then you get it let's say they
get hover repo and you just kind of go
through it a few times it's going to
make a lot of sense
everything goes in here all in fact I'll
make a comment
everything goes here okay in the
index.html route so let me open the CSS
so that we have something we don't have
a theme or template or anything so just
to do some CSS I am going to blow your
mind with this skill I am gonna toss on
a background color of how about f4 f4
and font color I'm gonna do two five two
five a nice little dim black and we have
our app class now I don't usually name
things capital so how about I just do it
lowercase
lowercase app sorry for the changes
we're doing it on the fly here so with
app let's just I don't know adding 20
pics no let's do 3 sorry 5 REM my brain
got a little distracted I was thinking
about the CSS grid CSS grid which by the
way check it out
my next project I will without a doubt
be using that I don't think I'll even
use bootstrap at all
so we have our padding here I'll just
add a border of 1 pixel solid ff1 real
soft gray okay
and we have our fonts okay so we have
our div app welcome to react shoot we
don't have any images really that's okay
let's let me think we're importing app
dot CSS okay we're applying the class
name of dot app and don't these these
things I have here this is just part of
vs code and a plug and I have where's
there's no references don't worry about
that
it just doesn't know right now okay so
very basic now there we go you should
have hot reloaded okay that's part of
parcel they have
quite a few cool features my favorite is
the lazy loading but notice how we
didn't have to set up webpack which is
very big I do use webpack but parcel is
really good
in some situations I haven't used it in
production myself so hopefully if anyone
didn't get that do let me know so with
this this is probably the most basic
application to make okay and I want to
stop on this one here and then move a
step forward and of course if you know
you can't keep going that's fine you can
always come back and watch later if you
want I could organize the folders too if
I wanted to heck I'm just gonna make a
new file all it read me MD and I'll put
in some info there later okay so
hopefully you guys got that working
you'll be able to play with that and
we're gonna make more modules next what
I'm going to do is cancel this so looks
like there's an error let me just double
check that fjs 9 and 4
mine fours right here I don't know if I
think feel weird or not I'm just gonna
run it again to check okay so it's good
so I'm having trouble connecting to the
internet let's just shut up take a look
at the Help section in your Alexa and I
say spying on me so I'm gonna make a
dirt I'm just gonna call this um oh one
what was that called pack parcel okay
and I'm just going to move all - oops oh
okay
and I need to list all LTA and make sure
I move dot Babel RC into own parcel if
we do need to copy it back down you no
big deal move you see what's in get
ignore real quick just to remember Oh
super expression okay one sec
let me just move dude what's this le doc
I just want to see what this cash guys
let me just VIN the gate ignore I don't
know everything but I want to ignore dot
cash I don't know what that is and I'm
just some cash to one parcel cuz I
thought there was a one parcel okay la
so let me just check what the Simone
said regarding is super expression must
be either null or a functions so I would
assume you're an app Jas in here try
this
hey let me make sure I'm seeing in 201
parcel and I'm just going to do NPM
start okay so that parcel is running and
we're gonna do constructor okay and
we're gonna do super did I type this
wrong
oops I forgot the function thing so
perhaps try that let's see that that
shouldn't be a problem I'll make sure to
refresh so is it regarding the Simone's
comment generally you shouldn't have to
do this but going forward we will do it
anytime we use a constructor we always
have to call super first so that it
constructs a the component otherwise I
am NOT certain however I could commit
this code right now just so that you
have it let's see Oh typo so okay that's
a programmers life we I can't tell you
how many times I've made mistakes with
typos I'm gonna close this guy we're
going to move on to let's see we're at
two I have quite a few demos in here and
I want to make a kind of interesting
register server worker that one's a
little difficult
I want to show you a little bit before
we jump into the actual thing I think we
might be okay to do it though
yeah yeah I like using a spell what you
might call it spell checker so what
we're gonna do
did I build this with this you know iron
out let's do this you're going to do NPM
I for install - g for global and it's
called create - react - app enter
okay so you should I will say didn't
name it this I wish they call it like
something different because I believe I
can type for view I just type view but
we're not talking about view right now
okay so this project right here I can
shrink out and close it okay that should
be working for you if it's not hang hang
tight relax it'll be in github you can
do whatever you want with the code the
only reason I put in a patchy license in
there so someone doesn't sue me or some
nonsense or something but it's not like
you're gonna get much anyways I am
looking yep I generated this with CLI I
fixed myself to the screen why eyes wide
open so hopefully everyone in stock
hopefully everyone installed that so
we're here we should be able to type
create - react app and press the tab key
to kind of autofill and if you just
press ENTER it should say hey this is
how you do it okay and this is kind of
like a default folder structure I wanted
to show you one way of doing it I guess
it's just going to be easy to jump in by
doing it this way so I'm gonna call this
o - how about with
Jen - CLI what a terrible name Jen - COI
I want to get rid of that - there but
can't have a perfect we're doing it on
the fly like what's that guy from Back
to the Future mmm Marty McFly so it says
how to do it if you don't have the yarn
installed it's fine relax we can use NPM
so I'll see you into the folder I
created hopefully you'd rent generated
yours and what we have now it might be
easier to actually look in here let me
start bill okay it should have installed
depent all these dependencies so they
use webpack and they set up all this
stuff for you and hot reload so it's
it's heavier but you know web packs a
very good piece of software so let me
just change one setting so I can zoom
this a bit so let's write 127 all right
I'm going for - I want you guys to be
able to see my youth my bar here okay
and by the way when this says you is
just uncommitted I guess untracked is
the word so this is the default
structure in which you generates a
default application and if I'm not
mistaken sorry
react if I'm not mistaken react uses
jest by default which is a unit testing
framework I'm not it looks like they
didn't include it though
so if we go to the package.json where's
oh here it is the scripts what we want
to run is start okay so within the the
new one we created with the CLI has a
nice little welcome page so I can say
npm start okay and this guy's loading
around port 3000 okay so welcome to
react and hopefully you guys got this
so go it's a nice think that's a SVG so
we have that running and this should hot
reload okay I'm pretty sure I don't keep
track of all this we have our app dot J
s and let me split these windows I'll
shoot it closed it
index jas oh they did crap I didn't
realize we're doing kind of the same
thing
there's just in a nested folder yes
Windows with NPM I don't know why it's
so slow yep
let me try to talk a little bit closer
does this come in a little bit clearer I
could turn up let me see the game
there's a little bit more gain there let
me know if that's still too quiet so
what we're looking at is basically
similar to what we did it's pretty cool
that you can toss in something like an
SVG or CSS I have not messed with the
web pack config in the default generator
which made this nice little application
for us it includes the get ignore to
ignore crap we don't want and the readme
file is actually quite handy and we can
use a lot of information from that if
you don't have a yarn bat lock don't
worry about it it's just like having a
package dot lock or something so what we
want to do is make a new folder and
let's call it components and we can make
a new component sometimes it's just if I
go to app J ass and lose copy and paste
okay and I will just call this whoops
products if I could spell
products whether it's plural or not is
up to you
app is not plural so I'm actually gonna
call it product okay right up and so we
changed the class make sure you change
the guy here and there are some trips
where you could I believe I haven't
actually done this this way I think you
can do something like this I thought
it's a little sloppier though but then
you won't have to type it twice but I'm
just gonna stick to the convention that
they have set up a product down here
and of course we're gonna want to change
these class names it looks like they did
name the defaults with capital letters
we're not going to have a header for
anything to do with products and app
intro we don't really care about that
okay product and then I'm gonna just
let's see we have a class name of
product and I'm just gonna make a
product CSS okay so let's just say dot
product border:1px solid
I don't know silver add some padding
five rim and we don't really care now
one thing we can do which I I would
really recommend is that you put
components in their own folders so that
once this gets big you might you might
have a unit test within the same
components or you might have a test
folder nodejs usually has in the route
where it's called
test and you put crap in there we'll
just try it doing this so make a new
folder and call it product now this is
opinion opinion based it's not like this
is the D way to do it okay
let me just make sure I say this is a
product and just in case anyone's not
familiar with es6 what we can do is kind
of a convenience thing instead of always
having to export one by one like let's
say I wanted to import product into here
okay look not the CSS the J s here so I
would have to say import I'm in app dot
J s
components slash right up front and it
does not end with dot J s and you should
spell import right okay
so if I had more things that I have to
import them like this like that's any
dog cat right so we want to use I think
it's called a bundler not a bundler not
something with a B so I would it's an
index dot JSP it's kind of like a little
bit like a Python in it file a little
bit like a just requires a lot of files
so under components I'm going to make a
new file and call this index J s in with
this this is where we include all the
things that we want to export from our
components so I will say gosh I just
brainfart it yeah it should be just
import that so oh it's no components so
I want to assign this a value say like
Const product equals will do require
I believe okay and what we'll do is
module dot exports equals product so the
the reason
how many indexes and at dot GS is how
we're going to that oh this is optional
just so you know and I want to show you
why I'm doing this because just pretend
you know in an application we're not
going to have just one component you're
gonna have even little components like
maybe it's subfolder within here called
partials that partials may include like
a navigation breadcrumbs
maybe footer links if they're related or
needed to be in there you you you will
be much better off having one file that
exports all the things four components
and then you can just import one file
and just declare it in there which I'll
show you we only have one item here and
I want to mention that since I'm gonna
use the same name product I don't need a
key because what this actually
translates into is this and you see I
get an error well if I say I have to
unnecessarily quoted some guy so but if
I named it a lowercase P oh sorry it
doesn't need to be quoted first of all
okay lower case B and then a capital P
it was the same thing you don't need
both so you just do product right now
product doesn't really have anything in
it and if we go to our app dot J s what
we do is instead of this we do
import Mirada
we'd actually put this probably in these
braces because we would import a lot
more of them import product from dot
slash components okay so what this is
going to do is anytime we add something
new we just say like let's say animal
user we just add it like that because
components this guy automatically reads
the index file and anytime you want to
include a local file within es6 remember
you have to have a dot slash before it
otherwise it'll think it's a no js'
module if i did this it's nothing this
is somewhere in nodejs called components
just how react is up there so i want to
undo that and again this is an optional
way to do it I just think it's cleaner
like I said it's it's just opinionated
and everyone has opinions I don't know
the best way to do everything so within
our app what we can do is load our
product within here and this might seem
kind of weird I'm just going to make a
new P tag okay and then here I will do a
product okay and this will load our
module I'm going to double check my
source because
did I did I add anything to that
component I believe I did
I don't want to screw you guys up so I
mean I tried typing this out before even
doing this
and just like Simone says there's a lot
of next files there are they really are
okay I mean a bigger window over on my
other screen do we want to deal with the
state yet no we don't want to deal with
the state yet you know we'll get the
state shortly so I'm sorry for how slow
this is going it's a little bit slower
than I predicted
okay and just to remind you our
index.html and I collapse this our
indexed HT where is that then I'm blind
as a bat
oh it's under public we can actually
delete this crap here I don't know okay
oh it's a HTML template no and no script
tags I mean that's something you don't
see very often merci so this is your
main thing like if you wanted you could
include like Twitter bootstrap in here
but you could also include Twitter
bootstrap inside the was it this guy
here okay and did I just make a separate
CSS for the product yeah that was kind
of stupid we can have a global CSS or a
per almost like a hmbc
here are both here are key MVC however
you say it it's up to you I I don't
think I give a crap about this CSS file
to be honest we want we care about this
working so let me just get rid of it
make it simple
so we have our product draya's file we
do need to just change pack let's just
do it let's just do it like this Imam
says make it simpler my goal is not to
confuse you guys so import product from
components slash product
that should be correct let's see product
does not have an export name product so
product product is brought up up
I'm so tired why is this longer apt us
yes well we don't want this here okay I
need us something the es lint I have the
rules they need react JSX valid
something's wrong here
app J ass line why does a line 92 does
not have oh gosh not the bundle if the
bundles are scary look at Wow 23,000
lines those are 30,000 lines must have
the map in there now I may have a rap
login Airness see if it works
yeah I'll have to have something to
monitor keep track of State and stuff
components product does not contain an
explorer right spell that plural
your product right up right up right at
that genius
if anyone sees what it sees the obvious
miss just feel free
huh
import react component from react
components project product product I
should have chosen something a little
easier that makes sense
extends component okay and we're
returning one thing by the way this
return here you can't do this like this
you can't do that you can only return on
one parent element just so you know so
you definitely messed something in there
or area if you wanted multiples of
something that's handy to know so we
have the correct component react okay
components plural let me just check my
source
okay nothing there has changed fjs so it
really should be the app it's probably
the stupid thing here right yeah cuz man
I'm so dumb I think it's because I put
these braces here doing it that way this
is basically saying what that saying is
product dot product when I do that so
this should fix it okay there we go so
you see this is our product I hear I
know it's not amazing but we're making
progress okay this will actually do
stuff and become easier he's going to
check with this bad boy stays valid on
nest and div cannot appear as descendant
of P in product J s
yeah whatever let me see if I delete the
paragraph tag something might happen
whatever I don't care about that right
now let's go screw you know so let's say
we have a product and we want to kind of
make this a product what does a product
have attributes okay we'll do attributes
new let's just copy and paste copy paste
rename attribute nom plural because
that's how they're doing it and change
attribute attribute attribute and you
know class name here of course it's only
applying to the front end stuff so
that's all good and before we forget we
always want to add to our at Jas of
attribute so in this case I would
duplicate this line attribute attribute
and just remember how I was saying you
know with the braces kind of like up
here it's really your opinion of what
you think works best now I will say
there are add-ons that do make this a
lot easier we're doing it by hand so you
know what's happening name price
category quantity yeah so we're already
extending component that's good what we
will do
this is an attribute okay and we want to
let's say create a product also okay so
if I have a product here we'll make this
better
just you'll be happy I think I'll paste
again and I'll just call this create you
could call it whatever you want really
should be cold wait I'm gonna product
create product create product create
product create from the create okay and
once again I have AB KS open over here
oops that's index closed I just and
we'll just add the product create
product great okay and then we would I
suppose duplicate this and change that
to product create okay so remember these
are components and they're isolated over
here we're doing it very simple there's
probably a lot of different design
patterns to this or structural
organization ways of doing it but it's
not too hard what we're going to have to
do now is with product create we're
gonna we're going to need to have a
little form to create something
so we have to keep track of the state of
something okay this is where just try to
pay attention closely okay so if we're
going to create a project or product
actually sorry I get a name so confuse I
can close that today what we need is to
handle the state and we're gonna add a
constructor and you might say why do we
need a constructor because that's gonna
be one of the first things loaded before
rendering it's just guaranteed I have a
bug in my imports we're at
do you recall which file it was Markov
ah
so just real quick we would add a super
here remember that we want to construct
the component first and then we can use
the this statement if we do not define
super we can't use this writes it and
we'll just say state okay
and okay
so far that makes sense in the app okay
let me just press f2
product
oh you're right attribute
oh man yeah sorry I keep backing up from
the mic I'm just gonna turn the gain up
quite a bit all right so basically these
are our isolated components we turn the
fan on one moment it's really hot in
here
there we go it's so isolated components
basically a component does yeah I I had
to fix that right here attribute an
attribute
thanks for catching that one silly me
okay does that make sense to you guys
that components kind of serve their own
role the app is like the the container
to everything it's like the the mother
child this is like the mother and it has
its babies in it in this in and all of
this stuff can be crazy dynamic it's
basically what it is and what this does
is it isolates all these
responsibilities so it's a lot easier to
use now if you had a huge app the
question is how can you do this the mo
the most efficiently so it's like
organize them easy to read I believe I
forgot to add
a state so what I want is for the entire
app okay
the mother lover here I want the entire
app to know what products we have so
just like the other things we're going
to do a constructor okay
and we'll do the super of course and
we'll say this dot looks state well
what's that
no oh sorry it was a spam message I you
guys didn't see it looks like template
loading in an MVC acceptable template
from within time yeah it it is pretty
much like that that's a good way to put
a Simone he said it looks like template
loading an MVC and you just load the
template within the template
okay components is it possible use
polymer let me see
I have not used polymer that's it
I have I have not used polymer it's a
2.0 for me J s libraries come out so
fast
o progressive web apps I would have to
do some research on polymer but then you
know if I did that then I'm never gonna
do anything besides study frameworks and
stuff so anyways let's just set this so
this state we want to keep track of the
products let's make this a dictionary
sorry yeah whatever you call the object
in jobs good products and this will be
an empty array and we need to set this
state there's these things called
lifecycle methods okay
there's if you just type the word
component okay
component dead catch dead mouse now if
you're familiar with view JDS mount
sounds very familiar
did it update
will it receive properties will not
we'll update we can use limits do that
mouth
I forgot the difference between did and
will on this I'll go with will so this
in let's make a note life cycle hook
this is part of react
I'll read the comments in just a second
so I think you could actually I think
you could use did moment as well so
since we have a state this is kind of
built in and it's static are static
sorry it's um it has a setter if you're
familiar with what's it in JavaScript
set X you know something kind of funny I
really use it so we'll just say this set
state and then we'll do the little
French braces make a mustache and we're
just gonna fill in some default products
okay we don't have a data store right
now with that said there it note is
really interesting because you can have
it's the weirdest thing I forgot that
just forgot what it's called sup
so it's some kind of flat file database
like it's not
was it called that sqlite3 not even like
that it's just totally different but
it's a total JSU's it that's a framework
for a lot of things so for this we have
an array of rod ducks weights we'll make
some dictionaries all right let me just
check the comments a moment all right so
what I'm interested in is how do you
change this around and where do the
advantages come over in over server-side
generation okay
the advantages over server-side
generation for me I like these
frameworks for a number of reasons
because one is you can have a front-end
completely separate and run it to a REST
API rather than having to use built-in
views in that that might only matter if
you're worried about I don't know
scaling or a separation of concerns I
really love it when things are really
separated also
I'm not a spokesman for react I'm not in
love with react I think at school so I'm
not going to sit here and say you need
to use it but when you compare it when
you get into things like use it what's
it called is it you up UX user
interaction I don't know
compared to jQuery or something right
anytime you work on just once you learn
kind of the roughness of this it's going
to be probably impossible go back to
jQuery like to do an entire site with
like dynamic things happening Ajax calls
but there's nothing wrong with just stay
in server site but I will tell you that
the these frameworks are in hot demand
and they are not going anywhere soon in
fact github I always like to look at the
github stars
correct okay so this is r @j s right 85
k stars is just huge okay this is what's
craziness today view J yes is it
it's almost 80 K stars earlier in the
year I think this was twenty or thirty
thousand maybe more behind so we have a
real battle going on between these two
guys and if it was up to me gosh it's a
tough call man
I'd probably go with a view dependent I
mean if I was working with people
because that is a lot easier to learn
the learning curve in my opinion so the
next question yep this pretty much looks
like PHP I'm just learning a programming
mentally mixed with Dom model and Jes
there must be an auto loader to load all
the UM the that's one thing I would love
to know about an autoloader I haven't
seen one I did look around two months
ago anything it drives me nuts
I know what you mean about the auto
loading the index J si showed you where
you import stuff I know your IDE whether
there's a or text editor can make your
life a lot easier
react native tools
that's cool this I haven't I haven't
user
sorry react native let's just take a
break for a moment and check it out
we're at native build native modal I
thought it could build desktop apps too
I guess who cares because you can use
electron with any framework you want
so this that's what's amazing this can
build real native apps that's crazy to
me I haven't played with that so yeah I
agree with you on that
Markov uh mount on mount looks like
mounting a file folder or directory like
amongst OSS one fellow the sign Munda
asks about local storage know this is a
hook meaning when the app is
instantiated the main app component it's
saying when this when this app component
will mount I want to set this state or
do whatever it's it's really just
setting cold in here in this instance
you can use view j/s with anything you
can view JSA every act you don't have to
even set it up this way by the way yeah
you you really can do it pretty ghetto
and I don't know make I
example make a component like pretty raw
you could look up some nice examples so
let me just finish this last asked
questions so we can continue on
I guess they using okay yeah no problem
I'm just gonna try to finish the stream
and use that mounting the flash drive to
access the phone okay I'm going to get a
bit distracted with the comments so I'm
just going to carry on so product I'll
give it a name I'll call this a bike and
how about a cat category and I'll just
say kids
that pot was kind of annoying there what
else would a kid like a ball
and I'll add one that's not in there
let's call it a soup and I'll call that
for adults even though kids can have
soup okay so all this is is we're
setting the state k of products a
product's value what do you mean far use
this use what packages and demonstration
I'll upload all this code to github and
provide a link whoa rec lazy loner
now okay
hopefully we're not getting that
confused with um loading modules react
lazy whoa I don't know what this does
this
looks like one of those things that lazy
you know when you scroll a page at lazy
loads an image what you're looking for
is um an auto load module es six seven
eight I don't know are you am I at the
right thing and auto loader for
components
Oh auto loader
hi I can't type rack lazy auto well
let's see we'll know if it's reliable
zero downloads that worries me with
thirty three downloads in the last month
you should look at the stats on stuff
right because not everything's gonna be
like super popular but I don't think I
would use this because okay simple to
use should work should work with ultra
relevance can autoload children on an
interval it has to do the scroll event
or it can do that works with those
friendship am I still on the wrong thing
dude this is react lazy auto loader this
is you know a late lazy loader because
like you'll scroll down on the page and
you know the image fades and it's just
slow so you save bandwidth I mean it's
not hard to use I mean you just look at
it right there I want this to appear in
100
milliseconds or something well I think
what everyone else is talking about was
like how composure as an autoloader you
include one file and you'd be looking
more something like es6 module Auto low
but I don't believe one exists if one
six two five loader okay that's two
k-stars which is really good
I've never seen this but it would be
really cool so our components so I'm not
going to get into this right now because
we'll get caught off track if I did find
something like this I would love to use
it I think a lot of people would so back
to this when we set the state here this
is setting this value here of this state
and
we need to go - what was that for
products ok so then in our products -
yes it's a lot of jumping around and
it's actually kind of hard to speak and
do this at the same time so where am i
what I need to do is okay a product
always has an attribute in this case so
I'm going to import that import
attribute from attribute and remember to
do this because we're going locally with
the attribute here okay that and this is
where things you really start thinking
about things okay and perhaps you might
make a subfolder called product and you
would nest attribute in that subfolder
because that review is really a child of
product and you can actually put the
attribute within here something like I'm
not going to do it this way buddy
right if you wanted to put this little
component in here you could do that but
we're not going to do that we are going
to use it in here though so
what I want to do is get the attributes
in return okay so what I want to return
is whatever's in the products and then
the attributes so I suppose let me see
if I have an example of let me add an
attribute something realistic here this
would probably be like a list of
something so instead I'll just say Li
lastname equals attribute
the create react app not that I know of
great app okay this is all I see I could
type help I wish it did I'm sure there's
something oh oh watch okay so if I do
view build P oh I boy I'm not sure if
this works with react
I would star this for sure this egoist
boy okay it's a command-line fellow and
go down a little bit if you're not
familiar I prefer to install this guy
globally with the - gene so check it out
it has a react generator there now that
is awesome this is getting ahead of what
we're doing by the way when you install
play you use npx actually I haven't seen
it done I have not seen this envy
exploit I've only seen
px but I haven't used it very much so if
I were to look at react I do have it
installed let me just uh NPM I - GPO I
that's what you have to stall install
but we'll have it here
what do I so in cases like this yarn
global toy oh shoot yarn doesn't stall
in the same place and PMI gee boy and
again is short for install alright what
happened to Bell response body integrity
failed tail
alright I'm not gonna mess with that
right now but just so you know this is
sorry and was a 10px okay so this
actually can generate I believe wet pack
stuff you know that there's a lot to
what I haven't played with it enough to
be good at it so back to this the
attributes let's wrap this up so we're
not here all day let's just say what we
have is within the this context okay
this react has some context of whoops
properties and it's called props okay
from the react component you try to type
dot so you want to look for like okay
here's context reps is another one that
you'll use as far as references state so
you notice that the component has a
state references properties in a context
we're going to start with properties and
properties can be passed
from goose Conan's front from components
and I am going to say I'm inside of
attributes
I want the properties of the product
name and I want the category which I
call the cat okay and I'll put a slash
there something like that I can get rid
of this div here okay so this props name
should be sorry I'm just thinking a
moment this props from a component which
should come from the app dot J s which
that sets this date of products okay I
think that's right
block the code to make sure I don't have
this wrong
I'm like brain farting over here sorry
about that let's see I'm pretty sure
okay pretty sure pretty sure pretty sure
you yes all right
I need to look that up actually it's
like you know when you can like write
code and just keep typing it but you
can't remember like the definition or
the exact reason for things that happens
to me kind of a lot and then I'm like oh
I'm explaining this but now I don't
remember what it actually represents so
we are going to go to the product and
make a constructor you're going to
notice a pattern here constructor now if
you guys feel demotivated just remember
you get paid a lot of money to do this
crap you get paid a lot of money to do
angular right now it's angular and react
as far as front and and they are hot you
get paid a lot of money for this and if
you're wondering while dreaming why do
you teach this or why do you why do you
tell us how to do this or at least try
to help us
your assumption might be I get a lot of
money I don't make crap from you two all
right I wouldn't be able to feed my kid
for a week off it so I just enjoy
teaching and the real the real truth is
that I can't possibly do everything you
know there's never going to be enough
developers it's just a
not a lot of people want to do it either
so we'll do a state as well make sure
you instantiate or run me this super and
if I did not mention this when you
create a this dot state sorry if I'm
repetitive this only applies to the
product state okay
the state here has nothing to do with
the main app state or any of these
states in what state does is it
remembers where am I in time if we were
to get a bit more complex you can
basically have a history of state
imagine a chess game that remembers
every move you could reverse the move
play-by-play and in regular JavaScript
you know it's kind of called you would
think about like a history that that's
it's not it's not super easy in this
sense of doing things more advanced than
just creating a history of text or
something but what we're doing here is
pretty basic so let's just say new
equals and object all I can't do that
all right I'll call it fresh so I'm just
gonna say a new and D project so by
default how about this by default
our new product is empty fresh product I
keep thinking of produce
yeah there's I mean honestly to be a
programmer and I'm not saying this to
insult anyone because I'm one I think
you got to have you got to be a little
crazy because I'll tell you what this
stuff can drive me crazy there's been
times I just want out jump off a bridge
basically it's just like oh mercy I have
this right
shorthand property assignments are valid
these structuring patterns all right
okay so this I wish I could break it
down so it was easier to follow we're
gonna make it work though so we're going
to have an event handler to create and
this actually I'm gonna copy this I put
this in the wrong file I'm getting a bit
distracted I blamed the ATD let's see i
watch all the way from the from instant
oh wow teaching people like me won't
affect you or anyone they're doing oh
man I'm not worried about competition or
anything like that if if someone's
better than me at programming they're
either naturally better or they are a
they're they're so daddy like I think
they are usually naturally better but
they're otherwise just a freak because I
cannot possibly study any more than I do
and it's actually not a good thing I
gotta make a video talking about that
attributes sorry we want to go to
product create sorry about that and
deconstruct this is where we want to add
the state whoops did this wrong okay so
in the product create we want to have a
empty state of just a fresh product okay
because by default nothing is going to
exist okay that's the first thing what
we want to render out it's going to be a
form so this is going to happen under
the render anything under render is what
goes into the Dom and in the Dom or just
remember its if it's not in like nested
in something here
if product create was not nested in
product you know if something's not
nested in at Jas it's never going to
appear but it can be nests up nested you
guys get it I'm not trying to talk to
you like you're you don't get it but I
don't know the audience fully right now
it also will work with what we have
we're going to make the product create
have a form let's just say arm
and end the form and I'm not going to
worry about the stupid tags I'll just
say title whoops do that right o BR tags
these ones are funny because if you do
this it's going to break it
these ones have to self close the HR I
thought I think HR does - yeah I think
you have to self close
I've been hopping back from view js2
laravel and Axius I'm jumping around a
lot and that's not good and I think a
lot of people are having that Charlotte
so we're gonna make an input type equals
text and remember how I told you about
that component dot oh shoot
component control space
all right well I want it wants to be
stubborn on me let me try putting it in
here the dot wrath well I don't know why
it's not showing whatever so we're gonna
use something called wrath ok JSX
attribute okay and this is like
basically what we reference in react to
get data we call this name so I'll just
do that these have to be self closing as
well so I'm going to do two line breaks
this isn't to be pretty guys or or girls
and we'll do another BR and for a
category I would prefer to have existing
categories that exist yeah let's make
this really confusing because why not
so I'm just going to put this here so I
remember something I'm gonna make a br
and input type equals submit
value equals create brought up son okay
so we're gonna need something here the
form is going to need an event handler
in this case a form is on submit equals
we wrap these in we don't do quotes like
this like a regular function we do
French braces and this were in a class
so it gets a little confusing so first I
need to make a class method let me put a
few exclamations we're going to get back
to that okay let's do it now so what we
want is the categories that come from
fjs in reality like this data I don't I
don't I don't think I would store in a
pas like it would be stored in a
database but I don't think I would fetch
it here because this only applies to
products hover in our case we're making
one landing page only okay in reality
like I would have a call to a it would
have to be like a REST API or graph QL
whatever crap that I thought crap cute
alright don't get off topic point
anyways let me read this comment you'll
store this form data in a JSON file to
fetch it in the product mod
old age interface right
I am not I'm not going to use a database
right now I
I highly doubt let me see if I'm gonna
have docker yes yeah sorry
not so normally I pry you something like
mando and I have a docker container so
docker PS and then I know this is off
topic but hey sometimes when I go off
topic people pick up a few tricks so I
have mine bound to port 2700 so I can
connect here and yeah I would use Mongo
for actual database not a JSON file one
of my weaknesses is I get react any
front-end confused with nodejs
the the imports and some of the things
you can and can do I think you need a
library for a weight in a sink in front
and also I don't know if that's built-in
or not okay so we have the component
well mount
so let me take a second if I have a
project I have a product attribute
why am I so tired
I want to basically have the main app
bind okay I want this is this is getting
hard to explain in there Doc's are
they're kind of hard
they might even and it's hard to do this
like but hey I'm not a professional at
this I'm still learning it sorry fjs
what we want ultimately is for this
which is our main application this to
have a handler so we can add a project
and we want the I keep calling a project
I'm sorry and we want the products to
remember the state okay so
I believe we say did we set projects
okay so projects was that what we called
it projects yeah so the state of product
that call that product I'm so sorry I'm
gonna have to get sleep after this all
right
okay so products and then what we're
going to want to do is grab any variable
this dot state products okay so we're
the products are equal to the state
right now when we run this it's going to
make sense but hopefully hood and then
we have one called
product create equals in our main app
gosh I think it's gonna be broken find
it running I wish I could I want to
create a project so I will I'll say this
create product sorry
yeah I'll call it great product this is
a function not a property so we have to
so this is within a class it's a method
I'm sorry
so we have to what does it not apply
no not find this okay
let me close this guy all right
hopefully I got that right okay so that
should be good and we now need a
function called great product within the
main app here just so say boom and we're
gonna pass a product
let's do a console okay so this is for
this but the real way it's going to get
created is through product create thing
yeah I think that's right okay my head
is spinning today
shoot I did a live cast woman exhausted
but I just really wanted to do one and
talk about react a bit by the way I
should mention you guys if you want
I started a discourse channel to
socialize our sorry discord discord I
mean slash stream everyone's welcome
there to talk about cold or post jobs or
look for jobs it's free I don't make
money off it voice chat it's pretty much
just to have a little community I posted
a link hey you know I'm gonna type it
here real quick the reason is because I
don't I don't like just talking to the
screen myself I want to get to know some
people you know I want to see you know
what they think what they like maybe
even pair program with some people not
instead just being kind of running solo
all the time you get tired you know
maybe some hottie project or something I
know I listed this at the start
bahding what's this for I mean /y
where'd that go gosh that's a little
just uh thanks for being patient
anybody the reason is I love to talk
about cold upsets my face there I don't
wanna display capture okay
okay you'll see a little link discord
dot MV / dream you can use that on the
web or download the client works on cell
phones it's free it's honestly if you
view slack
consider slack debt and I know a lot of
people love slack the slack is now dead
to me because of this discord app it's
that good and they have web conferencing
I don't have it enabled yeah but that
would be awesome to web conference with
some of you guys if you wanted to even
screen share I think there's up to six
people allowed in a little conference
you know just for like hobby stuff for
maybe help because I could learn a lot
from other people okay so back to this
bind when we have gosh how do I say this
when we have if I had this great prop
okay how do I say this I am inside of a
method called render okay so
and then I'm inside of a return okay
oh well thank you mister Markov oh I
think I've seen you here before too
so basically we are in a render method
and a return function okay
and this has to do with scope now give
me mercy I'm quite tired what we're
doing is when we say this this refers to
the current scope unless you use arrow
functions I can't remember with classes
es6 has you know you've probably seen
these before arrow functions like this
if I did like that oops I still sorry
let it remove that remove that text
there sorry
well I mean I can try that if I do
create product this this is going to
look outside of the class as a global it
will think because without this in front
of it it's gonna think it exists down
here like that right so you want to be
like all the discord yeah this what did
I see I don't know if I saw you on there
I haven't muted right now so we have to
have this referring to where we are not
globally and the great product I might
be wrong about this and I will find out
if I screw it up okay so just leave it
like that for now I'm pretty sure oh I
forgot the bind oh gosh not now it's
gonna bother me you're not supposed to
pet JavaScript es6 that is it was a
prototype function and I think it
creates a new function let me look it up
real quick that's actually a really
sorry if I'm too quiet that's actually a
really good question
ya know I like that because I want to
know what the heck I'm doing - I'm I
haven't gone in I haven't used bind in a
really long time I always get it
confused with one that's apply okay so
one guy says bind creates a new function
okay
so oops I've even had so dot bind will
create a new function that will have
huh this set to the first parameter
passed within the bind so that's kind of
confusing to read to be honest it's okay
so it sounds like it's taking this right
here this create product and then when
you bind this somehow since we're out of
the scope we're we're locked in this
scope here than this scope here it
somehow creates a new function of the
originating one that is so confusing
what am I talking about
alright well we'll fix it if I got it
around I might have it wrong when I
think about that so we're we're looking
at the app this app this fake guy in
their product okay
almost done
you just think why did I
I mean I sorry I mean to many a demo
projects I just want to make sure I
don't screw up the app I should have
left a note on that that buying this but
uh I I don't have a definitive answer
that's a very good question so I think
that's good enough for the app probably
if we go to
let's say let me double check attributes
okay we are rendering just I make it
plural right no wait these are what's oh
this is a this is a product item because
look we're giving a name in a category
all right sorry about that I'm just
gonna call this item I did that wrong
because that doesn't make any sense
I'm doing this one plural yeah I'm not
getting good sleep guys sorry this will
be uploaded to github I'll provide the
link and item dot J yes
okay so attribute is now item J s change
the class name change the export and
this this doesn't matter unless you use
CSS probably and then our @j s we just
need to do items for
attribute and I'm going to ctrl F to
find it and make sure I can replace it
and it's that there's no other ones okay
so okay you know I'd call it product
item just by the way I'm really doing a
poor job here so that is really what
this does is screw it I'm doing this
product and items one under there boom
alright so instead this will be products
like item okay so now we know the item
is just like it's just a little guy
inside of the product and then inside of
product we get order of attribute
changes to item product item okay
because we're in product with only
subfolder to get the item and then the
right out we are going to use the item
in a loop that no that should let's
split this I feel like I made this kind
of harder for you guys this is no
beginner this is not a beginner's thing
I jumped way too far ahead so this is
returning one item okay this whole item
class just ran there's one Li element
and we are going to you know jumble
through that loop iterate through it and
to do that we need the items and we can
put this we can really put it anywhere
you can only have one return statement
obviously per method so we'll make
something here I'll call it Const items
or no left because this is going to be
built on now remember how we had come
ponent dot I'm sorry components where's
the red
all right whatever we want the props the
props of the the main now props is not
locked into you remember how if we had a
state here under the constructor it's
isolated to the product if we have props
it's not isolated to that so I can say
um this props brought projects
products
I'm mad at myself so we know we have
these in a safe situation you probably
want to make sure that you know this
it's not zero
I think undefined this fall see no big
deal so we will say items equals this
this is where we do our loop this stop
props
products okay so let me open the app Jas
okay so this is this is stateful okay so
we can loop this so we're gonna move
this
props products and we want to this is
going to be cool okay okay let me just
think we're going to do dot map dot map
and what I want to map is the prod title
and category
yes I'm just gonna call it P and this is
oops
this is the ECMO six aryl function and
with one argument you're not required to
have the geyser on there it doesn't
matter
refs is on whoops
perhaps
Oh
oh yeah you're right good fine yeah I
got a I got a check that out so okay we
have a product and we yeah we map it let
me just make sure yes six map it is an
object one difference right don't worry
I'll get it right
looks not this file it is in a race so
we're getting products products array
and I want to map an array of objects
no you're right Markov oh it was a
popped up over in iterable okay so our
item is an array just you can see the
square there okay let me just make sure
I get that right
where's just the regular mat method I
swear this one's not even that hard es6
Maps I think this is confusing it with
es6 has something called maps and week
maps I don't know
yeah that not that it's a
array.prototype map implemented in Xmas
groups this this is it okay so they have
an array they mapped acts which would
represent each one of these x times so
if this was like an object let's just
say named John act you say value I
should be able to say value name yep
okay I think that's right so we will
return wait a second
why would I return something
I know it I know it I know okay wait
yeah I'm returning from the map sorry I
forgot I was I forgot that I was in here
okay so return and this is cool because
we're gonna use the JSX
component of item so I'll just say item
product equals let me close it off and
we use these instead of the quotes
because it has to be parsed and gosh
if I just product really let's just try
that and then let's give it a key
he why am i doing that he equals on
product name
okay save that I'm scooch it we got that
and this will loop through one two three
of these okay and
so items right here items generates a
item component with product state values
I guess okay that probably sounds really
confusing and then for this item we we
already are putting it here so we just
trans you know whatever that word is we
parse it out to items like that
boy that is crazy so I probably have an
error and I'm okay all right
Onix this is no that's 101 sorry let me
open this bad boy okay product is not
defined in product dot j s what's what
line is a line 16 product sorry this is
a PE because the mat variable I set
there that should be a P all right
so useless constructor that's this guy
here in the product item is defined but
never used in app dot Jas
so we don't need to include this because
item ism is a baby of product product is
the baby mama that should be right okay
so make sure you guys get that hopefully
it works this is the wrong port here
let's go here oh mercy
let me see
items equals this props products not
matte
oh man I rent RA LM sorry I can't say
your name that's that's crazy because I
I used
I'm curious prototype Jess I don't even
know if this is around anymore
yeah it is yeah I use well I didn't
start with this but I use this a long
time ago
it wasn't like real prototyping yeah I I
don't I don't I don't do any kind of
drugs or anything but I'm just yeah I'm
so sorry
I just I'm kind of frustrated
I do got I do want you guys to know that
I go live view Jas is twice as easy
three times as easy but I'm also really
really out of it at the moment really
tired
and I'm not blazed
that stuff actually kind of freaks me
out I'm a sensitive soul we're not doing
that one we're not on that one heart so
this is looking for component product
dress I will get this props products 911
drops products my chest
Muranos
okay what why this get all tapped out
funny bullocks
look sorry I I mean I'm an American I
don't know what that actually means
didn't mean to be offensive okay so let
me just see this I'm just gonna try
alert
yeah the cash flow what does it think
boy think do you think of a function
sorry yeah you know the prototype the
underscore stuff it's it's a I'm not an
expert at it John Rzeznik the author of
jQuery he's an expert at it J let me
just say this though jQuery is a great
library
this isn't like jQuery slim I really
like that there's jQuery slim that's
actually what bootstrap 4 is using
there's let me just tell you guys don't
worry I'm gonna finish it if you don't
want wash that's okay it'll be up there
just please join the the chat cuz if you
want to you know you don't have to do
anything but maybe you'll learn
something or we'll be buddies whoops
what am i doing
jquery.com there was a jQuery slim and
sizzle that's what it is
I didn't know the difference between
sizzle versus Oh a pure Jas CSS selector
engine interesting that's cool I guess I
don't know the difference between jaya
slim what the heck is cute him there
Oh unit testing I do feel like jQuery
has had its its glory days Lonnie and
John resin really I don't know if it was
only him or not he was a great great
game changing for some reason his guy
picked up jQuery Mobile that's weird but
it's uh I guess worst right there
where is it slim bill yeah they have a
slim so the slim build of jQuery
excludes Ajax and effects and I don't
know the size difference but I would
suppose it's uh it has to be worth it if
you because uh instead of jQuery AJAX a
lot of people really do like Axios I've
been using it oh whoops
it's Axios is awesome seriously if you
if you get into the into the goodness of
this beautiful lovely thing it's just
awesome this is a front end whatever
let's finish this product here so I can
shut up all right so let me know here
this props I'm just going to see what
happens
alert and let me console along this
props and should reload I hate when this
let me close this one
oh mercy do I have anything okay
I have products products is this state
products what is this a string
I must not have loop this uncaught this
problem at this props Matt I wish I
could pause this okay I'm just gonna
double check it once more brought up
duh doesn't matter to have item imported
yes okay
this props products plural wait
yes because it's plural right there
this props products dot map
P which is just a reference wait did I
do that
yeah I'm just okay I have my arrow
function I have my little plate what's
this
well that's for the map oh that isn't
like them and then we have our unknown
key so it's what happened here within
the render function I have this I'm
gonna do see what this gives me this
props products console and up to the top
what the heck is this this state
products
I don't let items
change so wise
now that Jas has that a component will
mouth okay
this set state why is this in gray huh
okay products right there it's an array
okay an object of a race you know so I
could have like other stuff like users
and then I have dictionary objects okay
I could maybe just perhaps not I could
semicolon that out okay
so Matt uh dad
mark alpha that is only if you have more
than one argument I'll do it
but and that works I'm I'm I would jump
I think I'll really jump off a bridge
yeah that guy doesn't work um it doesn't
hurt it you know just so you know that's
like if you want to add like something
else like I don't know a so it's totally
optional I can't believe that okay let
me just see I have a name and a cat yeah
oh you're probably a little delayed on
the chat I'm just gonna leave it like
that let me do let me just try this um
so I like I don't believe I installed es
lint so I am going to is clear now you
guys may open the parcel the
package.json and you could grab these es
lint guys here if you want to okay I'm
gonna do that and I'm just going to
minimize that go into package.json of
the o2 and I'm just going to add dev
dependencies
and you can laugh at me now oh no wait
what's this guy's bar no not in a
necklace uh how do I explain that no you
don't have to explain with bar yeah
you're talking about the item yeah okay
so I'm just gonna install this row quick
the yes lint sometimes this helps me
actually it helps me a lot since I am in
vs cold
I know sublime text has this but here's
yes lint I don't know it's ready look at
three million dollars people love this
and one thing I do which this is up to
you if you want to do it in my settings
this is vs code base just so you know is
it so this is my default es lint file
but I can put them in my projects and
I'm going to put this in here just so
that you guys have it too if you want it
or you'll probably type it out if you're
even watching this though
well I also have like the option to save
save that's PHP validate oh it's looking
on the left side
yes when
that's jazz Arlen okay here we go so I
had this one setting to is auto fix on
safe I'm not trying to yell sorry
and then there's es lint dot enable and
I turned this off because the HTML all
right so let me copy that over copy of
es Lynn RC to here and I'm going to open
that up so that you my friends can type
it out gosh it's gone
i by the way i prefer two spaces for
everything even JavaScript and Python
haters gonna hate but I wonder if I can
paste this in there I'm gonna try oh
that's terrible
but you guys can copy-paste that if you
want to otherwise you know I don't know
if anyone's typing it but remember how
we added the extension airbnb base they
have a really good standard I kind of
adapted from my previous work which I
mentioned it was it was fun work in
there it was really hard but I I love a
challenge you know I think every
programmer does and then the environment
is just like hey it's no yeah and an
import that's why we installed the es
lint
so here's es lint right that's the
actual linter I'm actually just realized
I have this installed globally the
reason I install it locally is so that
like what if someone else installs the
package you know but I don't know
and then right here's the config for
Airbnb well it actually just takes this
part there and import so that's enough
time for you guys to type that out if
you wanted to and what I'm going to do
is just to what happened man
the Venus coats
hundred percent CPU or something
did this frizz all right one side
oh my gosh all right sudo P kill vs toad
- 9 bird was a kill
boy I got this tool here oh alright
sorry
whoops clear LS and I'm just going to
save it and it should auto lint it for
me so in case I have some sort of issue
where my source at Jas and this is going
to kind of look around my code but at
load a second all right
you know it'll space it a certain way
and everything in this case I wouldn't
say it's Microsoft I would say it's what
is that thing called whatever made this
if you ever use Adam editor in my
opinion that's the worst editor it's so
slow
by the way I'm in a virtual machine in a
virtual machine in a virtual machine I'm
just okay alright so I'm just gonna say
that press f2 so yes lint in this case
once I yes lint JSX
oh all right my bad this will fix that
stupid error if you're getting it
so yeah electron which is really cool
it's just so NPM NPM I I forgot to do
development move - des Lent plug-in
react
and then down here I'm gonna head react
like that to my ESL in RC this will be
on the github make sure that installs
okay now if I go back alright
sometimes you got closing on the open
the file and it doesn't want to listen
what's no spam message hi keen on okay
well whatever to that I'm just gonna go
through these just watch save nothing
changes say wow this Norman say not
seeing anything changed that's really
odd oh did I forget what happened here
alright so open your product create br
br input
I got a sworn I typed oh sorry
input type equals submit you guys you
know I typed this I'm just checking
that's all right I don't need the naming
the value great product is the worst
tutorial I want to make have alright
alright
do you guys know live edu or twitch do
you think anyone watch code on there
because I don't feel right doing on
YouTube a lot yeah I know I did I don't
know what the heck happened I thought
I'm losing it
oh gotta close the forums okay if you
have color in a react plugin or
something you should add something like
that just make sure you post here then
you will say you listen there no I'm
just wondering like great product did I
write that today oh yeah yeah you
remember yeah okay keen on can on
yeah yeah you're everyone's welcome to
disk or just you know it's for dorks
like us well you might be a cool dork
I'm not but you might be all right so
I'm gonna have to go to my app my app
code that I had written a while back and
I'm going to look at I made it a little
different so I have to kind of translate
it real quick this is called product
create whoops wrong file
yeah I'm so sorry guys I'm poor at these
live cats I got to practice
not with you know the homeboys trust me
we'll be home boys or we'll get along
just shooting the breeze and talking
about code great
oh my gosh please tell me I am such an
idiot okay I need a form with a method
alright first of all I had on some
minute I'm so sorry guys
yep I'll just others it should be this
to score me I do not give a crap about
being power-hungry
or anything so do whatever you want I
just you know hopefully nobody's picks
on me so I I'm discord I changed my team
to white I like it
yeah this is what's wrong a lot of it I
forgot this part so I need a I could do
let me just check something we're we're
just talking about binding this oh my
gosh
will someone kill me this
is a sec joke
don't save that one i priced groups
something out so on submit we're just
going to say this dot what what am I
trying to do
can't you submit and we'll do the bind
this okay then here I'll make a function
called submit just like in jQuery we
want to Eid prevent yep and this refs
name dot value okay so this will be the
name use a constant if it doesn't change
use let if it is mutable this crap gets
kind of weird with the scopes like if
statements
check this out Khan's name equals dog
these are two different constants
because this is an if scoped in a block
it's called a block scope yes you know
you don't know that that's pretty that's
weird to me like I understand methods I
have never seen that before though so if
we have the name I'm not even going to
validate because it's getting way too
long and we're gonna set the state so do
I have a fresh product okay we are in
the product Jes I will say this sets
date and the object and we are gonna
kill this beast
was fresh product and it will be diction
or object name and category and you know
what I really don't care if this is
wrong at this point you know like you
would check if this was empty or
validate stuff here I can get rid of
that so name and boom come back to PHP
well I don't know what else to to teach
in PHP you know I feel like I'm
repeating myself all the time if I was
talking about view Jay yes this would
have gone a lot smoother by the way um
the reason for Jas man I got so many
topics I want to talk about but I get
stuck in hearing myself talk
one of the reasons in my opinion for the
Jay s people move into it and is wait do
I have this right boom
set the stay
okay and after I set the state I'll do a
yeah boom boom boom this is you have to
have this you can't have it empty
because there's no arguments here it's
just like saying hey after you set the
state will say this Propst
wait what's the method thought was a
product create once I
this day dot whoops crap why can't I get
my fresh product because we're just so
we set a state look you guys I'm
explaining this kind of hard if you use
angular angular 5 good luck angular 2 oh
my gosh 2 3 &amp;amp; 5 if you think this is a
lot of work this is nothing view J ass
is so much easier than this that's
probably why I prefer and I'm just tired
alright so the props that I want to set
apps jas let me split windows props
props props
that's true yes oh it's a new I want
agree
what the function was inside
I think of app so that it's globally
recognizable does that make sense
I got to do to my course I don't
I will all I'm adding it to itself but
really does that make sense that doesn't
make sense
this props of ad projects
I'm going to check about the put
something like this I'm like
project products
oh that's right yeah all right
check it out I'm just
I serious inset state
I have PHP somewhere oh my gosh yeah
guys I'm not sleeping that well all
right yeah angular is a MVC but by the
way I do like typescript it's pretty
cool the learning curve is a lot bigger
it's a heavier framework but it's good
don't get me wrong
the learning curve you're just watching
an idiot babble nonsense so I had to go
to these callbacks here a product create
I believe or is that a property no it
was sorry
whatever I'll try
that wasn't property
last name is AB
props there I can't believe I'm stuck on
this last part I mean it's not gonna
look beautiful but
it's
so I'm doing this currently I'm going to
add I thought what I was going to had to
but I totally forgot how I did this hogs
do okay
I think like that so we have a submit a
event that's our event handler okay
I
yeah I think I referenced the wrong get
thing that I wanted to go on about he
forgot to pass the e inside D submit
because this is an event handler J right
there inside the product J yes you can
call this whatever you want just make
sure submit would line up with binding
it there refresh okay there we go let's
see oh great form can I appear as a
descendent of all right so I have a
paragraph somewhere where it's messed at
all funny so first check at Jas I've got
a oh what's this crap yeah give her
these paragraph tags for these
components like that inside your at Jes
boom okay refresh no errors Hey
why did that rerender fall once I
Radek three
something this props on some whoops let
me close a foodie though this promised
product rate this props what am I trying
to set the properties for I'm trying to
set the properties for this current
class the product this is going to be
really something I swear I wonder if
this does anything I think I have a Oh
categories let me add add some
categories real quick I already had
these laid out which is kind of dirty so
they'll be in place
items are sold we have two of them kids
and adults
yeah that's right so for creating a
project we want to list those
heck I'll do this should I do static
I'll say this dot cats equals kids and
adults okay so we have some defaults for
the drop down because we want to make a
drop down in the crew eight yes so when
we render we can say here we go
let ops equals
this props cats and we're going to map
it again like we did the last one that
was a map
see and then they like that and then
this returns whoops
it will be an option he will be
see and value will be see
to see
and we'll have whoops option so
providing with default options this
normally this would all come from a
database you guys might be confused as
crap does that confuse myself as well
but if you go back after watching this
this garbage you're it's going to make
more sense guarantee it so we want a a
reference to the category I'll call it
cat select and then in here will render
the apps okay so submit form so this
props can't read property of McAvoy this
cats did I seriously did their own
yeah
props is a cat this props can wait weird
that coming this props cat and then that
came from
cats
we do that
product during a salon 20 with the way I
learned the worst way possible
I learned my problem is I try to learn
too much and I never actually produce
anything anymore and I've got such bad
ATD it's not getting worse as I get
older I usually read documentation it's
boring as that sound sounds I think I've
done a few college courses online for
fun well I'm not a big fan of college
courses because
I don't know I they don't really they
don't really go into anything
static
equals
yes what am i doing
I'm hoping for a miracle yeah I'm I've
taken a few college courses or cats
wouldn't that be a my this this
in my eye in Twilight Zone
static @z okay
equals why isn't this one o'clock
well this is a function right
oh there's no equal sign there
this is weird I coded I wrote code a
wild man yeah I seriously I got it I
gotta practice more this live stuff
someplace else so I don't flood YouTube
with a bunch of amateur stuff here this
is pretty embarrassing
static close default okay so I made a
static default cats
boo okay
next
where
how did I do this before guys I've lost
it yeah
did you ever use something like you to
me oh no I well I did it here let me go
back let me go to my webcam um alright
let me transition okay Wow
hi guys I don't even know how many
things are watching anymore IV no I
haven't used you to me I know I bought a
course on there before maybe two but I
bought them because they were good deals
not because I was interested in it like
I'm kind of interested in Java but I
don't want to go that route I had 10
people watching dang
people are just said yeah I got I don't
like hide this video you guys isn't
bears and I'm so sorry this turned out
horrible if anyone wants I'll probably
just I don't want I want to talk to
other people if they feel like talking
I'll head into
did discord dis dis Court if anyone's in
there I'll just check okay you don't
have to come if you don't want to others
hang out in the general chat but you
don't have to maybe I'll hop in a voice
room if I can understand like some
people have strong accents so I'm going
to try to push a fix for this probably
tomorrow or something I'm exhausted you
guys and I'm so sorry
this did not go how I planned I think
I'm going to cut down on the live
broadcast and just do shorter videos
well why would you want that while this
video really didn't go how I wanted but
yeah if you just are you mark oh that's
you Markov oh you still have a lifetime
yet can you let me know in this court
when you're done with that yeah I just
messed up someone really stupid and I
honestly haven't slept for um well I'm
going on two and a half days of no sleep
I do this a lot trying to survive and
I'm running at a time and it sucks cuz
you know you can't think when you're
exhausted but then there's not enough
time in the day to try to do something
then I think I'm telling too much
information anyways erase that part if
you download the
please anyways
I'll just post this there's only ten
people here like anyone cares disk or
I'm new to this court by the way I just
downloaded and I thought it's fun and
it's not about me dream that's just it
wasn't even my name I just thought it
sounded cool you know I mean this has
nothing to do with my ego
otherwise I'd a bit like Jessie
solutions I don't care I just I wanna
hang out with people like this and I
can't find them anywhere
so it'd be a lot of fun if more people
oh wow we got we're starting to add up
some people that might be kind of fun
okay let me close off the video again I
apologize I mean I'm gonna do my best to
stay active in discord I'm new to it and
we can all be friends and there's no
pressure to do anything you don't wanna
do when you don't have to talk or join
if you don't want to I get no money from
any of this except some money for
diapers from YouTube alright see you
later guys I stopped by the stream
