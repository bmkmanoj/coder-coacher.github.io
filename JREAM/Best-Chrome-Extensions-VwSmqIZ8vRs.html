i'm going to show you a couple of my
favorite Google Chrome extensions and
the first one is going to be this jas
shell this one's pretty cool because you
can type in jquery and see a live on the
page so let's say h 1 dot hover function
and this will help you learn jquery as
well and just test things out let's say
alert you hovered ok then you press
control enter and it loads it and hover
the h1 boom and you could really do
whatever you wanted with it um i could
say p dot hover function and i'll say on
this dot CSS border and control enter
and when you hover over a paragraph and
then you could save this into your
actual javascript file if you wanted the
next one is Firebug this is Firebug
light let me refresh the page Firebug
lie so you go to inspect and you can
select an element well I guess this
isn't going very deep down for some
reason it works and on other times it
doesn't work for me i'm not sure why i'm
guessing i don't know what this is
anyways i'll just go to something in
here you can say body they in the
background let's just make it red and
color will say white and rather than
always having to refresh your CSS and
everything you could just use this now
this doesn't save it here you have to
actually change it
if I hit refresh and there is no Save
button for that there's also you can
check here what do you call it an AJAX
or question here but that's another day
there's also web developer toolbar which
I liked a lot actually use this
information to have a lot and element
information and you can just hover over
things and get the information if you
need to know sizes and everything and
you can outline block level elements all
this kind of stuff it has so much packed
into it it's really good to have and
just play around with it external links
block level elements and you can see
everything you're working with here I
think there was a CSS oh yeah here it is
edit CSS you can edit the CSS in here I
actually don't use this so I'm not too
certain what it does let me refresh and
get rid of all this and it's going very
slow let's go to Google's okay here's
another one snippy this one's pretty
good so if I just go to some news here
and I click snippy click to snip and
what do I want to grab let's say I want
to grab this and that and that and I'll
say done and then I'll go to snippy and
I'll say show and it saves all this for
me and I could say this was a link i
want to just see later and i can always
come back to this and you can upload it
to google docs if you want another one
is x marks this one's really good if you
have multiple computers and it just
saves all your stuff in here across
multiple computers and the other one is
flash block which is really good you
know those really annoying
video ads I was getting at yeah like
let's say go to this site break I think
that a bunch of flash here I'll just
click this and let's see there we go you
see this flash button you can allow
flash from the site always or just
temporarily get rid all the annoying ads
and the last one is adblock you can find
that in Chrome extensions and just look
for adblock and it's the one with a
million users and this is a really good
one if you have any better suggestions
please post them in the comments thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
