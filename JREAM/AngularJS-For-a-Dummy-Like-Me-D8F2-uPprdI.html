in the development world every time I
learned something in depth as I can but
it's always something around the corner
and already I'm trying to pick up
angular and there's a whole bunch of
other things I've never heard of it's
just this sort too much for one person
to know but what attracted me to angular
was the simplicity of it and I'm not
very good at it I have to keep
practicing but I wanted to make a video
about it because I think it's really
cool and I think you would like it too I
just don't know exactly where to learn
it the best I don't like their Bane main
tutorial it was really weird other than
that it's a fantastic framework so life
goes on and I have a project here that's
really a HTML page called setup I'm just
gonna make a setup application it
doesn't really do anything but just test
out some features for my own practice
and for you to tag along if you want all
I have is angularjs the JavaScript file
there what you see here is Twitter
bootstrap styles and jQuery which aren't
needed but I'm keeping them there for
the sake of habit and I'm so used to
using jQuery what we have here is the
setup J's file I just called it setup
because it's just playing around so I
got my HTML file called set up into J's
file called set up with nothing in it
and that's really all there is to it and
then down here I just got a container so
to get started with angular you throw a
app tag up here attribute and what this
means is ng app is aimed Euler okay they
call it ng for some reason and that
throws me off now you can do just ng app
if you have one app but if you have like
multiple applications or something that
you had a big JavaScript system you'd
probably do it this way and the app I'm
gonna use I'm gonna call it setup I
don't like when people just call this
app it confuses me okay so now I have a
setup file and in order to get this to
listen I have my setup file included I
have to define an angular module so I'll
say angular module is set up and the
components the second argument is four
components and that's basically like
extra files and dependency it needs to
run I'm not even going to do any of that
because I'm not that advanced right now
and I'll give this a variable name so I
can attach stuff to it and I've read a
lot on angular I'm just kidding I really
didn't but I've been reading a little
bit about it and I know this isn't the
preferred way to do it but I'm not the
master you guys I'm just trying to
figure it out as I go
so that loads that up and right now it
does nothing and so we have this setup
app that applies to this whole page here
very nice what I'm gonna do is create a
little deaf here
okay and what we're gonna do is make a
controller so I'll put a h3 and I'm just
gonna call this repeater controller okay
and let's go to the setup j/s and we're
gonna attach a guy to it I'll say app
dot controller is repeater controller
and it's an anonymous function like that
so we're here already and of course we
have this thing that makes the
JavaScript look crazy scope it has a
dollar sign in front of it it looks like
jQuery it's not it's basically the
dependency injection if you don't know
that means it's basically the thing that
attaches everything together yeah so if
I were to say I wanted to make a
variable inside of this controller
I'd say scope dot name equals jubilee
okay now it's weird-looking so this
controller has scope name attached so
repeat controller really it could render
out you could almost look at it like
this dot name right that's all that what
this scope guys doing here I don't know
why it's just it's so weird from you
look at that so what we're gonna do is
attach this controller to an element so
here we have a div and I'll say
ng-controller equals repeater controller
and what this means is everything in
this element can do whatever is in the
repeater controller so we've got a
little a little nest going on right we
have our app called setup and inside a
setup we have a repeater controller okay
so those boom boom now we're going to
get the name and to get that it should
be pretty easy I'll just say name okay
and I'll go ahead to my page and cross
my fingers that it worked
and there it is jubilee and that's a lot
of work just to get a silly name in
there but I feel like we're onto
something right so if I wanted to repeat
content what if I had something like
whoops scope users instead of just a
name well let's let me make another one
scope users equals NRA
and inside this array will have some
objects and here I'll say name is
john-boy and gender will be male now I'm
just going to duplicate the line a
couple times I'll call this Teddy boy
any boy and any girl okay so I've got
all these users that just kind of chill
out there and if I want it to repeat all
this stuff you would actually use a nice
little angular tag anyways so this is
called scope users okay so remember how
it's like this dot users so basically
inside this guy I have that it's just
the scope guy looks so pits are there
okay so make sure your code all lines up
and you don't have an extra comma at the
end there and I'm just gonna refresh the
page with my console open to make sure I
don't have an error okay so back to the
HTML so we know we can do that with a
name let's make a new div so I'm just
gonna make him like a strong tag let's
make a new div
and this guy is going to be ng-repeat
okay and remember how we have just like
above we have users like that and this
is basically a for each loop or whatever
so I'll say user in users all right so
now this div contains the item of users
it's gonna loop through me inside of
here all right
so I'm gonna say user dot name and oh
the user dot gender
and make it stand out a little bit what
this is gonna do is actually going to
repeat this div many times so it's going
to do two every time it has a record in
there so I'm gonna refresh whoops let's
and here you have a little repeater now
that could be useful if you had like
database stuff coming in okay so I'm
still figuring this out so it's hard for
me to try to explain it
let's do one more controller for
practice I'm gonna call this count
controller
count controller okay and what I want to
happen here is just to increment a
number very very exciting I'll copy this
and I'll say app dot controller comp
controller function scoped and I'll
start out with a value of one sculpt dot
Val equals one and I'm going to create a
custom function within here so this is
going to get confusing so let me do Val
okay so we can see what the value is so
this is the count controller and we've
attached valve inside the comp
controller and I'll just refresh and I
have one right and it doesn't do
anything okay so I'm gonna create a
function attached to the scope so I'll
say scope
up equals function
hey you don't mind a little highlighting
gear it's just sublime doesn't
understand everything and I'm gonna grab
the scope value the same variable here
I'm gonna say plus equals one okay
and in order to make that increment I
want to tie it onto a let's just say a
button and it has to be in here because
it has to be in the count controller so
I'll say black knee ng-click
equals our function and I'll say
increment let me put this in a about it
h2 so it's big and so that ng-click will
be the function we made and it's just
called up and it has no arguments so up
and that should make it count up refresh
and increment increment increment so if
you found this useful can I ask you a
question can you figure out how to add
another button and make it decrease I
know how but I'm saying for fun you
should for practice and this was a very
beginner thing here just to practice I
hope you guys found it useful and it's a
cool system without talking about all
the concepts and stuff I think it's
better to get hands-on and play around a
little and if you guys know some place
that just gets hands-on I'm kind of the
simple stuff through angular please
share it because I don't want to know
about all the concepts and stuff I just
need to make stuff and then I get into
the concepts okay see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
