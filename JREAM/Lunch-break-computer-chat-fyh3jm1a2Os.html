hard drive in my laptop and I got this
one a sandisk 128 gig I don't know if
it's the best brand but installing it
was really easy my samsung laptop isn't
anything very high-end let me open it up
and i also installed linux mint on it so
what this is is an a6 vision and that's
not a very fast ship by all means and as
a little graphics card in it it's just a
15-inch kind of entry model laptop i
only want to use it for coding so
nothing fancy about it but i'll go ahead
and turn it on there it goes and it's
going to boot to linux mint it's pretty
quick
looks like it's loading the OS now
you
there it is now it's loaded and I can
just use it immediately load up google
chrome bunch of these it's pretty quick
it's not quite as fast as my desktop but
it definitely makes a difference this
linux mint is pretty cool too so nothing
really here to freak out about what the
solid-state this computer has been
slowing down freezing up quite a bit and
that's great and there's my lunch let me
show you my desktop okay here's my
desktop machine I've had this for quite
a while and these monitors I got on for
a really cheap deal so what I'll do is
I'll go ahead and shut it down and the
solid state drive on this is just
ridiculous it's because it's a six core
processor let me shut it down and above
I have some view of some palm trees so
it's shut down now there's no blue
lights what I'll go ahead and do is just
power on and on this screen and the
bottom right we'll get some numbers once
it's booting up it's like some kind of
little delay they're not exactly sure
what it is
there we go 99 those little numbers so
now it's building and there's windows 8
then it seems to load on this screen
here there it is it's all booted up and
what I mean that I mean it let me type
in my password it's all booted up
meaning i can just start launching
applications whoops that one on the
other side you can tell this one's just
way faster how fast I can load up
applications it's it's really ridiculous
a lot of photoshop and photoshop used to
take a long time to load but in this
case it takes about less than 10 seconds
illustrator used to take about 25
seconds now with this one i have a
samsung solid state hard drive and see
that it's just ridiculously fast it just
flies i would say the solid state hard
drive is probably the best improvement
to the computer i've made so far if a
lot of the properties of the computer i
have an AMD FX six core and a 12 gigs of
ram x y or 64 bit windows 8 and this
stuff up here where my start menu is
that's just a windows 8 add-on i
purchased because i really do not want
to use the windows 8 stuff which is this
I can't get anything done with all this
junk so I just always go to the desktop
here but that's it so check out solid
state hard drives are pretty sweet I'm
going to install one on my wife's
computer soon down here it's an old
looking box but got or this one this
might be the exact same one that's in my
desktop right now and these things are
fast
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
