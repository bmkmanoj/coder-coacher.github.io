the windows 10 Pro technical preview and
so far it's a big improvement over
windows 8 obviously the Start menus here
and it's like this and they have the
most use items here and your places and
that's nice and it has this stuff here
which I really don't care for and it can
open the Metro windows okay and you see
you have these icons up here looks like
they change these around a little bit
and this guy here will take over the
whole screen except the start menu I'm
just going to double sure and they have
this many over here a share and a search
and settings that come on to it just
kind of hovers over the screen isn't
that weird that was kind of strange like
in Windows 7 and 8 has a all apps
drop-down actually ate they remove this
which sucks but I have a Don you click
all apps and it lists out all your apps
now what this is really missing is where
you can just hit windows can just start
typing say explore it just gives me a
bunch of beeps and that that'd be nice
if they add that in there before the
release because it's really convenient
to have that search bar there we have
this thing here to expand it into that
view that you're used to with windows 8
and it looks kind of silly in my opinion
I don't think it's necessary but this
little guy here is your search and this
is called Cortana and you can talk to it
as well with your voice and they know my
name because i typed in my name and all
that I'll just say
explore today so searches like that
which is nice pretty funny looking stuff
but it still has this toolbar that I I'm
not a big fan of it but the windows also
don't have borders you'll see there's no
bar there and I think that looks kind of
nice they change these buttons you see
they're thin at the top and I'll go
ahead and change the color theme so that
it stands out more let me do flowers and
okay you'll notice a few things at the
top we have a highlight like an active
state bar let's open Internet Explorer
and this double window here is your task
view or your windows key tab okay so you
know there's alt tab to flip between
programs but there's the windows tab is
to show the entire desktop or add a
desktop so i just added a new one and
it's showing it right here so i could
click that and it looks like this is
just showing that these are open so if i
click it it should take me back to my
other desktop that's kind of nice i like
the virtual desktops i believe i can
press ctrl windows key right i can go to
the right or the left windows key tab
and add another desktop and let's open
notepad or something file explorer and
how about notepad and i'm going to press
you could click this all windows key tab
and i want to move this to like that
desktop you would think that you could
drag and drop but for some reason you
can't right now and it's kind of
annoying so I'm just going to
right-click and at the moment you can
move it to another desktop like that if
they added a drag feature that'd be
really cool
click they have a new little
notification center here and this is
very interesting your settings they have
a nice little panel here that looks a
lot different system and this is really
strange because i have this display
right here this actually looks kind of
nice but they also still have my stuff
here like your old looking stuff so i'm
not sure what they're going to do with
that like there shouldn't be two
sections for that they'll probably clean
it up and everything overall it looks
like they're making some nice new moves
and it's all right at least it's free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
