you how to use linux and how to get
started on my screen here i have an
example of some linux types of servers
or some people call them flavors these
are all linux sent to SD be a fedora red
hat bluetooth and what you want to use
is really up to you all of these share
the same linux commands for the most
part but they package things differently
now i'm not a linux expert i'm still
learning and its really good to keep
practicing because you'll probably be
using in the future if you do anything
with the web so what I use is sent to us
if I weren't using that I'd probably be
using debian the difference between
these two are the packaging commands
this vbn uses something called aptitude
centos uses something called yum and
sent to us is based off of red hat which
is commercial software so if at some
point you wanted to switch from centos
to red hat and get us a 20 mercial
support you could do that much easier
than switching from debian to a red hat
because centos shares the same packaging
system so that's a little history wish I
don't know much about so use debian or
sent to us whatever you want i won't use
red hat because you're a beginner and
you don't need to spend money so what
we're going to do is connect to ssh and
learn some linux commands i'm on windows
so i use something called putty pu TTYL
and if you're on a Mac or Linux you will
use terminal or it's also called shell
and what we do is we type in our host
name in here
and i'm going to call this testing and
before i open this up what i want to do
and putty is change the appearance so
that you can read it a little better i'm
just going to change the font size to
say 12 okay and I'll go to my session
and i will save now one thing you should
notice is if i were to switch to this
and go to appearance myfonts different
and if i go back to testing and load it
and go back to appearance I font saved
so it only saves per session okay try to
remember that so I'm going to open up my
connection you might get a pop-up window
that says hey you need to verify the key
just click yes and I'm going to login as
root on some servers that might supply
you with a user name other than root for
security reasons because the root user
has the most power to do anything and it
asks for a password and as you type you
don't see anything so it's like is it
broken but it's not it just doesn't show
text when you type they supplied me with
a password and I want to paste it in
here and to do that I just right click
and hit enter and it looks like nothing
happened but I absolutely something did
so the first thing we're going to do our
couple basic commands the first is
called list so I'll type LS and there's
nothing in here so what I'm going to do
is change director with CD dot dot slash
and now i'm a director down and you see
the slash here so i'll do LS once more
and now we can see where we weren't you
were inside of this root folder if i
ever wanted to get back to the root
folder i could just type CD squiggly
and now I'm in the root folder again and
basically what CD squiggly does is it
will take you to your user folder of
whoever you're logged in as so if i was
logged in and say Jessie it would take
me to a folder called Jesse in here so
and if we want to show the director that
when we can type PWD which stands for
print working directory I'm a slash
route so let's go back a directory down
and list just to see what we got now one
thing to notice about Linux file systems
is it's not like Windows the lowest
level starts with a slash learn windows
your lowest level is c drive and windows
the slashes are different the same with
the mac the lowest level is a slash so
what we're going to do is have a little
basic rundown and go back to our root
folder so you could type CD root or you
could do the CD squiggly okay so we're
in here so let's say we want to make a
directory I'm going to make their i'm
going to call it dog MK dirt that makes
a directory and it looks like nothing
happened but to see what happens just
type LS i start LS which stands for a
list and you can do several commands
with make door if i did make their fish
hat pig and LS we have all those folders
now now here's something interesting
let's do make sure of dog dog and list
these are totally different directories
you see how the casing is different
linux considers these different commit
folders and on Windows you can only have
one folder with the exact same name in
the casing doesn't matter but on linux
it does so that's one thing to watch out
for and just try to be careful and most
of the time you should always make
things lowercase my opinion ok so we
want to remove a couple directories so i
would type RM dirt for remove and put on
a move on dog dog fish hat and bliss and
there we have it what if we had files in
a directory let's go into dog actually
we could create a file from here into
dog let's first create a test file say
touch dog txt and list that out we have
dog txt what if i did touch dog / dog
txt and list and it put it in the dog
directory touch just basically it's kind
of like ding and it touches a file and
creates it there's just nothing in it so
i'll go to CD dog and list and there's
dog txt let's make one more file and
let's name it dot test okay and if I
list it doesn't appear and the reason is
because dot files with no name before
are considered hidden files on linux and
they don't appear so if you wanted to
show them you would do LS dash
a which means list all if you wanted to
get details on a certain command you
could always type man which is short for
manual and then the command name so you
could type man make der and LS and what
we have here is the command and the
options we can pass and if you hit the
page down button it'll give you a little
quite a few options that you can always
go through and to get out of the manual
page just hit the letter Q okay so let's
see let me list that once more and if I
go back down the director and list again
and I wanted to delete a dog directory
we're going to have a problem yeah
you're a dog barking so i removed the
directory dog and it says failed to
remove because it's not empty um what I
need to do is to theirs I need to remove
the files in the directory first or if I
just want to force remove everything I
can use the regular remove command which
i'm going to show you so first we'll use
it just to remove dog txt and it says
remove regular empty file i'll say yes
and this is just a prompt so let me do a
list again and now it's empty so if i
want to remove the dog and all its stuff
in it I'll do RM dash our dog okay and
that capital R there means recursive so
it says descend into it yes remove the
regular file yes yeah
yes and listen and if you want to do it
without having getting those prompts and
everything let me do a touch pig pig not
txt so inside a pig if we try to remove
the directory of pig we can't do it and
if you want to do that recursively and
force it to answer yes do RF so the pic
and if I list it's got nothing there so
what we've learned how to do is make
their remove their move file and a
couple of options and we've also learned
how to create a file which is touch and
I think that's a good start we've also
learned how to traverse directories a
little bit with CD
like that and let's go one more level
down and let's jump into the VAR so if i
go to CD of our and list and i'll go to
see the log list and CD audit and list
so now it's like where am i if i do list
it doesn't tell me once again we'll do
PWD to print the working directory and
let's say i wanted to go down to the bar
so i'm inside of audit either those CD
dot dot slash that'll take me to log dot
dot slash that'll take me to VAR c and
PWD and we're going to go so i can exit
this and we're good for now and that's a
good start on the basics of linux and
we'll do some more later thanks for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
