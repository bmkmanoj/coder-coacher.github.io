neighbors today we're going to make a
button in Photoshop and transport it to
HTML so that we can hover it and it has
a little effect and this would be a nice
way to make your links look decent and
to get started I'm just going to open up
Photoshop here's my file i made i'm
going to start from scratch and i'm just
going to do control n for a new file and
my default sizes are fine by me and i'll
start with a new layer and the rounded
rectangle tool and i have a radius of 5
maybe i'll do it 27 and my mode I always
have it on this mode so that I don't get
the vector outlines and I'll just make
it about yay big and whatever color you
make it in it's not a big deal because
we can always hit control you and just
change the lightness to a nice grayish
color okay and time to apply the magic
we can right click the layer and go to
blending options and I'm going to do a
bevel and emboss now it looks kind of
lame right now I'm going to change the
size to 1 pixel and I can change the
position of it to make it a little bit
of a softer grey and that looks good
enough for me now a gradient overlay and
this looks good but we just need to
change the opacity so it looks like it's
a little bit rounded the next thing to
make it look even better would be to add
an inner glow and I'm going to make this
color white and I'm going to make the
edges really hard and that's by changing
the choke in the size about to that just
gives it a nice soft little outline you
could make it a little softer if you
want it and the final touches might be
stroked and with stroke i'm just going
to choose a dark color on the button and
i'm going to change this to one pixel
and this button is kind of dark so i'm
just going to hit control you once more
and make it a little bit lighter
there we go and the gradient is kind of
hard on it so let me just adjust that
once more gradient overlay there we go I
like it like that and time to make a
little shiny part on the top I'll make a
new layer zoom in with ctrl alt mouse
wheel and I'm going to hold the ctrl key
so you can see a little dotted outline
above my pointer click and I'm still
selected on this layer though and what
I'm going to do is select the circle
marquee tool or elliptical and hold the
alt button so you see a minus on your
crosshair and we can just kind of cut
out a little piece here but like that
cool now for a gradient what I did here
for my gradient was I just selected the
default black to white for the first
color the bottom ticker i made this
white and on the top right ticker this
changes the opacity i made this one
transparent so it's going to fade into
nothing and you can just kind of drag
over it try to find something that
you're satisfied with or you could go in
the opposite direction to me this looks
kind of dated and tacky so i'm going to
go in the opposite direction kind of
like that just so that we could barely
see it well i guess we can't see it at
all
and maybe a little more okay that looks
good and now i'm going to put these both
on a folder and i'll just call this
folder button and we have to make a copy
of this for this state where it's
hovered over so with that button folder
i'm just going to hold the alt key and
drag down and i can move this up just so
it touches the edge we do want this to
be pixel perfect and on this button this
layer i'm going to hit control you make
it a little lighter and in fact you know
we could actually add a little bit of
color if we wanted to might make it look
a little neater kinda like a soft blue
or something and you might not be able
to tell a huge difference here but you
will when we use the mouse over and with
these 2 i'm going to select both folders
and press ctrl E or its right click and
merge layers and then with our crop tool
I'm just going to select these when you
merge them it makes it easy to crop them
because sometimes it doesn't identify
the layer styles and we want this to
work on any background so I would hide
the background and you should have those
checkers there and save for web and
devices and PNG dash 24 is the best
transparent image format and I'll just
say this is button dot PNG replacing the
previous one and I save that on my
desktop under a folder called test and
it's right here button we're going to
recreate the index file so although new
text whoops not a rich text document new
text document
index.html and we can open this and
nothing there yet and this will take
about two minutes to do real quick we're
going to edit with notepad plus plus and
let's just do a standard HTML body tags
and let's make a link aah RF goes to
know where we're going to get up a class
of button I'll say hey mommy so if i
refresh it's just a boring link that
does nothing and the magic happens in
CSS we just add some style tags and I'll
say dot button background will be URL of
button dot PNG with an already beat the
height the width we don't know yet and
that's what we're going to find out so
with the rectangular marquee tool we can
make a rectangle and it looks like it's
about 55 pixels whoopsie daisies maybe
54 actually I'm just trying to get the
height here 54 pixels by 181 wide 181
pixels and fifty four pixels okay and an
anchor it needs to be displayed as an
inline block or a block in order to set
the height and width and oops I got
these backwards this is supposed to be
181 x 54 and you'll see kind of what
we're doing
text-align will be center color will be
gray and we're going to add some padding
top so that this link will pop down I'll
say 13 pixels refresh and I'm going to
change the font I'll say font of boulder
14 pixels arial sans-serif refresh let's
do 16 refresh hey mommy I'm going to
make the padding about 17 it looks like
refresh that looks better and I'm going
to take away the underlying on that link
and for the the padding that we added we
have to add the subtract the padding
from the height so 54 minus 17 that
would be a 44 than minus 7 that would be
what 37 I think refresh here we have
that and the last step is to do button
and add the pseudo class of hover and
this one's easy background position of 0
minus and the height i believe it was 54
pixels refresh and hover over it and it
looks like we're off by one pixel so let
me try negative 55 pixels refresh and
there we have it a nice stylish button
to make your legs look better on your
website thanks for watching guys if you
found it useful give me a thumbs up or a
slap on the back thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
