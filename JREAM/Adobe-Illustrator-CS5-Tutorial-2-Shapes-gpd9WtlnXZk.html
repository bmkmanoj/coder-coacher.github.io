tutorial we're going to play little
shapes and I just got the grid on for
the heck of it and that's if you go to
view uh you can click show grid like
that and I also got a snap to grid on
but alright so let's make some shapes
right obviously a squares a square or a
rectangle you know if you want a perfect
square you can hold shift and like I
said before when you're making the thing
you can hold spacebar to move it around
and same with the circle if you want to
oval or if you want a perfect circle
hold shift okay
easy peasy and what about these other
tools you got this rounded rectangle you
can use the up and down keys there we go
to make it more rounded or more square
and may change the color because that's
hurting my eyes
like for this shape same thing you can
increase the sides with the up and down
arrow pretty cool and same with the star
up and down arrows and I'll hold ctrl
and you can change the way it appears
now looks like a little Super Mario star
because those are really fat aren't they
I don't mess with this little lens flare
much I don't really get why it's there
but oh well so that's pretty easy to do
then you got your line tool
you got changed a little outline box
down here and give that a color
and oh that's kind of bright okay that's
a skinny little line I'm just gonna
select that and make it thicker there's
a lot of options for the stroke but I'm
not gonna go into that you could just
monkey with that maybe and an arc tool I
actually probably almost never use that
and I almost never use any of these
maybe the grid sometimes I usually use
the pen tool but that's a whole tutorial
in itself with the spiral whoa what
happened let me redo that alright hit
the down button if you want to increase
the amount of curls down and up and then
hit the was it say hold control yeah
that's it to increase the closeness of
the swirls okay so I guess you know
that'd be cool for like a seashell and
the grid you know that's the same thing
up down left right to increase the
little number little grids in there and
yeah the shapes are pretty easy that's
pretty good for now and just play with
the shapes for a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
