version 14 I started using for
development I really like it I am in a
virtual box so that I could record this
and this is a fresh install so since
it's in a virtual box that might run a
little bit slow it does come with this
Libre Office which is actually pretty
decent I personally use Google Docs and
everything but I've tried this out in
version 12 and I didn't really like this
unity sidebar and now I've kind of
gotten used to it
I'd like to use dual monitors and I keep
the unity sidebar on my leftmost monitor
and if you go to your settings here and
your displays the launcher placement you
have multiple displays you can just
assign it to one and one other thing if
you have multiple displays when you try
to switch monitors it has sticky edges
and I just drove me nuts so I turned it
off okay so I'll just apply and keep
that configuration though I am on one
display so what was weird to me was this
whole sidebar thing I'm not used to
having applications without a menu at
the top so if I open Firefox let's say
and I'll move it over here a little bit
and it's like where all my options and
it behaves like the Mac OSX we're at the
top it puts these tools up here and I
really don't like this at all and
there's a way to change this which I'll
show you so first to manage stuff on
here I'm just going to right click and
unlock from the launcher and they've got
Amazon on there
okay and what I like to do one the first
things honestly is open up the system
settings and go to the keyboard right
here and the shortcuts and I'll just
click help browser and just backspace
calculate our backspace email backspace
web browser backspace and the home
folder now if you're coming from windows
like me I really like to do windows key
e and search I don't even know what that
is and that's pretty much all I do for
those shortcuts so if I press Windows
key E I get my file manager here which
is quite nice and again if you see
there's no menu up here and I have to go
up here and we're gonna adjust that so
this right here is the software Center
for people that don't like to use the
terminal and stuff and it's actually
pretty decent I am very impressed
because this everything in a bun - is
free I mean to have some games here that
cost money and stuff but it's free and
this OS is pretty pretty sweet for the
GUI and everything this guy here when
you hit the Windows key if you're using
windows keyboard he just opens up and
you can search for anything like file
and it'll look it up and it has all this
junk down here I can turn filter results
off to get rid of some of the junk I
don't want you can search a lot of stuff
I personally don't want Amazon or Ebay
or whatever to show up when I'm
searching for something okay and these
are just a bunch of apps they have what
we're going to do is look for compiz in
the sir
let me go to all software
compiz and you want this comp is
settings manager and this has to do with
all the window alignment and everything
so when I install it says to type in the
password and another one that I highly
recommend is terminator this is really
cool it's a better console I'm not going
to go through installing sublime text
and everything on here right now but you
probably want to because it's awesome
and Google Chrome I kind of prefer over
Firefox so you can install all that too
if you'd like so these guys are
installing and I'll hit alt tab and just
hold down the Alt key and just like in
Windows you can navigate through this
and if your fingers are good you can
hold shift to go backwards gotta have
some good finger movement there but this
is pretty useful so let's see where this
is installed close these guys out here's
terminator so to move him I'll just drag
them up here because that's like one of
my favorite programs
it's the terminal
I'm not going to customize it here but
sudo apt-get update and you type in your
password and you can make hotkeys to
split it vertically and then split this
guy horizontally and you can even create
new tabs which I don't actually remember
open tab okay so now I have a tab here
and here and I mean you can have a lot
of terminals open
it's pretty sweet so let's go ahead and
close that guy and in the compiz
settings manager it's just saying hey
this is advanced stuff be careful what I
like to do is go to the window
management grid and it has bindings to
move the windows to the left and the
right of this screen so if I want to
move to the left I'm so used to Windows
where I'll just grab the key combination
and do windows left and that's called
the super key on here and right whoops
and top actually the maximize key is
right here let me grab this one and
restore okay so now if I do left right
top and restore does not do exactly what
I want okay it's control super down
wonder why that one didn't work okay I
don't know what that I'm not gonna read
all that and corners and edges okay so
in the regular settings I want multiple
monitors so under the appearance I'll go
to behavior and I'll enable workspaces
and these are my workspaces here and
then it says show the menus for a window
in the menu bar or in the windows title
bar remember how I was talking about how
I don't like that I prefer them here so
now when I have a application open it's
going to be chilling right here which
makes more sense to me I personally
prefer these to be on the right to me
it's kind of weird on the left but with
version 14 there's a problem changing
that I forget the reason why so I'm
going to hold down the windows or the
super key and it just shows a list of
all of your stuff and it has all that
stuff the Macintosh has like if I do s
it shows my screens and I can drag this
over here I have four enabled right now
you can actually change that if I do W
super W it'll show what windows are open
if you've used a Macintosh
I think it's called expose like that
honestly I am used to the hotkeys where
it's ctrl alt and the arrow key and I
just like to move up and down left and
right like that
and if I instead of having to do the
super View and then drag this over I
want to be able to drag it over with
just the mouse oops
looks like my virtual box is hanging a
little bit okay so let's go inside of
here
is it the desktop wall and I believe its
edge flipping okay so the wall edge
flipping and check this so if I move him
over see he brings me to the new screen
and I'll go back so now I can just drag
him over it's kind of hard to do it
looks like this little sidebars being
kind of annoying and still snapping I'm
not used to using a single screen though
so this comp is manager he really
shouldn't be docked from the launcher so
if I open him up and I close him he's
gone now and I can just press the super
key and type compiz and it'll bring me
here I won't uncheck that okay and what
you might want to do is go to your
preferences when you customize
everything you want and export it and
just call it like my profile I'll just
call it Jessie and save it and do you
want to skip to fall options while
exporting I'll just say no because it
was highlighted and then if you have a
bun to anywhere else you can just import
it which is quite nice so one of the
things that bothered me was if I had
Firefox open and if I had another
instance open you know I click this it
doesn't seem to do anything so I'll
right-click it and open a new window
okay so now I have two instances open
and there's two little dots here for
Firefox so I can right-click it and go
to either of these instances or I can
super key W to look at the windows or
you can even alt tab it and just hold it
there for a moment and it'll show you
right there which is pretty nice it will
go in order if I tab it
like that that's one thing that's hard
to get used to hoops okay other than
that that's just kind of a brief intro
this button here also shows the
workspaces and sometimes you're just
sitting here and it looks like well
where is everything and you just have to
look at your sidebar and it has little
dots here I would like that to be a
little more customizable I don't know a
whole lot about unity but I do like this
now versus what they used to have and
you can't see on my screen but at the
bottom there's a trashcan it's just
because I'm trying to record this in a
nice resolution last thing is let's see
if we can find unity tweak tools are
really just to tweak let's see
unity tweak here it is so since I closed
this guy it might ask me for my password
again install yeah if I left the
Software Center open it probably would
be cool
so pretty much I was just getting the
compiz thing for all the visual window
movement and stuff and then the unity
Tweaker this guy has a lot of options to
change themes and you'll see these
options kind of repeated the workspaces
where you can have less or more so if I
did super I only have two now it's
really up to your own discretion yeah
but there's a lot of options on here
that you can tweak and mess with we can
auto hide this so then should hover not
sure how to get it to reveal might be
because I'm in the VirtualBox it's a
little difficult
I personally leave it on all the time
but you can also shrink the icons if you
want it smaller
I know Windows 7 has a start menu with
icons similar to this and I still use my
windows the old-fashioned way where has
the icon and the text and a whole bunch
of options to change there so that's
just a basic overview of Linux all of
the stuff you do will probably be in
your home folder so since my user is
Jessie its home and you have just an
assortment of stuff here and all your
downloads going to here and that's a
quick gist of Ubuntu 14</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
