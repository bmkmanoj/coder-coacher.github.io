the package of the week I chose Silex
it's the PHP micro framework based on
Symphony two components it's very easy
to use and get started with created by
Fabian potent sir possibly some
contributors who is the author of
Symphony 2 so to get started I'm just
gonna copy this their basic template and
I have a folder already open just called
Silex there's nothing in it and I'll
create a new folder and call it web
that's because symphony always calls a
web for what would be your htdocs but
I'll go ahead and make a new file in
here
and this will be my index.php or almost
like your front controller okay so
inside of web we have that under the
Select folder I'm gonna create a new
composer dot Jason okay so that's not in
the web folder okay and back to the
Silex page or is the installation
install now okay so I want to put this
in composer pause the video if you need
to
okay so I'll paste this I'm not done yet
and
documentation twig and we want to use
twig for templating cuz it's pretty
sweet we also want to require this guy
so boom boom alright let's do our
composer update I'm in Silex composer
update while that's running I'm gonna
make a new folder a cull of views under
web I'll make another new folder I'll
call it public all my sub folders which
I really like to do in terminal instead
but I'll do it anyway so new folder CSS
j/s image and you can really make a
pretty nice site out of this third party
okay now I would use Bower to install
the third-party stuff and this is just
purely gonna be for the select system
you can figure out Bower if you'd like
or just throw in bootstrap or whatever
so this installed a bunch of stuff
generated our auto loader like it always
does here's the routing which it uses
the HTTP foundation for requests and
sessions and all that pimple is there
dependency injector selects is nice and
twig is the templating language which is
a copy from Django templating so we're
here and we have hello name first what I
want to do is see if it even works first
so I'm inside of web my index file the
current directory this would be web go
level down to vendor and auto load so it
should load the selects application so
what I'm gonna do is just run the PHP
server from the public folder
or the web folder PHP - capital s1 27.0
: 9000 okay so it makes it just easy to
test in here okay so sorry the page we
are looking for could not be found now
what if we go to slash hello Jessie
there it is very nice so we know that
works we just would need a base route
and we want to use twig instead of just
returning strings so if I go to the
documentation we need to setup the twig
provider right here well I believe there
was a here it is we register the twig
provider here boom boom like that so we
set a path for twig and in this case
it's views which is a directory lower so
we'll just kind of do what we did there
whoops
slash dot views okay so this will look
for the view inside of views so in here
I'll just make a new thing I'll just say
hi and I'll save as index dot twig and
I'll make another file just say base and
base dot twig okay so we have those two
folders that files that don't do
anything right now and then let's go
down a little ways and grab the usage
boom and back to here and now we'll just
get rid of this and set our home path we
don't need name because we're not
passing anything in there we do need to
use app as this anonymous function here
we'll need to use twig and I want to
render index dot twig and there is no
data in the array I like to keep an
empty array there so with that
saved let's go ahead and try to reload
the page here and we get hi perfect so
let's make our base template and all
that stuff so your base could be
something like this if you've never used
twig yeah I write HTML the old way but
come on guys have mercy I'll skip a lot
of the mumbo-jumbo and right here we
would do block content and block save
okay you could do a title head head
and block and here let's just call this
Zeus okay so we can override this and
what we're going to do is go to index
dot twig and we're going to say extends
vase dot twig okay and then we'll do a
block title and block and we'll just say
homepage Playa and let's also do the
content index here and we're just going
to say app debug equals true and refresh
the block title has already been defined
it looks like it has content block title
whoops
content there refresh and there's the
content and basically you can just
inherit templates and not have to redo
all your stuff here where you would
include all your head code and stuff but
Silex is very very small and easy to use
there's a lot of other stuff you can
throw in but this is the gist of it I
think it's a great package for a micro
website they actually need some oomph to
it so thanks for watching guys and check
it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
