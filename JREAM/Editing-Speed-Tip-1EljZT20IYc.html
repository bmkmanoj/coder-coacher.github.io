document and you want to format things
let's say I want to change this font to
core your new and maybe make it a little
bigger how about boulder and change the
color maybe an orange color like that
and then I want to do that to every one
of these this is going to take forever
because I got to do all these clicks to
get it familiar so what you can do is
make a macro i'm using openoffice writer
if you want to see it's free what i
would do is go to tools macros and
record a macro and this little tiny
window pops up that lets us know we're
recording i'm going to do the same thing
i just did i'm going to first change
this to Quarrier change the font size
make it bold and pop in the color looks
good and I'll stop recording and I can
save this as code like I was playing
around with it before so I'll just save
it here and or write that and what we
can do is double click this and then go
to tools macros and run macro and then
we have to select from this drop-down
list run and you're probably thinking
well that's just as much clicks as you
know setting it up yourself so what
we're going to do is bind the macro to a
hotkey and to do that I'm going to go to
tools customize and in this keyboard tab
when you open it you'll probably be in
the menu tab just go to keyboard and
we're going to find a hotkey that we
like how about ctrl alt one and i just
press ctrl alt one when i focused in
this area and what i'm going to do is go
all the way down from the category and
openoffice org macros under user
standard
modules there we go and code like and to
get this in there we have to click
modify and now control alt one is bound
to code light and okay so i'll double
click this and press ctrl alt one and
you can see although it's still a little
bit of work we could easily format stuff
a lot faster if you know a better way of
doing this without having to write like
let's say a regular expression do tell
them the comments and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
