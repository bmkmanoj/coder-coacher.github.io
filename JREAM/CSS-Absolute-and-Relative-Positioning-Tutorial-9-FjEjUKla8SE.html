do relative and absolute positioning and
I just cleared out the stuff I had in
the previous section so set up a div ID
wrap and set up a new div and let's give
it an ID of just I guess just call it
header and let's put some content in
here alright that looks good and here it
is let's format our wrap once again and
just say width is 600 pixels and border
will be let's say 5 pixels solid gray
and for our header let's do a header and
let's say border 3 pixels solid red
let's see what we're working with here
all right now we're going to do a
relative position of the header and you
just type in position:relative and then
you can type let's say left and say 10
and that will add 10 little spots over
to the left and you see this will also
hang over the box you can also do top
and there it is there now um you can
also do bottom and right I haven't
really make I don't usually mix the two
I don't think that's a good idea
it looks like it causes a problem so I
think you take top away if you're going
to use bottom and tap will do that you
can also use negative values so negative
10 now what you want to do if you want
to have salute position something let's
uh
get rid of this and let's make a new div
inside and let's call it um div id
equals um just tag and then in here
destroy tag tag tag and let's refresh
see how that looks okay and let's make a
definition for tag oh say border one
pixel solid blue and let's say width we
need to give it a small width so just
say 120 pixels and refresh and there's
that now you could float right and do
all kinds of stuff but I'm trying to
show you how to absolute position so
let's do position:absolute and top will
be 10 and right will be zero now check
out what happens it disappears you can't
see it from here
but it moved all the way to the right
side
even though whoops even though tag is a
child of header century it's absolute
it's still taking the body for the
absolute position so to fix that you
have to say header position relative and
if the header is position relative
it will contain any children is the
absolute correctly and there it is if we
refresh it tag appears in there so
that's pretty easy
there's a couple other values like fixed
now if you have a absolute position
value you can do a top 250 percent you
got to realize if you have a scrolling
page it's going to stay at that position
it's not going to scroll with the page
let's try a fixed
and let's get rid of the relative in the
header so that it's in the center of the
page okay I need to put that on the left
so left to zero okay it's down there and
let me add some content so just below
here
let's just add some content so that we
can make the page scroll okay
and if you see I'm scrolling and this
tag thing here is staying in the same
position and that's what a fixed
position does and that's pretty good for
now thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
