prototype quite a bit and it's just
another JavaScript framework what I'm
going to show you is how to do an ajax
get in JSON and it's a lot like jQuery
but a little different so we'll start
with a document dot observe and we do a
dom loaded and a function and this is a
lot like the document ready in jquery
and what we're going to do is just a get
and to do so we do new ajax request and
then we do the page name I've already
made one called it Ajax PHP and then we
make an object in here and let me close
off this little thing here and we can
move down a couple line so I forgot my
quote okay so the method will be get and
we're going to do on success and we'll
create a function and then the parameter
inside it and what I'm going to do is
put this the output inside of this div
ID output and I'll do dollar um
oops output dot insert transport and
we're going to have to come back to that
so what we have to do is return
something from Ajax PHP and in here I'll
just make an array and i'll say a equals
all right and I'll save text is hello
and value or how about status is this is
good okay and to return JSON from PHP of
course we have to do echo json encode
good and if i refresh we don't get
anything yet because we have to handle
this JSON data so we have to evaluate
the JSON data it appears that doesn't do
this automatically so I'm going to take
the transport argument here which is the
data coming from the PHP and response
text dot eval Jason now response text
might actually be the actual stuff
coming from PHP I don't know totally yet
but i'll just do data equals all that
stuff and now i can do my J son thing
I'll do data dot what we call it text
and status Jason text plus BR plus theta
dot status
and refresh and now we got data from
another source on another page there's a
lot of other things we can do like I'm
complete we can do on complete function
and i'll just do alerts it's done and
that's done you can also do unloading
there's quite a few of these like for
unloading you could make a little
loading image up here somewhere on the
page but that's it for the most part and
I included my code snippet on my site
which is right here if you'd like to get
it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
