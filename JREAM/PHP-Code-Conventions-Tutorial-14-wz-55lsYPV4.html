we'll cover some cold conventions and
organization of your objects I wasn't
sure exactly what to name this but it'll
cover a couple things so generally what
you want is your classes should serve
one purpose each so let's say we have a
database you should have a single class
for database and if it had a function
here called connect that would be its
own function and it may be public
function query and public function get
to get the query and see what you don't
want to do is say public function query
we let's say we do the MySQL a query and
then MySQL I fetch array all in one we
want two separate components so that the
structure of it can be like DB query
okay and then we have this query up
hanging around in the database object we
could say DB count rows or we could say
DB get and this way we have a lot more
flexibility to what we want to do with
what we're query in okay and another
thing like let's say you had an email
object you probably just do class email
this should be in its own class and
let's just say a public function a set
name public function send email okay
what you don't want to do a database
doesn't really need an email and thing
but let's pretend uh let's say if there
was an air for example I know this code
isn't correct but I'm just trying to
give you the general idea if error we
could say
email equals new email and email uh
let's just say send email okay y-you
won't want to do this is because you're
now requiring the database object to
include the email object and once you
get a big library you're not really
going to know what you want to if you
don't want to include your email in your
package let's say you just get rid of
that then you have a conflict here and
what you would better off be doing is
saying DB query and you'd say if DB
error equals true you know rather than
setting the email up here you could say
this error equals error so if there was
an error you'd say you know no email and
email send okay and hopefully that gives
you that idea there another thing is
cold convention and this is really it's
up to you
but it'll help with the clarity of what
you're trying to do there's a couple of
different ones I prefer those end code
conventions I don't think I follow it
perfectly but basically they say if you
have a class you started out with a new
line some people like it like this you
see where the brackets are and then
there's let's say function um something
like oh one okay and you see how these
brackets on the same line here
you should stay consistent with whatever
you decide to do every time so that it
doesn't look like this and it'll just
look kind of confusing if you have
brackets starting there then brackets
starting here you should stick to one
method I prefer the double line like
this and then there's a variable naming
one thing is when you make private
variables you start them with the
underscore and the same with
affected and public should just be you
know anything and you should do the same
for methods if this was a protected or a
private method you start it with a
underscore and then there's like naming
and stuff camelcase is pretty popular
there's some that say you should name it
like if you're going to set something
set the name of the thing and then
forget you do get value whoops and this
will just keep your software consistent
and you'll be able to quickly find what
you're doing and other people will
recognize the pattern of how you code
quickly this is also called camel case
and if you have three words you'd say
set value now and you read the words um
like a camel they're back it's like a
hump and some sometimes I kind of like
doing mine like item name here I kind of
like these underscores because when I'm
just quickly scrolling through my code
it's really easy to read and and also
when you make classes you should put
each class in its own file and for
example what I mean is if we had a
database this would be its own file and
just you can call this whatever you want
um
I prefer not to call mine dot class even
though I've shown that in my example I
just prefer to call it database and pop
it in a folder called libs and then if
you had another one let's just say email
I just say that his email dot PHP and
what this does is you have a library now
where you can just drop a database
anywhere you want if you're working on a
new project or if you only need your
email class rather than tying things
into
like I showed earlier where the database
requires the email if something went
wrong this way you can just pop it in
wherever you want and then handle what
you're going to do and on the public
scope so I hope that helps and good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
