you a trick to quickly handle all your
photo resizes and watermarks you see I
got all these photos and like let's say
I wanted to create thumbnails or
something like that and I'll be a
consistent size what I would do is bust
open my window go to actions and we got
all this stuff in here and you see all
these default actions here what we want
to do is record our own and to do so I
have to click this new little guy here
and what I want to call him I'm just
gonna call him resize and watermark okay
so it's recording right now it's gonna
record what I do so I'll say write some
text copyright me okay
and I'm just trying to keep this short
and simple and I'll make the opacity a
little bit and I don't know I'll just
throw it up here okay and then I'll go
to image image size
now the 250 by 250 boom and copyright me
alright you get the idea
I'll hit stop and I have this resize and
water and that's where I'll do I could
run through each one of these one by one
like this and hit play you can see it
does it like that but if you had like
hundreds of images or something you
could go to automate batch and what do I
want to do I guess the default actions
because I only have one member right
here's my default actions and then I'll
go to resize and water and I have to
choose my sources you can do a whole
folder you know you don't have to have
everything open or I can do the open
files I have which is what I'll do here
and I guess I'll just hit okay check
that out
it looks like on this one since the
image was a lot bigger the Zack Morris
one I'll undo it you see a place to me
in the wrong place so I don't have it
down to a science but that does get the
job done and I hope this tip helped you
guys Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
