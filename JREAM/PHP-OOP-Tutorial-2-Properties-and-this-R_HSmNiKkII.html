number two and we're going to cover our
properties and the this variable so
let's just create a function and call it
function sample now let's make a
property for the example class and you
would do public item and say public name
in PHP for you would do var before and
PHP five you do public private or
protected I think in PHP six they're
making it so that var is interchangeable
with public so let's just do public
because it makes more sense and this has
to do with the scope and where you can
access the variable outside of the class
like here or if you can access it from
classes that extend it but we're not
there yet so don't worry about that
just keep your items of public or your
properties public and then the this
variable uh with this you can call
functions so you could do on this sample
but we don't want to call the same
function here so let's just make another
one called test and test will echo out
the word test so you do this test and
this applies to the class that we're in
the class the Orang is example so um
we're saying inside of example which is
this call the test function and we'll
refresh it and we have a beautiful parse
error because up
this line here refresh that and we get
nothing because we didn't instantiate
the object so down at the bottom do new
example and I'll just say a e equals new
example and call the method and let's
run sample so even though we're running
sample a sample says hey run test and
then we're calling this function down
here and we get the word test if you
want to do variables we can do echo this
item now item has no value or anything
so let's give it a just say item blah
item and this should echo out item right
there you don't have to use this um just
like regular functions you can do a
regular variable let's just say 500 and
you can echo out regular and we have 500
and just like other functions in PHP you
cannot pass that into a different
function because that's outside of the
scope so if you had dog you can't do
this this won't work because regular
belongs to the test function so to have
global properties and throughout the
class just use a the this command and
you should define them at the top
