be a series on java programming and some
of the basics so what you want to do is
first get the SDK which stands for
software development kit and look on
google and you'll see java SE downloads
now it looks kind of confusing with all
this stuff here what you want is the jdk
which is the java development kit and
you would download this one JR e is the
Java Runtime environment to run Java you
likely have that already installed so
we'll click that link my internets going
a little slow and um you would download
this now it's a pretty big download okay
and just get it for the operating system
you use i'm on windows here okay and
after you install all that what you're
going to want to do if you're on Windows
if you're going to want to right-click
my computer and go to properties and
we're going to once again do advanced
system settings I've done this in a
couple other tutorials and go to
environment variables sorry we click the
Advanced tab up here so you might see
this go to advanced and environment
variables and then we are going to go to
path and edit the path because we want
to add the Java executable to the
command line so I'll open up my little
browser here and go to f drive program
files java and go to your jtk or sorry
JDK folder java development kit and we
have to look for the binary and here it
is in bin
and here it is Java Sea so I'm going to
click up here and just copy this long
path minimize here and at the end of
this I'll just add a semicolon and press
ctrl-v to paste that in ok ok ok and
close and you can go to start run or
press windows key r and type in CMD and
just type in a java and if this comes up
you know its installed so we have java
installed you can also use netbeans for
your ide if you want let me open this
real quick netbeans this is my favorite
ide I have some other stuff going on in
here at the moment whoopsie daisies what
did I do to this window ok and you can
create a new Java document in here if
you like a new project so i'll do that i
have to install the java plugin because
i only download the PHP for netbeans but
if you want to do that you could go to
tools plugins available plugins and just
sort by the category here and we're
going to look for java and what do we
want we want the java SE that's good and
the GUI builder you can install this if
you want i'm not going to at the moment
well i guess i will and that means we'll
install these
it's easier to work with the IDE because
you don't have to do everything in the
command shell and a text document and
you get live updates and everything so
that's getting it installed and we'll do
some coding in the next tutorial thanks
