we're going to do some functions and
there's there's a learning curve to this
so you're gonna have to get familiar
with it like with the if statement where
we do the if our argument inside our
brackets on the expression function is
just the same way see we type it like
function and we can give any name we
want I'll call this one test and then my
little brackets or braces and what we
want to happen here let's just do alert
one okay so we have a test function okay
I'll refresh nothing happens and
basically what a function is is it's
something that can be reused over and
over so when you define a function it's
not calling it this is just telling us
what it does to actually use that I type
the name like that and don't forget your
semicolon refresh and boom now a
function can take arguments so let's say
a and full alert a and you're like well
what's that gonna do you see how test
and now has this value here we can put
any value in here like I'll say John Doe
and this a is going to replace this
value here so whatever we put in here
since I put John Doe in here it's as if
it literally is appearing in here so
it's going to alert John Doe and I'll
refresh and we get John Doe if you want
to do another argument you can also add
a comma and say B and I can do alert a
plus B and I'll say John Doe
is cool refreshed and John Doe is cool
so let's do an actual example of
something down here at the bottom I have
a div ID of item one two and three and
what I'm gonna do is something called
get element by ID okay
and we've done document that right when
we wanted to write values this one's a
little bit longer so document got get
let's get element by ID okay and down
here you can see our ID is item one so
I'll say item one and what do we want to
do to that let's um add some HTML and
this is called chaining where you keep
adding kind of a function on to it so
I'm going to say dot inner HTML equals
blah blah and I'll refresh and it looks
like nothing happened and why is that
that's because um it's calling this
JavaScript here before the rest of this
page loaded below and you can see I've
already done this I've created an onload
event so when the page is loaded we want
to run a function called init so let's
go ahead and create that function I'll
say function init
and we're gonna pop this in here and
basically what's that saying is when the
body is loaded and here's the body this
stuff then we're gonna run this command
in it
okay so I'll refresh and it fills in
that text and if I want to do item 1 and
item 2 I mean 2 &amp;amp; 3 I can do it that way
refresh and here's where a function
comes in handy because we want to not
repeat code a whole bunch and this will
be a perfect example so we could create
a function but I'm not going to create
it inside the init function we don't
want to nest our functions up right now
anyways we want to keep things simple so
I'll say function and I'll call this
fill and I'm going to just cut one of
these and paste it in there okay so I
can get rid of this stuff here and we'll
call the fill function I'll just say
fill okay
refresh and it fills in the first one
let me reiterate what we're doing once
more when the body loads the HTML all
this stuff here it's gonna call the init
function init isn't any special kind of
function I just named it that because I
think it's easy to remember and I would
probably maybe put it at the top no big
deal
and when init is loaded we call the fill
function and what's fill do it fills in
some HTML and to make this more flexible
we want to do is add some arguments just
like we did up here so I'll go ahead and
I'll leave that there for a second and
for this I'll say item and item remember
what this does is this placeholder it
replaces what's in there so if I fill
item one refresh it still works I can
copy this again and do fill item to
refresh and it works and to make this a
little more flexible I'll add another
argument and call this content and this
way we can put custom content inside
here and I'll say I'm item 1 and I'm fat
and we'll fill the last one also was the
item 3 I like cheese
and refresh and now we have a function
that can do all that cool stuff and
before this tutorial gets too long
I do have style tags up here with a
class for the color red this isn't
JavaScript this is CSS right here and I
just want to show you another example of
an event so let's say item one
when item one is clicked we want to
change the font color so I'll say
function change and I will say document
dot get element by ID and I'm just gonna
pop in item one here and just like how
we chained this up here we're going to
chain class name plus equals hey with a
space and that looks a little confusing
I know basically we're adding a class
plus equal is like appending to it and I
put a space here because like down here
if we add class equals test and if
JavaScript added it without a space it
would be test hey so we add a space
after that sorts like test hey okay and
in order to get this to work let's just
do an init
let's do change and I think that's all
we have to do refresh and that items
read some other things we'll have to
talk about again are the switch
statement events Oh what else
scope and a lot of things come to mind
when I think about this I wouldn't panic
too much about using get element by ID
because I would use a framework because
there's just a lot of stuff to do
manually all this code but at least
practices so you kind of get what's
going on and start for the long tutorial
but thanks for what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
