we're going to do our own functions in
the last tutorial we learned that a
function looks like this it has a word
and it has parenthesis and this won't do
anything because it needs to have
something in it so it'd be the length of
blah and we want to create our own so
let's go to file new window and we get
open this little Python editor and a
function you can think of it as
something that you can reuse over and
over anywhere you want any number of
times so rather than saying print 5
print 10 and 15 although this would be
better as a loop you could make a
function to always add 5 to something
anyways let's make one and to make one
you type in the word death d EF and then
the word of the function now you can't
use the word when because that's a
reserved word for the length function so
let's just call this one adder and we
make our own parentheses here then you
press the column key ENTER and you'll
notice that your lines are tabbed over
that's because everything on this line
here is going to be within the adder
function if you happen to go down here
that's going to be outside the adder
function so make sure your items are
tabbed over that you want inside the
function so what space is important in
Python for this one let's just say print
5 plus 10 and let's save this
I'll save minus test dot py and run run
module nothing happens yet but the
function definition is inside this
session of Python so I can type adder
with the little parentheses and hit
enter
it gives me 15 so that's pretty easy but
not very impressive let's make a little
more use of this what if we wanted to
say we wanted to put in our own values
in here you see how
length we put in the word blah and it
gives you the value what do we want to
put our own numbers in here I'd say a B
now you could change these to anything
you want I'm just using simple variables
for this example and would say print a
plus B and what this would look like is
adder and just pick a number let's say
10 and 500 so with this adder this a
piece would be the 100 and B would be
the 500 and basically the parameters we
pass in go into wherever these
placeholders are and so it'd be 100 plus
B and I'll save this and rerun it
make sure you rerun uh so the system
registers your changes let's say adder
100 and 500 enter and it adds up these
values for us now we could do a lot more
and say print a times B print a divided
by B and print a minus B and just press
f5 and rerun it and let's say adder 100
whoops or 199 comma 500 and it gives us
all these values pretty cool now if we
wanted to put let's say text beside
these strings we could say plus and then
do another plus to attach the string now
we're going to run into a problem and
I'm doing this on purpose and then we're
going to say multiply and we're going to
say divide and then we're going to say -
okay make sure you add a plus after all
these the plus sign attaches a string to
another otherwise if it's a integer it
will do math so if we save this you
would think that it's going to say plus
is equal to a plus B but
you'll see adder and we get a bunch of
errors
that's because Python cannot combine a
strength and an integer so the way to
fix this is to apply the string function
that's already built into the system
onto the math so we type STR for string
and this cast this to a string and press
f5 oh sorry my dog was just fighting
over some turkey on the ground
all right so adder let's say 400 and 500
and you'll see this will give us string
based results pretty cool what if you
had another function let's say Daffy
smile and in here we'll say print
I feel happy today okay
that's all this function will do we can
call this function from this function
and to do that below on this line make
sure it's still tabbed over just type
smile and don't forget your parentheses
I'll press f5 to reload it and I'll say
adder 200 300 whoops invalid syntax
whoops this is because we have to define
smiled before adder because this is
calling smile before the system
registers is it defined mm-hmm so let's
cut this and pop it to the top my
mistake all right
so smiles defined here then once we call
adder it can actually call smile because
it's in the system so f5 and type adder
and there we go I feel happy today now
you can also press C
I guess you have to be in the actual
shell of your software like Microsoft
command prompt or bash shell if you want
to hit the up arrow and get the previous
command you typed but it doesn't appear
to be working in the Python shell so
these are just some basic functions and
sorry for my slip-ups but I hope you
were able to follow and thanks for
