application I just started using and
it's pretty cool called file seek by
binary fortress I'm not associated with
them or anything but I needed something
to look through files because usually
what I do is I load up a project and
netbeans and I search through the files
in there and I don't really want to make
a project out of what I'm working on
because I'm just digging through
wordpress looking for random stuff that
they have all over the place and I just
got the free version here and it's
pretty slick I added it to my context
menu so I can actually use that so
inside this wordpress folder in Windows
Explorer I just right-click and search
with file seek pops this up includes the
path that we need and you can have a
couple options so I didn't just use a
match full string right now and I'm
wondering where they set their cookies
so I'm looking this up and I just
searched it goes through every file for
me and I can just double click it open
it up and it takes me to where it is
it's a pretty good time saver if you
guys know anything that's any better let
me know but so far this is a extremely
handy has case sensitive options also up
here so I guess that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
