wanted to have to do ever this is not
about programming and it's it's
real-life stuff I grew up in a family of
four so there's me a brother and two
sisters and um unfortunately my sister
has after her pregnancy got a very rare
disease and she's had it for two years
absolutely two and a half now but they
just found out what it was six months
ago it's called Cushing's disease or
Cushing's syndrome and the good news is
that it's treatable the the problem is
it's very degenerative so obviously I'm
not going to show recent photos of her
or anything you know you bruise easy it
takes long to heal there's a lot of
weight gain fatigue like the 90 year old
grandmother and pretty much anxiety and
panic attacks and your bones and organs
slowly kind of deteriorate I don't
totally understand it all up when she's
had time to explain it to me but they've
been to so many doctors the past two
years and none of them know what it what
it is and then finally they found
someone and they knew hey this is
Cushing's I'm like what the heck is
cushions and I've learned a little bit
about it they
they my sister's married and they have a
two-year-old daughter
I I made a GoFundMe page to write it up
all the details if you'd like to know I
just want you guys to know I never
wanted to make a video like this and
we've been trying to keep it taken care
of for a long time obviously her husband
especially he's had it pretty hard for
the past two years managing a full-time
job and he's had to manage a lot because
she's not capable of it with a daughter
as well little tiny one so I'm asking
you if you want you could go to the
GoFundMe page read it if you want donate
if you want you don't have to you guys
you owe me nothing okay I don't think
the world owes me anything I have
donated to GoFundMe pages just to let
you know that's a hard site to be on
because when you especially when you see
children it kills me and some of you may
think well dream aren't you a rich man
no and it's explained in the what do you
call it
GoFundMe page what I can offer all I
have to offer this point is if any of
you follow my facebook you know I was
let go from my job with another
co-worker kind of kind of a bummer but
I'll recover like Bob Marley said money
doesn't buy life and he's right but in a
sense money pays for these ridiculous
doctors if I didn't mention it her
husband Dan has insurance
he's also software developer I've
mentioned him a few times or good
buddies their daughter her name is Ellie
she's a sweet girl my sister's name is
Justine I just want to make it very
clear that you guys owe me nothing and
all I ask is that if you want just leave
a nice comment in the video just it
would mean a lot to her because this is
a very hard thing and there's also a
recovery phase they're going to go
through it no matter if they make enough
or not and I've offered that if
financially they have even more troubles
they can live here you know to get back
on their feet
I'm doing this for my sister not for
myself you know she's my younger sister
you know I think any of us would do what
we can but it's now to the point where
they can't find the tumors they're
little tiny tumors that let out cortisol
and cause all these problems and they're
usually a tumor on the adrenaline or
gland or pull the tear gland I don't
know where those are located I'm not a
doctor so you know hey you can pray in
secret if you want and say nothing
you know I'm just a guy like you I know
anyone that watches this yeah maybe it
looks like it's totally off topic I
don't really care you know I'll probably
make this video private after a while I
just wanted to reach out and do all that
I knew to do to help and so you know any
donation goes 100 percent towards them
I'm not keeping anything
this has nothing to do with me really
and I understand you guys not not
everyone has resources people have
struggles and stuff and life gets hard
sometimes and like Les Brown says you do
what you can with what you have and
never be satisfied
so um I I do I do want to thank all my
YouTube viewers and you guys I make make
the videos over the years because I
enjoy it and I even think some of the
trolls are funny but I prefer no trolls
on this video because it's it's not a
it's not a joke so
I don't know really what else to say you
know I know fur I'm I'm almost pretty
sure there's some of you out there that
probably have some issues to maybe with
health and or someone in your family you
know and you I not be able to have a lot
of connections and I'm very sorry for
that if that's the case but the GoFundMe
seems to work best on Facebook if you're
in that situation in the emergency words
you guys should check it out if you have
some issues yourself and I think that
kind of summarizes it and thanks thanks
to throat for watching you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
