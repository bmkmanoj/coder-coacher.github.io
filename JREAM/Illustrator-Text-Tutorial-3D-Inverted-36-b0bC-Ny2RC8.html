asked how I could make this text appear
like it's in the ground so I'll just go
ahead and do that I'll go to affect3d
rotate and let me preview this so I'm
going to make it look like it's on the
ground possibly give it a little
perspective and I suppose that's good
enough okay and i will go to object
expand appearance okay and this little
border around the text I don't want that
there I'm going to select the white
arrow and just make sure i'm selecting
that and delete all that okay next I'm
going to double click to go into this
group select all these and hold ctrl
shift and press G which is ungroup
control shift G press that a whole bunch
and at some point we should be able to
break this apart hmm it doesn't want to
break there we go so just monkey around
with that and next I'll just create a
bunch of shapes and these are going to
be the backgrounds for each letter and
we're going to create a clipping mask
and I'll make these a gradient color and
it will go from light to dark the dark
like that and you just want to make sure
these will cover up each letter so
there's four squares and I think I'll
shrink them down a little bit okay and
arrange send to back okay and now i'm
going to select this one the first
square and the letter T right click make
a clipping mask and I'll do that for
each letter
okay next we're going to draw the part
that makes it look like it's in the
ground so i'll double-click the t to get
into this object you see when i hover
this is square gets in the way i'm going
to press ctrl too and it locks it okay
if you need to unlock it just press ctrl
alt too so that i don't actually
accidentally click it and stuff so with
my pen tool i'm going to go about at
this point and drag all the way down
here and just kind of create a shading
in there and we'll do it with this point
and you've got to kind of know your
points where they're gonna dip down if I
did it over here it probably won't look
correct because this isn't really a
point where it's going to be shaded so
some basic artiste skills might be
needed here okay so it looks like this
goes down into the ground if we zoom out
you see how that looks like it's going
into the ground I might not have the
shade incorrect you should be able to
repeat this with every shape I'll go
ahead and lock this with control to do
my little arrow piece
and it'll probably get trickier on some
letters you'll have to actually sit down
and think about the best way to go about
that like this e it looks like we might
actually have to have something coming
down on these sides as well and perhaps
right about here
let me whoops
so the e doesn't look perfect i'm not
exactly sure the best places to put the
little fade things but that's a general
idea i hope that helped and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
