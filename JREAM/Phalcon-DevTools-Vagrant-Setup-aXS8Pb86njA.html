Linux with whatever operating system we
want and we're gonna do that with
vagrant now whether you're familiar with
vagrant or not it's not a big deal
because it's not that difficult to get
started we're not going to be using
puppet provisioning and that's a whole
nother talking itself but what you're
gonna need is to download vagrant it's
about a hundred Meg's it's for any OS I
might be using one for one or one for
two
that shouldn't matter much and then
you're going to need a VirtualBox and
you can just download this guy it's for
every OS and both are free so I have my
VirtualBox here just disregard this
machine here what we're gonna do is
create a base vagrant box and if I go to
the getting started page this is what
we're gonna do and precise 32 is an
Ubuntu instance 32-bit and the reason I
want to use 32-bit is because it will be
most compatible with people and what I
mean is if you're using a 64-bit
processor an AMD 64 or an Intel 64 bit
sometimes you don't have virtualization
in Abel and you have to go into your
BIOS on the computer and enable that I
believe it's a VTX and amd-v or
something for both chips and sometimes
they're not enabled so sometimes 32-bit
will just reduce the hassle okay so I
have a console here I just made a C
Drive playground and what I'm gonna do
is just copy this you obviously make
sure vagrants installed and I'll paste
this guy in here and it's most likely
that you're gonna have to download a
file once you do vagrant up so I'll just
say vagrant up and if I open up this guy
here we can just kind of wait and it's
really making a machine in the
background and to help you out up there
it goes
the computer I'm on right now is my host
machine okay and then this guy running
here is called the guest machine all
right I believe I already do have
precise 32 on my system I've used it in
other places so I don't have to download
it it might take you a little bit but
it's worth the wait once you get it you
know a downloads a whole operating
system so I'll shrink that guy you can
just see what's going on inside here -
it's a little preview window I'll shrink
that guy down and I'm gonna open sublime
text let me clear out a lot of this
confusion while that's running
so I'm going to open the folder of C
Drive playground and I don't have a
vagrant file yet I might have to do a
vagrant command still
once you get to the message that says
mounting shared folders that means it's
pretty much almost done unless you have
some provisioning going on okay so I
have this installed some of these
warnings like system drivers you don't
have to worry about okay let me just
type vagrant in it okay it already
exists let's see where I am C Drive
playground wonder why it's not showing
up I'm gonna open the folder inside of
here see if that helps playground there
it is I don't know why it wasn't showing
up so it created this vagrant file and
this is in Ruby so I'll just go view
syntax and at the very top you can't see
on my screen it says open all extensions
with and I'm gonna do Ruby there then
it's nice and highlighted so here's the
box and then here's the URL and we have
our little vagrant file and what we're
going to want to do is open up either a
port or an IP so the first thing I'm
going to do is open an IP here I'm going
to change this to 192 168 7.0 and we'll
be able to access this once we install
Apache and all that good stuff let me
scroll down okay our synched folders
let's go ahead and do that so with our
sync folders if I go like this vagrant
SSH I'm inside a vagrant now and just so
you know the root password is vagrant
for this box I don't know if I can sue
as that guy but he has sudo power
so what we're gonna do is sync up a
folder I'll delete these two lines and
I'm gonna do it as W W actually I
actually have a line that I copied I'll
provide you with this file here
okay now config vm sync folder i only do
this line here because of windows but
we're gonna create a w w folder and in
the shell will go to vagrant /ww and
these mount options are just permissions
okay and the group W W data will be the
Apache server okay and dota2 okay
we're also going to forward one more
port well we only really need to forward
one port so I'll delete this and the
guests will be six three seven nine this
is for Redis like that okay we can
connect to my sequel through this IP and
all that okay so we just configured some
options I'll go ahead and delete a lot
of these lines so it's readable and I'll
make sure to include this for your
convenience because a lot of stuff in
here okay and then there's a lot of
stuff down here about provision and I'm
just going to delete it all because
we're not going to do that and it's a
pretty small configuration file in Ruby
and sorry I can't help that it's Ruby so
what I'll do is just exit SSH okay and
I'm gonna do vagrant reload and I'll
shoot I don't have a WW folder so make
there ww
let's try again vagrant reload
there goes
and basically this is just gonna give us
a couple more options
now if you do have problems this guest
additions guy sometimes you have to do a
vagrant plug and install such as vagrant
plugin installed guest additions or
vagrant windows is one of them if you're
on Windows if you have problems
so let's SSH into they we have to do
vagrant SSH and what we'll do is a sudo
apt-get update and what we're going to
use is PPA of a guy who's already built
PHP 5 for us to make it easier make sure
we get the latest and greatest so we'll
do another sudo apt-get install how does
force yes and we need python software
properties and i'm going to include all
this for you so don't panic you'll have
a list to go through if you want to set
it up identical and then i'll say sudo
apt whoops add apt repository PPA under
edge slash PHP 5 so we're adding a
repository with PPA
oh and D are each a PHP 5 and that
should add the key it says hit enter so
I want to add that okay and we'll do
another update make sure we get him in
the list ok and now we're just gonna do
a big build so I'm going to say sudo
apt-get install PHP 5 we need PHP 5 dev
to compile some Falken stuff Apache to
live Apache to my PHP 5 that just plugs
it into Apache my sequel server does
you'll obviously probably want that PHP
5 my sequel so that we can tie it in and
we're going to want curl
get core each top nice little utility
and why not throw in the Redis server
okay and yes okay it looks like this is
setup so what we can do is open the
Falcon PHP guy up let's bring them over
here and download very easy to do this
you see we got all our stuff we need
here it already comes with the build
utilities and I'm just going to copy all
this code to compile Falcon and Linux
and edit paste and the last command
didn't get called usually I can just hit
enter when I do a paste like that at the
end it's just gonna close and close it
okay and install okay Falcon is on our
system and what we want to do is just
add the I and I so let's add a PHP mod
sudo VI et Cie PHP 5 mods available
Falcon da I and I press the letter A and
extension equals Falcon dot s o escape :
WQ ok and there we go and I'll just say
pseudo peace B 5 enable mod of Falcon ok
and let's test this out let's see
service Apache to restart and let's do
sudo service Apache to restart ok and we
should be able to go to one - oops 1 9 -
1 6 8 7.0 and you should get this and
this is our virtual machine running and
this is what we'll be using
so let's polish this off and make sure
we get
poseur right now I'm in some crazy
directory so I can just remove or move
force of see Falcon because that's
already installed
I always forget to type sudo okay this
guy this is the command I'm using and
I'll say sudo boom
so that's downloading that I'm going to
take this command copy it so I only have
to type composer I don't have to type
all this out okay so I should be able to
type composer and that has all my good
composer stuff okay make sure we're in
our root directory okay and let's just
do I'll use nano this time probably more
people familiar with it
nano composer Jason there it is
this is what we want the Falcon dev
tools require Falcon dev tools dev
master and I'll go ahead and go to my
guy here and just what's boom ctrl X yes
safe and I'll do composer install and
this is going to install the dev tools
okay now if I list let's list this out I
don't like this junk sitting here so I'm
just going to remove composer Jason and
composer dot lock and I'm gonna make a
directory called Falcon tools CD and a
vendor CD into Falcon CD into dev tools
and all this stuff in here is what I
want so I'm going to move everything to
Falcon tools and then I'll go back down
here and I'm just going to remove
vendor okay so now I'll just go in to
create assembling so I'll say sudo link
symbolic of the root directory
Falcon Tools Falcon dot php' into user
bin Falcon okay so I should be able to
type Falcon now and we have our dev
tools set up and let me just also check
I'm gonna type H top slash Redis and
Redis is running excellent let's just
try Redis server sorry
I mean Redis CLI say ping-pong good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
