explain an encapsulation and
encapsulation it's just when you hide
stuff in your objects from the public
where the public would be considered
outside of the object so the reason to
do encapsulation is so that let's say
you made a game engine and people want
to work with your framework you don't
want them to mess up things to like
break patterns and algorithms and things
and encapsulation is like making your
variables or methods private and
protected so for example let's say we
just have this where we have a set name
feature and a get name feature and we're
going to make the name property private
and we'll just say new test test set
name Jesse and then let's do a test
get name and let's echo that out and
here we have it working and everything
now encapsulation can be good because
what happens if you set on test name
equals Jesse
it won't work and you can't access the
private property now you might think
well why does that even matter let's
make this public and I'll just do test
name equals two two two you see it gives
us a different name this matters because
if you want people to work within a
structure of how your code works this
could totally interrupt and break your
program if they're doing things that
aren't according to your software
structure if that makes sense
I hope it does so encapsulation is a
kind of summed up in that way there's
probably a few other explanations that
might be better but I hope that
a decent idea thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
