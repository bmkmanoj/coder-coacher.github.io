tutorial i made a new document i'm going
to zoom in with control all zero to a
hundred percent and just make a new
layer and you can hold down the shape
button and you'll get a bunch of shapes
or you could just click it and you'll
have shapes up at the top and i'm going
to use this rounded rectangle and have
my radius set at 15 and what you'll have
probably if you didn't change any
settings you'll have it on this setting
with shape layers and you'll make
something it'll have this outline now
it's not really going to have that
outline when you save it like for the
web i actually never use this feature so
i'm just going to delete that and make
my new layer again and select this one
to fill the pixels so when you make a
shape it fills it in and it acts like
what you would think it should act like
so i'm just going to make my little
rectangle here with a nice little color
and then i'm going to select my text and
the text color i'm just going to be a
little darker so i'll go to be for
brightness and i'll say forty two
percent that'll be good and just try
something like dear diary I had a good
day I hope you get a good also today
maybe we can hang out in chill I'm love
Jessie okay whoops okay so we've got
some text on top of some diary stuff I'm
just going to make this look a little
prettier and surprisingly gradients
usually make things look really pretty
obviously not like that but you can go
through the blend mode so let's go
through a few of these and see what
looks kind of good that's a little bit
like a sunset that's pretty cool
actually I'm going to keep that one
whoops or was it color burn okay and the
gradient direction you can change that
if you want and then the gradient type
and yadda yadda yadda what do we want
here I liked how it was that'll be good
and bevel emboss just kind of makes
things look cool sometimes around the
edges let's see that's a little so yeah
you know this is what you'll do you'll
just play around stuff quite a bit I
don't know if anyone has this down to a
science color overlay pattern overlay
and the stroke alright that's good i
guess i'm going to change this text to
white all right and for the text i think
it'll be a little more readable with a
drop shadow so drop shadow and the
opacity a little fatter there we go and
then we have a beautiful piece of art
here obviously it take time to figure
out what would look the best but you can
select this tool it's the crop tool and
we're just going to kind of select here
it might snap to the edges you want to
be careful with your Styles because you
see it's going over the border so
sometimes you gotta do this manually
okay alright that's good enough and then
click just click the little arrow tool
crop and we have an image here and if
you went to file save for web and
devices you could save it as a gift for
jpg if you wanted a transparent
background this is one thing you'll want
to remember is you need to hide the back
ground and you'll see these checkers
here k by the way I'm holding ctrl alt
shift and pressing the letter S or the
shortcut is right here that's when
you'll probably want to get used to if
you're saving a lot of stuff for the web
and for a transparent background you can
do gift but I should let you know that
Corner's if you look very closely these
corners are not going to look good on
any background because a less white
because these are it can only have one
color of transparency but it's like PNG
24 it creates all these little pixels
for transparency see these are partly
transparent however the size does get a
lot larger and you know when you're
producing things for the web you usually
want them a pretty small size because
when so unloads the page you could lose
traffic with too much stuff being
required and then there's PNG eight I
don't ever use this but and you would
just save it for the web let me hit
cancel and there you have it we made a
simple picture thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
