about the smarty template engine and
getting started the first thing I want
to do is download smarty and unzip it I
just put mine here and we go in this
directory really what you want is the
libs folder right here I'm just going to
leave it as the default for now so you
have that and then just make an index
dot PHP page and to get started the
first thing you want to do is require
the smarty library okay the next thing
you want to do is can figure a few
things after we create the object the
first thing we're going to do is set the
template directory this is where your
TPL files go I'm going to call mine
views mm-hmm and then the compiler where
your cached files go I'll just call mine
temp and then you're going to want to
create these directories okay the next
thing we're going to do is since we're
an index.php or going to render the page
okay and we have to create an index TPL
file inside the views folder what
okay and if we load up our web browser
and there it is it loads the hello page
next if we want to assign some variables
inside of the template you could use a
MySQL connection to fetch an array but
I'm just going to make a temporary array
okay there's just some name and ages and
to pop that into the template you just
do smarty assign and the name we want to
assign it I'll just do people and array
so to use this array inside of the
template I work with people the syntax
is a little bit different but since this
is assigned you can do people and you
should get an array if you want to loop
through that you do something like
forage from people as whoops item equals
P and then you just do P there's the
ages if you want to get the key you just
do key equals K I usually in regular PHP
usually do key before the value
you so I'm just going to put that over
here and there we have all the ages some
other things you could do is let's say
this was on a table and we want this in
every row whoops okay so this is a table
you can do cool things to cycle values
for example if we had a style and we did
a background and let's just say gray
okay but if we want to cycle different
values we could do something like this
cycle values equals silver and gray X
and it cycles it out for you a good
reason to use this is because if you had
a whole bunch of data inside of your
pages you can separate the server-side
logic from the display logic and that
makes it extremely easy and clean to do
things you can also do standard PHP code
inside of the template engine and just
echo one
hmmm sha1 hello that's pretty cool I
don't use that often though probably
what you'd want to do when setting up a
template engine is create a header file
and copy this okay
and save this as header dot PHP and then
we just require once a header dot PHP so
that would be at the top of every page
and let's say we have a date return from
MySQL and the way my SKU L displays it
is like 2010 1010 and we want to assign
that to date okay their state it has a
lot of modifiers so you could just say :
or sorry
it's the pipe to do a modifier so you do
date format and their formats it there's
quite a bit of date for matters in here
also you just put a semicolon I don't
know any off the top of my head let's
see if that does anything nope I don't
think smarty should be used in small
applications it's not really necessary
but in large applications it's really
good if you're in on whether using a
large framework like Zender CakePHP or
CodeIgniter I think using smarty with
just flat files is a good alternative
because it's not too large but it's
still really organized with some useful
things there's a ton of things you can
do in
like let's say let me make a string and
assign it okay so I have a name and that
just displays Jessie there you can do
stuff like string replace : and I want
to replace s with um J and I'm not sure
why that happened but anyway so that's
just a quick overview of smarty all your
files will be cached in the temp
directory all right that's just a quick
overview and installation if you play
with it for a while you'll start to
realize how handy it is and how much
cleaner your code becomes alright have
fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
