some freelancing tips I'm going to cover
four topics warning run know your value
estimating time and wise choices and
freelancing is a tough way to live
unless you're really good at it so I
used to freelance for about five years
and I was semi successful in it but I
don't make as much as I do working
full-time so let's start out with the
first topic warning run so things you
should run on run away from our favors
sometimes you'll get someone that just
wants a favor and feel like you'll build
some good reputation with them the
problem is this can lead to scope creep
or they'll think that you'll do more
favours in the future and it's always
for free and you know your time is
valuable so you shouldn't just keep
giving things away for free no matter
how desperate you are the second one is
promise for equity I used to see these a
lot especially on Craigslist which is
someone says hey if you build this
project you'll get 20% in our company
when we make money I have this great
idea this is probably one of the worst
things you can do because you're gonna
be investing all this time your free
time into something that's not even
guaranteed to pay out and I've seen a
lot of people not get anything from it
because it's not an original idea to me
it's kind of like someone saying hey I
have a really unique plan to build a
house you come spend all the time and
build the house and once we sell it I'll
give you a cut well you could just build
something all by yourself without them
there so there's really no point in
doing this unless the person has money
to pay you for the work you're doing
another thing is competitions there's a
lot of competition sites now this is
good and bad
good is that you can win like let's say
it's a logo competition you're building
your portfolio which is good so you can
have something to show over time because
you keep trying to win and have a
variety of graphics if it were a graphic
site the downside is you're wasting a
lot of time for a little bit of money
most competitions are less than a
thousand dollars and for graphics
anyways and to me it's not worth it
another one will be bidding sites
there's a lot of these one is oDesk and
I don't mean to bash oDesk but their
prices are way too cheap you'll never be
able to survive off that unless you live
in a very low income country I'm from
America and an American on oDesk it's a
pretty tough way to survive so I'd watch
out for that especially because you have
a lot of competition and what you're
going to get our a bunch of under bids
and you know the person is usually
looking to save money if they result to
go into a bidding site so it could mean
it's gonna be a lot less quality or
people just start trying to make a quick
buck and that's not the best idea next
let's talk about know your value know
your value so what is your time worth
you should have a good estimate and for
example let's say you've been
programming PHP for three years if
you're charging ten dollars an hour and
you live in the United States you do not
have a good estimate of what your time
is worth if you can write PHP and build
a whole website for 10 dollars an hour
you're selling yourself way too short
the next question would be can you
survive can you survive off what you're
making while you're freelancing once in
a while you'll get a good project and it
might go perfect but not every projects
really like that
and it's kind of a gamble you know you
gotta keep keep the cash flow coming in
which is difficult when you're
freelancing so you have to know your
time what it's worth in order to say hey
can I survive off this if I don't get
any work for the next month or two and
the last thing is what's your niche and
the reason I bring this up is because
there's some freelancers that try to
encompass everything as in I'm a graphic
designer
I write back-end code and front-end code
I do copywriting I do SEO so that's very
unattractive to a potential client
unless you're like a company because
that's a lot of stuff for one person to
do so my best suggestion is if you're
gonna build a website you could be maybe
the wordpress guru you could be the
backend system administrator or just as
a total graphics guy but encompassing
all of them is a very difficult thing
unless you're really confident about it
and you have a good way of presenting
different packages that's probably the
only way to do it okay the next one is
wise choices freelancing is very tough
because of the uncertainty and you have
to be good at getting clients the best
way to get clients is networking
I would suggest LinkedIn and when you
get a couple of clients most of your
clients will come through word-of-mouth
believe me word of mouth is the best way
to get clients it's been true for me
every single time someone refers you
they refer you they refer you everybody
knows somebody that needs something and
you shouldn't really depend on just a
nice-looking website to draw in all your
clients one trick that I did was I'd
start with a client and I had
then pay a little less than what I
normally charge so you know they're
getting a kind of a good deal and only
do this once or twice and with that what
you can do is you now have someone that
will give you a very good reference and
you can put it on your site or have a
nice portfolio piece if you don't have
any and you can use that as leverage to
get more clients and then that person
will refer you to other people
obviously keep it between you and the
client that hey this isn't what I
normally charge but I'm just doing this
in this one case okay
another thing is portfolio building you
can actually get a pretty good portfolio
by freelancing and what I mean by that
is you're gonna be doing a lot of work
you know who knows what you'll be doing
you'll be able to have a nice portfolio
that would actually give you a good foot
in the door in a job if you wanted to
work someplace full-time so freelancing
for me was a stepping stone to get into
the work world so it's it could be a
good stepping stone for you
lastly is the work advantages working
for somebody full-time in my opinion is
a lot easier
meaning you don't worry about all your
bills collecting money creating scopes
and then doing all the work
I mean freelancing is a lot of work to
manage so the benefit of work is that
you get benefits in most places
you often get paid a better salary or
hourly payment and work experience is
really good on a resume and last of all
most importantly we all might be
introverts that want to work from home
but I always had trouble working with
people and their personalities but I
learned so much from just working with
other people just talking to people and
getting help on little things when
you're stuck it's a rapid learning
opportunity that's one huge benefit to
being in the office
I'll finish this video out with one last
story when I was pretty new probably in
my early 20s I started freelancing and I
was working for this company
and I was only making 10 bucks an hour
and it was only for some very basic CSS
and HTML work a little bit of Photoshop
work and I was getting paid about a
couple hundred a week which I thought
was decent for the time however they
promised me equity in the company so
how's it go cool so based on the sales
they get each week I'd get a cut and I
ended up getting you know I think it was
about 20% because we were a team of
three or four guys and that week that he
didn't sell that much I got a check for
about $60 now I spent a full week of 40
hours working and I got a $60 check so
do you think I stayed at that job nope
I quit the same day because $60 for a
full week of work I could work at
Wendy's or McDonald's and make more than
that and I'm doing something that you
know not everyone knows how to do per se
so what you're doing is valuable not
everybody wants to be a programmer a
graphic designer and not everyone's good
at it so you have a skill that people
need so don't sell yourself too short
I've made that mistake a thousand times
and don't get taken advantage of
even if you're young so that about sums
it up guys I hope this helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
