minding litecoins and before we get
started let me just warn you if you're
young or if you live in an apartment or
with somebody I would not suggest doing
this because the electricity can really
add up I myself don't seriously mine any
coins I just do it for fun once in a
while and you'll see I haven't made much
progress but it is a huge energy
consumption so this site amount here is
Bitcoin wisdom and I just wanted to show
you the price of it going up and down it
fluctuates a lot this is in 15 minutes
though if I go to one week look at this
graph I just went all the way up to
12:42 now I'm not sure where it is now
it should be around six to seven hundred
I believe but anyways Bitcoin the guys
that got in early you know they made
like a 2,000 percent return on whatever
they paid in electricity so it's just
kind of fun to know about this stuff so
I'll go ahead and close this and I'm
going to talk about litecoin litecoin is
the second most popular after Bitcoin
and you can mine it and when you mine it
it's best to do it with a tool with a
pool because you'll get a lot better
results basically for example on my
account I'm contributing for kilo hashes
which is next to nothing
I was just turned it on my laptop and
with the pool all together all the
people trying to crack these algorithms
based on what you contribute your share
rate you get so much balance and you end
up getting a lot more and cracking a lot
more blocks then you would just on your
own so I suggest if you do want to mine
like coins do a pool and one thing to
look out for is the difficulty
I thought they listed the difficulty
here no okay so basically to get started
you can do it two ways you have a CPU
and a GPU
okay GPUs your graphics card if you have
one you should or it's built into your
CPU possibly and then there's your CPU
so I'm using LTC rabbit they take I
think four point five percent share of
what you cracked I don't really care
because it's so easy to get started so
I'll just go to my account and my
workers and I have a couple of workers
here it doesn't really matter what your
password is because if somebody's going
to hash on your behalf it doesn't really
matter so I'm on my desktop right now so
I just made one for that and what I'm
going to do is get that guy going and if
you scroll down a little bit they have
this thing says read our full tutorial
and down a little bit and here's the
first one for AMD graphics card it's
called C G minor and AMD graphic cards
do get the best results and CUDA minor
which is what I'm using because I happen
to have an Nvidia card that's all these
two are for GPUs and then CPU minor is
for a CPU now if you have a AMD graphics
card depending on which one you're going
to get the best results because it's the
best it processing all this crazy code
but besides that I just downloaded these
two you would download whatever you want
or you could just download one if you
run on one of them so I'll go to my
downloads folder I'm going to start with
the CPU minor and I have a 32-bit bat
and a 64-bit bat file and if I right
click and edit this you might get a if
you're on Windows 8 you'll get a warning
you have to click more info to open it
and basically this just runs my nerdy
Exe and if you download it from the
rabbit site it automatically puts in the
place to mine from otherwise you could
just put it in yourself and then user
pass mine was this with a 1 and what
we're going to do is just start mining
so I'll double click this guy and the
CPU get started pretty quick and I have
a 6 core so it's doing about 5 on each
core comes about 31 kilo hashes and
that's really not a whole lot but you
know you can leave this running and it
does pretty cool and you'll notice that
update on the site eventually what
you're contributing it's pretty much
just going to keep repeating this over
and over okay so with a AMD FX processor
I get about that I'm running my CPU at
90% like I said I'm not serious about
mining I just do it for fun once in a
while while I'm sitting here this
doesn't really slow down my computer
either but the GPU that one's that one's
a intense one so the CUDA miner
pretty much the same thing you have your
little URL here and then your username
and your worker
and your password I don't want to run
both under s1 so let me just create a
worker and I'm going to create a new one
is called this desktop GPU with one is
the password okay
so then I'll go ahead and add this guy
on and I'll call him desktop GPU ok now
I don't know what's going to happen when
I run this because I'm recording a video
and this goes crazy Oh
you help everything pretty much crashed
on me Ike I can't record a video with
this you see I have a g-force gt5 20
come on let's see if it runs
okay it's auto-tuning with the graphics
card this I think it uses a lot more CPU
sorry not CPU a wattage for power and it
can heat up a lot more so this really is
underperforming for a GPU you're seeing
1012 Killah hashes very very low I'm
going to close that because it's just
going to drain my life
so if I go to the home page here you see
it looks like for some reason it's only
19
it'll probably update a little bit more
and here's my balance and this took a
really long time to get I mean to get
one actual litecoin takes a long time if
they're selling for like 24 to 32
dollars per light coin the money I spend
in electricity won't be worth it even
with a mining pool if you did decide to
do it you'd have to think of it as an
investment for the future just like
Bitcoin if I open up my little hardware
monitor I downloaded this guy it's kind
of useful to detect what the heck's
going on with your computer if it
decides to open there it is and you can
get kind of the down and dirty details
about how much stuff is running here's
my CPUs they're running it 3,000
megahertz the temperature is pretty
important to keep a load on to keep an
eye on sorry here's the load a hundred
percent you see a hundred per second CPU
running all day and just imagine your
GPU - this thing's going to drain like a
during your power bill bad
then here's the GeForce GT anyways it's
a kind of fun to do but you don't have
to use LTC rabbit if you don't want I
just happen to like it because it was
easier to use there's a lot of other
pools but if you want to mind light
coins for some reason in your free time
you're bored that's kind of how you get
started also if you decide to use Amazon
Web Services or something with some of
them off or graphics cards they tend to
be nvidia tegra cards so they're not
going to be the fastest but some of them
have like 32 virtual cores it's not
worth the money for how much you have to
pay for Amazon Web Services at this
point they up the price because people
were using them heavily if you look
online also for Radeon 78 50s and 70s
70s if I have that correct they're
pretty hard to find out because there's
some of the best and most affordable
mining cards ok well have fun guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
