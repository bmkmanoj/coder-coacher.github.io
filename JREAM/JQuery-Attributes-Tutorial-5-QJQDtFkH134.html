we'll just touch on attributes and what
an attribute is or attribute I'm not
sure how you say it just gets inset
stuff in the Dom let's make an example
so Ana proves tutorial we messed with a
selectors let's just do a class and say
we're gonna select happy so let's give
this a class of happy and the action is
this we'll use an attribute let's say
dot HTML okay we want to grab the HTML
inside of happy and HTML would be the
attribute and how we want to display
that let's just alert it so let's do
alert happy that HTML it's pretty
confusing looking in it so refresh and
you should get something like this you
could also work with input areas I think
we showed that briefly before so input
value equals hey type equals text so if
we refresh that we have that value in
there what if we wanted to get the value
of that we'd say input dot Val like that
I'm just going to delete my other input
so that we don't have a little problem
and let's alert that alert input dot Val
and it outputs hey the same thing you
can check if something has a class or
doesn't there's really a lot to this and
I think it'll be easiest if we just kind
of make some
examples and one more thing how to set a
variable rather than a wrapping alert
around this whole thing you could say
Val equals and that would be a
legitimate variable or you could put a
dollar sign before it if you want it's
up to you how you like it I'm just gonna
leave mine like that and I would say
alert Val and since it's a variable you
don't put quotes in here and then we
refresh and it displays the same thing I
think yeah that's just kind of a basic
overview of the attributes and thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
