will do a little bit on scope and make a
simple little calculator so let's make a
new class and call it calc and the first
thing I'll do is make a variable called
public input public input two and public
output so let's create a function and
call it set input and we're going to
take a value from here let me just make
this so you can follow along easier so
let's say new calc and let's say calc
equals new calc and we'll say calc set
input 5 ok so we're going to take a
value up here and say in and we'll say
this input equals int I'm just
typecasting here we'll do another one
for set input 2 and we'll call the set
input
- so calc set input 2 so we set both of
these and let's get the final output of
multiplication and let's just call this
sum get result and we'll do return this
output well we got to do the math first
this input has to be - ok this input
times this input - and we want this
output to equal this input times this
output - and that should do good
so we'll do calc get results and we want
to echo that out since it returns it and
we'll get 110 so that works now let me
break this up just one more time I'll
just do this function calculate so that
we calculate inside of a different
method and we'll do calc calc you late
okay
and get result okay
same thing now there's almost no reason
to use this get results because we can
say calc
input and we can already echo that out
there's five and we can echo calc output
and I forgot to echo it we have a
hundred ten and an even bigger problem
as you could say calc output equals 200
and say let's echo it out see and this
could cause some monkey business so what
would you do to protect the output you
would make it either protected or you'd
make it private the reason you use
protected is for classes that extend
this but for this example I'm going to
make it private so then we can't fetch
or change the output let's see what
happens fatal acts fatal error can
access the private property because we
don't want people to jam it up and that
kind of keeps it safe and we don't get
confused where things are changed
throughout a system and everything just
works one way and we can easily track
down what's going on
so scope if you did protected input - we
still get the error input - can't access
protected property and what protected
does is let's say we have another class
called test and let's have it not do
anything extends calc so when it's
protected it means this can be molded
renamed and grabbed in child classes and
private means that it can only be messed
with inside of this class itself and
public means you can use it anywhere as
long as the object is created like here
now you should notice that you can also
do SEPs more instances of Calca like new
calc and let me just get that back you
could copy all this and say call it calc
- and this is a totally different
instance of the object and we still have
that little error there let me make this
public okay so you can have more than
one instance of an object and you can
reuse with little lines of code just
tons of stuff inside one object over and
over alright so hopefully that gives you
a little idea how objects work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
