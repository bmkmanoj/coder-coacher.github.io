tutorial on how you can list a directory
contents in PHP a very very simple way
so what I have is just an index file I
open this and it's just blank right now
and I have an upload folder with a bunch
of random stuff I put in here we have
text files JPEGs mp3s and PNG s there
are other ways you can do this but today
we're going to be using glob
because it makes it very easy so what
I'll do is I'll just make a variable
named derp and they'll say glob and I'm
going to plat past the glob function and
in here we pass the directory name
uploads and then we have to pass a
expression of what we want to select
it's not like a regular expression so
don't get scared first let me echo out a
plea so that we'll be able to read this
okay so I'll refresh and uploads and
it's like hey it's not selecting
anything I look in here and obviously
there's stuff here what we have to do is
tell it what type of file to select so I
could say f5 txd refresh and it selects
it what about a file that doesn't exist
it won't select it so that's pretty cool
if I wanted to select all the files I
could do asterisk txt and it selects all
of these beautiful and how about if I
were to select the JPEGs pretty good now
a problem you might run into is you
might have a folder and you have
different image types if you look at
this one it's a PNG file this one's a
jpg and if you wanted to select all the
images rather than doing to glob
commands like that'd be ridiculous
if we were to do this refresh that's not
necessary and then you'd have to merge
the two arrays and so on what you can do
is you can pass a constant in here and
we call this a glob brace and what we do
for this little expression here we put
little braces here then we add another
extension so I'll do star dot PNG save
and refresh and what do you know that's
right here so that's a pretty simple way
to list files inside the directory now I
should warn you if you put a space here
after the comma it will break it
see how that's not listing because this
is actually being read like space
asterisks but you want asterisks and of
course asterisks means all so quick
short tutorial and I hope you guys found
it handy thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
