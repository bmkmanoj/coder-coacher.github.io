with laravel on and off for about two
months and I really love it I don't feel
like I'm good enough at it to actually
make any video series but I'm going to
talk about one of the things that's been
giving me a lot of hiccups and I feel
like I'm finally getting somewhere and
it's probably laughable because it has
to do with the routes so I will say this
little play project here is just a local
project I threw in bootstrap 3 and made
just a couple of views and controllers
playing with the blade template and I
tied in cartilage century to not a
hundred percent yet and basically what
this is it's just a really nice user
authentication system with a bunch of
stuff to save you a lot of time I
decided to try it out because a French
man at work is using it and I really
like it beside that where my trouble is
when i get two routes creating forms and
stuff i want to do it so that i can use
named routes so I open up my contents
here and here on my homepage you see
there's a link to logon and I'm using
URL to login and what this does is it
creates an actual URL based on my whole
site so I'll put test test after it and
let me go to the homepage and if i hover
over this and click it it goes to slash
test test and i don't want that i want
named rouse and by that i mean i can
just type in login and if i decide to
change the url it'll listen so it took
me a while to figure out what how to go
about this so routes and here's my
controller route
and to use this i'm going to add an
array at the end of this and i'm going
to say as login okay now in my blade
template I'm getting confused with these
guys quite a bit but there are also
helper functions like route to logon and
I actually don't know if this is going
to work so i'll refresh and unable to
generate URL for the name drought log in
such a route does not exist I've been
getting this a lot and if I go back to
my routes it makes me wonder if I have
something wrong here so what I'm going
to attempt to do is cut that out and
right here i'll say uses
the login controller ok and I'll refresh
and let's see I made a constant forgot a
comma refresh and a rate to string
conversion so something's in the wrong
place still so it's a little different
for that one right so I'll put that guy
back now here I'll jump back to the
controller here I can actually do that
so I'll say uses home controller get
index as home and boom ok now let's just
disregard this guy right now for the
moment and I'm going to make a route to
home okay so I'll say
route to home and our refresh oops me go
here and if I hover over here it does
create the name drought so that's pretty
easy to do this I just have to pop in
uses as far as I understand but for a
controller I believe it might just be
doing it automatically I don't know so I
looked through the forms and found that
we can do a little trick in here so site
PHP artisan routes let me make this
bigger and enter and this lists
everything I need so if I look here at
the gate logon that as it's not doing
anything so at the moment I don't know
how to do that if anyone knows in the
comments could you tell me for that I
don't see what exactly I'm doing wrong
because these guys down here work fine
okay so that that's questionable why it
doesn't work I don't know let me just
change this back to loggin
so what I have here is a group of routes
and basically all this does is what
happens before they hit the dashboard
user is it authenticates I won't go into
that because it's kind of at the start
of their documentation in routes but so
I'm going to head over to dashboard user
and this is a resource controller a
resource controller is pretty cool good
for creating and editing crud controller
pretty much so let me login whoops test
to test calm and it looks like it didn't
like it I'll just go to admin ok this
isn't a perfectly working system and
create so on my user create page I'll go
to my
so I'm using the user controller as user
ok and I'm going to go to the user
create page ok and you see how just
playing with this URL here i'm going to
say route I actually don't know the
route but I do from the artisan helper I
was stuck here because I kept trying to
do user dot index or user dot create but
it's prefixed with dashboard I believe
it's just putting a period for the
slashes almost like it's not respecting
my alias because it's a resource route
so i can do dot dash board user dot
index i believe and i'll refresh
and here we have it creating
successfully so I guess what I was stuck
on is I was trying to do just user dot
index and it's not respecting it because
I suppose if I change this to slash user
it would work but I might need to have a
dot before it okay controller method not
found
try like that refresh OOP
so these are throwing me off a little
bit before I save this file i'm just
going to rerun that command and see what
user see now its user dot index i guess
it does base it off of the route the
actual route but i don't know why my
alias isn't working so you know i would
try to put this like cut it out and say
uses like this oops
and refresh and I get the array to
string conversion because something is
in the wrong place this is supposed to
be a string at the second parameter but
is there a way to alias user without
using the actual route name that's one
thing that's really throwing me off so
that should work again okay and what I
also found is you can do URL route to
say home which is basically the same
thing as this okay
and I didn't really understand why both
of these work I know this is a helper
and this is a class but when I look
through the forms and stuff some things
show just route something show URL route
it'd be nice if it was a little clearer
on how it's worked but let me close with
this the resourceful controller is cool
because let me bring it on over here
I'll scroll down a little bit i can use
artisan to make a controller well you
can prevent certain things here but if
you just type PHP RS and control or make
a photo controller you can make a
resourceful controller and what it
provides you with is get post oh here it
is create save show edit update and
delete they just name them kind of
differently and they have different
methods to access them so it is a
time-saver just use the console to build
it I'll go ahead and create this guy
here and
it tastes photo controller and if i look
at it let's see what we get photo
control our index create store show at
it update destroy so that is a
resourceful controller yet when I look
at this and it says control or make it's
weird that it's making a resourceful
controller it's just like that like how
do you make just a standard controller
through the console I don't I didn't
pick that up so I think I need more help
than I'm helping anyone here which is
why I'm not making any videos yet at
this moment but i really love writing
and Lara Val and learning it because
it's really fun in the syntax is
absolutely beautiful so if anyone does
know why this works in again but it
doesn't work in a resource or controller
route please let me know alright thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
