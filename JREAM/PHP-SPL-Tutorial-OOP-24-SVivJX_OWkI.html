we'll do some SPL introduction and SPL
means standard PHP library and this
cannot be turned off in version 5.3 I
believe so you don't need to do anything
fancy you'll be dealing with iterators
and an iterator is like a loop and this
will allow you to loop through objects
and at the end of this I'll show you an
example with XML which is very handy
first we're just starting off with an
array right here and just calling it
number it's just some very basic usage
and we're doing in an array iterator
and to move through let's just say I T
which is the array iterator and we'll
just say current and you probably
recognize this like with regular array
functions but let's just do echo I T
current and we get one and we can go i T
next and let's echo I T current again
and we'll get 20 these are separate
values so you can also loop through them
like you would a normal array let's say
for each i t as item echo item and
refresh and it'll list all out for us so
nothing too fancy there what if we
wanted to limit the iterator we could
use a limit iterator let's just say
limit equals new limit iterator and
we're going to pop in the iterator of
the array this right here and we're
going to say we want to list listing 0 2
and let's say 2 2 so 0 1 2 so instead of
I T we do limit because the array
iterator which is actually this is being
passed into the limit iterator and it's
going to limit that and we get an error
because a long 12 I forgot my semicolon
and there we have it we can limit that
nothing too fancy alright next let's
play with the cash iterator real quick
let's just sayin whoops
names equals array Jesse Joey and Jenny
how about Justine also and we'll create
a new array iterator and say names
equals new array iterator and names and
then we will do a caching iterator we'll
say new caching iterator names and I'll
let's give that one CI value okay and
then we can loop through these also and
say for each CI as item we could say
echo item and then there's another
function here that I like it's if CI has
next meaning it has a another thing
after it then will echo a comma and
refresh that and it's kind of like oh
what's it called implode or explode one
of those but yeah there's probably a lot
more to all this stuff and if we create
let's say an array object let's say
names equals new array object and names
we can do print our names let me echo a
pre statement real quick free now let's
see what we get okay so now it's an
object and it has these values in it we
can do things like names counts names
append Johnny and names counts let me
echo these and I'll echo a br
and refresh and you see we can append to
this and here's Johnny at the end you
know but here's where the real magic
comes in it's simple XML so let's say we
have X let's say we have XML equals
simple XML load file and we'll do test
XML you can pass it in to an iterator by
putting a comma here and saying simple
XML iterator and print our XML and we
have a simple XML iterator object or
alternatively you could do XML equals
file get contents test XML and the
iterator equals new simple XML iterator
XML and I'll just print our iterator let
me echo a pretty once more and refresh
and we have this simple XML just like we
would a normal simple simple XML object
but now we can run through it and do a
lot more here's my XML file it's just
kind of a real simple thing here and you
know it's really to loop through objects
like this like let's say for each
iterator as person and I'll say echo
person name and let me get rid of that
refresh you only get Jessie Joe because
in our XML we have Jessie and Joe for
the name and let's try to do echo person
age and echo that and echo BR and
refresh
now you know what you can do is they
have file iterators or directory
iterators I don't know the names I
myself need some more practice with this
but I found it a little confusing to get
started with and really know a little
bit of what it can do so that's why I
made this tutorial and I hope it helps
you out thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
