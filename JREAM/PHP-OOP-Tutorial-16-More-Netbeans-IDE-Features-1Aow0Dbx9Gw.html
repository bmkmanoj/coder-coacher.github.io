I'm just going to talk about an IDE a
little more I'm gonna talk about
NetBeans because it's the one I prefer
and it's really lightweight and it's
free so you have your IDE your project
up here and you have a navigator and it
shows all your methods which is really
nice when this gets very long because
you know just scrolling through this
whole thing all the time can take
forever and just makes it a little
easier it has quite a few little plugins
that you can use like control space
brings up the suggestions with where
you're working okay if you want to
comment out blocks of coal code you can
hold ctrl shift and press C and to undo
that just press it again
and that's from source toggle common and
they got a bunch of these I don't use
everything yeah I'm not some kind of
master with NetBeans but familiar with
it a little bit it has you can connect
to your database from here which is
pretty cool so you don't have to load up
your PHP myadmin or terminal if that's
what you do you just go to databases and
drivers and say MySQL which is what I
have set up and you just click connect
using my host is localhost and the
default port
I think it's 3306 but you can leave a
blank if you don't know it and my
username is root for this connection I
just want to see all my tables and
everything so you get a little
connection down here and you can expand
this and I'll just go to the test table
and you can look at all your tables and
if you actually want to view what's
inside of them you right-click it and go
to view data and it comes up with this
little thing here and this is pretty
cool because in this little text area
you can type in queries in
try to select stuff how you want them so
this is saying select star from test out
layout and I'll just say where ID equals
1 and then execute it and then it only
looks that one so go back to that this
is really nice and you can also edit
your content from this little table just
double click it commit records ok after
you change a bunch of stuff click commit
records and that saves it and save and
refresh ok there we go get rid of this
if you don't have this plug-in you can
go to tools plugins I'm not sure if it
comes with NetBeans automatically and it
be under the available plugins I already
have a lot installed
I believe this looks like a database
driver so that might actually be
automatic I think this also has
subversion repository and everything you
can use or that be under team subversion
and I think you have to set up a little
thing up here I don't have one set up
CVS if you prefer that too what else we
got here so it's just good to use it's
easy to flip through your projects in
your HTML and TPL files it shows a
hierarchy of code or the document object
model the way it comes in order I don't
use this very much but you might like it
I guess that's it for now I'm trying to
keep the videos a little shorter so you
can play with your own copy of your
software and not lose get too distracted
alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
