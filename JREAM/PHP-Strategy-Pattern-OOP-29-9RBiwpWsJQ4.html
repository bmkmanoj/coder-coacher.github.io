about the strategy pattern and the
definition for this is the strategy
pattern is intended to provide a means
to define a family of algorithms
encapsulate each one as an object and
make them interchangeable okay and I'm
gonna use an example like this it's very
easy to follow with games so if we had a
king a queen and a knight obviously you
can see right away there's a lot of code
duplication we don't want that and it'd
probably be best to abstract this into a
superclass and I've done that in this
one and here we have the superclass and
then the subclass is here and what we
have are the attack and defend methods
inside the abstract class or the
superclass and we have some if
statements here it doesn't look very
good because if you look at this if
helmet if breastplate what if we add
like 20 items that would be just a ton
of items to determine what kind of armor
he's wearing and this is where we'll use
the interchangeable part also we free
assign them just to default weapon with
a new sword new sword new axe and so if
I go to the next one we would have a way
to interchange them with a set weapon
and set armor and we also have a bunch
of classes over here like the types of
weapons and armor and these are the
algorithms these are considered the
algorithms and remember in the
definition we want a family of
algorithms k we have those the weapons
we want to encapsulate each one is an
object and okay these are all their own
objects here and we want to make them
interchangeable okay so to make them
interchangeable we've done the set
weapons armor and in number 4 here's our
nicely looking abstract superclass with
the subclasses and we're going to tie
these in with interfaces to keep a
strict rule on how these are formatted
or template because in my previous
example here's a group of weapons right
and you see what if a weapon had spell
and the other ones didn't or what if a
helmet had defense defense but it also
had magic resistance well then a it's
just kind of out of place so we want to
kind of break these into separate
classes if they're doing something
really different so I'm just gonna do it
like this interface armor with helmet
breastplate interface weapon with axe
staff and sword so let's look at some
actual code you can download this on my
site I'll provide a link in the
description I've just included the
abstract character King tonight in a
Queen Anne interface for a weapon and
all of these weapons implement the
interface right here and here's our
algorithm I just made a very simple one
like this just total random number for
the sword there's a little more damage
for the random number just on how much
he'll attack for and we have our armor
it also has its own algorithm and
basically what we have in the abstract
characters we have our set weapon and
this weapon equals weapon this will be
an object and we can set our armor and
basically we're inserting two algorithm
into the current character and down here
we just add the face hp+ armor defense
and attack is base damage plus damage
and the two strings just so I can see
the object nothing too complex there if
I went to one of the characters I just
have a function that says talk so we can
see what they would say and they have
default weapons in here and they have
default statistics just a very simple
example so I can close all these out and
so we can construct a new king queen and
night and what we can do now is say it's
set weapon and new staff and remember
these are our algorithms so you can
change their armor and everything and
I'll say Queen set weapon
and I'll say sword earth sorry I need to
do new sword and I could do Knight set
armor new helmet I don't remember what
his default was but it's clean and you
see now we have a group of all these
different things that are
interchangeable now it is true that you
could accidentally put the sword inside
of the armor and you know you just got
to keep track of that basically this
makes the client area really flexible
and now we can do a whole bunch of
things with a nice reworking bill system
and I hope that helps you and that's
basically the strategy pattern and
