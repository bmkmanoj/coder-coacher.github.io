some tutorials on Adobe Illustrator cs5
and it's for vector graphics and that
means they can be resized and all that
and it's a pretty good at making logos
and stuff and really everything so I'm
not super familiar with this new version
but I'll try to make it easy to follow
so let's make our toolbar wide I
personally find it easier to do that and
the workspace in my opinion is kind of
hard to pick up so up here at the top
where it says essentials let's just do
like Photoshop and we have layers down
here but you don't really need to worry
about layers as much as you do on
Photoshop graphic Styles let me just
make a new document file new and click
the little advance button most the time
you want to work in RGB or else she'll
give funny colors on the edges with CMYK
alright so graphic Styles up you can
leave these here if you want but I don't
find myself using a much appearance I
seldomly use that only once in a while
and symbols I don't think I ever used
those and I'm not sure exactly how these
toolbars work all right so the
Pathfinder where is that there it is
this little Pathfinder tool this is the
jackpot and this is what you're going to
be using all the time so I just drop
that over here the align one also that's
a pretty good one and just put those
into one little box there now let's put
mine in the corner the transform box I
don't use that much
then for the shapes just hold the mouse
down on that and click this little arrow
because we'll kind of use shapes a bit
and if you look at all this it's pretty
scary so I guess I'll try to start from
here first we want to save our layout
how we got things set up so go to window
workspace save workspace and I'm just
going to overwrite one that I was
messing with okay if you have one ever
load this layout again just load it
right here easy-peasy and what I mean by
layers is let's say you have a square
here and let's just make another square
I made the red square second so it's on
top of the purple one
but even though we're on the same layer
you can move it up and down and vector
graphics again you can zoom in and
they'll never lose their quality it's
not pixel based if you want to zoom back
out just hold ctrl and press one or you
can hold alt and use your mouse wheel I
use control one a lot to get to a
hundred percent okay so there's a lot of
hotkeys in this and I'll try to use the
menus a lot and remind you the hotkeys
so the first thing is let's just make a
circle okay we have a circle click the
circle and then hold alt and you'll see
these double arrows and that means we're
going to make a copy of it and then just
drag it over and let go then if you need
to deselect just click anywhere okay and
I don't really like the black border so
click the little border down here then
click the little slash okay and now
we've got two circles we're going to
make a heart
and let's just make a square and that's
what a lot of Illustrator is it's
playing with shapes make sure you hold
your Shift key so that you get a perfect
square okay we've got a square now hold
your spacebar button down and you get
this little hand try to get used to that
because you're going to be moving around
quite a bit with the little spacebar
alright so click the square and if you
go to an edge you get these little arrow
keys um hold shift and then click down
and turn it so it's like that kind of
like a diamond okay so this is gonna be
the bottom of the heart we're going to
try to cut out a piece right let's take
this corner here make sure you have the
black arrow too not the direct selects
see what happens if we grab this it's
going to stretch the corner but we want
to move the whole object so use the
black arrow and that's the V button so
if you ever need to get back to that
black arrow just press V and so take
this corner and drag it up to like a
corner over by the heart okay and I'm
just going to click this and press down
a couple times Oh actually I'll just
leave it there I'm just going to hold
this and resize it so that it fits there
okay and it's going to be a little bit
off but that's fine for this lesson kay
and then let's just make we're going to
make another square and cut off this top
part of that square so just make a
square I'm going to make it black so
that you can see it and I'm going to put
this on top of it okay and here's where
the Pathfinder comes in this one's on
top of it so I'm going to click this and
then click the square I want to
- the front so I'm going to remove the
front which is the black square click
this and then it looks like it
automatically expanded okay well hold
the Alt key and then zoom in and then
now you can grab your little white arrow
now we're going to move the corner so
that it touches there and move the
corner so it touches there you know it's
not perfect maybe you could drag this
down a little bit okay I'm not going to
be too picky for now and you'll be like
well look you still have all these other
pieces you can go ahead and select all
these pieces and then press this the
unite okay and now it's one solid piece
this is really cool because remember how
we copy the shape hold the alt button
like this and drag it now I'm gonna just
rotate it and I'm going to move it to
this little Pierce then you can grab two
pieces hold the Alt key drag it and
while the both still selected rotate it
and then drag it on over now I'm going
to hold alt and scroll backwards and
look at that you could even group things
but I don't want to go too fast so it's
hard to understand but uh just try to
get familiar with alt and the mouse
wheel control one to go to 100% view and
the spacebar to span the area okay and
if you want to try to get ahead try to
make a habit of the V and the ctrl key
the control key like let's say you have
some selected or let's say you have the
square tool and you make a square
but you want to select this heart
without having to go over here you just
hold ctrl and click this so controls
kinda like a quick little substitute for
selecting all right I don't want to
confuse you though so I guess that's all
for now thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
