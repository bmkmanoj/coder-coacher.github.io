a while as you can see I've grown a
stress beard which the stresses of life
you've all faced it and the struggles
rule out there so stay strong my
brothers what I'm going to show you
right here on the Left I have two
monitors but on the left is Ubuntu which
I do all my development in i usually use
windows for examples because most people
use them and i will say you can install
Python PHP and nodejs on windows no
problem just download the executable add
them to the path and you'll have them in
your terminal whatever you use but in
this case I'm just going to show you
this and just so that nobody asks i'm
using ubuntu but i'm using the gnome 3
for my display the x11 server whatever
and i have add-ons so you can look for
gnome extensions so if i go like this
that's an extension this isn't default
the workspace is on the side and all all
these things aren't default so it's up
to you if you want to do that now let's
get to it what we're going to learn if
you don't know already is the
interactive shelves for three languages
one PHP to python 3 nodejs let's just
i'm just going to write this in here PHP
yeah clear echo PHP here will say echo
py here will say echo njs so at least we
know what we're doing so the weird thing
about PHP is python and no Jas their
interactive terminals you just write out
Python or you're right out node in PHP
it's dash a so PHP a if you write PHP it
just hangs here if you're a PSP I which
is what you would think it just gives
you the info but you can say PHP dash a
and now we're in the interactive console
one thing that's extremely important to
remember is the interactive console
once you exit it it forgets everything
you put in it so this is this is good
for just trying to figure out little
things and if you have any problems what
you need to check with PHP at least is
let's say I believe it's under etc' php5
and then there's a CLI folder and then
php.ini so there's 2i and is one for the
web one for this command line interface
okay on windows would be somewhere under
wamp or xampp i'm not sure exactly where
that's located right now so let's do it
PHP a so we start with a equals one got
a right proper PHP code and we have to
echo a okay pretty simple stuff let's
let's do an array and this is what i
want to show you and we're going to keep
it short because it's simple stuff so
let's say theta equals an array of dog
cat fish okay so we can obviously do a
print our of data just pretty easy stuff
watch this 4e i'm going to type 4 and
hit tab
I thought it would auto complete it did
before oh there there stir ah there we
go I guess it autocompletes done I don't
know I didn't do it on the for each
probably because that is not a method so
much as I forgot what it's called a
internal up whatever built-in thing so
let's just do for each data as key value
and this is what i want to emphasize
when you type this you get confused
you're like what the heck is that now
has two of these things not peach fees
funny the shell this just means hey
buddy you're in a method okay so don't
forget about it and we'll just do echo a
key looks dot dot dot value dot and
since we're in a terminal we don't use
be ours and htmls or paragraphs we can
do double quotes you want to do double
quotes so it parses the slash n which is
a return character boom and I know that
thing looks confusing but you just want
to close ok so if you put your finger
over those two brackets facing that way
actually looks legitimate ok and there
we have a basic PHP stuff say you wanted
to get a the ini file stuff echo I and I
let's see and I get a max is it one word
nope max file size well obviously don't
know what I'm doing I can't even
remember a PHP function let me just open
a new window just a piece p dash I well
they got in here where's the saying well
I got extra bug but I don't know if you
have it so I don't know if that would
help all right let's just I don't want
to do so who cares about that let's copy
this or let's type it since you pry
session da autostart what
ok so I have it all wrong I'm just
yes we need to print our so i guess or
of our dump or whatever so let's just
see what this gives us
next file size let me just check PHP
dash i grep max at mex file up as i
always get these confuse alright so
let's do let's hit up oh we don't want
any of that crap here will say I Nana
get up load max file size two megabytes
now let me just try that without the
print dark see that's weird that's why
it kind of threw me off I guess your
safest bet if you wanted to do that you
could but if you're going to find ini
files dash I pipe grep and then whatever
Redis you know so then you can see let's
see looks like a radius is loaded air
which has a separate ini and just low
try this okay so enough PHP want to keep
this short and sweet so Python we just
type Python I will say a equals one now
this is different because we can just
say a and it says one it's a bit easier
a bit easier to read in here as well not
just the language itself so let's make a
array I'll say dog equals Doberman don't
know how to spell it what's another one
husky and my favorite a Pekinese okay
now we don't need semicolons and Python
and all that gay so I'll just a dog so
it tells me what it is in real Python
you would probably have to print dog or
use something to output it I swear your
doors creaking man who so again a loop
so for item in dog
now this remember the PHP had those
brackets this uses periods so we know
we're inside of this and keep in mind
Python uses tabs if you do or don't know
python just tab and we're going to do
print item and enter enter and there we
have it now to exit any of these you
just press ctrl C maybe one or two times
you can test all a bunch of array
functions and all that with all that set
or sorry python its control D for some
reason like let me do make their test CD
tests and I'm going to do them you don't
have to do this just watch py dot py and
a I'm just going to say a equals one
print one oops print a ok just something
ridiculously easy and play thon py that
py and you know it's just running a file
you can do the same with PHP and nodejs
now know Jas usually I have to do
something like that you could look it up
but I believe that's what i use i didn't
use a PPA let me just say you can
install all three of these on windows no
words and you just load your console
make sure to add it to your system path
system variables path I've gone over
that so many times so you if you don't
watch my videos just look on youtube in
how to add directory to system path and
windows ok or environment path so node
is just note now this one's interesting
i'll say a equals one and it just
automatically gives me i'll hit a again
i'll keep in mind this is java skirt so
we can't use print or echo like your use
of most things so let's say I make a
array a sorry B equals less do something
fun our actor equals who's an actor you
like oh no Bruce Lee sadly he died he
was a cool guy who's another legend uh I
wish I could hear someone give me some
advice huckleberry and how about some
John Wesley I've heard a lot about him
lately okay so since this is JavaScript
semicolons are not required enter cool
let's I packed our again now if we do a
loop in Java Script we can say for I
oops this is sorry pub a little while
while actor dot length is extra route I
don't know how to program you guys
honestly I don't even know how I'm
employed like I don't know anything all
right let's try this for loop it's what
three am I don't know oh it's a two-way
i'm almost for i equals 0 I is less than
actor dot length i increment and this
now does the dot dot which seems right
but we have to do a console log of actor
and then the index enter semicolon okay
so obviously got something wrong for an
undefined there don't know what it is
don't really care
one other thing is this you might like
now I might get it wrong and it's
frustrated me with jquery but so let me
go to CD test okay and npm is the node
package manager so i'm going to do npm
install underscore and you see it
creates a node modules folder and that
node will know to pick it up so npm
sorry note and i'll say underscore
equals require underscore hopefully that
works type of underscore it's a function
that means it's integrated so let's say
a equals 1 2 3 and I'm going to do
underscore dot each I can't remember the
order because jquery the haystack and
needle are different than underscore
their opposites let me just look it up
real quick and then we'll end this video
I apologize for the long video I'm not a
genius I I can't remember everything
each list and iteration okay so a and
the iteration we wanted a or it or 80 we
wanted a function what's weird is you do
Val key like that okay so I don't want
to mess this up hey Val key so console
dot log Val console dot log key okay now
the tricky part and a non IDE is the
brackets and high links so we have a
function and then a closing parenthesis
for the each enter
undefined is not a function type of
underscore each so there's a problem I I
don't know everything about no Jas I'm
not a master sorry guys but javascript
yes if you do know how to import jquery
and early any library inside of this
it'd be pretty cool obviously it's easy
to create another file and just run it
is a j/s file for nodejs so sorry about
this last error I don't I've always had
problems importing for the past three
days and if you out if I have the video
I'll attach it of my frustration but if
someone knows I please leave it in the
comments because that'd be really
helpful and thanks for watching guys and
don't forget to a grow a beard it means
it's a manly thing and means you don't
care the struggle is real all right bye
