with trim calm and this will be Adobe
Illustrator revisited to improve on the
first video I made so what I have open
is Adobe Illustrator cs5 and your menus
might look a little bit different you
might even have this collapsed over here
and the first thing you'll want to do is
organize your workspace so there's this
box up here that says essentials you can
drag this down and pick any presets if
you like if you're familiar with
Photoshop go ahead and click that what
we're going to do is set one up I'm
going to set it up the way I like and
I'll give you a reason why so to do so I
want to go file new and we have all this
junk you might not see the Advanced tab
you probably don't need to put anything
in it and I usually like my illustrator
file to be wider rather than taller so
I'll select my orientation of a wider
guy there and to me honestly the size
here doesn't really matter
points pixels whatever because vector
graphics can be resized to anything so
just I never put a name in here how this
press okay and here's my art board one
thing I never liked about these kind of
programs is it looks really difficult to
start with and to be honest it is but
we'll try to break it down so we have
this Navigator window at the top right
to move around if I'm honest with myself
I never use this so I'll just drag it
off here I'll go ahead and close it
remember what we're doing is building an
ideal workspace next the info I use this
in Photoshop to measure pixels but in
Illustrator I find myself never using it
so I'll go ahead and get rid of it up
here we have a color picker I use this
often so I'll just leave it there
then I have a swatches and actually use
this quite a bit you can keep it or
leave it it's up to you we also have
symbols and to be honest I rarely ever
use this I'll close it you might want to
leave it on
and what we can do is we can put our
mouse down between these boxes and slide
things up our appearance you use this
time to time but in my opinion this
better suits as a special thing and what
we're going to do is build a new toolbar
I'll go ahead and throw this up here and
you probably can't see it but I have a
blue line on that bar I'll drop it and
that's my appearance one thing I don't
like is how these buttons are hard to
tell what's what
I'm not a grayscale icon kind of guy so
those stretch this out and I can see the
text okay graphic styles to be honest I
like to do things really custom so I
don't want to have that there
transparency that's a very useful one
and this actually has more options so
I'm going to click this thing down here
and you can't see it on my screen but a
menu popped up that says show options
and there's some things in here that's
not quite like Photoshop so I'm not
going to monkey with it so I'll just go
back hide thumbnail okay and if you're
familiar with Photoshop you use quite a
few layers in Illustrator you don't need
to abuse them as much because you can
move things on the layer up and down so
let's go through some of these
attributes lengths these you probably
won't use unless you get really into
illustrator open type and paragraph and
character we can get rid of all of these
because when we create a text item I'll
go ahead and click text you see we have
a bunch of options up here there's our
character here's our paragraph and I
don't find much of a need for these
blocks our brushes I don't use these
much but they are very useful I'm going
to close that and we also have stroke
and gradient these ones you'll use quite
a bit so depending on how you want to do
it I like to bundle these up with my
transparency and I want my transparency
to be on the right
so I'm going to drag him over cool
transform this guy
don't use too often so I'll close him
out a line that's a very useful one and
Pathfinder is probably the number one
tool in the entire system so Pathfinder
I'm actually going to put him down here
I use him for everything and a line it's
extremely useful I could in fact put him
down here as well now you might be
thinking well you don't have much
workspace and you have to realize I'm on
a funny resolution right now to fit the
video it does have actions things that
you can record and repeat I don't use
these too much I'll get rid of them if I
ever do need something I can just go to
my window
and I have all these things here and
then there's appearance here so I
suppose what I could do is just say put
a line right there put Pathfinder right
there and now I have a very simple
layout you can also shrink and enhance
this menu so what I'll do is I will save
the workspace so I'll click this
drop-down save workspace I'll call it
Jessie - and anytime you load it and
it's not how you're familiar with it you
just click and lo to how you like it and
it looks like this is almost identical
to what I usually use I wonder if I can
stretch this open a little bit more how
do I get those full on there
maybe it has to be a little bit bigger
can't get any bigger oh there we go
I got click that arrow oh I can't make
those higher up I think I'll put the
Pathfinder up at the top no at the very
top then the alignment there and
appearance I don't use it too much but
you could leave it there I think I'll
get rid of it so I have a nice dark gray
or cool and I will go ahead and resave
my workspace oops
chessy - yes so to get started what we
have are a bunch of tools on the side
that really scare the crap out of me
when I first started using this one
things you're going to do is manipulate
shapes all the time in Illustrator so
let's take the shape bar where you see
the square hold down your mouse and this
little edge piece we're just going to
tear it off I like to have that guy just
chilling right at the top I use them a
lot
next thing is your pen tool I'll drag
this guy snap them off and boom
okay the other thing we use are these
two tools here so what we'll do first is
just something very simple click the
square and just drag it and there you
have it now with your cursor it's still
that symbol so if you drag it again it's
going to make another square it'll keep
making squares and the difference
between the black arrow and the white
arrow is the white arrow we'll select
anchor points which are these little
squares here on the edges those are what
make up vectors because vectors is just
nothing but a bunch of math so I'll
click this guy and how about I select
this anchor point see how it gets bigger
when I hover over it I'll click it I'll
click it again and drag it I can stretch
it and click this guy and drag it and if
I just click and drag you can do the
same thing obviously that's not a work
of art however we're learning so what
you can also do is click one point hold
shift and click another and now you have
two points selected with my arrow keys I
can move the pieces I have selected very
easily and if I hold shift I can Joel
tomb around quite a bit more so here's
the difference the black one will
actually select the entire object you
see that how it outlines that bounding
box or this you select each individual
piece so if I wanted to just move an
entire piece I just use the black arrow
and get using pressing the letter A and
V oftentimes V will be your hottest key
to use because you'll say you'll make a
shape you want to get back to your tool
you press the V hot keys will make you
extremely fast at this you can do the
same thing with this you can hold shift
to select two boxes move them around
and the Delete key will delete them
obviously there's a lot of hot keys in
here that you should remember that will
help your life immensely one is I have
this selected with my black arrow the
what I'm going to do is duplicate this
I'll hold down the Alt key and you see
how my arrows turned into like a double
arrow that means if I drag it it's
duplicating the exact same thing that
comes in handy a lot definitely
something to remember you can also
select by dragging your mouse like a box
and letting go it's pretty
straightforward and with the white arrow
you can do the same with edges so if I
were to go like this and now I have just
those edges selected and I can make them
bigger okay so back to my black arrow
I'm just going to delete all these boxes
so let's make something let's pick out
this polygon tool and don't let go of
your mouse when you start dragging just
drag it now press your up arrow and
you'll get more sides press your down
arrow and you'll get less sides and
that's a little trick one thing you can
do also is hold the shift key to lock it
symmetrically I'll just let go there
there's a lot of features like they have
a grid if I go to view not rulers sugar
it there it is I can have a grid and
that's really little and if I look at
the top of my document it says 94% if
you want to get to a hundred percent
just press control one control one
that's a real good hockey if you're on a
Mac I believe it's command one and with
this grid if you were to want to mess
with it you could go to view snap to
grid and to edit the grid size I believe
off the top of my head you can press
control K or
would be command key on a Mac and under
here you would go to guides and grid and
grid every how often I'll say 144 for
subdivisions and okay and now it's more
spread out and with the snap to grid you
see how everything snaps in real nicely
one thing that people fear a lot is the
pen tool and it's not something to be
afraid of since already have all these
snaps on it'll make it easier so I'll
pick my pen tool out I'm just going to
click this little corner here and then
I'm going to go down here and click
again it made a line and that's not that
impressive
so I'll click this corner here and you
see how it filled in with white that
color is based on this square right here
in this square is the fill color you can
just hover over and see and below it is
the stroke or the outline color so I
want to change it I just click it or
double click it and I can select a color
from here otherwise I can use my colors
here and just pick something or go to my
swatches which is nice to just quickly
pick a random color same thing with the
stroke you have to click the stroke or
you can click this little flip arrow
tool like this and there it is you can
press the letter X to just quickly flip
through them so if I was ill like this X
boom you need to switch colors real
quickly and one thing you're always
going to want to do is close your path
I'm going to purposely get out of the
pen tool I'm going to hold ctrl to
temporarily use my black arrow just
click right there and then I'm going to
press V and I'm going to zoom in now you
can zoom in down here at the bottom well
there's all these percentages you can
use the magnifying glass and just drag
in a square
and if you ever stuck just press control
one and you'll be back to 100% if let's
say you zoom in and you wanna look at
another corner hold down the spacebar
and you get the panning tool so now I
can slide to the side move all around
and you're just continually holding the
spacebar pretty easy a better way to
zoom if you ask me is to hold the ctrl
key and the Alt key and use your mouse
wheel and it'll zoom in wherever you put
it it's a lot easier to use so I'm going
to go black back to my black arrow I'm
just going to delete this guy chillin
here and I'm going to make a new
document so that it'll just reset a lot
of our settings and let's see file new
we'll just create a new guy and let me
just double check it has all these grids
and all that stuff off and what we're
going to do is we're going to try to
make something so we're going to do it
with the pen tool because I didn't
finish talking about that with the pen
tool we're going to make a dot doesn't
matter where you make it and just go
down a little bit down the page click
another place click and this time what
we're going to do is we're going to
close this shape and we're going to drag
the pen tool now if you hover over the
closing dot you'll see a little tiny
circle beside the pen that means it's
going to close the shape and before you
click make sure you hold it down ok and
then you're just going to drag you can
dry it up and down left and right and if
you hold shift it can lock into place
see that
there we go and if you start drawing
again if you're going to start drawing a
new shape because you just close the
shade so I'll go ahead and delete that
dot and you want to press your V key off
and to just get out of a tool like say
you want to move it around so with this
what are all these other pen tools well
the plus one will add an anchor point if
you click the shape and you look at all
the dots around it one two three it has
three anchors if I wanted to add another
one I could do it here pretend this is
the side of a face now click a dot here
and a dot here and this would be to make
a nose so remember to manipulate these
dots I use the white arrow and I want to
make sure I have nothing selected so
I'll just click and instead of looking
for the dot by hovering sometimes you
might just want to make a square of the
general area you know what's in so I'll
drag this out and it didn't look exactly
how I wanted so I'm going to add one
more point right here and back to the
drawing board drag this dot and this man
will have a very big nose okay with the
subtraction tool it will remove an
anchor point like that and another one
okay and the last one is this little
convertor so what we have if I hover
over this anchor point it's straight you
don't see those busier lines by the
edges of it but if I go to this one you
see it with these little handles here
that you can manipulate and we can
convert this corner piece into a busier
so I clicked it it should be converted
but I'm just going to drag it there it
goes now it's just like that and you can
move around these little handles however
you choose so from a face that could
turn into an eagle
and that's just a quick overview of that
pen tool hope it makes you happy
so let's actually make something with
the tools we learned
let's make how about a frog okay so I'm
going to start with any lips - okay and
holding down shift its going to make a
perfect circle okay and I'm going to the
black tool and I'm going to click this
guy hold down the Alt key and just shift
in drag okay and then what I want is an
interesting shape and this will be a
friendly little introduction into the
Pathfinder and there's many ways to do
this but we're just going to use the
Pathfinder so you can get the idea of it
so I'll say right between the eyes if I
can get it right I'm going to draw a
circle and hold shift now it doesn't
look right because I started in the
center here but it's going to the side
what I can do is hold the Alt key down
and now it's a lot easier to tell it's
in the center an awesome thing is while
you're making a shape I have shift and
alt held down right now so you might
have to Jere wrench your fingers a
little bit but you can hold the spacebar
you can drag the shape down okay so
here's our little frog it doesn't have
to be perfect and I'll click my black
arrow tool so talking about the
Pathfinder what I wanted to do was make
the bottom of the Frog kind of round and
using the pen tool we were playing with
I'll go ahead and click him here what
I'm going to do is I'm hovering over
this circle and in the middle you see
this tiny little X I'm just going to
click the X here and I'm going to go to
the edge here and I'll go up a little
ways what I'm doing is I'm making a
curve and you can make this curve
however you like does not matter a whole
lot
okay but I want the curve to basically
cut off the bottom of the frog's belly
so I'm just going to drag this up make
the curve a little bigger and what we're
trying to picture is half of a frog and
I'm going to make it go all the way over
so what I need to do is finish the shape
and you'll see why in just a moment I'll
go back to my pen tool and where this
guy lines up I'm just going to hover
straight up and click and we do want it
to cover okay and click so I close the
shape
right now you're probably very confused
what are we making we're going to
subtract shapes from another shape
that's what we're doing so I'll click
this guy and we're going to do a mirror
down here you see a little rotate tool
you're going to hold this down snap out
the menu and flip it now we don't just
want to flip it like this I'll undo that
we want to first click right on the line
then we want to hold down the Alt key
and then the shift key flip it 90
degrees there we have it so with these
two shapes I'm going to join them
together so it's just one shape and with
the Pathfinder we have right here it's
called unite okay so I can drag this
down right about there and we're going
to subtract the Frog so that he only
he's a circle like unto this line and to
do that I need these uh lines to go
outside of the circle so what I'm going
to do is I think I'll just add some
anchor points here here
here here basically we're just building
the temporary shape so that we can
manipulate it and the reason I added
anchor points is because I don't want to
mess with my curve okay so now what I'll
do is I'll select this shape and this
shape and if you look at this little
outline and then the bottom of this this
is the shape we're going to get and
there's a number of ways to do this
let's try a intersect and now look at
that beautiful work of art so what I
want to do is right click this guy
arrange send to back and if you
right-click and look at arrange all four
of these hotkeys are very very useful to
know so definitely get used to using
control in the brackets and the shift
ones too so now we have a frog and he
might not be perfectly shaped but this
is a beginner tutorial what else we can
do is we can make a little smiley across
him and we're going to have to do that
with his eyes too so I will just
duplicate this eye and I'm going to make
another circle I'm just going to overlap
it you have to kind of be able to
picture the shape you're subtracting
from it okay so I have these two shapes
and this is the end shape that I want
with the black arrow tool I'll select
both of these guys subtract and here's
this little eyelet and we only need to
make one eye at a time because we can
duplicate them over and I wanted to look
a little cartoony so I'll make this a
little bigger if you look at the edges
here this allows me to stretch the eye
and I'm going to hold the Alt key so it
stretches from the center and the shift
key so it's a little more symmetrical
okay
and I'm going to copy this and there's a
couple things you're going to do paste
paste in front I was to paste in front
and right now it doesn't look like
anything's happened but we have a new
copy of this eye so I'm just going to
drink them down a little bit here and
I'm going to flip these colors around
and oftentimes you don't want a little
border so I'll just hit none like so now
we have a little frog I'm going to give
them a big old smiley face and we'll
practice the pen tool once again I think
we're going to divide this guy up make
them kind of cute looking does not
matter if it is not symmetrical to me
because this is just a beginner tutorial
and if you're perfectionist
you'll love this software because you
can make things perfectly shaped okay
and you can't see what's going on here
but you see where the blue border is in
the black or just make those two
different pieces so I'll select both of
these and I am going to divide okay and
it looks like nothing really happened
because they all look like one shape but
since we divided it it actually grouped
it all together so I'll click this right
click and I will do ungroup and if you
click it it still looks like it's the
piece but it's not so I can get rid of
that piece so let's add some color and
I'll just pick a green color I'll go
back to this base I'll just pick another
green color and we want to move these
colors to the back so I'll right click
arrange send to back and there's his
face now with his eyelid I'll just press
the where's the eyedropper the
eyedropper tool and this will pick up
any color we want boom get rid of this
boom okay and I'm going to delete this
eye for now and I'm going to hold ctrl
alt and zoom in and with this little
eyelid we're going to ctrl C to copy it
in control f2 paste in front okay that
was control C and then control f I'm
going to make it white I'm going to just
shrink it down a little bit okay
and there's a lot of details we could
get into adding to this but we're not
going to kill ourselves over it so that
looks decent he's got a little smirk on
his face and now to draw some feet this
will be a little tricky I'll try to do
it off the top of my head
frogs have little bubbly feet I think
I'm just going to pick a black so I'll
make a toe with a circle and another toe
I'll make that one a little bit smaller
and I guess another toe even a little
bit smaller and I think this should go
on this side see how we're doing that
and I'm going to make a little palm for
a hand it's not going to look like a
super real frog so I'll make a circle
right about here now try to visualize
this like we can manipulate the shape
very easily okay so I have a circle
there I'll take us three fingers whoops
I'll just move those down for now and
we'll use the little white arrow tool
and here's another way to manipulate a
shape with this little guy here I can
drag him out I'll track him out and up
here we can push these guys in sorry
it's a little hard to see on these
colors whoops and we can even drag these
guys in a bit and sometimes playing with
these curves can be a little annoying if
you don't get it exactly like this don't
worry about it it's just playing around
so I'll pick my black arrow then I'll
pick my eyedropper or press the letter I
boom okay and I'll temporary use my
black arrow with the control key boom
boom okay and just so it stands out a
little I'm going to make these a little
bit lighter just by adjusting the green
color and we're going to press the
letter V boom I'm going to drag these
little toes up here and there on the
bottom and I'm working so that I don't
have borders so I could actually just go
like that select the whole guy here and
pick this border here and be like snap
they're all gone
wherever they are and these toes they
could be on the bottom or top let's Hill
they look on the top I kind of like them
on the top so to make my life easier I'm
going to hover over all these shapes
here I'm going to press ctrl G or object
group right here okay and now if I click
this it's a whole group if I wanted to
go into that group I double click it C
and then it's just like normal
and groups will help you sort things out
I might want to move these down just a
tad bit and since I did add those I
should probably save my workspace -
Jessie - yes and now I'm in a group I
can click here to go back and all the
way back boom
so I'll click here and we're going to do
this again the rotate tool sorry the
reflect tool and just find the center
point click hold your Alt key down and
the shift key and rotate boom and we're
going to do the same thing with the eye
we could actually make a little line
above his eye or below as I don't know
let's do that just a little line above
his eye and I'll take the pen tool just
a quick and dirty way I think it's good
to get practice with the pen tool just
make a line and you see how the shape if
I close the shape it's still a curve
like that I don't want that so let me
undo that I can click this anchor point
here boom and it'll take away the curve
so now I can close it straight on like
that that's a very handy little tool
extremely handy just to make the guy a
little more interesting I'm just going
to copy ctrl F and paste another little
white circle here I'm going to put it
right about there this time we're going
to make it transparent like so a little
bit smaller
there we go now we can group together
this eye and give them his other eye so
I'll just select a block here I'm going
to press shift to deselect that shape
cool object group and we're going to do
our little reflection tool again so
right about there
hold alt shift let go click click and
he's a cute looking little frog I think
you should have a little lip I'll be
kind of funny
so if I'll take the pen tool let's draw
a line here and about the center I'll
make it round touch up there I'm going
to try and match this top line like so
okay so now we have a half of a lip and
the color for this I'm going to pick
something very similar to this color I
pick the eye tool and I'm just going to
brighten it up a little bit yuck
there we go and we're going to mirror
this over once again like that select
both of these join them up now he has a
little lip I think it could be a little
bit smaller there we go and the Frog has
two little noses nose holes so I guess
there
and there okay so far is legs without
getting too much into it because you're
starting to get the basic idea of
drawing an illustrator I'm going to just
alt drag this guy here kind of make them
a lot bigger and I'm going to arrange
send to the back and let's put them back
there and it looks kind of funny because
I'm not a frog artist I don't think I'd
want to be it'd probably get boring
I think that looks good enough so I'll
just click this and rotate like that
lastly we'll just hit up the text tool
I'm going to type ribbet and I'm going
to select that and make it a lot bigger
and look at that amazing font I'll do
aerial since it's more of a generic font
yeah
how about century gothic I always like
that font ribbit and let's make this a
same bubble so I'll grab this rounded
rectangle and you can press your up and
down arrow keys to make it rounder or
less round find something you like I'll
make it just a sky blueish color make
sure to send that guy to the back and
then we'll just need a little arrow
and I'll do that with the square so I'll
take the square flip it around and I'm
just going to grab my white arrow tool
and stretch that guy up a little bit
stretching a little funny too I'll move
them like that and send it to the back
okay and lastly we have this little
artboard space and we can change the
size of our artboard to kind of fit our
picture like so click and there it is so
what I'm going to do is just go to file
save as and I'm going to say this as
frog tutorial okay so that's an
illustrator format you always want to
save an illustrator format file that way
you can go back and edit it and change
it and when you want to save it safe for
the web you go to file save for web and
devices and this is kind of has a lot of
options to it let me shrink it down okay
so if you don't know your file types you
usually want to save in a jpg if you're
just going to send it an email or throw
in a picture or something in the quality
you can put around 80 or else it's going
to look kind of cheap and the PNG that's
just transparent but these are a lot
larger file sizes for now I think I'll
save as a JPEG save okay so that rounds
it up for this tutorial I hope it was a
pretty good introduction to Adobe
Illustrator and I hope you guys enjoy
making your graphics and thanks a lot
for watching good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
