we're going to make a website from
scratch just to show you how it goes if
you choose to do it this way so on my
desktop I'm just going to right click
and create a new folder i will call this
website and this will be a static HTML
website but this is how we can get it
started and let's create a new text
document and call this index dot HTML
and this will be our main page that it
always goes to now you can edit this if
you double click in and it opens a web
browser right click it and there's
probably a edit option and we're just
going to put in some standard stuff in
here starting with the doctype and then
the HTML tags the body tags and appear
the head tags if you don't know HTML yet
you can just type this up and learn as
you go I also have some tutorials on it
and it's pretty easy then we'll do title
and we'll just say my website one thing
you'll want to do in HTML this tag up
here just type lang equals en because
you're most likely English if you're
listening to this and then we're going
to include a style sheet and that is to
style our page and we do that with link
hrf equals i'm just going to combine
default that CSS
all right now if I open this in the
browser it's not going to be impressive
right now i'll just open a new browser
window over here and drag that in there
okay so it's just a blank site what we
want to do is this default file create
this and in this folder i'll go to new
text document and call this default dot
CSS I've got a lot of CSS tutorials too
if you don't know this I'm just trying
to put it all together so to make sure
this is plugged in I'm just going to say
body and background of red safe and
let's open this refresh and that's not
loading so back here this has to be
fixed we got to add the re l equals
style sheet
and go ahead and refresh that okay and
we'll create some elements usually you
want a rapper div ID equals rap or
rapper I'll combine rapper and a
website's basically constructed much of
the same way so i'll have a div ID of
header and this is where our logo would
go let's say and then we'll have a div
ID of content and a div ID of footer
okay go ahead and fast-forward if you
already know all this stuff and this is
just to tie it all together content blah
and let's refresh the page make sure
it's all in there okay so far so good so
to make things better looking we're
going to use CSS I just want to put in
some fake content here and this should
be formatted properly kind of like H 1
equals welcome to my website
and ok and then I'll just put some fake
text in here the reason i did uppercase
and lowercase is because of it looks a
little different and we'll just do an h2
let's say more info and just refresh
that once more ok now what we need is a
reset CSS I'll open up Firefox real
quick I'm in google chrome right here
and i'll load up this webpage in there
also
okay and here is Firefox now you might
not see a huge difference let me see if
I got internet explorer also and we can
load up the same file little boy oh look
at all this junk Oh Marcie oh my
goodness no wonder I don't use this it's
just terrible okay well these browsers
look pretty consistent with the margin
spacing but on certain items it's all
different so what we want to do is reset
these two lit in all browsers it just
shifts everything to the side and get
rid of all the extra junk so open a new
tab and let's go to 0 CSS reset and
here's Eric Myers CSS reset this is
pretty famous here and let's see if
copy of the file and I'll select all
this copy and go to website and we're
going to make a new CSS document and
call this reset that CSS open this up
and paste that in there okay yeah
that'll be fine we can close that and we
have to include the link and I prefer to
import it from here so with the at sign
like an email at import reset dot CSS
and watch closely the positioning of
things refresh and it all gets put up
there now we have like a blank framework
to work with pretty cool now the next
thing I would suggest doing is
organizing your CSS into a separate file
a folder new folder and call this CSS
because it looks good and if you have a
standard it's really nice and don't
forget to change whoops the Lincoln
index to CSS / default CSS okay
looks good and we're moving along at a
decent pace here I'm going to open
default CSS and here's our site so we
have a rapper we have a header content
and footer the ids are things that don't
change for the most part and classes
with the period change a lot so for the
rapper I want this site to be centered
on the page and you have to give it a
width if you want to Center it and you'd
say width 960 pixels wide and then to
Center use margin 0 auto and margins are
Auto basically means margin-top is 0 the
right is auto the bottom is 0 and the
left is autumn you could type it this
way if you want it also but this is
shorthand for saying 0 top and bottom 0
left and right okay and for the header
let's actually change this background
let's just make it silver
and I let's have a regular font font
like a nice font you can go on google
and type CSS font stacks let's see if we
got any of these sitepoint that's a
pretty good site yeah I'll just pick
this one this is a really long farm
stack ok there's the font family I want
to define the size you could do font
size equals 14 pixels but I prefer mine
all in one font tag like this get rid of
the family and just type 14 pixels
refresh there needs to be a little
bigger 16 pixels okay that's more
readable that's an interesting font so
for the margin is width of 960 a rapper
oh we have our rapper here but we didn't
ever close it down here did we oh yeah
we did margin zero auto what's the deal
that's not doing anything
so the div ID of wrapper is wrapping
around all this stuff with I guess I'll
do eight 20s well I might not see any
results here okay it's because I did
something wrong at the start let's see
960 I put this little pound sign here
and refresh there we go all right back
to the CSS so for the header this will
be the logo and usually um there's a
navigation maybe across the top bar so
let's say header let's give it a padding
of top is 10 pixels and bottom is 0 or
sorry so 10
there we go for the content how about I
guess the same thing just get this stuff
out of the way now this is being
repeated you could obviously combine
header content and footer but I don't
want to do that because will change
eventually again and we're gonna have a
navigation inside the header and the way
to go about that itís a header nav and
let's just do background is white so
inside the header will have a div ID of
nav I'm going to have this over so we
can tell it's inside it and let's create
some fake links aah RF home will say
about and services refresh isn't that
beautiful so that's all right and I'm
just going to go on google and look for
a concrete texture and here's one that's
a little big you don't want to use
something this big for your background
with that one point eight megabytes
about this one ninety four kilobytes
gahafer I'm just using this to show
example in the tutorial and I'll save
image as and i'll save it to desktop and
our little website folder save
and back here if we go back to the
website folder here it is you're going
to want to rename this something that
makes sense because you don't want your
file names to have spaces so I'm just
going to call it B G dot jpg and let's
create a new folder and call it images
because you're going to have a lot of
images probably so on the style sheet
let's take the background the default
color will be silver but we're going to
use a URL let's say URL and it will be
images / BG jpg refresh that's not
loading images BG jpg
see if that works there we go oh yeah
we're folder up in the CSS the reason we
type dot slash is because the CSS is in
this folder k if you look up here CSS
and then website and from the CSS file
we need to get two images so we have to
first type dot slash to go folder down
then we have to go to images okay so
this is just moving a folder down
refresh and that looks okay so let's do
some transparency so for the content I'm
going to make a little background and
I'll just call it gray and let's do
opacity of fifty percent and for other
browsers that might not work let's do a
filter of alpha and how about opacity
equals fifty okay refresh oh shoot I
forgot that this changes to text also so
that doesn't look very good I guess I'll
just leave it a solid color we could use
a PNG but I don't want to and I'm going
to make the padding on all this 10
pixels man that's ugly if you're if you
have photoshop you can open that up I'm
going to take a screenshot of this to
match these tiles back here so i just
hit print screen
and
we have whoops
all this looks like my photoshop is not
very happy huh I don't know what his
problem is and I'm just gonna pick a
color in here I like that dark one so
you can pick a little color in here get
this color out of there and let's pop
that into here don't forget the number
sign refresh and that's ugly well it's
not going to be a perfect website just
making it and how about them way not
that one the color for the content I
guess I'll make it white
oops forgot the semicolon that messed it
up okay and let's format some text what
we want to do is format the h1 h2 and
the P for the h1 tag I'm going to say
font size of 20 pixels let's see how big
that is not big enough 30 pixels that's
good enough for the font size of h 2
i'll say 24 and for the P for paragraph
the line height a good rule of thumb is
line height of like one fifty percent
130 to 150 and its paces it out and for
the h2 I think we're going to want to
have a margin so margin I guess just top
of 20 pixels and boom and that's spaced
out counter nicely and we're going to
want to default link color so in our
content let's say we make a link for
example a hrf
let's scatter a couple of these through
there and how about right there and one
in the footer okay so refresh and we
have these ugly blue links so what we
got to do is let's separate this is text
and let's call this one links this is
just a comment by the way let's say a
color um I'm going to open up Photoshop
once more and just grab this orangish
color I am pretty much as good as
colorblind with stuff so don't mind me
okay and if you want to change how it
looks when you hover it we can do a
hover and let's say color red you know
it hovered it turns red that really
hurts the eyes oh so i'll just do yellow
refresh okay
for the navigation piece here what I'm
going to do is make it the background
the same as the content okay and I'm
also going to add some padding so 10
pixels there we go and I want these to
be bigger and spaced out more and this
is going to go down in our links so
these are going to be different from
just the default links here so there's
our default links they're here will be
our header links so these only applied
to the header I'm going to do text
decoration of none might as well split
this down here font weight Boulder and
how about some padding the tops good and
the right I'll say like 30 pixels and
how about the font size of
20 pixels refresh okay and how about
when they hover these it changes the
background a little bit so we're gonna
do the same thing here and
a hover and backgrounds of i'll just
copy this background here and get a new
one that's a little lighter okay you can
just type these in if you want boom boom
boom and there we go I want to add some
padding to the top so it looks taller
also so padding is 30 pixels I'll say
eight pixels refresh and when they hover
I kind of want the color to be white
refresh okay that looks pretty good and
for the footer we should probably Center
this text so we'll say text a line of
Center refresh cool i'm going to quickly
make a logo in Photoshop just to show
you how to include one in your site so
let me just make a new file zoom in at a
hundred percent
oops okay my website where are my font
options
it does not want to let me click it oh
there we go I don't know why Photoshop
does this it's always shrinking down on
me where is that picture I'm making new
one embarrassing 500 x 500 ok so I'll
just call this my website and 60 that's
pretty big don't really care the layers
I'll just add something to it so that I
can show you the transparency trick add
a little stroke to it about a drop
shadow change the color overlay to I
guess we'll do a little bit of a
gradient instead of a color overlay all
right this isn't really about how good
we can make the graphics look so I will
just cut this little thing now when
you're saving it you want to get rid of
this background so that you have these
checkers and that's transparency will
save for web and devices and we're going
to save as PNG 24 there's a PNG eight
but that doesn't have as many levels of
transparency so if you can see closely
there's this whiteness here but if you
go to 24 all colors have levels of
transparency and that's good it doesn't
look good in internet explorer 60 foot
nobody should be using that or they
should be all right so say this is logo
and back to our header let's do image'
SRC equals images lolo dot PNG ok
refresh and there it is you see how this
layers over the background pretty nice
all right guys oh this is pretty much
all we need to do for now you could make
this look however you want I just wanted
to do a total overview of how to put
things together it's very important you
name your things cleanly lowercase and
with underscores instead of spaces or
dashes and put things in folders to
that's a good idea so thanks for
