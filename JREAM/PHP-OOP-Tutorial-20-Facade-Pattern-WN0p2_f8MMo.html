tutorial we're going to cover the facade
pattern and this one's pretty easy I
think it'll help you remember if we look
up the definition for the word facade
and as two definitions the front of a
building and another one is a
superficial appearance or illusion so a
facade what it does is it makes the
client make a call like let's say new
stringify and when they call this it
runs a bunch of things that it looks
really simple but is really doing a ton
of stuff in the background like I guess
we'll just start by typing it out so
I'll make a class stringify and I'll say
um public function construct and I'll
pass in string here and I'll say this
string equal string now for the facade
part what we're doing is basically
breaking things down uh to make each
little function do its own thing so I'd
say private function sorry I can't type
well today um add text and I'll say this
string equals um
adding text this is just a little string
manipulator we'll make and let's do
another one and let's call this one add
digits
and then we'll make one more just so
that you can see that the complexity
behind the single client call let's say
we had a guess add object and we'll say
stuff and let's create this stuff object
real quick
I'll try to move up a little so let's
say class stuff and we'll just give it a
method say a public function right craft
and we'll say return class um writing
stuff okay
and for this up here we'll change this
to stuff right crap okay
and what we want to do when the
constructor is um rather than having to
go us x add text X woops X add digit
we're basically making this like a
facade front of the building one call
looks real simple but it's just an
illusion
it's actually really complex um I think
so anyways I'm not good at explaining
that so we'd say on this add text this
add digits this add object new stuff
okay and let's just echo out the string
echo this string
and let's refresh missing one argument
for stringify construct oh right here
I'll just put an intro text and refresh
and see how that kind of works
automatically simply one little facade
when it's really implementing all this
other stuff and that's a facade pattern
