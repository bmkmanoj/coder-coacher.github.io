look at content aware scale and scaling
as you know is when you're resizing
something like press ctrl T and this
would be scaling making a smaller or
bigger and you can try to scale
something like this let's say we want to
make it really thin okay so I'll make it
like that and everything gets totally
squished it doesn't look very good with
content aware what we can do i'll hide
that other layer it intelligently does
this for you so you just go to edit
content aware scale and you just do the
same thing we'll just slide that over
about as far as we can go okay and you
can also do it up and down but you
usually want to save that to the end if
you start getting other things squishing
and isn't that pretty impressive ok I'll
press ok so let's compare these two turn
that one back on and you can see how
these lost the original thickness of the
buildings and these kept them it just
kind of moves everything closer together
and that's really cool lets us form the
sky up here see if you wanted to
transform the sky just with regular
transform it's going to look pretty bad
let's do that on this one it's just
going to shrink a lot of the image and
let's do the content aware on this one
look at that it's just stretching all
the sky force that is cool about the
water looks like it wants to stretch the
sky mostly ok let's try another image
here's one of a bird just on a separate
layer and go to edit content aware scale
and let's see we're getting rid of some
stuff and looks like the branch is
shrinking see the birds still keeping a
shape Oh get
my stuff there okay so let's undo that
would I pace there okay let me make this
a little bit bigger let's say width is
900 and let me make a copy of this
little guy okay here's the regular
transform if we're doing it left to
right and that ruins it obviously you
could just cut out a piece if you wanted
to but in some cases you might want to
use content aware fill our transfer
scale and let's shrink this little guy
down and that looks a lot better and one
more picture we have a picture of some
streets and here's what the regular
transform I'll do it on the right
regular transform if we wanted to shrink
this down all the cars are getting
squished and doesn't look very good this
would be really hard to do manually so
let's select the other layer and go to
edit content aware scale let's shrink
this down most of the staying pretty
intact looks like the bus gets a little
distorted if you look at the number 40
on the street you see it keeps its
correct size and apply that and what if
we want to make it wider let's do it
with the normal one let's make this
wider and that looks pretty bad let's
try it with the content aware yeah looks
like I had some trouble on the bridge a
little bit but it does pretty good
compared to the bridge down here I mean
just compare the cars look at these cars
and the buses okay so I guess that's it
for this oh one more thing you can
create a mask and select what you want
to scale so let's say
I go to channels I make a new mask and
the white area is what will stay the
same in the red area or the black area
is what will be transformed and this is
just a new channel and just click on
your RGB again and you can go to edit
content aware scale and when you click
protect choose your alpha channel so we
scroll down you see it's get rid of the
black stuff first and it tries to
protect the white so you could do that
if you wanted you could also add a
different kind of gradient if you wanted
certain areas to be protected so this
would mostly protect this area right
down here and the darker it gets the
less it's going to be protected and
let's do the same thing edit content
aware scale protect alpha and you see
it's trying to protect the white area
try shrink that down that's pretty funny
see how that works it's pretty neat
alright guys thanks for watching and I
hope this helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
