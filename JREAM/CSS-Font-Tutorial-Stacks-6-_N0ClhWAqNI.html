probably tired of hearing my voice by
now a little tired of talking but in
this tutorial number 6 we're going to
talk about fonts and maybe it seems a
little but fonts do make a big deal on a
website if everything was times new
Romans I think I'd go crazy so let's go
over some fonts first thing to know is a
font types I'm just on w3schools here
now it tells you the difference between
serif and sans-serif and obviously you
can see the difference is that cereth
are like Times New Roman fonts and
sans-serif are like Arial and Tahoma I
believe if you're on Windows sans kind
of means without the glyphs ok so it's
up to you what you like best so I
suppose we'll start with some font
settings the first couple of commands we
can do is like font size 10 pixels and
if you look at what that does we've got
some really little text you can also do
EMS now EMS are different measuring
units so it's a lot lower number and
that looks like about 12 pixels in size
you can do 12 points and it looks like
the same size kind of 214 points you
could do centimeters I'm kind of scared
to see what that does
yeah that's a little big let's see I'm
just going to leave mine well generally
they say use EMS so just say 1.5 am so
there's resizable like this but with
internet explorer 6 7 8 I know I said I
wasn't going to talk
that old dinosaur ie6 but hey you know
sometimes it matters I guess but just
for me I like pixels because I don't
have any respect for Internet Explorer
no offense if you're on it
then there's font weight you can do bold
you can do bolder you can do 500 and
refresh that okay
font size equals I kinda want 14 pixels
up there we go that's the original size
I had the Texas oom doubt okay so
there's our font size there you can
change the font weight you can do font
variant I know that's kind of confusing
you can do italics or is it italic maybe
it's plural italics
well the fonts not changing there I must
have typed it wrong or who knows not a
big deal you could look it up it's
pretty easy font weight size then
there's font family this one you'll
probably be concerned with most of the
time you can say Arial and refresh we
have Arial font throughout the site now
one thing to consider is you can't use
fonts from your hard drive that people
don't have like if you have a font
called squiggly and someone doesn't have
that installed it's not going to show up
on their site okay now for the most part
I like to use shorthand font with all
these and to do so you just type font
and then the size weight and type okay
so this would be Arial and for the
weight I'd put normal get rid of these
and that did not work because I think
this might have to go before this
there we go okay so it's font weight
size and then type you can also leave
this blank if you want to leave it
normal but others leave it there for now
know something to know is uh font
families what you can do is let's say
you define a font such as a comic sans
ms which I don't recommend because it's
just a Corning font that people
shouldn't use in my opinion and for
multi-word fonts you usually use quotes
and comic sans ms then if you want to
fallback font if they don't have Comic
Sans I'm asked you to say like Arial and
if they don't have Arial
I don't know if Apple Macs have it or
not I don't particularly like Macintosh
but you just do sans serif or something
and it will fall back on a sans serif
font and this is what you call a font
stack I do have a link that I go to
quite a bit I don't know if it's a great
one but it's pretty long right up here
and they have font stacks and they give
you a little example below and you see
basically it says if the person has err
al use that if not attempt to use that
if not attempt to use this and lastly
just use a generic sans serif fonts and
this is very good to do because it will
keep your site the most consistent among
all users rather than saying if they
don't have Arial then let the computer
just pick something like the default
Times New Roman font so I really like
Arial for a reading and you just paste
that in there and this is a font stack
and refresh and there it is you can have
different fonts for different sections
obviously you don't need to do clear all
this
generally if we want the main font to be
Arial and we just want to change the
sizing you can just leave this how it is
and down in h 1cl we only change the
font size we don't have to do it like
this 20 pixels you know that's just a
waste of space just do font size and as
you can see it's here if you wanted to
change the font family once again it's
let's say courrier new and put those in
quotes and look at that that looks
pretty old-school
there's also pre which is pre formatted
text and I showed that in a previous
tutorial but it shows it literally and
we had a pre tag up here right here
background gray you could also do a
letter or sorry let's let's go in the
paragraph a second let me show you
something with the text this one is
sometimes school line height and let's
say 12 pixels and we refresh it change
the line height I don't know if you saw
that let me make it a little smaller say
8 pixels see that now this could be a
problem if you're zooming in I don't
know how all browsers handle this with a
bigger view on the browser when they
zoom in the way I'm zooming in by the
way is holding ctrl and rolling the
little wheel that's for Chrome anyways
and so possibly you want to use a
percent I do most of time so say 150
percent and that would be a regular
spacing plus half of that I usually
looks pretty good there's also a text
indent this will indent it like a
paragraph and just say 15 pixels and
look at that it's starting to look like
a real
document oh yeah there's also text
aligned
you can do text align justify and
justify makes it so that it looks like
on the left and right it ends at the
same spot or does so as close as
possible you know their Center left
right and lastly there's text decoration
and you can do over line puts a line
above it I'm not sure why you anyone
would use that but oh there's underlined
line through which is like strike
through and I think there's one for
blank okay yeah that's uh not available
anymore because blink was like an old
HTML tag the thing was a nightmare
alright that'll give you a general idea
of fonts and a little bit of text have
fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
