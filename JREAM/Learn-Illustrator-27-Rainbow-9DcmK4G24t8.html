tutorial we're gonna make a rainbow and
let's see Rory
g-give red orange yellow green blue
indigo violet so that's six seven lines
we're going to need to make first thing
we'll do is start with a line tool just
make a straight line and then make one
go upwards also make it pretty high and
this is how we're going to make our arcs
to make sure they're in the right
positions so pick your arc tool and you
can use up and down to change the amount
of arc you want I'm just gonna have mine
pretty standard and then hold shift if
you want to have it perfect okay and
next I'm gonna hold alt and shift and
drag this down just a little bit I guess
that's good so there's two three four
five six seven okay there are seven arcs
now we're gonna have to resize these one
by one just hold shift and drag each one
to the corner like so and now we have a
beautiful thing so for the line colors
with two red orange yellow and green
blue indigo and violet get that one okay
and we can delete these basis lines here
and we could do a blend and see and
select this blend tool here and then you
can see my lines aren't perfect I'm not
too worried about that then just like
this point and click here and just do it
for each one down and this will create a
nice little one for us okay I'm gonna
copy this and undo that because we're
going to do two types of rainbows okay
so here's this these lines aren't
perfect
don't really matter and then just go to
the little reflect tool and flip it
around and there we go that's a decent
looking rainbow the bottoms could be
smoothed out for this one I'm just going
to increase the stroke not sure why it's
not let me do two at once okay I guess
let's say one two three four let's see
one two three four six so it looks like
I'm going to do seven it's not touching
so I guess I'll do eight and have them
overlap a little bit hey there's
probably a faster way to do this eight
and eight okay and these lines here I
guess you could try to make them
straighter
make sure okay so you get the basic idea
you'll be able to download this drink
calm slash lab /ai it's in the
description and you can flip that around
and we have some rainbows and I hope
that helps thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
