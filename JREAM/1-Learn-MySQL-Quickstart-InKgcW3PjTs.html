gonna learn MySQL what is MySQL it's a
database and it's open source it's on
most shared web hosts is owned by Oracle
and it uses structured query language
that's what SQL means why do you want to
learn this so that you can interact with
databases through a variety of languages
it's not just limited to PHP it's used
in all kinds of languages to store and
retrieve data it's really cool so what
I'm gonna do is work locally on my hard
drive and to do that I've installed lamp
you can solve lamp or xampp if you're
using a different operating system I
also use heidi SQL it's free and open
source you can find it on google and PHP
myadmin
this is also probably on your web
hosting and I'll do my tutorials for now
in PHP myadmin
to get started so what is a database
what's it look like if I have this open
you've probably used Microsoft Excel
before or OpenOffice calc and you have
this spreadsheet you can think of a
database like this the name of this file
is untitled one so my database would be
called untitled 1 this is figuratively
by the way and all this stuff and this
here would be called a table and I've
organized my tables with these tabs down
here so users as a table pages as a
table and sheet3 as a table obviously
they can't be empty but here's an
example of one in a table you define
your columns and my columns are ID name
user and password we also have to define
what they can accept inside the fields
so your columns go across and your rows
go side-to-side or well you know what I
mean and what you do is you insert rows
of data to fit in the parameters here so
I hope that makes sense let's go to our
localhost of PHP myadmin and you'll
probably get a login screen something
like this we will learn the SQL at some
point but first we're just gonna get
familiar with PHP myadmin so we're gonna
create a new database and I'm gonna call
mine learning and I prefer my collation
to utf-8 and create yours might say
Latin not a big deal for these examples
here okay
and if I go back home you can see on my
service of MySQL I have all these
databases and we just created learning
and it's empty so just like in this
example we have our file name here now
let's create a table called users users
and in this example I just had four
slots I'm gonna go with three though so
three want three fields and go so the
first field I want I'm gonna call it an
ID okay and this is gonna be a number
value so that every piece of data we
insert is gonna have a unique
identification number that's never going
to be the same and you'll understand
that later on if I get into database
design I might I might not so I'm just
gonna leave this as an integer and value
it's gonna be 11 long I'm gonna auto
increment it and the index is going to
be the primary key we can talk about all
this later I suppose and then for this
I'm going to do
let's say user and pass so I got a
username and password this will be a VAR
car and the length I'll say 40 and from
pass will be 40 and it will also be a
marker okay and you might not understand
what I'm doing right now and that's good
because you shouldn't we're just making
something to show you an example first
whoops click Save okay and now we have
one table just like in here this tab
down here it says users and we have a
structure for the table and to insert
data into the table would you just go to
the insert tab so let's put in some
random stuff okay the user name Joe and
how about a user name Jesse and go okay
so inserted two rows and it looks like
nothing really happened but you go to
browse you'll see now much like the
table we have I'll try to shrink this
over much like the table we have here
besides the name let me delete that we
have an ID we have a user and we have a
password and this this file would be
considered the learning table and this
section would be considered the user's
table these three are considered the
columns and the data within are
considered the rows okay so if you
understand that good and we'll be able
to learn some more in some new tutorials
