to show you the appearance and graphic
styles and Adobe Illustrator and if you
don't have those windows open you could
always go up here open up appearance or
open up graphic styles okay so first
I'll just make a shape and i'm going to
show you the appearance tab first you
probably made these shapes a lot and
play with borders and everything what
we're going to do is duplicate the
stroke in the appearance panel and we're
going to have an inner stroke so we can
actually have more than one stroke on a
objecting to change this color to white
okay and I'm going to click the text
that says stroke when you go over it it
turns bowl and I want this one on the
inside and my bottom one I want this on
the outside there we go and then you can
change the size of these if you want
there we go and click it and now I have
another stroke you could even add more
if you really wanted to but I don't know
why bother yeah that doesn't look very
good one thing to know is you see how I
don't have my object selected and I'm
working on my thing here and nothing is
really changing at all even if i delete
it make sure you have your objects
selected while you're working on it or
else you won't get it right so real
quick I'm going to add a gradient to
this box I have to break open my
gradient little tool kit click that and
with the swatches I'm just going to drag
the color on here
ok and I'm going to change the
orientation of it looks good and now we
can drag this into our graphic styles so
over in your graphic Styles tab just
drag the whole shape there and it will
keep a record of all your appearances
that are set on that given shape so if
we had to repeat this shape the whole
bunch let me change my color like this
i'm going to press the V key to get back
to the arrow I could just select these
two and go boom and they're the exact
same one thing to note is that if you
scale the size notice how the border
stay the same size if you wanted things
not to do that you could change that in
your preferences I kind of like them not
to scale here's if they are scaling you
can go to edit preferences general or
just control k which I'm used to
pressing and check off scale strokes and
effects and now watch it if I make this
bigger see how much bigger the border is
compared to those other ones so I guess
that's how ever you want to do that I
personally like mine off okay so we've
got a couple of these one reason this is
really handy is let's say we had this in
a radial gradient so let me go to my
fill or let me over my gradient and I'm
going to do a radial and I wanted to
start up there oops okay good enough and
if we had like a gradient in a certain
position let's say we remake a circle I
guess it does keep the gradient usually
what happens is with new objects when
you create a new object it doesn't keep
the gradient in the right place but I
guess a dozen cs5 hope I remember that
correctly
graphic styles does have a lot of built
in ones and what I'm going to show you
is probably one you never played with if
you click this little drop-down or this
box here i'm going to do additive and we
get this little panel here and it looks
like they do nothing if you click them
and the reason is you have to press alt
and click it because they are like
additions to it so i'll click and that
just added a drop shadow and you can
keep clicking it to keep adding to it
and this one would actually duplicate it
so if i want like that like that and we
still have this one shape it has all
these styles on it like that scroll down
a little bit i'll click this one and
it'll change all these it's kind of a
weird thing that keeps just adding these
styles to it i'm not sure like exactly
what you might use this for but it's
kind of neat to know about on the mac
you'd have to press i think it's the
options key not sure what it looks like
it's kind of like this let me change
that it looks kind of like that this is
like that on the Macintosh or maybe it's
the control button not sure and
obviously you know there's a ton of all
our things in here you can do whoops
click that I got to undo that alt click
to add it on looks like this thing's
getting a little big let me make a new
shape real quick okay neon well that
just took over the whole style I can't
all click these because these aren't
additive what else do we have textures
loading loading loading boy from grading
this computer it's still pretty slow
illustrators a big ol pumpkin program
boy all that takes a lot of juice okay
well you get the general idea of graphic
styles they can come in handy if like
you're to make a cartoon character that
needed a certain appearance like if this
were skin tone for example and you had
to apply it to his skin yeah well you
guys get the idea thanks for watching
have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
