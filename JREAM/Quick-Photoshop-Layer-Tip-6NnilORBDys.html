give you a real quick Photoshop tip that
might not be that impressive but I've
learned it recently and might be a
little embarrassing that I didn't know
it so let's say I'm working in a website
layout because as you know photoshop is
fantastic for laying out a website and
by the way this is early two thousand
nine so it's pretty old when I have a
lot of layers it's hard to figure out
what goes where I mean I've organized my
folders content top bar so I could move
around my top bar and once in a while I
get things in the wrong folder so it's
over here and I really should recap that
but I don't have time to go through
every little object and name every
single layer so a little trick is you
can actually use this black arrow and
click auto select and layer and then you
just click the layer you want and it'll
jump right down to the lair if you watch
the bar on the right so if I want to
move my logo it jumps to the right layer
and moves it so that's pretty easy and
even better yet is if I have that off I
can actually use the ctrl key so if I
just have this on this layer and I'm
trying to move this I just hold the ctrl
key and there it goes so you don't have
to hunt through layers is much so if you
already knew that that's cool and if you
didn't I think this will help you a lot
and also if you guys feel like it i have
a form i started it's a dream com flash
form and you can chat about programming
get some help here or talk about
photoshop and illustrator I don't know
something to chat about have some fun
meet some people that watch the videos
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
