we're gonna make some cake and it'll be
kind of cool so just make a circle or
like that and then we're gonna make a
box like that and then we'll drag this
down so that it's in between the lines
and then just join these two together
and for the top piece let's just fill it
in with white and send it to the front
okay next we're gonna take a little
slice out of it and to do so where the
center point is I'm just gonna click
here and then to this line whoops then
down to there and let's just say about
like that back up and over
cool now I'm gonna try to make this
little corner piece also the cakes gonna
be double layered so there's going to be
a line through the middle what I'm gonna
do to get the right curve is just drag
this down make a copy subtract that and
then subtract the middle the reason I
didn't subtract the bottom was just
because of a curve issue it looked like
pops that up right there and this curve
it's gonna go on an angle so from this
point we'll just say try to keep it in
line with this so it might just be
easier to make the line like that's not
straight like that then we can move this
line down here and make sure we line it
up okay and then just drag it right down
to there
and I'm going to finish making this
little box actually I'm going to do it
from here okay
so that'll be the little stripe piece
we'll put a cherry on the top and let's
try to make that little side piece real
quick um it'll be fairly long so let's
just i guess i'll draw a square first
and i'm gonna flip it 45 degrees and i
didn't think about this one hmm i guess
that'll have to do and forgot to close
that okay so that's not gonna look very
attractive let's just do the cake itself
for the cherry the top i'm gonna make
chocolate frosting and that's usually
dark brown the gradient always looks
better so dark brown and kind of a light
brown I'll make it radial and something
like that okay and with this piece we'll
just copy that and for the little cherry
I'll just do red and for the inside this
is going to be a bread color
okay so that'll do this line this is
going to be chocolate so I'm gonna make
that dark brown and this one as well and
now I can get rid all these borders okay
and this actually needs a shadow showing
the floor so I guess we go from here to
here well something like this and that
this would be the little floor piece
I'll make one real quick I guess it
could just be a silver platter and that
would look like that and then if we want
to add some shading to make it look a
little more realistic I'm going to do a
little different type of shading this
time just make things interesting okay
and I'll just put black there and the
transparency is going to be really low
so kind of like that I'm going to do one
more layer of shading up here and a
little less transparency okay now you'll
see these lines here they're not
flawless but it'll just take too much
time to make everything perfect for the
cherry
I'll just do a radial gradient and it'll
be red and red but a little darker okay
and the cherry is gonna have to be on
the top let's make it have a low
glossiness to it so I'll add some white
there and some transparency and I'll
just do another bubble and chair usually
has a stem so let's draw that line there
make it red needs to be darker and the
edge of that line should really be
rounded so stroke and the cap will be
around cap okay
and if I want to have this bottom layer
a different color what I could do is I
could go like select this piece and this
piece drag it down and I'm going to do a
wrong one there we go the exclude and
then I'll just click this top piece with
the white arrow and delete it and I'll
move this back up here and now we have a
different layered cake I think this
should be a little different color in
that middle line there it looks kind of
cool like this though so let's just make
let me just get a darker color
brightness let's say 13 okay and you
know you could add a shadow below the
cherry and give this some transparency
and obviously this is going to conflict
with this I'll just draw a little shape
here whoops and subtract that expand and
move it below and there you have it no
need to go into too much more detail you
can download this from dream.com if you
want and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
