jess seeing in this door we're going to
look at patterns so just grab your paint
bucket on a new project make a new layer
and let's just paint it like this blue
color okay and I'm going to make one
more layer and to do a pattern we
usually click up here and we pick
pattern and they have like a couple of
them given to us that are just really
ugly so if we want to make our own
sometimes pixel patterns were good and
there's a lot of pixel patterns you can
download so you don't have to make these
yourself but we're going to do it
ourselves so let's just make a 2 by 2
image that's really little and at the
bottom just type in a thousand percent
or just scrolling zoom in and take out
your pencil tool now make sure you make
a new layer this is important if you're
going to do these pixel things cat and
just make a line and then we want the
background transparent okay then go to
edit define pattern and just click ok
and once we're here we can get our Paint
Bucket again and grab our pattern we
just created and paint and that looks
decent now the reason we did
transparency is because if we wanted all
these lines to have a gradient fate / we
could right click and go to blending
options and then do gradient overlay and
let's select a rainbow color okay that
looks cool and if we wanted to change
this background here make sure you
change this back to foreground this is
something you might forget a lot okay
and then we can change the background
there you could even go even further and
make a layer mask and we'll gradient
fade this and you see how cool that can
look with just simple lines and all it
took was a pattern now you could also
have some text and let's just say
jumbled let me make it real big okay and
lets me make it strong and just make it
that blue color okay and you can do this
with text to and do a pattern overlay
and select our little lines now this
could be used with better things than
this little thing here let's say we
needed a texture and i just copied an
image off the internet a little control
new okay pace and I've got some grass
here ok and I'll go to edit define
pattern okay and this text is actually
not thick enough so i'm going to do
impact for my font okay there we go and
back to the blending options pattern
overlay and select grass and the scale
it 100% that'll be the actual scale I
mean there's a lot you could adjust to
this and if you find a place where you
think it looks cool you can click or
unclick link with layer so that when you
drag it you kind of move it along as if
there was a background and that pretty
cool and to make this pop a little more
let's add a drop shadow or how about a
stroke just get a green color okay okay
you can even do a gradient overlay on
top of that and go through something
here that's kind of cool make a stroke
black actually white look better okay
and patterns are pretty easy and they're
very effective so thanks for watching
and good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
