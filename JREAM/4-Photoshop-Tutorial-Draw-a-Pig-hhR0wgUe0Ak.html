tutorial we're going to draw a little
big and this is to show you I guess you
know you can draw stuff in Photoshop
normally I want draw a character in
Photoshop because I like my graphics to
be vector but we'll just do it anyways
so whatever size you draw it it said
that size because if you make it bigger
it's going to lose its quality now pigs
are pink I believe I'm actually gonna go
to swatches and just select a pink color
and pigs have a little round face okay
and what do they have little ears or
they have little nose don't the kind of
like that size and you can't see it it's
on a different layer so I'm going to
hold ctrl and press u and this brings up
the hue/saturation box this would be
under image adjustments hue/saturation
okay and what do I want change the
lightness so I want to go like that so
it's just a little darker or actually
maybe should be a little lighter since
it's sticking out closer towards us okay
so we'll just have a real simple little
nose there I'm not going to name my
layers because it might just waste a
little bit of time and then his eyes I'm
going to zoom in a little more and also
be black a little eye there and I'm
going to hold ctrl press a so this is
around the edge that's select all right
here select all and then I can hold alt
and just drag his other eye over here
okay that keeps just so that these eyes
are in the same layer instead of making
more layers than necessary and on top of
his nose I'll make a layer right above
that I think
yeah they have kind of cute little nose
holes I guess I'm just holding alt and
I'm going to click his face and alt
brings up the color picker and with the
circle tool I'll just say like that and
once again I'll select all with ctrl a
like that hold alt and drag this little
nose piece over okay
then I'll hit control u like before to
pop this up and as nose holes will be a
little darker and maybe a little darker
okay
all right let's draw some ears for his
ears um I think I'll just the polygon
tool yeah I guess we could use this and
I'll just kind of whoops
drag it over here then I held ctrl and
press the letter T and that is under
edit free transform like this and you
get these little markers around the box
if you move the mouse around you can see
it's obvious you can just flip the shape
around and everything you can resize it
with the corners and if you want to keep
it in proportion you can hold the shift
key and if you want to resize it from
the center you can hold the Alt key okay
but how let's do this and kind of turn
it around put the little ear there and
about as little ear whoops
little ear over here so that I don't
waste too much time I'm just going to
probably do the head like this so I can
show you some other things okay here's
his head down here let's go to blending
options and we'll do a gradient overlay
let's find a kind of a little style we
like and that looks kind of cute for the
piggy oh that's nice
lighten that might even be nicer that's
a little too light all right I'm going
to do screen and I'm going to change
angle on it not sure how big of a deal
it's going to make and yeah okay that'll
be good so I'm going to copy that layer
style and then I'm going to find his
nose and paste it that only need to be
adjusted a little bit and about for his
ear and it's all there here there we go
and you see how this ears coming over
his head I'm just going to pop this
layer down and down and down now it's
behind his head and you can tell these
layers could get a little annoying
there's a way to make them smaller I
forgot where it's located oh let me
press ctrl K ctrl K opens up this little
box yeah I'm not going to go through
that right now but then what we can do
is I'm going to select all these layers
K and I'm going to go to edit where is
it flatten whoops oh I guess it's over
here okay I don't think you can see this
on the screen reporter over here this
little drop down way at the bottom it
says flatten image we'll click that one
and we get this okay flatten image let
me undo that one more time and I don't
want to flatten the whole image so I
want to right click this back again and
select merge layers and those are
merging the layers that are selected
okay so now this is all one piece all
right but don't do anything yeah what
I'm going to do is select all oops what
I press
all right select all with control a and
do edit copy or control C and now I'm
going to do control all Z or uh step
backwards okay and I actually don't know
why I just copied that I guess I'll go
edit paste well well now I got two big
E's
but I guess others do it this way I was
going to make a border around the whole
little daddy's face so I'd say a
blending option stroke like that but to
preserve the layers I'll just pop this
down here now see all these lines look
really ugly it's because we're 110%
there we go and now we have a cute
little piggy
I'll make them say oink Mike okay um
now with resizing this is where
Photoshop kind of lacks you know you're
going to get this with any raster and
there we want to make this piggy bigger
and say image size um well first let me
make this a lot smaller so we don't get
all that white space okay say image
image size let's say 900 okay and you
can see we lose a lot of quality a lot
of quality because it's uh no this is
just raster images it's not like vector
so try to make your images the size you
want to keep them things can look better
if you actually downsize them sometimes
- if I said let's say 100 you see it
doesn't look like it loses much quality
it just kind of fixes things up alright
well that's it for now thanks for
