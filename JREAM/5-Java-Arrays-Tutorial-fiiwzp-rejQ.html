tutorial we're going to do some arrays
and an array is kind of like a if you
think of a calendar in the date December
and in December there's 31 slots so slot
1 you might do this slot to you might do
that and it's all under the December
name except all these little slots have
their own values and that's what an
array is it's like a pocket of data
under one name and so let's go ahead and
make a variable name I'm going to make
an integer variable first integer array
under the variable name of Ages and you
see here you put these little square
brackets right after the type you can
optionally put it after the variable
like that it seems that most people
suggest doing it right after the type
because it's the easiest to see and to
do this we're actually making a list of
items and we have to put these in
squiggly brackets like this and if
you've done JavaScript this probably
looks familiar so I'll just pick some
values I'll say 12 years old 25 35 and
50 and that is a very simple array okay
and let's do system dot out dot print
line and let's print ages and see what
we get just for fun I'll do Java Sea of
VARs java and let's run it with java
VARs and we get a crazy scary looking
string that's because an array can't be
printed out like how it is you actually
have to call it based on its position
what I mean is we have our ages and this
would be slot 0 slot 1 slot 2 slot 3 and
we can access each slot with a little
square bracket in the numeric value so
ages 0
that would actually be 12 ages one would
actually be 25 so i'll go ahead and
recompile that and run it and there's 25
now what happens if you actually want to
see the entire string I'll show you that
in just a moment if you wanted to see
the array as a actual string let's make
a new one and we're going to make this
in a different way and this will also be
an integer array so int years equals new
int of how many I'll say five okay so
there's going to be five slots and the
age is up here we have four slots and
you might get confused this always
starts with 0 1 2 3 but really it's four
total so let's go ahead and say years 0
equals 2001 years 2 equals 2005 here's 3
equals 1950 and when you say in 25 this
means you can go up to the number for
meaning it stops on five so we can go up
two years 4 equals 1650 okay and to see
if you have any errors just compile it
looks good and what we're going to do is
actually print out all of these in a
string and to do that we have to import
something called the Java utility if
you've used python this is probably
familiar we do import at the top and
we're going to import Java dot util dot
arrays
okay and yeah that's just a class that
handles a race so let's do um arrays dot
to string years ok so we're grabbing
this arrays object this one we're
importing from up here and it has a
method and it called two strings or to
stirring and this makes the array go
into a string and we're going to put
years and do a string and we're going to
want to output this so let's do system
dot out dot print line and I will
compile and run and now we can see the
array as if it were a string ok so
that's pretty cool and you see these are
all out of date or all out of order
1650s at the end and you also see we
have a zero place do you remember
putting in a zero well since we didn't
define years with slot one it just put
in 0 for us because we declared this
many spaces so arrays the array class
isn't only limited to making things to
string it has a few other built-in
things so what we can do is do arrays
dot sort years and let's recompile and
run and now you see it's nicely in order
that's not all it's limited to we can
say let's make a new array of integers
I'll let's call this int I'll call it
life and I'll say new int and I'll say
12 spaces and rather than having to find
everything automatically who and just
say arrays dot fill and then we pick the
array we want to fill I want to fill
life and what do I want to fill all
those values with let's say 25 ok
and we're going to do this same thing up
here to string but we have to change the
variable to life let's go ahead and
compile that and run and you see this
nicely fills in all these slots for us
if you don't understand a raise that's
okay this is a little bit of a tricky
concept but so is a object-oriented
programming which is much harder than
just a race so practice these a little
bit try to get familiar with how you
build these and I'll make a string one
real quick so we'll say string and we
put the little square brackets here and
let's just call this all names and
equals and remember in this way of doing
it we're doing the same way as we did
ages up here you could do it the same
way we did this one by one but I'll do
it this way and don't forget to put the
double quotes around it so i'll just say
name's Jesse Joey and Jenny and Justine
okay and let's do system dot out dot
print line and even though this is a
group of strings right here there's
still array items so we have to do
arrays dot to string of names and let's
execute this and run it and there you
have those you can also sort this up and
do arrays dot sort names and let's
recompile and run and it sorts it
alphabetically that's pretty cool so
you're not just limited to numbers you
can do strings too and this is a
friendly little tutorial I hope it helps
you so just practice making these thanks
