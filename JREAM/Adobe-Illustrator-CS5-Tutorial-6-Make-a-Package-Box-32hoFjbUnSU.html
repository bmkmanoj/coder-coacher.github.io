make a box that looks a semi-decent I
guess I'm going to do it without this
tool so I'm going to go to view um
perspective grid and hide grid okay so
I'm just going to make a square and I'll
go from here
so with this square I hold the control
key down to quickly link to the little
white arrow and if you let go it goes
back to the black and that's just
something you get used to so what I'm
going to do is hold ctrl and then select
these two box these two edges I'm going
to hold shift and press down three or so
about five times then we got this
sideways box the next thing I'll do is
rotate it with the reflect tool or the
letter O and I'm just going to click on
the side here now make sure you hold the
Alt key so you get the double arrows and
then just drag it around and hold shift
to lock it in place
okay looks good so far
and the top box piece I'm just going to
make a another square like that I'm
going to move this to the background
with ctrl shift left square bracket okay
and it looks like we're going to need an
anchor point right about here so go to
your pen tool and choose add anchor
point boom and then with the little
white arrow just drag it up okay so now
we've got a box and I guess we'll add
some colors gradient preferably and I'm
just going to pick the default gradient
extra I'm going to do it on all these
sides
let's make it some box colors okay I'm
gonna see what radial looks like so if I
do a radial gradient um okay yeah
that'll be good so I'm going to select
these two walls here with ctrl + Shift
then click I and click that edge there
and with the gradient tool selected
let's see let's say the lights coming
from the right side then this side would
be the brightest and then the top would
be a little dimmer and this side would
be the darkest okay so that looks good
I'm not the best with colors um then
select your whole box and go to this
outline part right here and click the
little slash so now we have a box
without the little edges it looks like
my boxes aren't perfectly lined up so
I'm just gonna try that once more okay
there's a little white gap between the
box but at a hundred percent view you
don't see it so it's probably not really
there the next thing we'll do is draw a
line for the box closing and let's just
say it'll go across here well to get the
line perfectly lined up with the box it
probably go from edge to edge like this
and after you make that line just use
your arrow keys okay you can't see the
line if we erase the line so go back
here and let's give it a little line
whoops okay we'll make it a little
thicker and that's good for now and how
about some tape the tape is going to
fall about right here so I'm going to
copy this
shrink it down and for now I'm just
going to make it yellow whoops so I got
a little yellow box like that and make
sure you move it to the front so that'll
be the tape and now I'm going to double
click this to isolate it so it's easier
to work in I'm just going to add some
little zigzags with the pen tool and if
you don't know how to use the pen tool I
got a tutorial a couple of them down
that you can do I'm not going to be very
picky about this here okay I'll just
move it down a little bit
whoops up one more that's good enough
and then just Union the shapes okay
so we'll have our tape there and I'm
just going to pick a white and make it
transparent and then we're going to need
a piece of tape that goes along there so
I guess I'll just make a square and I'll
rotate it so that it matches up with the
angle of the box there and then I'll
position the corner here with the piece
of tape and now take your little white
pointer and let's uh drag that there and
drag that there that'll make this the
same color now there's a little line
there hanging over I'm not going to
worry about that right now and to make
it look a kind of like a cooler icon I'm
going to select all these walls here I'm
going to go ctrl C to copy then I'm
going to hit ctrl F okay and that means
paste in front so before you let go
anything hold shift and pressure up
arrows a couple times
and you'll see we have an extra box I'm
going to Union all these together and
I'm going to get rid of the thingy there
and let's give it a stroke and we're
going to give it a border let's see um I
want it on the outside it looks like
they've changed some of these settings
I'm not familiar with well I'm not sure
off the top of my head so I'll just do
eleven stroke then move it back down
with the shift down arrow and then move
to the back of the layer doesn't look
the best okay I guess I'll put it on top
then yeah I need to move this stroke
position here we go inside outside okay
I guess I'll just resize the box done
okay okay there we go and there you have
it we have a cute little box and you can
obviously see how you could go into more
detail on making it prettier I'm going
to save this file and I'll put it up on
my website if you want to download it
