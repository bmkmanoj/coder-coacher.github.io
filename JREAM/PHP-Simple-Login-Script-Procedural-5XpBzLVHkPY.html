this is a tutorial on a simple login
form so I suppose the first thing you
should do is create a file called login
dot PHP and we'll start here first what
we want to do is create a form and
that's going to accept a username and
password and then we also need a submit
button ok next we need to give the form
method and we want to post and the page
we want to post to is login dot PHP so
when we click the button it goes to this
page so at the top of the page is where
we're going to handle the login
information so you set up your post
variables for user and password I would
give these variable names also now
you'll notice um if you just go to the
page without clicking the form you'll
get these undefined indexes so really
what we should do is set a request so it
only checks if the page is requested at
attempt so when you click the button it
goes to attempt and we'll make sure it
only happens when they request attempts
this is just a quick and dirty way to
get this done I want to fit this in ten
minutes okay so if you just load the
page now it won't show that okay next we
want to create a little database I'm
just going to load PHP myadmin
and I'll create one called tests users
and I'll create a user's table and just
give a three fields of ID user and
password the types are going to be in
move our car and var car for the user
I'm just going to allow up to ten
characters and the password is going to
be 40 because it's going to be a sha-1
encryption and just that the ID is the
primary key and auto increment okay and
let's insert a user I'm just going to
make mine jesse for the user and for the
password since it's going to be sha-1
you can code it let's just do echo sha-1
and type in the password you're going to
use I'm just going to use Jesse and just
put that into the password field okay we
got a user next just erase that line and
we're going to want to do a MySQL query
and make sure the user exists so let's
create a link do MySQL connect
I'm on my localhost so I'm just going to
localhost roots and I have no password
then select the database were working
with and I believe mine was called test
users and then let's create a query
I'm just going to leave it like that for
now
and if there's an arrow with the query
let's just uh kill the script and output
in error if there is one just for
testing see what happens okay no errors
it's possibly good you probably want to
add or Die can't connect to database
just in case let's see if we can get a
MySQL fetch array just so it does okay
so that's working now let's validate the
login information so for the query we're
going to select user from users see this
is the table and we're going to select a
user where user equals user and password
equals password now we need to sha-1
encode the password so that it matches
the password in the field next we
probably want to clean the input so that
someone can't mess up our database query
so we're going to want to move the post
values below the database connection so
that we can use the MySQL real
skate string normally I use my SQL
improved but this is okay actually what
we want to do is escape the string
before we shall want it I think yeah
okay and if we want to count the results
we'll do a my SQL count and that will
want to count the rows and do a MySQL
num rows and we're doing that on the
query so let's see if we get anything
zero Jesse Jesse and there's a match II
so let's just call that total and if
total is greater than zero will login
else do nothing you can customize this a
lot better for yourself but for now I'm
just going to make it really quick so if
there's a match in the tolls greater
greater than zero let's make a session
of user and also do a session start you
might actually want to fetch your row
and put your username in there but I'm
just trying to keep this simple let's do
a header location to dashboard dot PHP
and make a new page let's call this one
dashboard PHP
and to prevent someone from happiness
page let's say if is not set session
user I think those it
session user header location login dot
PHP so if you try to go to dashboard
nothing's going to work they'll just
take you right back here that's good
oops we should probably start the
session beforehand so this sets the
session the header and let's try to
login there we go
and there's your simple login script</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
