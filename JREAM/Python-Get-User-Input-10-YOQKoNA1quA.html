we're going to modify user input and
there's two ways to do it there's input
and you say type something okay and
it'll say type something and it gives us
room to just type okay and input will
give us an error because you have to
format the string yourself so if we do
this again just type something I'd have
to put it in these little quotes and
what we want to do is make this easier
on ourselves and for someone that was
using the program and just a raw input
type here and then we can just type
anything we want okay so open up a new
window i just saved minus test stop pi
as usual and let's do one say for the
input and we'll say input equals right
input what is your name okay and once we
get their name let's do something with
it will say if let me rename this to
name actually if name let's do if length
of name is greater than 5 print you have
a long name else print your name is very
short okay and we'll run that what is
your name Jessie your name is very short
and let's say Bartholomew and you have
long name and you could do quite a few
things with this if you wanted to have
it keep going we could do a loop and
I'll say while true and let's tab these
over okay and we're going to take the
input here and pop it in here okay so
oops okay I'll run this my name is
Jessie after you type it you can keep
testing it because the while loop
never really going to end um blah blah
yeah and you could make a little fun out
of this you could say let's do a pick a
number or something pick a number and
and what we're going to want to do is
play the random number so we'll say
import random we're just importing the
random module and i'm going to say guess
equals random dot random of 12 let's say
10 so they can pick a number from 1 to
10 and once they pick a number will say
if name equals gas and we'll say print
you guess the right number else print
you guessed d wrong let's just say wrong
it was plus guess what I do comma guess
and let's run that save I pick a number
three random takes no arguments sorry
pick a number oh boy that's given us
some funky numbers okay sorry I need to
do Rand range of let's say 12 10 and
let's see 5 10 20 come on we gotta pick
a well pick a number for it looks like
that one did actually get it so I'm not
sure why that happened anyways this
isn't about a game this is just a
messing with the user input if you
really want
mess with this game I guess just play
around with it but I hope this tutorial
was sweet and to the point thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
