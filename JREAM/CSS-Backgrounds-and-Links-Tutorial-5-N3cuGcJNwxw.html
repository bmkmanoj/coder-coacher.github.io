backgrounds and lengths so let's get
started everything and your HTML
document can have a background for this
one we're going to use an image so
actually I like that background color so
you can actually leave that there and
type in URL and then parentheses then
type in the name of your background I
saved just an image from the internet
called Mario Mario jpg and refresh and I
got Mario in the background now you'll
notice that your background repeats
itself and CSS there is no way to
stretch the background to fit the
browser size you'd have to use a
javascript for that or something else
but if you want no-repeat you just type
no-repeat and refresh and there we have
one little copy you can also change the
position now this has to go before the
no-repeat and just say zero fifty
percent there it is it's fifty percent
vertically and if you want to it
horizontally just do fifty percent there
it is there now what i'm doing here is
called shorthand CSS you can do it a
long way and you would do it this way
background color is was that background
image is this background position is a
50-percent fifty percent and background
repeat is no repeat
and refresh and there it is and you can
see why do it the shorthand way and why
you should remember the shorthand way
because it's a lot faster and to do that
all of that in one line its background
and that does color and that's this is
optional to you don't have to do all
this URL a position and repeat okay you
don't have to have this here you don't
have to have this here you know this
background tag is very flexible so let's
just put that back where it was and no
repeat all right let's deal with some
links now I'm going to create some links
inside the header they're not actually
going to go anywhere um let's just stay
home and about whoops about and let's do
a contact page and refresh and we have
some links up here now let's style those
links up I'm just going to create a new
section called links and that's just a
comment the first thing you do if you
want you can do a and that stands for
anchor and just say color is white
whoops and refresh and we have white
Lynx now what a lot of people want to do
little hover effects so you do what's
called a suede Oh class and it's a colon
hover now these are a little different
and they're used in different scenarios
not just for lang
there's different suede Oh classes like
first child but we're not going into
that so don't worry about it so when we
hover let's say color equals red and we
have that now we don't want this to
apply to all things so let's say only
for the header links and we should
probably put a link there because it's
good practice now since an anchor is an
inline element let's add some padding so
that it looks a little prettier and what
I mean by in line is that it goes in
line it's not a block in line if you did
display block check out what happens it
goes on its own line we don't want to do
that and then there's also a viewed link
feature now the purple means the link
has been viewed and to do so this order
does matter so it goes a link a visited
then it goes a hover and a active let me
just add header before that so no links
visited let's just say color silver
there we go now you'll notice that the
padding applies to everything all the
rest of the links so you don't have to
redefine this in the visited or anything
I'm just going to make this white so it
goes back to the original style and for
the active one what active means is when
they're currently clicking it and like
it's loading say color yellow
well I don't know how to get that to go
so links are pretty easy and you could
have different links for your content
you could do content a length but what
you got to remember is it goes a link a
visited a hover and a active you could
also add a background to the links a
background URL Mario jpg now this is
going to look really stupid you can
barely see it so let's type in ninety
percent see if that does anything now
you can kind of see it now well ways you
probably don't want this little
background there and always the goal of
these tutorials are not to develop
terribly hideous websites we're just
getting a feel for how CSS works hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
