python tutorial and we're going to learn
how to set it up in the command prompt
in Windows if you're on linux it's
probably already set up if you installed
it and what that means you can type
Python and hit enter you can get into
the Python thing here and say you know
one print hello and so you won't have to
open the idol every time if you don't
want to or you could make you know
python and then the file name I don't
have one though so let's go ahead and
set this up and I'm going to be doing
this on Windows I don't know how to use
a mac at all so I'm just going to open
up my computer and go to properties okay
mines up my desktop in my screens not
showing it so just right-click your
computer and go to properties or get to
control panel system okay and then we're
going to go to advanced system settings
and click the Advanced tab and way down
here go to environment variables okay
and we have all this stuff here and it
looks like whoa I don't want to mess
with this and really you don't want to
unless you're cool okay so we're going
to go down to path where the variable is
path and click Edit and you just press
the HOME key you'll see there's already
some stuff in here so go ahead and press
your end key so you're all the way at
the end and you'll see i already have
mine here i'll delete it and redo it
okay and what you're going to do is go
to the very end and put a semicolon and
then you're going to put the path for
your Python this software minds on f
drive Python
and that's where my Python exe is right
here so I'm just going to have my
semicolon say F backslash Python 27 and
you can put a semicolon there if you
want and the backslash I don't think it
matters and press ok ok ok and close
this and just hit up your run key you
can go to start and type CMD or just
your windows key + R which I prefer and
type in CMD ok so let's type Python and
here it is it should be working and we
can load files in here also let me go
ahead and make one real quick in this
text file ok and I'm just going to say
print loaded this file ok and I'm going
to save this in f drive and call it test
py ok and oops let me hold ctrl and
press Z to get out of here ok and LS
oops I'm not on linux der ok and here it
is test dot P why so I can type Python
test py and it says loaded this file so
you could use command prompt to do stuff
in Python it's more useful in Linux
because you're usually in the bash shell
a lot more but i thought i'd bring this
up so that you know you're not only
limited to the idol screen and you could
use this if you have Python on a web
server and test stuff out alright guys
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
