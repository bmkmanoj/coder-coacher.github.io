some 3d studio max and this will be the
introductory tutorial I'm using 3d
studio max 2011 student version which is
free for three years if you are a
student so to get started when you load
this up you have four viewports a top
front left and a perspective most of the
time your goal is to make a good
perspective rendering so to get started
my layout might look a little different
than yours what you can do is go to
customize and customize user interface
and I went to colors and i already have
viewports selected and I changed the
viewport background to a gray color and
I applied the colors now and that's just
a little bit easier for me to see in my
opinion so what we have are our select
object tool which will use all the time
and then these three tools move rotate
and scale so try to get comfortable with
these three tools a lot of this we're
going to ignore this down here at the
bottom is for animation so what we're
going to do first is just make a shape
and get the feel for it we have our
panel over here which is where we create
objects and then this modify panel
you'll do a ton of working so let's go
ahead and make a box
and from the top I'm just going to hold
my mouse down let go and then move up
and click ok now to move around in this
viewport you can use your let me click
first you can use your scroll wheel to
move in and out you can pressure school
scroll wheel down to pan around and you
can also hold your alt key and press
your scroll wheel to move in 3d so try
to get used to pressing down your scroll
wheel and working in 3d studio ok what I
like to do when I'm working on something
is I like to isolate it and what I mean
by that is I like to click this plus
sign here sorry let me select the object
tool the plus sign here and I do
maximize viewport or the hotkey is alt w
so then we can you know kind of isolate
what we're doing so what we're going to
do first is we have a square here right
I'm going to right click this convert to
editable polygon okay and this
automatically brought us over to the
modify tab and it's what a lot of work
is done so if I want to edit this
polygon based on the vertexes I click
this little vertex here and I just say
click a point and you can see it's red
highlighted and I'll click my move tool
and I can move that out now back in my
perspective I'm going to hold alt and
press my middle scroll wheel and you can
see what we did you can also edit it by
its face so if I were to click here
I could move this out move it up play
all around so let me go ahead and delete
that and let's start over oops so they
left a little bit there so that only
gave us a very minimal corners and
everything to work with what we're going
to do is create a box again well any
size you want and with the shape select
tool I'm going to click the box and I'm
going to go to this modify panel and i'm
going to add length segments width and
height so i'm going to put three on each
side so if you're adding them and you
don't see me your perspective you can
click this smooth highlights and turn on
edged faces additional you can turn a
the smooth highlights on in the other
sections if you like in my opinion it's
a little easier to see that way so we're
going to do the same thing again we're
going to click the shape right click
convert to editable polygon and now we
have our selections here and now we can
edit it with more little squares so
click move and pull out and let's see
from our top view or their top right
here I can
move this up and you can see that it
wouldn't be too difficult to make a
shape out of just a square and to render
it up at the very top toolbar it's this
little teapot and the rendering will
render whatever window is currently
active so I'll render the one right here
and there's a odd-looking shape so what
I'm going to try to do is make a face
and not very detailed just kind of the
structure of a human face and we'll work
with that so I'm going to start with a
sphere and the segments of 32 that's a
lot okay see how many lines that are on
here that would be a lot of editing to
do and the more segments there are the
longer it's going to take to render
obviously it's more detailed and rounded
though the trick is with video games and
stuff is they use a lot less segments
let's say I have this much now it
doesn't look very round but if I were to
add a bump map and a texture whatever
you want to call it it could make this
look really realistic so I'll right
click convert to whoops editable poly on
and i'm going to select the face tool
and from the top view i'm just going to
drag a square and i want to get it on
the other side okay I'm just going to
delete that
okay so from the front view I'm going to
first carve out his face with kind of a
human head face i'm going to press alt w
I maximize this view and I'll select
here and here and holding ctrl to get
additional selections you can do that
now let's see if we can scale these two
that's not exactly what i wanted so i
guess i'll have to move them one by one
mm-hmm so you could select say a block
here move it over select a block here
move it over I'm not going to make this
perfect it's to get you started so now
we have kind of a head shaped that way
and from the left side i'll press alt w
a human head so we're going to do is his
nose custom so let's move that out move
this in now human face usually has their
jaw pointing out and to get this to
point out where we want it I'm going to
use the vertices and rather than
selecting one point here you got to
remember this has two sides to it so if
I were just to move this by clicking it
and if i go back to let me press alt w
you see it only got one side here so
what you usually want to do is select
with the little box here and drag and
that selects all of those points there
so let's go back to that in the hult w
and i'll select the square around those
little points drag out and that's a
human chin let's put his nose in a
little bit more
ok so the forehead usually sticks out a
little bit you can take your time making
it all pretty and all 2w and let's move
around here so we have a starting face
it's not the most beautiful thing now
some of the fun stuff will be one of
these tools i'm going to show you so
from wireframe i'm going to go to smooth
highlights oops that's the back i'm
going to change my front to back there
we go and edged faces on what i want to
do is add a nose here and let's maximize
our perspective view and about what yeah
this is a good point we have to mess
with a tool called chamfer okay so
chamfer click to turn it on
and I think it's on there we go I guess
select chamfer settings and then down
here we can play with it I haven't used
the new version oh this is pretty nice
so I could just stretch it like that
that'll work and it's good enough check
it off so let's move around a little bit
what I'm gonna do is move my vertice
right here down I'm actually we're going
to select both of those so I can move
them both down boom and oops boom and
ctrl-click just like both and get those
kind of on it even line with their
ok and then with the face tool i'm gonna
select this and pull it out we'll just
pull it out a little bit and then we can
tuck this back in
okay something looks uneven from a
couple points it looks like we might
need to champ for this point too so i'll
go ahead and chamfer settings and let's
see i'll just leave it to what it is we
can monkey with it so now we have that
point and right here it usually goes in
for our nose i'm sure everyone here is
familiar with a human face let's see it
just doesn't look right like we need
more points and the nose comes in closer
together so on the x axis oops oh we got
two different points here that in and
move that in and what do I guy is that
no sticking out it looks like we would
need some more points here but I think
this is a general idea to get you
started with how to model the easy way
and here i'll go ahead and render and
that's one ugly human face looks like a
fish with its mouth open but you can
change the color very easily by this
little color box here maybe a skin color
render and there it is oh man that's a
shame but i don't want to confuse you
too much play around with this maybe
make something easier like a boat
because a human face is kind of hard and
i think that will wrap up this quick
start tutorial thanks a lot for watching
and thumbs-up if you liked it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
