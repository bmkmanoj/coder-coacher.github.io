to look at database normalization and
this just helps you structure a database
and it's it makes it I guess logically
more reusable and they're called normal
forms so 1nf has a set of rules 2nf and
3nf there are a couple of rules to go
higher but they're necessary so let's
get started by this I'm using phpMyAdmin
because most people are familiar with it
and I built a database and I named a
database sorry if that's confusing and I
created a table called user inside a
user we have a primary key of an ID with
an auto incrementing integer and the
rest of this is just general stuff that
could apply to the user so let's take a
look at what would be in something like
this well we have an ID and this is the
primary key we have a login and this
would be unique for whether the user is
we also have a password for that user
and then we have a name their full name
and we have a school and then we have a
list of websites one two three and we've
created a column for each of these so
let's go back to this list and look at
the first normal form rule number one
eliminate duplicate of columns from the
same table well that's an easy one it's
all these websites so what you would
want to do is delete these two yes and
we can rename this to website
and that was the only duplicate of
column we had and you might have some
questions right now but we're going to
get into that let us go through the
whole form process step to create
separate tables for each group of
related data and identify each row with
our unique column or set of columns well
that sounds a little confusing but let
me make it simpler by showing you an
example what would be related data let's
think about that a second a password is
always unique it's it's just going to be
kind of random you know we're not going
to have a separate table for passwords
that'd be kind of silly the login should
also be unique so nothing should share
among that the name for the most part
it's always going to be unique and
there's no need to create a separate
table for that but now when we look at
the school people can go to the same
school you know what I mean so if this
guy went to Grandville med maybe this is
his buddy
and he also went to the same school now
here's what the problem is
if we were to have a database with a
table like this imagine we had 5,000
records and we had to update the user
field and look for Grandville med we'd
say if we had you know 500 out of 5,000
we'd have to update every single row and
that's just redundant so what we do is
we're actually going to create a new
table for school so I'll go back to my
database I'll call this school and I'm
just going to give this two fields
go and remember this up here it said
create separate tables for each group of
related data and our case school was the
only thing that would be related data it
furthermore says and identify each row
with a unique column in other words a
primary key and our primary key will be
ID and the title of the school I'm going
to make the ID 11 and the school 255 I'm
also going to change the title to a fire
character I'm going to change the index
to a primary key and auto increment it
okay so I can go ahead and save this and
what we have is a place to store schools
so I go back to user I'll select
Grandville med I'm going to insert
granville med and let's make a school
called Socrates okay whoops browse now
this table all it is is titles of
schools now I spelled that wrong let's
not worry about it and let's go back to
users so that was our only issue there
let's go back and look at what we need
to do next so for the second normal form
we need to meet all the requirements of
the first one we've done that number to
remove subsets of data that applied to
multiple rows of a table and place them
in separate tables okay I don't know
what that actually means I'm going to
skip this part right now because it's 2
a.m. and I can't process it step step 3
sets create relationships between these
new tables and their predecessors
through the use of foreign keys now it
feels like I'm reading a lot of
gibberish
let me show you what this is actually
saying remember how we created the
school over here and these have these
unique IDs what we're going to do is
place these keys inside of this school
row so what a foreign key is if you
don't know is if I go back to school
right now this is a primary key a
foreign key represents a primary key in
another table so what I'm going to do is
let me go back I'm going to check all
and edit these and this is going to
represent the primary key in another
table and that's what we call a foreign
key and go and what I want to do is also
change the structure of that row as you
can see it's a VAR character but we're
only accepting integers so I will change
this to int and I'll just say 11 for the
heck of it and that looks good
so let me take a step back remember how
we had a couple of websites and if I go
back up here and I read this again which
was making my brain fry a couple minutes
ago it says remove subsets of data that
apply to multiple rows of a table okay
and place them in a separate table the
way I interpret that is we add a couple
of web-sites so what we want to do is
create a table for the websites so I'll
call this website and I'll give it four
fields and here I will say ID 11 primary
key autoincrement
I'll call this URL one URL - and URL
three
change those two of our characters and
I'll save this okay so if I were to
insert some data I could say some fake
domains and I could go to browse and now
we have a table dedicated to URLs and
we're still in step two we're in the
user we're going to reference a primary
key on the website so I'll check all of
these and edit and I'll just say one two
and three these should always be
different per user so let me go back to
website and create another record I'll
just say these are fake domain names if
they're real I apologize
so back in user now these represent
their foreign keys and we also need to
change the structure once more just so
that it matches up for the website to an
integer of 11 save and that looks good
let's browse and you see how this is
cleaning things up and separating it
let's go to third normal form meet all
the requirements of the second normal
form then it says remove columns that
are not dependent on the primary key and
actually this is exactly what we just
did with the website so you might be
saying now how can I use this data let's
try it out I'm going to run an SQL query
I'll say select all from user go and I
get this but we have to use joins to get
the data out of these so what you would
do is a join so I'm going to select all
from user inner join school on what
condition on the condition that school
dot ID equals user dot school okay and
go and now we have the title of the
school now you have to realize this
title got joined on to the end of the
result set so we could remove the school
part and I'm going to do the same for
website so please watch carefully back
to the SQL looks like I have to write it
once more inner join school on school
dot ID equals user school inner join
website on
website dot ID equals school dot whoops
sorry user dot website okay and I'm
going to copy this so I can redo it once
more go and now you see we have these
all joined up on here and you see we
have these URLs here that aren't very
pretty so if we wanted to get rid of
school and website we could do that by
pasting our query since we really won't
need those and we could specify the
fields we want I'm going to open this in
a new window we want ID login name and
then what we want is a school dot title
as school this is giving it an alias and
we also want website dot URL well I
think we'll leave website alone so I'll
copy all that just in case and go
couldn't find ID and field list
ambiguous what this means is when we're
joining the ID there's an ID primary key
in website user in school now sometimes
people work around it and they'll change
this to say user ID and for the website
table they'd say website ID and so on
but I personally don't like to do that I
like to use aliases so if I were to say
select school dot ID we should be safe
go and we have it nice and pretty like
this now you can see we don't have our
websites listed there and that's a
problem so let's try that query once
or I'm gonna press ENTER and place these
down so that it can be read easier so
let me slow down and read this a second
one thing I like to do is give it an
alias for these so user will be you well
maybe I won't get into that it looks
like I selected the wrong ID user ID and
just to be paranoid I'll just pop this
before here and I also want to select
the website URL one two and three and
I'm going to select all copy and go and
it looks like I have a error
school oh that's the problem
I'll try changing that to school title
No Oh what did I do wrong okay
I own paws the video sorry I
accidentally have a comma right here and
you're not supposed to have that now one
guy I respect a lot who's an SQL expert
his name is Rudy he puts his commas
right here so that you can see him at
the end of the line and I haven't gotten
the habit of that totally but man I'll
tell you what that can help you out a
lot so I'll go ahead and go and let me
select all this this comma here sorry
about that
go and now we have all our data
compacted referencing different tables
and this is really the beauty of it you
have to imagine this is a large-scale
database and if I wanted to change
Grandville med I can go right over to
school and edit this and if they were
homeschooled say it their mother's home
we can run a SQL query go and this will
change every record for the school and
it'll it'll behave the same for sites
and everything so the plus to this is
it's smart to do the downside is that
you have to do this with a relational
database like a Facebook database they
don't have relation it's not a
relational database because it's a lot
faster so you couldn't do that on a
simple database like what amazon offers
another downside is that joins can be
expensive when you're joining a lot of
tables
and what I mean it can be it doesn't
mean it's always going to be I mean
unless you're joining a ton of crazy
things so you know do the best you can I
guess what else is there to say
it really helps and I hope you guys like
this video I hope it makes sense okay
and I appreciate you guys watching and
all you nice subscribers and I hope
everyone has a nice evening and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
