going to briefly go over selectors and
selectors are things to obviously select
things as you know I've already shown
you the ID selector let me just type
this in ok this would be the ID selector
and the period would be the class
selector um there's quite a few of them
and I'm not going to go over all of them
but there can be like colon input and
that will select all input and text
areas you can also select all hidden
elements notice the little colon before
it um there's ways to select an
attribute so you could say div and
attribute and in a tribute is something
like type or RAL and a tribute um so
this would select all the divs with the
attribute of ral if you had that in
there you can also select all the
children of an element so let's say you
have a div with the Allies listed in it
which would look like this div and if
you had this it would select the
children and which is the LI the
children of li inside a div and what
selectors do is it's basically working
with the document object model and
things are nested in a hierarchy that
you'll have to get used to and it's
pretty obviously obvious to see if you
have a code highlighter you see I click
this div it shows where it starts and
then then you see ul and then Li how
these highlight so UL as a child of div
li is a child of you L AM div
okay and if you just want to select an
element I shown you that already you
don't put anything before you just say
div you could say body and that's
generally selectors you'll use those for
everything thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
