heavy impact all across the world
javascript as well and it's probably a
good time to pick some of this stuff up
so right here I have Linux and I'm just
going to show you how to install it and
then we're gonna make a simple
application just to run a basic node
server that really doesn't do much so
there's two parts to know there's node
and then there's NPM so I'll open this
this is Windows here in the background
is my virtual machine for Ubuntu so in
Windows I'll just download 6.95 it looks
like it's 12 Meg's and this ships with
NPM that's node package manager
hopefully I have the wording right but
you can think of it like PHP skom poser
or pythons pip and I'll go ahead and
open this in Windows as a nice handy
little installer I set the agreement and
add to path we want to make sure it's at
to the path yep
that's so we can run it from the command
line
and once that's in our path you can open
in Windows at least PowerShell or
command-line others open CMD here okay
so it's installed let me open a new one
just I don't know if it's like Linux at
all where you need a new bash open so
let's try to type node ok so it takes to
send a note so console dot log one
it just says undefined so ctrl C twice
to cancel out now let's try NPM ok so
that looks like it's working you don't
need to worry about this NPM RC file at
the moment or really unless you decide
to do something more detailed alright so
that's how you install it and you should
be able to follow the same instructions
is what I do after showing the Ubuntu
installation so on a bun - you can
download it I typically go here and I do
a apt-get install node 334 possibilities
so boy there's a lot of these so there
should just be a node sudo apt-get
install node I've been a little password
nodejs
okay so it's node J s and then if you
don't have n PM you would do sudo
apt-get install I believe NPM yep all
right so then you have no js' and your
NPM package manager on Windows or bun -
and Mac is probably kind of similar to
Linux and what we want to do is the
package manager you can install global
things so I'd say something like NPM
install - g4 global and
maybe something like typescript and
hopefully I have the right permissions
but yeah it'll put it in user local Lib
node modules do you want to make sure
that maybe you're a member of the group
here and this folder has read/write
permissions so if I did a LS how about a
LS - LT a of user local Lib node modules
so okay all my group is Jesse and looks
like some of these owners are nobody and
the first thing I would suggest
installing is n I have it installed and
you would just say NPM install and G so
I don't have this is owned by nobody and
the group access is wrong so what I'll
do is sudo CH own Jesse Jesse he'll do
it recursively to user local Lib node
modules okay and I'll just hit up a few
times make sure that all right so now my
directors have permissions and I'll just
do a try that NPM again okay so if it's
already installed it'll just upgrade it
and with that in your terminal you can
just type N and you can switch node
versions I'll just hit ctrl C to cancel
out so they said the stable one was
six-point I thought it was five six
point nine five so I could control C out
so I'll say n whoops
let me clear this looks like my
terminals being funky so an install that
was six point nine six point nine point
five mmm-hmm
do I have that right
so you can do n stable and LTS so I'll
do an install stable all right
pseudo and install stable well that's
pretty weird this is the first time this
has happened
I should be able to just say and go
straight and six point nine point five
no you don't use the word install silly
me I I don't I don't always use this but
uh that's good and then I'll type N and
I have six nine five here I'll just use
six nine five since we installed that on
Windows and in Windows you can also do
the same thing I believe so what we're
gonna do just make a new directory on
Windows or no CD into that directory and
for this example I'm in projects node
okay it's just an empty folder and the
first thing we want to do is NPM in it
and this will bring up a little thing to
create a JSON file for our dependency
just like PHP composer or a pip file and
I'm just gonna leave a lot of these to
the default entry point I'm gonna change
to app dot J ass a little easier to read
and just get repo keywords author I like
MIT license and yes and you see how it
generates this
let's hit yes and if I list we have a
package.json now if you want to add NPM
packages you can do it from the command
line which is a lot easier or you can
actually just like vim the file of
package.json and let me go ahead and go
down and show you real quick if I go to
NPM J Escom here you can
tons of packages and I mean it's crazy
you name it
angular there's typescript whatever name
this has is what you would type in your
terminal for the most part it looks like
this one for some reason I was a space
which wouldn't be correct in the
terminal so we're gonna look for connect
and this is just a middleware framework
to run a no js' server it's not gonna be
how we would use Express or like a real
framework I just want to show you how to
get started so that you feel like you
accomplished something so connect would
be one we're gonna use you can define
the versions but I'm just going to well
gosh they use a really good example here
pretty much what we're going to be doing
for the most part I don't see where
they're using HTTP here let's see I see
they're using this to create an HTTP
server and listen on a port I don't
believe we need to do that just to get a
rough start so let's just make two files
I'll say touch of app KS index.html okay
so we have those files and now let's do
npm install connect - - save okay so now
if i cat the file of package JSON you
see the dependencies here we have
connect and it just installs the latest
version and then we also just want to do
a npm install of one other thing just to
display our index serve
- static okay now if I list this out you
see we have a node modules folder what
you would typically do is add them get
ignore and add node modules to it okay
cuz you know that's just a whole bunch
of stuff and whoever gets your package
is gonna say NPM install right just like
composer
you don't include all the packages so
what we're gonna do first is I'll
sublime this because it's a little
easier you guys to follow or other than
the terminal and in here I'm just gonna
say it's one hello from node welcome we
did it okay and we're just gonna serve
up this one static file now in app dot j
s this is our actual application so the
way it works is pretty much JavaScript
actually it is JavaScript and I'll just
say var Connect equals require connect
and this is the same name is what we
installed in the package JSON so let me
alt - so you see it's connect right
there and what are you end with
semicolons are knots up to you I prefer
to and we'll just save our serve static
Eagles require serve - static the reason
for that is you can't have this you know
in JavaScript with a - unless you did
like an underscore or that and all we're
gonna do is save our app equals connect
and app dot listen on three thousand and
I mean you can pick any port pythons
usually 8,000 or 9,000 I believe but
let's just do 3000 and we want to just
serve up one static file in here
and then we're almost done so we'll say
app dot use and in here I'll say serve
static and the magic of der name which
is the current directory name this
doesn't look too good
let me just close this guy out and okay
so sometimes when you have too many of
these it looks confusing
so the der name and then in here we're
gonna pass in a dictionary or sorry an
object and I'm just going to use a new
line here and I'll say index and this
will be an array of index.html and I'll
and that when I run this I just want to
say console dot log running on localhost
3000 and save all right it's really that
simple
so if I don't have any arrows SA node
app dot J s and it says running on
localhost 3000 which can also be you
know one to seven
o dot o dot one like that and remember
this is just JavaScript I mean you can
do a a lot with this you can use strict
mode I believe in node and so I'll just
go here load localhost and hello from
node and that's how you start just a
basic basic server I think it would be
good to get used to there's so many node
packages it's overwhelming maybe you
might want to look up something like
popular NPM packages and oh they have
the most starred packages well up at the
top is Express which is a fantastic
framework for front and back-end which
I'd like to get into from there
as far as working with sorry about that
working with like compiling your code
with ACMA script babel angular and
typescript and stuff that that would be
for another day but uh if we just get
and jump to a framework i think that'll
be cool so that's the gist of how to run
nodejs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
