gonna show you how to use microsoft
expression encoder just the basics first
if you load it up you'll see you have
two of them expression encoder and
screen capture and first I'm gonna start
with the screen capture what you want to
do is you get this little window you
make sure you click the audio button so
that it records your audio and it has
some options in here you can adjust this
stuff if you need to highlight mouse
pointer might be kind of cool I'll
actually turn that on I haven't used
that before and then you just press
record and it gives you this window here
let me find a little smaller it allows
you to reset you want to record and then
you would just press the record button
in Windows I have a problem if I move
this or if I resize it and I try to
click these buttons it freezes off and
won't let me do anything and I don't
know how to get back to that so I press
escape and what I do is right after I
resize right after I select a region
like this I go to record and it seems to
work so this is pretty basic you just
press record and it gives you a little
timer on the screen and you can just
talk to the screen now right now it's
recording and I'll just press stop and
then you have these a list of these the
top ones are most recent you can press
play to preview it but I'm not going to
bother I'm gonna go to the bottom and
press send to encoder and this will open
off microsoft expression encoder and
it'll just take a second to load and
there's a lot of stuff in here
I have not messed with everything and
you'll see your screen here you can
scroll out to see a better view we're
working in limited space here and you
can play it it's pretty cool if you
wanted to add an image to the start you
could right click and do add source at
start or just click this button here and
I like to put a little sound wave in
here and then I hit play
as you guys know from my videos if you
wanted a little overlay at the start the
only way I found out to do this is
right-click and go to add visual overlay
and add your thing and I just shrink
mine down to here
and then I kind of resize it so that now
you have this next on the right are a
lot of options output format I always do
windows media and mostly everything else
I leave default you can enhance your
voice I have a kind of a choppy
microphone so I usually check that off
and lastly you just click encode and
this will take awhile but not for that
short of a video ok I was making sure I
was recording audio and then if you go
to apps expression encoder 4 mm it'll
give you this window to load a project
and what I would load is this
transcoding project if you need to
transcode it and we get this same window
up here this time we will just go to
file import and you'd import a avi file
or something too
get it working all right guys thanks for
watching and I hope this helped</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
