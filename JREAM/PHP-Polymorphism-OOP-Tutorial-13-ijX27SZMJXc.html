this tutorial I'll briefly explain
polymorphism we've already done that a
little bit in the little character
tutorial we did a definition of this
from Wikipedia it says polymorphism is a
programming language feature that allows
values of different data types to be
handled using a uniform interface now
that in my opinion sounds a little
confusing
let's just pretend we're making a geeky
game once again so let's say we have a
couple of different characters they can
use like a wolf a horse a dragon and a
human and these are different types of
characters right and all these
characters will have a couple things in
common like their hip points there let's
say armor value and I guess magic power
and these would be attributes that are
applied to all of these different
creatures and polymorphism says hey
we're going to create a I guess you'd
call this the uniform interface I prefer
to call it the concrete class or the
base class and we'd say characters and
these would now be defined inside a
character's the properties that all
characters are going to have and then
these would extend characters like this
and polymorphism says these are children
of characters so we're going to inherit
all of these so in the simplest terms
that's a polymorphism</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
