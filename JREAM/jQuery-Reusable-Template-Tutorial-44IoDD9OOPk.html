show you how to make a template inside
of jQuery so that you don't have to use
a plug-in and you won't have to rewrite
HTML code the reason you'd want to do
this is because if you hit a user page
like this and you had a user list you
could have HTML code listed down here
like listing the users and a couple of
links with that options and perhaps you
might have some CSS classes and if you
were to add a user you want to append to
this list with the exact same template
but you wouldn't want to have to retype
the HTML code because if you change the
HTML code and a listing you'd also have
to change it in the creation and it
might not seem like a big deal for just
one little one-pager
but it will be when your project grows
so here's how we do it first of all I
have a get request coming in and we'll
take a look at that in a minute first
let's create a bar called listing TPL
you can call it whatever you want and
I'll make a function and since this is a
VAR i do end it with a semicolon
oops and what we're gonna do is make a
variable within here called output so
our output equals div put plus equals
this is just to put it on multiple lines
and Ferb's plus equals so what we want
to do is actually use the keyword this
and I'm going to do one for user ID plus
this stop logon and this refers to this
function here and what I'm going to do
is return the outputs or turn output it
might look a little confusing on
multiple lines just by showing you this
output on one line real quickly okay
and there oops so we have a variable
output we have some this guy's and an
object so I could say listing TPL dot
apply and that's the key word there is
apply and I'll create an object and
they'll say user ID corn 1000 and the
logon will be Jesse and that will put
the user ID in for this dot user ID it
will put login in for this dialog so say
bar data holistic apply and I'll alert
the data and refresh and there it is my
code this is a very simple example if we
wanted to
and another guy had to change this to
1000 once a Joey
refresh Jesse Joe okay so now we have a
template structure you would obviously
put other things in here like class
names and markup in here so it's all
pretty so what I'm gonna do is loop
through this to use this object I have a
get request here I'll open up Firebug
and refresh the page and you can see
inside my object I have a success of
data in an error message these three
here I'll click this guy here's my data
and what I want to get into is data so
I'm gonna do a loop through data you've
probably done this quite a bit I'll say
for VAR i equals 0 I is less than ODOT
data dot length increment I and we're
basically gonna do the same thing here
we can just cut that guy
and delete them paste them in there and
the difference here is we're going to
apply the loop value and if you look
inside of this object here data zero has
data added date modified email log and
password type and user ID so what I'll
do is place a data and I
and that won't do anything until we
actually throw into the document object
model it's over here where it says
listing at the bottom that's our little
red div container it's currently empty
I'm going to say just like the listing
and append data so I'll scroll this guy
down refreshing and here it is so let me
press ctrl shift C and Chrome and I'll
inspect the element you see these will
have the same HTML so with this add
button here I'm going to create another
little function I'll say
let me give it an ID so that buttons
value is add and I'll say add click
function I want to return false so that
the button doesn't do anything and I'll
just copy this and we're going to append
the data well I'm not going to actually
put in a real data I'm just gonna put in
a fake one so I'll say this whoops
user ID is a real big number logon cat
and I'll go ahead and refresh my page ad
and and if you look at it it also has
the same HTML content so by sending a
function with the template we can do
that very easily
also since I'm going to loop down here
you'll notice that I'm adding things
that aren't yet existent I'm sorry I
mean it's skipping things that don't
exist yet it's still going in the method
so if I did alert date this dot date
modified and this is coming from my
Jason you won't be able to test that or
refresh so what it's called it'll also
handle functions like that but I guess
one point is that it takes the whole
object you pass in but it's up to you
what you display and you don't have to
pass in additional things but throwing
up to you I think that about sums up
