I'm gonna show you how to set up a
Rackspace cloud server and get started
and put your website up I showed you
Amazon Web Services and I think I'm kind
of preferring Rackspace just for a
personal preference but that could be a
long debate anyway so I'm gonna assume
you already have an account here and you
know how it works and they pay hourly
what I'm gonna do is go to hosting and
cloud servers and I'm going to add a
server and I prefer sent OS you can use
what you like but that's what I like and
I'll just man I can't fight I'll call
this tutorial and I'll do the smallest
instance just because it's an example
what I'm gonna do is open up my notepad
right after I copy this password they
give me that way I don't have to check
my email so here and I'll paste that in
there look I still spelled it wrong and
then down here I'll grab my IP address
and boom
okay and it takes about maybe a minute
to build and what we're gonna do is some
DNS settings I have a domain here that's
not really doing anything called drag
them and I'm going to I could create my
own name servers but I think this way is
a lot more convenient if I were to
switch things around so the first thing
I'll do is go to my DNS and I got a lot
of domains in there I got dragged them
in there right now so I'm gonna just
load this up and I'm going to add let me
slow down a second after you create your
domain name we're gonna add records and
there's three records we want to add the
first one will be at a name and the name
of it is your domain so mine will be
drag them calm and the content would be
your IP address so I noticed a point to
it and time to live would be 300 and
that's added okay
the next thing we'll add is a cname or
canonical however you say it
and that's drag um compost ww this is so
that it can go to our actual website TTL
means time to live so okay and the last
thing we'll do is a mail exchange which
is the MX record
and I can just do drag them calm
content is the same time to live and
priority I'll just put this to 20 if
it's your main domain I don't know put
it to 10 I actually don't really know a
lot about that right there sorry ok and
I think I clicked ok so now that we have
that what we can do is go in here and
set our name servers and Rackspace cloud
servers has these set up that where you
can just point to what is that DNS 1
something GoDaddy's always really slow
for me I don't know why I use them I
really don't look at that I'm gonna
pause my video a second ok we're back
and I'm going to attempt this again with
GoDaddy and for my name servers I'm just
gonna say I have specific ones whoever
you're using it doesn't really matter
because you can train change this
anyways DNS one stable transit calm and
DNS 2 dot stable transit calm if you
ever need to find out what these are
sorry that was a pigeon sound effect if
you heard that you can always look up on
Google for Rackspace cloud server name
server that's a lot of that's a mouthful
of word okay so that's all good and now
that we have our server kind of chillin
here right here
there's our IP address make sure you
have that copy we're gonna open up putty
and putty is a free software which you
can use and go ahead and paste this in
and I'm just gonna save my session so I
don't always have to type this in and
then we're going to open our SSH
connection except the key and we're
gonna log in as root and here's the
password I was given so I'll copy that
and a patient just right-click now you
won't see anything but it went in and
the first thing you probably want to do
is change your password then you do that
with pas swd and I'll just pick some
random well that's a bad password let me
try again I'll just say poopie oh I
typed it wrong
let me type it here
goofy face one
okay uh okay here we go password
poopyface one okay I just right click to
paste that in so the first thing you
want to do is a yum update I'm not going
to do that because it's gonna take about
10-15 minutes what we are gonna do is
install virtual min and let me pull a
window from my other screen over here
okay and I just looked up virtualmin
install I'll go to this page and I'm
going all the way down to here and I'm
just gonna copy this link address and do
a double you get all right click
and I'm gonna see what's in my directory
I have that file and I have to make sure
I can run this so I'm gonna change the
file permissions just too bad I guess
and then we can run it with dot slash
installed that Sh
yes I want to continue and this the
fully qualified domain name I'm just
gonna put in drag them calm because that
was the name we're using but you can
have a lot of virtual hosts in here you
should just put something in there ok
and this does take a little bit maybe
eight minutes so let me pause the video
and think okay it looks like virtual men
finished and the reason I'm doing
virtual man it's because one it's free
to have been using Plesk a while and
although plastic is pleasant in some
ways my buddy Shane let me know that you
know Plesk
it makes copies of like the php.ini and
messing around in the ssh with something
like Plesk installed in my opinion is
kind of difficult and virtual men seems
to do everything kind of cleanly anyways
so we should have our IP address and we
should be able to go to HTTP ass oops
our IP address and port 10,000 now it
has to be HTTPS
just ignore this and I'll login with my
username and password and don't worry if
you think you're clever I'm going to
delete this server after I'm done with
this video okay
and it had some post installation
instructions pretty straightforward I'm
just gonna fly through these you can
read them all if you'd like but it's
just saying hey how do you want this to
roll
we do want MySQL and for the password
I'm just gonna use poopyface one again
and next
and next
okay and I'll just recheck this
I mean it's just pointing and clicking
we don't need to dilly-dally around--
and what we're going to do is create a
virtual server for the example site I
showed you and that will be drag them
okay okay okay
and we're just gonna create a virtual
server so it's pretty straightforward
here it's just gonna be dragged I'm calm
my administrator password obviously you
should use different passwords and all
that to be safe and under enable
features I do not need to set up a DNS
zone
dabbe logins you can click this by the
way to see what they are I don't want
that and awstats I'm not a big fan of it
and this will just automatically create
a MySQL database you could do that
yourself if you wanted and that looks
good and we can create the server
okay
loading loading okay and now we have a
beautiful thing in here and what we can
do inside of here is go LS let's see
where we are I'm gonna actually remove
install that Sh yes and remove that
virtualmin log yes okay it's gone and
I'm gonna go down a directory list and
it puts our files in a home so C home LS
and see the dragon folder every time we
create a virtual host it'll have the
name in here so I can go CD drag them
and list and sorry it's hard to read
that blue font public HTML boy that is
really hard to read but I'm gonna go to
CD public HTML and there's nothing in
here and what I want to do is make a
file I could do well I want to actually
put something in it I'll say nano sorry
I don't like that then index dot PHP
right because I'm a newbie and I'll say
echo drag home okay
make sure you don't have like a problem
and you're typing here if you do pH
because it's gonna show a empty page
I'll just say hi
control X and yes enter
make sure it's in there okay and I'm not
sure okay it's ready already your DNS
might take a while and your domain
people like my GoDaddy might take a
while to update in this case it went
kind of fast but here's the domain name
and that set up you can do a lot of
domain names what you'd want to do
though for starters is a little bit of
security you might want to SSH key
that'll make it a lot more secure like
this isn't very secure at all so what we
want to do is change some the route
logon we don't want that enable because
that's really insecure for hackers and
they always look at that to hack you so
what we're gonna do is Nano our little
text editor of etc' SSH access oops HD
config okay sshd config and I'm gonna
edit this and the first thing I'll do is
I'm actually going to make it so that
you can only connect on a special port
not like this is that fancy but let's
say they can only we can only get an SSH
on this port okay so I'm gonna make sure
to write that down
that'll be careful with doing this part
because you can lock yourself out
and a little page down and page down
here it is permit root loggin you want
this to be no okay and I'm going to
press ctrl X Y Enter
now before we get too excited we have to
create a user that we can login with
okay so I'm gonna say add user dogface
okay now we have a user name dogface and
I want to change the password to him
password of dogface and let me just
write this down dog face and
kittib at 500 shoes that as a password
right click enter
right click enter and now we have a
little guy in there now we're gonna have
a big problem if we try to log into this
right here okay
now while logging this route and my
previous password was this right click
enter actually sorry we didn't even
reload the rules my mistake
we actually have to reload the rules and
I believe that is a service sshd restart
ok let's try it again and we'll load
open
and it won't let us in because remember
we changed the SSH port to 777 and we
also have to allow the IP tables to
allow that poor so let me save that so
even if I try to open this the IP tables
is blocking it so we have no permission
to do that and I'm trying to remember
where it is
let me try find from the base okay it's
searching if you ever want to cancel a
search like this you can press ctrl C to
cancel it control okay I think that's
/et see sis config so I'll do nano et
Cie this config IP tables enter and for
my SSH port that's a little ways down
there it is right here where do you see
22 I'm going to change this to seven
seven seven now you got to be careful
because sometimes this will insert a
funny line here so make see that make
sure it doesn't do that control X Y
enter and I'll do service of IP whoops
tables
restart okay no errors and sshd is
restarted so now we can log in to
tutorial loading loading did I get that
right because I made a second
yeah that's the right Court hold up okay
I'm what you call an idiot and I put 777
I meant to put 7777 let me get back over
there we go
Oh looks like it watch I'm gonna reboot
it I think I got that extra line yeah so
I gotta go back and edit it see how it
made a new line right here boom control
X yes Center okay I'll try that again by
the way I'm hitting up to go to previous
commands I typed okay that's good now I
can try it here load open yes and I'm
gonna try to log in as root with my old
password of poopy face one right click
enter and access denied good and let me
log in as the other guy it's a good idea
to keep an extra one open in case you
lock yourself out and make sure this all
works what was a dog face
right click enter okay and now I have
dog face and if you want to get to your
root power
you just type Soup for a super user and
the password which was a what was typed
it wrong anyway so you guys get the idea
that's just a general quick start wow
this video is getting a little long so
that's a quick introduction you could
create more virtual servers if you'd
like and it's a lot of fun virtual means
a program I hope this helps somebody
because getting started with all this
stuff can be kind of confusing and
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
