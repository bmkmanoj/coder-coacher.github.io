fanatics in this tutorial we're going to
look at Python operators and comparisons
and these are pretty standard throughout
many languages so they'll be really good
to know first let's start out with some
operators we've we've kind of dabbled
around in a couple of these and we're
going to just get them all listed down
to be sure first we'll play with some
you're probably familiar with I'm just
going to go right into the shell here
and this one let's just say five is less
than ten and it'll give us a boolean
value and boolean is true or false
boolean this means true or false ok
there's the greater than so 5 is greater
than 10 and it gives us false there is
the greater than an equal to so 5 is
greater than or equal to 10 and you have
to put the greater than before the equal
and the opposites true with 10 is less
than or equal to 12 ok so these are just
some standard operators there there's
also the comparison of equal to so we
could say 10 is equal to 10 and that's
true then there's the not equal to which
is 10 is not equal to 10 and that's
false there's another one and this is
sometimes in MySQL also and this is not
equal to but basically this is saying 10
is less than and greater than 20 which
basically translates to not equal to
personally I prefer this one the
exclamation and equal sign okay so those
are what you call them value comparisons
you can also do object comparison so
let's make a variable and say a equals
10 and B equals i'll just say 10 and i'm
going to do the is operator and that
word will highlight
okay so I'm going to say a is B and
that's true now what if i change b210
point oh i'll type a is B now it's false
because in reality 10 point oh is a
floating number and 10 is a absolute
value so that's not true if we have we
also can do it this way a is not to be
so you can use these little ways to
compare things you could say if a is not
be print dog and you can use these in
your if statements which is pretty cool
and with our other way of doing it with
the values you could say if 5 is less
than or equal to 10 print pig and the
prints pig if you want to group these
together you could always say if 5 is
greater than 10 or 10 is less than five
print what are you doing and it looks
like neither of those were true so it
didn't do anything now what if we do
something like this AE quills fish and B
equals fish let's see a is be false
let's do B equals fish with the same
lettering and let's say a is B and
that's true now even though these
strings have the same values there's
still different objects it's not
comparing the exact memory resources
comparing if the object has the same
value and real quickly let's go over
some boolean functions just so we get
this down there's true and false okay
true and false it has to be typed with a
capital letter all the time so this
can't work has to be a capital letter so
if we said
if one print one whoops it'll print one
what is one mean basically one would be
true ok one equals true and zero equals
false ok so what if i said if zero print
one and it doesn't print anything so try
to remember that if you ever see a zero
it's going to be false if you see a one
it's going to be true on the other hand
what if you had this if zero print one
we get true why because this is now a
string in a string that's not empty is
always true ok if I said if just empty
print one that is not true because it's
an empty string alternatively you could
type B ool short for boolean and it's a
function and it will evaluate whether
the statement you wrote in there is true
or false instead of doing if statements
so boolean of empty string is false and
you can do this to figure out how they
work bool one and this is just things i
should cover the first but if you don't
know them I just try to pick these up
real quick alright guys thanks for
