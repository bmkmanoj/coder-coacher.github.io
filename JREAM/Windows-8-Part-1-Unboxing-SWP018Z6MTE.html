windows 8 pro pre-ordered came the day
it was released very nice got it from
amazon for a sixty dollars there's a ten
dollar off deal and pre-order deal and I
didn't want to shoot a video until I had
some energy took a nap get some
starbucks little fall season caramel
macchiato or Frappuccino whatever so
here's windows 8 I got this already on
opened it this is all it was in plastic
and I looked at the case I thought well
this is kind of silly okay yeah it's
just kind of corny a bunch of balloons
and green cheese and spirals some things
I don't understand that they do so you
open it and you got this key here and
this is like a card just kind of cool on
the back is my serial key and I will not
turn that over and then you get a little
welcome pamphlet that's just like hey
welcome does you how to do some stuff
and it has a 64-bit and a 32-bit version
it's just one license for whichever want
you to use and again some more balloons
I don't really understand what they
picked this color and these things for I
think it looks really silly I went to
bestbuy and try it out some of the
windows 8 laptops today I want to save
up for one for the meantime for my
desktop I got this logitech touchpad
it's wireless and rechargeable and it is
eighty dollars my wife forced me to get
it oops i already opened it so that i
won't have so much trouble while doing
this so i just have to
pull it out okay and it's this big old
touchpad man I know Apple pioneered this
whole idea at least I think so they have
a touchpad doesn't mean they pioneered
it in all it is it's just a touch pad
and it feels really nice it's heavy and
it's sturdy it's not like a cheap piece
of plastic like on a lot of laptops it
feels like that material they're making
a lot of the new windows pcs with sorry
or just a regular pcs which is really
nice stuff and it feels good I haven't
used it yet but I'm at this will go hand
in hand with Microsoft Windows 8 and
then inside of here comes with a toward
if you want to leave it plugged in and
attached to the bottom is a little USB
poke down in there so I'm going to
install windows 8 shortly and get a
little starbucks it's really nice out a
nice fall breeze so I'm kind of holding
off on it i'll be honest i really hated
windows 8 when I tried it and I'm giving
it a fair try when I used it on a laptop
at the best buy with touch screen and
you can clip the laptop around
especially the lenovo ideapad i was like
wow this is cool i think with all these
new ultrabooks coming out and how good
androids getting my wife just bought a
tablet i think apple is going to have to
really up their game to to stay cool you
know i don't i don't know how they're
going to compete with how good these
products are coming out man but a that's
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
