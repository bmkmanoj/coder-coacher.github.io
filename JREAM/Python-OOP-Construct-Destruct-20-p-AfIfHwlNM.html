tutorial I'm going to talk about the
construct and destruct and an object if
you don't know object-oriented
programming don't panic I'm just going
to touch on these topics a little bit
jump back into some regular stuff and
you won't need to get too scared because
00 p is it's pretty tricky stuff okay
now we've already made a class in a
previous tutorial so let's do the same
thing I'm just going to make a class and
call this test and make sure you save it
I just same I'm as obj dot py save it to
whatever you want and to do a
constructor let's just first do one we
type def for the function underscore
underscore in it underscore underscore
okay and the little parenthesis for self
and let's say prints we created the
object okay and basically what it stands
for is initialize or it's a magic little
function so when I hit f5 nothing's
happening right now but i'll say T
equals test enter and immediately when
you create a object or instantiate one
it runs the initial it function every
single time you create it so if you had
a bunch of functions that needed like a
two run through when you create an
object you could use the in it and i'll
probably try to do better and explaining
stuff like that further on but we want
we don't want to get carried away
there's also a destructor which does the
opposite when you delete the object you
can have it do something obviously it
can do more than just turn out a message
and this one is underscore underscore de
l and we'll say print deleted okay and
I'll run this I'll say T equals test
whoopsie-daisy and if I hit T you know
it exists and everything and to get rid
of this object i could say T equals
false t there we go I'm not sure why
that took a second to go through let's
try that again t equals test okay T
equals false there we go and you see
this will be called when we disrupt it
if this makes absolutely no sense that's
okay object-oriented programming is
tricky but we just want to touch it a
little bit and that'll be good for now
one thing i will mention and when we're
extending a class okay you don't need to
know this right now usually up in here
where it says class test we usually have
the word object in here i have been
reading around and I can't exactly
figure out why you have to put this in
here so it's okay to put this in your
objects now T equals test and that works
T equals false and that works so sorry I
don't have a good explanation for this
yet but we're going to need to put this
in for future reference and I'll make a
tutorial on how to extend a class and
just try to make it easy to understand
because this is really hard stuff
alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
