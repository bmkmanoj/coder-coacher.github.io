at namespaces in PHP 5.3 and up and what
I have here is an index file loading a
couple of sample classes so here I have
a database class a form class in a
validator class and we're going to use
the namespace so generally what you do
is you'd say new database new form and
new validator and if I were to refresh
we get all these here now when we want
to contain things database form and
validate the validator are really common
names so you know you could name it
after your API like if my API was called
Jessie I could make all my class names
prefixed like that and you know Zen
framework what they do is I think they
do Zend underscore they do theirs like
that so that looks should look familiar
book you should take advantage of
namespaces and to do that let's go ahead
and create a namespace I'll just say
namespace Jessie and that has to be the
first thing at the top of your file you
can throw in comments above it if you
like but nothing else I'll throw that in
namespace Jessie and in validator since
he's in a subfolder I'll say Jessie
slash form okay and I'll go ahead and
refresh so what's happening here these
classes are defined on a global scope
okay so think of a namespace let me
build a little common block here
namespace is K and we have a global
and then we have like the second level
custom custom custom and then we can
make children of that children of that
okay so try to keep that in mind when
you're making namespaces so what we'd
have to do is I'd have to say Jessie and
backslash database that's how PHP does
it with this backslash and this guy was
under a child of form so really this guy
he's right here on this level and then
he goes one down and then to the global
so refresh and those all work pretty
easy now there's limitations to
namespaces you can't like do everything
with them for example here's something
interesting you might not have known you
can use define because it says it
protects constants in namespaces okay so
we'll do a namespace of Jessie and dog
okay if I do echo dog will actually get
a result this is a dog and it says
you're not supposed to and the reason is
because define acts different than the
word Const okay so I'd say constant dog
equals this is a dog okay so let me
delete this one because define is always
on the global namespace what Const can
be put into namespaces so refresh and
undefined constant dog so I have to put
this guy over in my namespace Jessie dog
refresh and this is a Dom another thing
you can do is function so I'll say
function talk
I'll say hello mount and again if I try
to run talk we'll get an error they
can't find the function talk so I have
to say Jessie slash talk and refresh you
can see how it's all contained in my
little namespace here one thing you
might run into with namespaces is let's
say we have a database here and I want
to do a new PDO now I'm going to get an
error because I'm not passing parameters
in this PDO object so if i refresh
clacks Jessie PDO not found the problem
is that in this database class were
actually in the Jessie namespace so if
you want to load a global class you
would put it backslash before to go down
to the global so if i refresh their way
there we have it the error but it's
getting to PDL at least that's one thing
to keep in mind another thing we can do
is alias our namespaces so if I was
inside my database and I wanted my form
class to be in there if it had a
different name I suppose we could use
the validator class because it uses
Jessie slash form if I were to do new
validator I'll save and refresh and it
doesn't find that even though we're in
the Jessie namespace so I could do form
slash validator because you'll notice
that here it is right there
we're in the Jessie namespace right now
so we can do it that way but if your
namespaces got really long so just for
an example
oops I'll make this a really long one
copy that and I'll just make sure to
comment that up up I'll just put in the
whole thing here make sure that works
oops up in database gotta so here's our
really long namespace what we could do
is alias it and I could say use Jessie
form lesson item as I guess FLI so
instead of that I could do
FLI and that should work
database line whoops I forgot my
semicolon
refresh and here's the lesson on
validator shows up twice because we
called it here in there so that's a
short little handy way to alias
