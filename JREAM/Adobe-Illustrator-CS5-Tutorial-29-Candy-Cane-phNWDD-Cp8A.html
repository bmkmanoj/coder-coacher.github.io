let's do a candy cane and this will be
pretty easy I'm just gonna select the
line tool and the arc tool just hold
this button down usually it's on the
line and just pick the arc and I'm gonna
hold shift and just drag a line and what
I'm gonna do is mirror that over with
the reflect tool or the letter O and
click on the Anchor Point and hold alt
and shift to flip it over and then what
I'm gonna do is click this point here
and then just hold shift and click
somewhere below now you'll notice if you
move this it's not attached and I
haven't gone over this in a tutorial yet
but we're going to join these two anchor
points so select your white arrow and
make a little box around those two
points and hold ctrl and press J and
that will join the two pieces together
looks pretty good I'm gonna make the
stroke let's say 70 okay and it doesn't
totally look like a candy cane I guess
we might be able to add another point
here with a pen tool I just click this
dot here and I'm gonna try dragging this
a little bit older now that's pretty
ugly but there we go so it's kind of
like a circle almost and then with the
black tool let's select the line and go
to stroke and cap the edges with a round
cap okay and it looks like candy canes
are usually a little bit longer so you
could select this point and drag it down
if you need and if you don't like the
size of this just yet
I would first expand it and just go to
object expand and there we go now it's a
little object like that so have this I'm
just going to make a copy of it so that
I don't lose its form if I ever need it
again just in case we mess around with
this too much
and what I'm gonna do is hold control
and shift and press G a couple of times
and that's to ungroup it because when
you expand something you get all these
layers see we have a path a group layer
and we really want this just to be none
of that so I press ctrl G a couple times
and it's just the path okay so we're
gonna now use the drawn side feature
right here so click that it's kind of
hard to see it's the bottom right little
circle pie thing and you'll see these
dotted lines around the edges and what
we're going to do is draw some lines or
some squares so select your square tool
and let's just make a square a real long
one let's flip these around get rid of
the line there and I'm going to send
this up by holding alt and I'm also
gonna flip this pretty slanted okay now
what you want to do is we have a nice
little square here if you accidentally
click and loose place just double-click
the item again and you might have to
double click it again to get to that
level and I'm gonna alt and shift drag
and basically we're Andre's us all the
way up here you can see this not long
enough once we have a copy up here so
I'm gonna actually stretch this a lot
longer there we go I'm just gonna press
control-d
a couple of times so the spacings all
even and when you unclick it we have
this nice little candy cane
you could add some gradient to it if
you'd like I think I'll go ahead and do
that with the red and I'll just drag red
here and maybe a little bit darker right
and with the white I'll just select each
one of these whoops don't want to select
the background and how about a little
white gradient with just a little bit of
gray just a touch okay and here's where
this little piece could come in use we
could use this as a
I'm just gonna hold alt and drag it over
here it just kind of snaps to it for us
and now I'm going to get rid of this and
use the line let's say shoes are red I
guess and this is going to be a border
around it and we want to send us the
back so hold ctrl shift and press the
left square bracket button and let's see
what color might look a little better or
how Green would look that looks kind of
silly but anyways there's our simple
candy cane and you can download this on
dream comm and I put the download URL
inside of the description thanks for
