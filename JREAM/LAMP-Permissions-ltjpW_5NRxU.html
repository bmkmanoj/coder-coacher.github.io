to make a correct permission system
using a lamp so that's what we'll do I'm
going to do this quickly in digital
ocean so let's start and create a
droplet or if you have running elsewhere
that's fine i'm just going to call this
lamp too because i was playing around
and for fun I'm just gonna do this I'm
not going to really pay that but it's 50
cents an hour it'll probably take me 10
minutes to do this I never used machines
that powerful with 12 CPU so make it a
little interesting and select a region
that's closest to me now I will say
digitalocean offers this this lamp
installation I personally don't like
things to automate what is actually
really easy i like to know how things
work i'm sure this works pretty good and
you could adjust it but i don't like to
do that I like to use DBN because it has
slower releases and it's very stable
ubuntu comes out a lot more rapidly but
since most people probably fav her a bun
too i would stick with 1404 because its
long-term support i'll go ahead and set
this guy up and create the droplet and
you can use the same commands on a bunch
of in debian pretty much they both use
the app package manager and its really
nice so that's creating and then you
would check your email if you're using
digital ocean and i already got it so
open up my terminal this is a windows
terminal but it's really get SCM inside
of console too so I have all these
options I've talked about this a hundred
times so I have an IP address they
emailed me so I'll say SSH route at and
I'll just paste it in okay and hopefully
that's done getting set up I don't want
to get an error then they gave me this
crazy lowercase password that i'll copy
I just like to be sure it's set up and
i'll hit enter
it looks like it's hanging ctrl-c i'll
press up and enter okay this is a I'm
glad they showed up actually so this
happens because I made a previous hole
so it looks like it's using the same IP
and I said yeah it's okay and what I
have to do is remove the old item so you
probably don't have this in your
terminal just to type sublime to open
sublime text so I'll do this kind of a
normal way and drag this over I'm just
going to go to the users folder which is
Jessie that's who I am and the ssh
folder if you can't see it it's because
your folders are hidden and windows so
you could type / ssh and it's this known
hosts file so I'll just edit this with
no pad or whatever scroll to the very
bottom because this was the last one I
recall doing I'll just delete these
records let's see line 35 I don't know
what that IP addresses I'll just delete
that save it and I'll press up it's
going to ask me to Rivera Phi the key at
least I hope so it's going a bit slow
I'll try it again
there is no record of that inside the
known hosts so that shouldn't be an
issue well is my internet working yep
422 my internet is working there we go I
don't know what the hang-up was so it's
going to estimate real tenta Kate I'll
say yes and it adds it to this little
file here and that's just user base same
thing in Linux and Mac it'll add to a
known hosts file boy it's really going
slow its crawling and that's a that's a
big machine man alright so then i'll
paste in my lower case password they
gave me oops spot i was on linux i need
to right click and paste wow this is
slow i don't know i don't do the
previous box i made was a lot faster so
my current password i have to paste it
again and a new password i'll just make
something up okay first thing we always
want to do the afghan update with any
box so that um we have the latest
packages and then apt-get update or
sorry upgrade yes so update and upgrade
pretty simple and we're going to set up
lamp which is very very easy
looks like you had a lot of stuff to
update ok so we're already on linux
right now so that takes away the l4 lamp
so we needed a MP that would be a patchy
my sequel and PHP right and let's do a
apt-get install apache2 mysql server and
php5 you could even do PHP 5 dev for the
headers if you had a PHP I something
like compile a package I won't go that
far into it we're keeping a sweet and
simple so I'll say yes and we'll get
prompted for a password three times and
I'll just leave it empty because I'm
going to destroy this anyways okay at
this point i will copy the IP address
they gave me and once a patchy installs
and reloads we can test the page out
this is like the very minimal
installation for a lamp stack up and
then you can move up and install more
stuff i will show you the pseudo i'm
sorry i'm a root user right now so i'll
just type apt-cache search and php5 dash
and these are all packages you can
install for php5 like em crypt and em
cash internationalization you can also
do apache mod are there it is live
apache to mod that's a library for a
patchy lib apache to dash mod and they
have a lot of stuff let's see if we need
any doesn't look like it looks like PHP
cow automatically installed with it so
that's up we can go to our site and load
the IP and there's the default page and
let's see d &amp;amp; 2 bar ww boobs okay and it
went into an HTML folder it looks like
so let me go down a director into LS LT
a alright so this has all root
permissions I want to see what the yep
that's were also now if i type ps4
processes aux and i do a pipe grep
apache2 I want to see it's running as
user ww data and most likely the group
ww data so what makes this easier is if
I just do CH own dash
are all right let's do chgrp so this
will change the group from root to ww
data and let's do CH group of dash are
so it's recursive to every file I'll say
ww data and I'll say www ok so now I'll
list out the permissions for ww ok so
now it's the group there so I'll CD in
the HTML sorry ww and just make sure ok
so let's make a new user I'll say let me
make sure you get this rate add user
Jessie sorry its user add user ID Jesse
and I want to add Jessie to the user
group of Apache our sorry ww data so say
usermod' an existing group would be dash
a to append it i believe and then g of
the group name will be ww data and the
user will be Jesse ok and you'd probably
want to add your user to sudo usermod' a
I'll type vazut oh ok and scroll down
and you can add your user in here if you
want i'll just type Jesse all equals all
all all and I'll whoops control x and
save yes now i'm going to type go down
or directory i'm going to do chmod g +
RW inside of the WWF older and I want to
do that recursively ok now i'm going to
type sooo Jesse now I'm the Jesse user
ok now I'm going to see the end of ww
type LS LT a and so the owner of the
file is root but I'm in the WWE to group
so i should be able to touch test txt
and there we have it so cd2 w 2 cd2 HTML
touch test txt i should be able to edit
index HTML and just add some stuff here
I don't know if I have went with him our
nano index okay control x so now i have
permissions to edit anything so if you
ftp din and upload a file let's see what
my user did LS LT a now the only problem
we have is that jesse is the user and
the group so if someone else came in and
tried to edit this they would have to be
either a root or jesse in the group i'm
bad guys sorry I totally forgot what I
was doing I had to go the bathroom so
bad whoo that was not fun so with this
um off the top of my head I don't know
how my user Jessie would upload a file
and then change the permission since I'm
the owner I should be able to say CH own
of test txt up let's do CH group sorry
of a CH group to ww a to test txt I'm
guessing it's going to want me to sudo
it no LS dash LTA okay so as long as you
keep your stuff is ww data let's say I
have a new guy named Ralph and I add him
to the group let's let's just do that
real quick user add Ralph sorry pseudo
user add Ralph and was the password I
made and that wasn't it
do I know it
this is totally embarrassing um the sudo
su well we can scratch that idea off the
list I just to make my passwords right
and I don't want to rack up charges on
digital ocean because I'm cheap so
that's basically you guys just keep your
groups ww data and anytime you add a
user just usermod it I'll type history
for you and do we have it nope I made
the users route didn't go to plan but I
hope that helped</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
