and this is a tutorial to learn CSS
you're required to already know HTML
that's a pretty easy
tagging language to pick up if you don't
know what you might be able to follow
along the other thing the web browsers
as you know there's quite a few of them
ie six seven eight
that's internet explorer then there's
Firefox Chrome and Mozilla they're sorry
Safari for Macintosh I believe those are
the main ones
but they'll appear a little bit
differently for me I'm going to be
working in Chrome and I'm not gonna pay
attention to ie6 because anyone using
that is probably from another planet
because it's so terrible and out-of-date
in my opinion and Firefox and Chrome
usually appear quite the same I don't
really mess with Safari I'm not done in
these tutorials so I suppose we can get
started I'm using notepad plus plus if
you're wondering and the theme I'm using
it's called Zen burn and notepad plus
plus is just a nice editor that will
highlight your code for you and has just
a ton of features that you'll really
like so the first thing you'll want to
do is create a new folder and create an
index.html file and just start out your
HTML document I'm not going to worry
about the document type that's what
usually goes up here doctype I'm just
gonna try to get this working pretty
quick now as you know how HTML elements
let's start with a heading tag and call
that the web page will create a
paragraph
and just say this is some text to repeat
that a little bit and how about a
horizontal rule about a div container
add some text in here and there we have
a couple of elements to work with now
and here's what it looks like the
webpage okay now what CSS is it means a
cascading style sheet and basically a
style sheet is what makes your HTML
webpage website look attractive and the
way we write that hmm I'm going to use
an embedded style first you can go ahead
and type this I'll just do style type
equals text slash CSS and then and the
style now if you look at this body here
this is called an element and CSS the
way you change things is you have either
an element an ID or a class now I know
if you look at these three things it
might look intimidating but it's really
not an element is anything that's
considered an HTML body h 1p
these are all elements now if we go to
an ID that's defined by ID equals and
we'll give it a name and it's kind of
the same thing for class class equals
hello now these won't do anything right
now as you can see I'll refresh the page
because we've given these know
definitions the difference between an ID
in a class an ID starts with a number
sign and a class starts with a period
so why would you use one or the other
well the ID are four elements that are
used in the page one time those are kind
of like let's say you have a header div
ID equals header and you're only going
to declare that once on the page that
would be an ID because you're only using
a once usually you just use IDs for the
structure of your site and classes are
things that are used over and over so if
we wanted to apply to classes as a bold
phat there's three classes applied and
we can also use those down here but
don't worry about that we'll just start
off with some pretty simple CSS on the
elements erase all this okay so we have
our style tag here what do we want to do
let's start out with a body and body is
going to apply to this and as you know
the entire HTML document that appears is
within the body there's the body tag all
the content and the ending body tag so
what do we want to do with the body
let's give it a background and that's
pretty easy you just tell you background
:
the color name let's say green and
semicolon I'll explain the syntax in a
second see that pretty easy the way CSS
is written is pretty similar to well I
don't know what it's similar to I guess
PHP functions a little bit but uh you
probably don't know PHP if you're
learning CSS hey you type in the name of
the element so we did body and
everything we want to do to the body
goes in between
curly brackets like so and I just hit
enter a few times so that it's easier to
read on different lines so we had
background with a : green semicolon this
is the keyword I guess you'd call it and
this is the definition or the value so
you could do more things like color
white and that will change our font
color to white easy peasy
there's a lot of tags to go through
though such as margin and a margin is
like a invisible spacing kind of like on
a piece of paper the margins where you
don't write in margin five pixels see
the PX
that means pixels let's do it bigger so
you can see it whoops there we go now
there's different units of measurements
also there's a M centimeters I think
there's millimeters it looks like it
points for the most part for sizing I
use pixels for fonts however many
suggest using a DM because an Internet
Explorer you can't resize with the font
resizer anyways you need not worry about
that at this juncture so let's do
another one so you see how this body tag
works everything we put in these
brackets will be applied to the body now
let's do one for h1 h1 squigglies and
we'll do background purple and refresh
there we have it you're learning how to
make a very ugly website
and just say let's try for the paragraph
and as you know the paragraph starts and
ends here let's say border 1 pixel thick
solid line white will probably go into
this more later but you can just type
that out for now and there you have it a
char which is a self closing tag because
of that slash there which means
horizontal rule let's say height equals
10 pixels there it is it's a lot taller
so this is CSS this text in here I'm
going to show you how to do things more
efficiently and we'll probably get to
that later but for now thanks for
