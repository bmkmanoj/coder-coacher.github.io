to learn about sub selects and what I'm
gonna do is create another table real
quick so I'm gonna go to my query and
just make sure I have learning being
used so use learning and let's create a
table and call this one threads and I'm
gonna of course have an ID with an
integer of 11 not null and auto
increment increment there we go
don't forget the underscore there mm-hmm
and I'll have one called title with var
character of I guess 50 not null and how
about a description if others do DES see
now desk is a keyword in my SQL so we
have to back to get that and I'll do
this one just as text not null and we'll
do the primary key and that will be ID
now let's execute that okay and I'm
gonna hit f5 refresh and here we have
some threads excuse me
okay so inside of threads what I'm what
I'm gonna do is tie some of these in
with the posts okay so in the post table
what we're going to do is create another
row and call it assigned thread sorry
another column so I'm gonna go over to
the table and I'm just gonna add a
column and I'm gonna call this a sine
thread integers good yeah that's pretty
much good then just press save now that
was an alter table query if you scroll
up you can see what we did alter table
I'm not going to talk about that right
now though so we have our posts with our
data in the assign thread is null so the
this will be another foreign key
I'm just gonna put some numbers in here
okay I just want one two three one two
three and I'm gonna make three threads
okay
and I guess I'm just gonna insert a row
and ID will be one title will be the
life in description and just some stuff
in here and let's insert another one
another one I'm pressing f2 by the way
to type in these okay not a happy time
stretch this over and one more because
we had three IDs I always call this one
blah okay so if you imagine this was
just a very simple form we have threads
which would be kind of like a the main
topic and then we have posts inside the
thread now we could assign a user on the
end for someone that started the thread
but we're not making a form I'm just
trying to display an example okay so
let's see post all right there we go
let's get to the query and make a sub
select first thing we're gonna do is
select all from posts make sure that's
working looks good and we're going to do
a sub select with the where we're gonna
say where posts dot assigned user not in
okay
and this is pretty cool because we're
gonna only select post values where
there is no existing user so I'm gonna
say we're not in select ID from users
and I'll execute it okay you can alias
this if you'd like remember we went over
that with the word AS basically what's
happening is we're selecting everything
from post and the where statement
filters everything out based on what we
put in it and we're filtering it out
based on the assigned user that is not
inside the users of the ID now that
sounds confusing and I'm not sure about
the best way of explaining it but I hope
you do follow okay you don't have to do
not in by the way you could say in and
execute and now we get everything pretty
much if we just did a regular select you
can also do equals greater than so we're
gonna select the assign user we're
select ID equals users mm-hmm and we'll
say where well okay I'll just execute
this it happens okay
we're post assign user is greater than
okay look
let's do men of ID okay see things are
getting a little complicated with
sub-queries so we're selecting all from
the posts and we're the assigned user
which is this field is greater than
according to this sign the minimum ID
and the users and if we go to the users
table and look at this the minimum ID is
1 so if posts assign user is greater
than that it will select these so that's
a little confusing let's do it with the
threads table now and I'm just gonna get
rid of this or I'll do a sign thread
equals okay so remember we just made our
thread table we're gonna select all from
posts where the assign thread equals
what and this is kind of cool so follow
with me instead of finding it based on
the ID we're just gonna find it based on
the content of the thread so I'm gonna
say select title from threads where
title equals and let's see what I wrote
in one of these lets get them from life
okay we're titles life and execute
select title sorry select ID okay
because the post assigned thread
remember this is a foreign key sorry I
have to flip around these tables and it
might break focus a little bit
remember this assign thread is a primary
key here and this says over in threads
the ID to talk to and we're searching
based on the title here inside of
threads and then we're comparing the ID
to the post query
so I'll execute this and rather than
searching by the ID like I just said
we're selecting the ID but we're
searching based on the title okay I hope
this is clear tried to examine this
query for a while until you understand
what's going on and hopefully this isn't
too confusing
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
