show you how to make a button like this
so when you hover over it it changes the
background and it's not too difficult so
the first thing I'll do is open up
Photoshop and I'll redo this for you
I'll say new and I'll just say 400 by
400 pixels okay and I'm going to zoom in
quite a bit and importantly look at this
info box here it's a little eye you're
gonna need to use this and if you click
that little drop-down tab and go to
panel options this is what I have on
I think document sizes I guess I don't
really need that you just want this
width and height thing and you want to
make a button that's even in size and
like let's say a hundred by thirty so if
you multiply that by two it'd be you
know a two hundred by sixty and you'll
see what I mean I'm gonna take the
little rectangle tool well I'll use the
rounded rectangle I have a radius of
four pixels and the mode it's set on is
this one for raster are not the vector
art and I have mine on anti Elias and
this will give us a little bit of
shading on the edges so this might make
it a little bit bigger I'm gonna take
that off and watch these W and H values
when you make your shape and try to make
it the size you want I guess I'll do one
twenty by thirty okay and that's a
perfect shape if we had anti Elias on we
would do let's say one twenty by thirty
but this shape if you zoom in even
closer it has little faded pieces on the
corners sometimes it makes faded pieces
on the top too and the bottoms so you
want to get the exact perfect size you
want it
so I'm just gonna use this plane we're
all up in one here and I'm gonna hold
alt and duplicate it and you want to
move this so that it's touching the
other one I control you add some color
I'll do this one I guess blue again and
all I did was right-click and add some
blending options I did a gradient and I
set the transparency real low and I'll
copy the layer style paste the layer
style good and then we just have to crop
this image so this is really two buttons
in one image but we're only going to
show one but one piece of it at a time
the benefit of this is also that you
only have to load one image file and you
will not see the white blink when
another image has to load so I'll save
this for web and devices and as a PNG so
that it has a transparent background you
could save it as a GIF
since this doesn't have anti-life edges
if you want and i'll call this button 2
dot PNG and over in our HTML i'll say a
class equals button href equals nowhere
and I'll get rid of our previous one we
had here and retype this so what we have
is a dot button and we'll say
background:url is button to dot PNG and
we'll do no-repeat so on the page I'll
hit refresh and we have this little
button here we can see the backgrounds
in there just barely and an anchor is an
inline element and we need to make that
a block so I'll do display block you
could also do display:inline-block if
you like I suppose I'll do that so that
I can put a couple next to each other
and I'll show you what I mean
here's display:inline-block it puts them
side-by-side but they're still blocks or
if you just did display block it takes
up a whole line I'll just do inline
block and we'll do what height and let's
look at our image again I'll hit ctrl a
to select all and the width stays the
same 120 the height is 60 and we'll I
want to show half so 60 divided by 2 is
30 so the height will be 30 pixels the
width 120 pixels and refresh we're
almost there
and I'll say font size is 12 pixels
color is black text aligned will be
Center
and refresh I don't want that little
underlined there either so I'll do text
decoration is none and I'm gonna do some
padding on the top to try to move it
down a little bit so I'll do padding top
will be eight pixels and anytime you add
padding you have to subtract it from the
overall dimension so I'll put height
down to 22 there we go and the next part
a dot button and the suede old class of
hover and I'll do background position is
zero negative 30 pixels so it's using
the same background here and it's going
to move it to 0 30 to negative 30 and
there we go that's pretty easy to do and
it looks really classy thanks for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
