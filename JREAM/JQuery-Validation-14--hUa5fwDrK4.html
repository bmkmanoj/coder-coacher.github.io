tutorial for jQuery we're going to make
a form validator that's pretty simple
and let's get to it first go to Google
and look for jQuery form validator and
we're going to get this one on B
assistants go here and just go ahead and
download it looks good and you'll get a
zip file and here's my working directory
let me delete this here okay I have my
index file
this can be HTML by the way that's fine
my jQuery file I'm just going to drag
this big old thing in here okay and in
the jQuery validate this is our first
time installing a plugin
might be a little scary we'll go ahead
and just grab one of these I'm going to
use the pack I'm going to cut
right-click and just go to paste so it's
in the same directory and let's get to
our index file I'm just going to clear
out this and let's start over
so first doctype HTML I'm going to pause
the video so I can type this real quick
okay guys we're back I just typed all
this up real quick so to shorten the
video and we have our standard HTML
document here with a document dot ready
function refresh make sure the alert
works and we're going to include the
jQuery validator plugin and this is open
source by those guys over there and make
sure you include this after your main
jQuery included okay and also make sure
you don't have dot J s repeated twice
sometimes if you copy paste it might
trick you up okay so we're going to make
a couple fields I started with one right
here and let's just do a name email
password and verify password so we've
got four of these I'll say email
password and verify password for
password I'm just going to give these
some names I'll just call that one
verify okay and I'll refresh looks
alright let me just add a style
definition in here and we're just going
to say a label width is going to be a
hundred fifty pixels and display will be
inline-block so it looks a little more
attractive we also need a submit button
so I'll get rid of this here and this
type will be submit okay and let's wrap
these in a form tag for my D equals
register I'm sorry I'm rushing through
it I did record this video and it got
over ten minutes in my recorder wouldn't
let me go so I'm trying to hurry it in
here
alright so the first thing we do is we
assign the validator to the register
thing the register ID so register dot
validate and this is the form down here
register validate and it's not going to
do anything yet if you refresh it
because we got to put some rules in here
and put in another pair of the squiggly
brackets and let's go down so now we
create a I'm called rules and this is
basically an array of items okay
so you should be using a text editor
with a highlighter so you can see where
your brackets connect if you can see on
my screen this is white and you can see
a little dotted line close to there
because it's pretty easy to mess up how
many squigglies or a little curvy things
it out there
all right so now we pick the name of our
fields we have one called name we have
one called email and we have one called
password okay now we also have verify
password but we don't need to do
anything to that and these are actually
going to be multi-dimensional arrays you
know there's rules names email password
and more stuff goes in here these don't
have to be arrays but I think it's
easier to type it this way
so for name let's just say required is
true for email we're going to say
required is true for password required
true okay and for email we're going to
say email is true meaning it will
validate a real email address for the
name will say min length is 6 and we'll
also do that to the password and the
password we want this to match the
verified password so we're going to say
equal to and then let's make a ID of
let's just call it verify so that has to
match the verify password input field
although this has the name verify I'm
just going to do verify okay and if i
refresh this submit it says this fields
required if I type in an email says
please enter a valid email good and
it'll go away as we do it okay and I'm
saying enter the same value again and
it's not the same value so it's not
working let's just do
there we go that's pretty cool
name and the way to format your error
thing you can say label dot error and
I'll just say color red add some CSS to
that to make it pretty one thing that
you should know already is that even
though this validates on the client side
you're always going to want to validate
on the server side so however you
process this form please validate it
through the server because someone could
turn JavaScript off and just put a bunch
of junk in your database all right guys
that's it for this tutorial
sorry I went through a fast go ahead and
rewind if you need to I'm trying to
squeeze this in under 10 minutes thanks
