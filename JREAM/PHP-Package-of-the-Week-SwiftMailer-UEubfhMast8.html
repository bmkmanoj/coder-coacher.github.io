the week time for PHP and we're gonna
use Swift mailer you've probably heard
of it but I might as well mention it and
we're gonna use it for
SMTP I know PHP I send mail but when
you're working locally you can never
really get your mail to send because say
you have WAMP or a lamp or a MAMP
configuration this will make it easier
so the website it looks a little dated
but it's made by the author of symphony
I'm gonna be using mandrel for my SMTP
service you can also use Gmail or
mailgun or 50 other ones it's free you
can look at the pricing here up to
twelve thousand emails a month is free
so I mean it's hard to beat that and
what we need to do is use Swift mail and
integrate this SMTP service so let's go
to Swift mail here Swift mailer I'll
just grab 5.22
and I have a projects folder packed
through the week a composer and an index
file and we've done this before I'll
just paste this in I'll add a little
tidbit with a squiggly and get rid of
the two that means with that it could
update to like 0.8 0.7 those are usually
non-breaking changes tossing that in
there for your luxurious convenience and
let's do a composer update okay while
that updates let's go to the index file
make sure we include the autoloader
require I'll do it require once today
vendor auto load PHP boom so Swift mail
has pretty good documentation it works
wonderfully think about it like this a
transport it really equals a method of
sending email API a SMTP server
whatever okay and we're just going to
create one transport for now we grab a
factory with swift underscore SMTP
transport I'm not a big fan of the
underscore here but that's how they did
it new instance okay and here go all the
way down
we need the SMTP address and then the
port okay
additionally we need to sometimes set a
username password it depends on your API
mandrill happens to use a username and
password so I'll set username and I'll
set password and notice how I'm chaining
these all together just for readability
sake actually I want it like that
okay so this creates an object of a
transport yet there is no instance of it
being used okay
so first let me get some creds I'm gonna
login to my man drill boom and here's my
host my ports five eight seven so here's
my SMTP host my ports five eight seven
years might be different my username
it's just my email with mandrill I could
use my dream email but this one's where
I get most my junk set password and it
says just using API key so I created a
temporary one sorry I blurred a few
things out cuz I don't want to get in
trouble and we do that okay so while we
have this the first thing to do is say
okay this looks pretty cool let's make
sure nothing went wrong so it's just PHP
index no problems also type PHP - I for
info in do grep of SMTP and make sure
you have protocols under here you have
SMTP
installed otherwise in your PHP I and I
just enable it
search for SMTP I think it's on by
default I go through so many PHP
versions I can't remember anymore
next we can attach this to a mailer so
I'm just gonna call this swift equals
swift mailer new instance then we pass
in the transport and what we're going to
do is create a message so send a message
we create a message equals another
factory swift message new instance my
special subject okay and you can end it
here or you can chain it I like to chain
it it's just easier to do set from set
to like that and with this the from
address it can be just an array or a
string I like to do a raise so I'll say
set from me at local da host and then
this would be my name
Jesse local host and I'll set to I'll do
an array also this is just so that I get
my email and that will be to Sir Jesse
okay so we're not done yet we need to
make some content this is an important
important message okay so we have some
HTML in there I did that for a reason
now optionally you could keep attaching
stuff or just do message and that I like
to keep chaining it sometimes so I'll
set the body and I'll say content this
will be text slash HTML because that
bold tag is HTML and then we can also do
part and this one will be strip tags of
content and text plain okay so there's
our message now this is our instance of
our transport engine or API this is our
message content okay and now we just
need to send it will say swift remember
this is the instance of all the mandrill
goodies and I'll say send what I want to
send the message this guy here all this
crap and then what I'm gonna do is just
do a result equals that and I'll var
dump the result and let's make sure we
don't have an error
okay so I'll do PHP index dot PHP okay I
spelled new instance wrong so new
instance new instance okay and
successful and now since I'm using
mandrel sometimes it cues up and you
wait a moment other service might be
more rapid but let us wait and see okay
so I'm gonna drag my little gmail over
here I know it's really small because
you know there's a lot of personal stuff
in here so it took about two minutes to
send it probably because of a queue and
here's the Jesse local host my special
subject and this is an important message
and that's basically the gist of it to
use last thing I did ask if you could do
me a favor I'll put a link in the
description if you could fill out a
simple questionnaire of how it can make
improvements to videos so that it's
better for you and probably the majority
will rule and you know do you like to
see mistakes the speed of explanation
the length of videos so please fill us
out if you feel like it some of the
questions are optional down here and do
not put in anything personal
okay this only goes to me don't put in
passwords or anything and you know you
can just tell me how bad I suck or
anything but it's really up to you and
thanks a lot for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
