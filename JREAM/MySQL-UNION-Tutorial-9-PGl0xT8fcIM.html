we're going to look at Union okay and
let me type that out Union I'm gonna
briefly go over this now you remember
when we did our inner join and joins let
me just do that one more let's say
select all from users or how about posts
inner join users on a sign user equals
users ID and you remember how we have a
bunch of columns and they get added
horizontally what a union does is it
stacks it on top vertically and we'll do
that for a second let's say select star
from users Union woops
select star from folks and this is going
to give us a error and it says you have
to have the same number of columns okay
because it's stacking it on top of each
other so what I can do is this I can
still let's just select one from each
I'll say select title or name and title
okay and I'll execute here we have our
admin the John user and now it's all the
post records down here you might not use
this much but it's good to know that you
can do two queries with a union as long
as your selections have the same amount
of things here if you wanted it to do
two columns you could say ID and how
about a sign user and execute and
although this is the name field we also
have titles in here okay when this is
Union this just goes under the name
column okay you could say name as blah
if you remember we did a license or
alias and here we have it they're pretty
short tutorial but I should mention this
if you ever run into a situation where
you need to use it alright thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
