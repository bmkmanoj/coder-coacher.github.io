this is turning out so I'm gonna do his
body now and he has a little uh well i'm
gonna use this tool he is kind of a
little round body here and guess like
some hair hanging over that so i'll make
some hair ok and i'm just going to group
these together and put it behind his
little chest hair piece I think it might
be a little higher oh well then it's got
a little he's got some arms so make some
arms and they're going to kind of curve
over and I'm going to do a warp and an
arc that's a little too curvy think
that'll be good expand the appearance
and let me get the same color as his
head up there or wait I'll just continue
drawing them for now I think he has a
little bit of a body behind here too so
i guess i'll add that they're okay and
he has some gloves and those are like
little triangles at the top the hands
going to be a little trickier to draw i
guess all
do this again and I'll try to draw a
little thumb on here okay and I can move
that up a little bit and move this down
his hands should be a little less round
I think let me get rid of that anchor
point okay um okay yeah that's not bad
so zoom back out and then he's got some
legs I think his arms might be a little
smaller so I'm just gonna shrink them
down whoops okay and I think this little
character has pretty big hand so that's
pretty good and then he's got some legs
so I'm going to warp this as well and
send it to the back he's got some little
socks I I believe they are like two
little rolls like that and then I'll
just group these together and then he's
got his shoes um I'm going to try to
draw those on a little bit of an angle
so kind of like this
okay that'll probably be good and he has
a white on the tip of the shoe so let me
fix this corner okay I think his socks
are a little bit bigger and then he's
got that little line there so i'll just
do this and make a line and i'm going to
separate these pieces so the shoe will
be red on the inside and the fronts like
that color let me expand this and the
color of his little legs that's a pretty
good color I can just use the eyedropper
tool to pick up all these colors okay
and then I'm going to flip around uh let
me group these first actually i think i
should add a little more detail first to
shew i'm going to make that a gradient
okay and sock I guess I'll just leave
like that for now I'm going to add a
little bit of shading on his little
joints so like right here where the
glove appears i'm going to add a little
bit darker color well I'll do black
cumin some transparency okay yeah
that'll work and it was pop it in there
well that doesn't look very right and I
guess maybe under here or his arm starts
okay that might look a little bit funny
and no big deal um I'll pop one on here
and right about here and then he's got
some tales to come out I'm not sure what
the bottom of this body parts supposed
to look like I don't have a picture by
me so I'll just leave it that way his
tails um I guess what I'll do is make a
square and get rid of a point then i'll
do a warp on it i think i'm going to
want to do maybe a wave no let's see how
this works out no I guess I'll just do a
narc it'll probably do the best results
it gets pretty fat at dandiya that looks
good I'll expand it okay and then he's
got a little zigzags on the tail here so
I'll just add some of those let me get
rid of the border on it so some zigzags
and I'll join these up cool and then the
end part of his tail it's just kind of
like a curvy little thing whoops okay
just need to adjust these little pieces
here that'll be fine move that to the
back extra might look better the other
way around so like that yeah that's
pretty nice and then I'll just get the
white on there and then it's little tail
color but we got a problem over here
let's see let's see race this handle
there we go I'm going to group these up
and is tails usually a little bit fatter
yeah it looks better and then I'll flip
it around with the mirror tool and pop
that in the back he's got two tails so
it's kind of like that I'll change this
one up a little bit so it looks a little
different and ok and now we'll group
together the arms or the leg and then
group the arm in its own and time to
flip these around just got to put these
above the tail and below the body ok
send these to the back I guess I'll have
to straighten those out a little bit
better ok now it's it's it's starting to
look like them I might go into more
detail i'm not sure yet but i think
that's right now it's a good place to
stop thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
