project I'm working on just for fun and
I wanted to bring up a jquery form
helper because this is starting to drive
me nuts so normally we have just like a
form here and what we do is we call an
action and we can eject submit it so how
would we do that the way I like to do it
is I will go to the top and look for the
form and here's my form and I have a
project form alright so i could say idea
of project form dot submit function
event
and we'll do it event not prevent
default and then i'll do VAR URL equals
this attribute and i want to get the
action because if i go back to the top
see the action will be the URL now i'm
in codeigniter right now so it looks a
little different you might just have a
do create PHP or something but we get
the action I like to do bar post data
equals this serialize and that'll
serialize the data then we do the post
so say dot post URL post data function
and i'll say data for the callback stuff
and I do comma J some and in here I do
if result equals one once data dot
result equals one else or fail alert
success okay so i just typed out all
this to handle the form and what I'm
getting it is if I have a lot of Ajax
calls this is going to be a lot of crap
to copy and paste so let's go ahead and
see what happens I'll refresh the page
create a project
and success let me open up my console
just to show you and create a project
and create success and let's see what
the network xhr says and it shows that
the form data we posted a title a
description a category ID in a CRF token
this just comes from a coded I know
right here so i found the it's a lot
easier just to do something like this i
believe this and I'll uncomment this and
i just made a function called handle
form i pass in the ID for the form and
this is the success message and this is
the call back so i'll save this I'll
refresh my page let me open my console
so we can see this and I'll say hey hey
and submit oops a two
in the console create and you know what
happened here total field must be at
least four characters it is created
there we go project ID 17 successfully
created so I did all that code with just
one line of code and I made it so
optionally you don't have to pass back
data so it could just be like this to
handle a form but like let's say you
wanted to do something with that data if
i go to my console i have this object
data and then the project ID it looks
like i have a typo there but with that i
could manipulate the Dom like let's say
this table roll had an idea of 17 if
this were a remove action i could remove
it but since it's a create action I
would actually append it probably to the
bottom or the top so what I'm getting at
is this I shall open up my j/s folder
and I have a file called Ajax j/s and
this is great basically what it is I
just include the file and this does all
the work for me we have three parameters
l for the element you know you pass in
the string the success success text
which is optional and the success
callback which is also optional so this
does exactly what a submit does like we
did before but it handles it for us now
you'll see that i have the VAR URL and
the bar post data doing all that for me
i have the post here and i have a result
i will say that my jason i always pass
back a result of one or zero which is
successful or fail I mean if you're
Jason called back is like
hold that success you can do it any way
you want and change the class so you
don't have to pass in a string if you do
it'll pass back hey its successful
otherwise they'll just say success you
could change this all you want and it's
quite simple what I will say is i'm
using a custom result class and the
reason I'm doing this is because it
makes my life easier to show and hide
those little Twitter bootstrap results
so I'll go to a result and this is kind
of a class that looks like it's written
in PHP and right here if I did a result
dot success in passing a message it will
make sure it's not undefined otherwise
just passed back success and then I just
have a div of success and I have a set
time out here to hide it after five
seconds and I have the same thing with
error but the different with the
difference with error is if I pass back
Jason from codeigniter or any PHP script
what I did was I detect if it's an
object so you can pass back a string or
an object and it'll display all the
errors let me show you an example so
I'll get rid of these two fields and
click create and see it shows both of
these errors here so when I go to my
network you see I have error title and
description so it can display one error
or many errors so it's kind of useful
now these classes are just in beta and
stuff and I'm releasing them on
bitbucket and if you'd like to fork I'm
and improve them feel free to now I know
this isn't like a all-in-one solution
like it's kind of like to simplify
things for example this ajax class i'm
sure people have made a lot of different
flavors of it and they're probably a lot
better but i really like things to be
straightforward simple and to the point
so that I don't have to configure all
kinds of options
you know what I mean that's just how I
like to do it but feel free to go to the
bit bucket which is bitbucket org slash
dream / jsu tilt and i just put this up
there and you can clone it for kit mess
with it make it your own or anything but
uh I hope this helps you guys because it
saves me a lot of time I wish I would
have done this sooner and if you have
any better suggestions please let me
know because i really like things that
save time thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
