dream comm in this tutorial we'll make a
simple little file logger as an object
and the reason I'm jumping right into
this is to give you a little practice to
make objects so let's just make a class
called log and um what we're going to do
is have a feature to write to a file and
read a file so let's do public function
right and we'll do public function read
now when we write to a file we need to
define a file name so let's put in a
string file name you can name your
variables whatever you like and string
file name and when we read a file we
also do the same thing and you can just
pop those in there and what we're going
to do is a file open so let's do file
open and just take this string file name
here and the type of way we're going to
handle it we're going to append to the
file because um we want to use this
let's say like is an error logger and
then we also need data to write into the
file so let's make a file I don't think
a pen will create a file so just put a
plus off the top of my head I think that
will do something let's put this into a
new file first actually cut this new and
class log and I'll just call this log
dot class dot PHP and then the main file
require once
log dot class dot php' and let's do log
equals new log let's make sure we don't
have any errors ok good
now when we write a file let's pick a
file name let's say um log right and
let's just say test dot txt I'm not sure
exactly what that will do and check your
directory that did create the file so a
plan append plus is good and you're
going to want to make sure the file is
writable
depending if you just install it on a
server if the chmod functions
permissions are different so do if is
not writable string filename and we'll
do die and say change your chmod
permissions to string file name so that
way we know if something is going wrong
there so we have this open we're going
to also want to write text to it so
let's do comma string data and the data
will be what we write into the file
and to write into it we do F right now
we got to give this a handle call it
handle equals f open and we're going to
F right to the handle and this is where
we put in the string data and then we
close the handle F close handle now as
you can see this looks pretty procedural
but let's not worry about it I think
this is good because it's very minimal
you're going to notice your code imagine
if you had 20 different blocks like this
and in your class you're going to want
to comment things so I suggest doing it
the phpdoc way and let's say description
is a rights to a file and a pram string
and string file name the name of the
file pram string string data is to be
appended to the file and when you read
through this you'll know exactly what
you're doing so we go back here to test
and let's say my name is Jessie and
we'll refresh now what do we have let's
see okay that inserts let's refresh
again make sure it's appending reload it
alright that's good
now for the logging let's make it so
that every time we write into the file
it puts it on a new line and we'll just
do it down here
and after the string data just go like
this and do /r n refresh whoops okay and
that did not work because it has to be
in double quotes so that it parses the
newline characters refresh
and open there we go
wait that does not look great I think
it's maybe just our four windows
string data /r actually let's put this
before it so you see if that does
anything refresh and test reload there
we go okay that works
sorry about the confusion and um that's
pretty easy right there I'm going to
comment this out and let's work on the
reader so for the reading let's do a
handle equals F open string file name
and we're just going to do our and we
are going to do um let's drive file get
contents and of the string file name and
we're going to return this and then over
here let's do log read test dot txt and
since we're returning the value we need
to echo out this okay there it's
printing and I suppose you'd want to
echo um you could do pre so that
displays it how it is in the text file
like that just ignore these arse and
ends up there we made a mistake earlier
that's pretty pretty easy there I think
this is supposed to be a five up here
maybe a four who knows so you can see we
have a simple class here we probably
want to comment this up and this just
has string file name only and this uh
routing a file and you also do a return
comment
and this returns a string and it returns
the text file okay yeah that's pretty
good for now and no need to make this
tutorial any longer all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
