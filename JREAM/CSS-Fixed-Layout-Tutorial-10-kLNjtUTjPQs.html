make a fixed layout from scratch we just
have our standard HTML document and we
have our CSS file and of course the
reset from Yahoo so the first thing
we'll do is make a div idea of header
and let's do three two more one for
footer one for content one for sidebar
and that'll that'll be pretty good I
think and let's make one called a rat
will wrap and these two are going to be
wrapped together in that so next let's
do some CSS say we add header we had a
wrap we had content with sidebar and we
had footer so I'm just gonna give a
border of one pixel solid red I'm gonna
pop that on all of these so that we're
gonna see what we're working with
and let me load up the page so workspace
yes okay
here I have this let's give these a
height let's say height of 200 pixels
contents sidebar those are I'm just
gonna give these a height normally
you're not gonna put anything in here
but I'm just doing this for so that it
looks all right and let's refresh and
we've got a couple of boxes so to do a
fixed layout let's do the fixed layouts
when you define the width so
let's make the wrap contain that
contains the sidebar in this certain
size so say width equals 980 pixels
that's a safe width for 1024 resolutions
for the sidebar we're going to do
float:left and let's refresh okay
and for let's see sidebar is inside the
wrap let's make the sidebar 200 pixels
and refresh and now it's there now if
you look to the let me add text so it's
easier for you to see what we're doing
sidebar content header okay here's what
we're working with the headers up there
sidebar footer and what we want to do is
make the header the same size as the
wrap we could put the wrap around it
actually I guess we'll just do that like
so and now we have a nicely contained
layout and looks like it's almost good
to go I don't know if I'm missing
anything content yeah I guess that's
good and I feels like I miss like a
clear of a float I guess just to be safe
in your footer just say clear:both and
in your content you don't have to define
a width but you could say float right I
think I might cause a problem though
yeah because we didn't define a good
width so just leave it like that and
there's your fix
way out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
