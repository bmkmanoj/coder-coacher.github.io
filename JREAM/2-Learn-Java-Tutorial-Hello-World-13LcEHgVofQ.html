we're going to make a hello world java
program so I'm just in my f drive
workspace Java because this is a easy
little place to get to for me and the
first thing we do is right click new
text document and i'm going to call this
hello dot java you should always have
your classes with a capital letter and
let's open this up with your favorite
text editor first thing we do everything
in Java is an object and an object must
be wrapped in a class so we do class
hello and then we do the squiggly
brackets and everything inside the hello
class goes between these brackets here
okay and the name of the class must be
the same name is the file so hello has
to be called hello Java and you should
always capitalize your class names so
the first thing we have to do is called
a main argument and this is for your
main script one Java the runtime loads
it and it looks a little confusing but
go ahead and just type it as I do public
static void main and then that's the
first part okay
public this has to do with the scope
this has to do with the type of function
this is the name of the function and
then we have our little brackets here
and inside the parentheses you don't
need to know this right now but just
type string args and string is an object
just so you know and args is a array of
arguments and we're not going to really
get into that right now and to write to
the console we're going to say system
dot out dot println for print line and
then inside of here we're going to write
hello world okay and basically this is a
system object and it handles the output
and what we want to do in the output is
print the line okay and go ahead and
save that I close this up now I'm going
to go to Microsoft PowerShell you can
use a command prompt if you'd like but
this one's just a little cleaner looking
sometimes and I'm going to change
directories to CD f drive workspace Java
okay and here's our hello dot Java file
now we can't run this yet because Java
is a compiled language so we first have
to compile the Java file and to do that
you say Java Sea hello dot Java and no
errors that means it's good and if you
look in this folder we now have a Java
class file let's go ahead and open this
up and see what it looks like it's a
pretty crazy thing here isn't it you're
not meant to read that
it's just like compiled okay so and then
to run it we just type Java hello now
hit enter and it says hello world
congratulations you've done it I should
notice that you do not type dot class
you have to type the actual class name
which has to match the file name so
hello and go ahead and run that again
pretty cool so it seems like a lot of
code just to do this we could also do it
once more system dot out dot print line
I feel good okay and remember you're
going to have to recompile this okay
even though I save this java if i type
java hello it still says the same thing
so say java sea hello dot java and it
recompile zit and let's say java hello
and there it is so don't forget to
recompile it alright guys that's a good
start and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
