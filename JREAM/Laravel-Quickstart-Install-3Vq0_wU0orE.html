looking at lower valence like a pretty
legit framework it might be the future
very elegant documentation it looks
really clean so possibly i'll keep doing
serious on this if I can find anyone
interested first thing I'll do is just
download it from github and I'll just
grab the zip of the master file and I've
already done that and I placed it in my
workspace folder which is a PHP
accessible and just a fuller called
laurelville so to get this working it's
the public directory where everything's
run from we need to set up a HT or an
Apache virtual host for this directory
and using wamp I'll just head over to a
patchy httpd I'll go to the bottom and
I'm basically gonna do this I've already
typed it out and basically whoops
we have our virtual host here i'm using
port 80 to if you're not just take that
off and my server name will just be LVL
and i'll have to change that in my
windows hosts file if you're using mac
or something else you'll have to do it
that way with ma'am which does
automatically i believe so i'll save
that close it out and again since I'm in
Windows I'm going to run notepad plus
plus as administrator and I'm just going
to open up my hosts file which is C
Drive windows system32 / driver / ET c
and host and i'll just add LDL to this
and i'll go ahead and restart my wamp
server and in a new tab i'll hit up LVL
82 and it says lower bail bootstrap blah
blah blah it looks like I got a bad
version from get so let's go back here
and we're in the master branch let's go
to the three-point Oh branch and i'll go
ahead and download the zip
boom open this up and boom copy that
over and this should fix it so I was
just in the master branch but to me that
should have worked out of the box so go
ahead and refresh and here it is and
this is the beginning of laravel I'll
open sublime text and open the folder
and I'll just go to work space laura
bell and i'll select this folder to work
in and what we'll do is just make a
route real quick so i'll go to
application routes and down little ways
we'll just make a test route called /
test instead of returning the view will
just return this is a test okay and if i
head back i'll just type a slash test
and looks like I made a typo there so I
forgot to do a semicolon once more there
we go and that's the beginning of
laravel it's pretty easy to set up right
out of the box if anyone's interested in
a full series let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
