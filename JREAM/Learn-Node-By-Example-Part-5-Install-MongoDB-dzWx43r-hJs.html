MongoDB first for Windows users you
would just search for mongodb downloads
and you would just grab this first one
and that define and you would run your
little MongoDB guy here all right now I
already have mine installed the only
thing i would change is the past that
you define it in and i put mine in c
drive / Mongo because it's easier to get
in so if I were to open my command
prompt I'll run it as administrator I'll
go to see dr ok i'll type der and you'll
notice i made a data directory so I CD
in the data type der also created a DB
der and a logs durso CD into DB and see
what's in here and it adds a bunch of
stuff once you get Mongo going but the
installation is under C Drive Mongo dirt
and CD been there and what you want to
run is mon god so you say manga exe and
this would be the place you would
connect to what's trying to connect I
don't know if I had another instance
running on accident Mon post i did Mongo
sorry you got to Mongo d first and ok
now it's waiting for connection and just
a test that you could open up CMD again
and CD in to see dr Mongo CD in the bin
in this type Mongo exe and now we're in
the terminal
DB and we have a DD called test and you
can close this and then just keep your
app running if you want to run this as a
service just search on Google for
Windows MongoDB service and also you
could also make the folder here I could
cancel out of this MongoDB / or manga
flash been in your path so that you can
just type the word Mongo be or just
create a service now in Linux we do it a
little bit differently okay sorry about
that there was a child crying for linux
install MongoDB on ubuntu this says only
support 64-bit LTS ubuntu releases this
means 12 and 14 and while it may work
with other releases it's not supported a
configuration so I'm on 16 in here so
what you would do is probably follow
this as far as adding the key I believe
it's three point oh four or three point
four that doesn't work with ubuntu z
niall 16 so you would if you're on 12 or
14 your server or your desktop you would
just add one of these guys follow the
instructions and you know just pretty
straightforward it's on a main MongoDB
site now I found one that I did like it
would be MongoDB ubuntu 16 service and
digital ocean had a pretty good article
on it to create it as a service now keep
in mind that this uses in it dot d where
preview sabon to use is upstart so to
have an upstart script you might have to
search for how to autoload it or
something so open a terminal
so we're here look and shrimp this guy
down and I need to add this key I can
receive the package for the repository
okay and then we just echo out this and
it's a little bit different than the
other ones this has 3.2 and it says
ubuntu zinnia will just copy paste that
okay and I'll just do it apt-get update
and let's see ODT kgs in another process
let me try that again
okay and then just like with the other
versions apt-get install yes mongodb org
and it's a it's a good size download
going down it shows us how to set up a
service which we're going to do i'll
provide this link maybe a few others in
the description so let's copy this i
prefer them google them of this guy and
we just copy all this stuff taste it in
and notice of service users going to be
MongoDB right and quit and while this
tells us what we do and will attempt to
run system control start MongoDB and
then we can check the status ok so it's
actively running and if we want to
automatically enable it i do we will
enable this for all that stuff and the
firewall I should check my ufw rules
datos okay ufw is not even on locally so
I don't need to open up port 27 whatever
so I should be able to say Mongo alright
and just type DB and their steps okay so
with that then we'll be able to use
MongoDB and go from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
