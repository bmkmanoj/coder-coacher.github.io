of his video recording and such I've
never showed anyone this but I figure I
would know because it's kind of
interesting that there's just sound
padding I got it a while ago but it just
prevents as much echo so there are a
bunch of hard drives on my desk that
I've collected over the years and taken
out of laptops and such and I'm just
going through them and getting anything
out of them that I don't need and then
formatting them for example if I look at
a couple of these it's kind of hard to
find where the size and everything is
this one's a 250 gig I don't know that
if this one is 1000 gigs so that's a
terabyte that's a good one some people
ask which keyboard do I use and it's the
sig aluminum keyboard it's really just
aluminum here it's not like anything
super fancy but the key presses are
really nice and that's why I like them
it's got a USB on each side and it just
is the best keyboard i found i just use
a gigabyte cheap mouse so back to the
hard drives this is a samsung 128 SSD it
feels really light weight almost kind of
cheap but uh I'm now a SSD convert I
love them this one was already formatted
and the reason I'm doing this is because
I picked up this guy right here it's
called pluggable over there's more light
and you just drop your drive in there of
either size and it connects through USB
3 and it was I think 30
sucks something like that and it works
really well this guy here is my western
digital passport or I keep up keep a lot
of files I need to like give my parents
or my brother I like this little thing
and this is just a cheap amazon case and
this guy i've had for about boy six
years that's a 500 gig i believe it's an
iomega to drive you can see how dusty it
is and I got a little USB 3 hub here
it's a bit messy at the moment and a
while back i upgraded to a corsair 650d
case and i really like it inside here
it's probably too dark to look at but
it's a AMD FX six core processor and a
gosh radeon five or six series i bought
it used get a lot better deal from that
and up there the new mic stand and pop
filter i returned to the blue yeti
because my recordings been very poor and
so you know i am recording on my cell
phone so perhaps the audio will be
poured here now the closet of fun i like
to save stuff here's the Raspberry Pi
about a while back and it's just sitting
here I haven't found my shoes for it
some old ram hyperx blue those are 5 12
pieces so they're pretty low considering
you get for ram / use that on
motherboard and to Nvidia graphics cards
both with hdmi ports I think these are
actually identical
they're nothing fancy the only reason to
get one is for the dual ports and this
was my wife's old computer it was in a
terrible case and it was really loud
it's a fork or AMD you can tell
motherboard is probably quite dated or
cheap at least only has two gram slots
but boy this Mickey was loud this fan
right here this guy was really loud and
obnoxious I didn't like that and I got
just random junk unfortunately this is a
chromecast my boss was kind enough to
give it to me it's 30 bucks but it's
just not that good you know what I mean
and really a bunch of wires never know
when you might need a hdmi cable you can
get them on the cheap just save up on
that up here got my windows 8 pro CD 8.1
is already out but this is the ugliest
case I've ever seen it's reliably you
know I'm not a Windows fanboy I do like
Windows but i will say that i did don't
like this whole concept they did so i do
use windows 8 but I'm kind of a pretty
much switching to linux for almost
everything because I developed mostly
everything on Linux but otherwise
Windows 8 is a good package and here's
the chromecast box things like 30 bucks
and I don't think it's worth it okay
now why do I have my wife's mother board
there because over here her desk is a
little messy I bought her an Intel look
let me see if i can find that box makes
that noise when you open it and i love
this thing a core i3 and right there is
a plate you can take out here and you
can attach it to the backyard monitor if
you wanted to now with this it comes
with a power cord but you have to buy a
three prong Mickey Mouse cord to go into
that power adapter which is kind of a
nuisance so if I look at this little guy
this has a core i3 and I mean it's
little and it's lightweight I had to buy
it an msata hard drive SSD and some ram
i forgot the tight but it's a smaller
ram and this little guy has to hdmi
ports gosh I don't want to hump anything
she's only using one of them because she
has a real big monitor and I didn't buy
a Wi-Fi card because we just hardwire it
in and then there's two USB hubs and her
USB ports and I bought this little guy
again I love these little hubs her says
a little on/off switches this is the
only USB 2.0 I think that's pretty much
it I got her that I bloop this is the
marathon mouse now I look to buy a lot
of things used and refurbished depending
on what it is because often as good as
new and you save a lot of money like
this nook I didn't buy a brand new I
bought it used and I think they're like
290 new and that's a lot I know getting
up for
80 being new / refurbished and that's
kind of how I like to do things I'm a
deal hunter and here's a the second best
keyboard in my opinion this logitech
it's actually wireless empowered by the
sunlight so we have some shades there
when it's daytime and it types really
well has a good key response and I like
the slim keys it you know I'm very
serious about a keyboard I feel cherry
MX do type very well but I don't like
how high the keys are and they're a
little to push back it like forces my
finger up but that's just preference I
was so my wife had a big computer it was
right here's just a mouse or sorry a
person out and that's her whole computer
system now and she's running Windows 7
that's what she prefers and thats a big
screen so I mean all this stuff I didn't
get all this overnight some of the stuff
is just over the years it piles up I
mean who would buy all these hard drives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
