give you a short tutorial on how to make
a simple validator class object-oriented
it's not gonna be too detailed but it'll
help you get started with how classes
are laid out and I figure this is a
pretty easy way to grab a hold of it so
let's start out I'm gonna make a new
file let me save it I'm actually redoing
the video so I'm just gonna overwrite it
the next type PHP and this is going to
be the validator class and I just made a
folder called libs that's short for
library or library and I'm calling it
validator with a capital v you want to
name it the same name as your name your
class which is with a capital letter
because eventually you're going to use
Auto include so you don't have to
manually include everything I gotta
reload the file so it fixes the colors I
don't know what's going on okay
so we're just going to require once
whoops
libs validator I'm going to be using
static functions so that they can be
called in the index dot PHP page without
creating the object so here's an example
public function blank string okay I'm
just creating a public function blank
public means it's accessible outside of
the class so if I go to index I do
just make a variable new validator okay
making a new validator right here so
once I create a every function inside
this class even though I don't have one
will be accessible through this variable
and the syntax is kind of like this Val
what do I call it blank one you don't
need this but I have a string and my
function okay so I'm gonna refresh that
it says working now the reason I'm going
to use a static static methods is
because I don't want to have to call
this all the time on different pages and
so on and this is actually going to look
a little bit different so I'll show you
what I mean so you instead of public
function it's going to be public static
function okay all the functions in there
with the two colons hmm you call the
class two colons and then the function
so I'll just start by making a couple
functions if string wine there's
probably a little bit better way to do
this but you know just try to keep it
short here we have a if string length of
string whatever's passed through the
blank function is less than one let's
return true else return false public
static function digit string if I
actually like this little type function
is called C type digit string okay if
this is going to be a string
we're gonna say return true else return
false and mm-hmm we'll just do that for
now so let's say I have a equals 500 B
equals nothing
let's do null c equals 585 okay and then
I'm going to check these so if validator
blank be echo B is 1 okay so we'll test
that one out Oh line 8 let's see line 8
is strangling whoops one too many
parentheses okay
B is blank okay about if validate our
digit a goal a is a digit a is a digit
and then let's try digit 4 see if
validator digit see that call this is
else okay
what happened here oops I didn't save it
okay
refresh see is not a digit so it
validates this and it's really simple to
use so instead of doing it the
procedural way your code you know it
looks something like instead of having
it something like this all over the
place if a string length is less than
one
you know the procedural way is kind of a
long sloppy way especially if you're
using a lot of these this is just a very
simple example of what I'm saying you
know set all this throughout your code
and okay so it just kind of cleans up
your code and everything and there's
just something very basic to do okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
