gonna check out the perspective grid and
Adobe Illustrator I think it's pretty
cool
it's this little thing right here and it
puts up this big ol grid and you got
this little button thing here looks kind
of confusing but it's really not I think
the only confusing part is how to move
stuff and this little triangle piece
here it changes the well the squares in
the view okay and this will lengthen the
wall like if you're going to make a
building and then there should be one
over here you know there's a lot of
settings here to play with the
perspective I'm really not gonna try to
figure that out right now and you can
move the walls position anyways the cool
thing is that this little tool here you
can draw on the wall mm-hmm so if you
made a square you see how that fits onto
that view plane I don't know what a
circle would do yeah circle works too
that's cool
and a star and if you wander on another
wall you don't do that you click the
other side of this grid and we could
draw like this so this just opens up a
lot of opportunities to make
proportional things and that's that's
pretty impressive if you ask me I wonder
what this will do oh this will draw the
ground it's pretty cool I don't think
there's much else to say about that have
fun
hey guys what's up this tutorial will do
some gradients okay I'm just gonna make
a square in a circle and it might
surprise you but if you click the
gradient tool it won't do anything so
what you got to do is open the toolbox
for gradients which is this little
button or just go to windows gradient
and pops this little box up and then you
click just click this little box there
we go we have a gradient now we can use
this little tool to drag it on here how
we want and you can adjust it however
you want
slide these little sliders along and or
you can change the color by double
clicking these little tick boxes these
little squares and I'll just pick a
color blue and the black I'm happy with
pretty easy to do or you can drag these
little things onto them you can simply
just drag them in more spots if you want
you can also do it with a color if you
drag it on and you can change the colors
here if you select a little ticker
pretty easy looks like a new feature not
sure how know it is you can change the
opacity so it's transparent so if I put
this on top of here see how it fades
into that green there impress of Adobe
and I guess this little piece just
inverts it whoops there we go
so you can easily invert it I think
it'll be easier to tell if we just have
black in that so it flips it around and
there's radial gradients of course I
usually prefer to shape it with oh
that's cool
a gradient tool
now this is new very impressive yeah so
it looks like it's just a matter of kind
of playing around with this stuff the
other thing is there's gradient meshes
and I'll do that on the circle the
gradient mesh tool is this little
squiggly looking thing and you click a
point on your item and it creates this
grid right and it looks like it doesn't
do anything but at some point you're
probably going to want to stop clicking
and then select the well I'm going to
change the original color of this whole
thing to skin color while we're at it
I'm going to shrink this gradient tool
if you click here this little arrow here
and go to open swatch library you
probably can't see it on my screen it
looks like that fits I'm gonna do oh
where is it skin tones okay and okay
skin tones here there so I'm just gonna
make the base of the face like that then
you select the little white pointer and
then pick a spot and you can just kind
of start lightening things up if it was
a nose would be pretty bright and then I
guess the mouth will do a little darker
yeah it'd take a while in my opinion to
make a decent looking face by always you
can create a nice little thing out of
that it's quite time-consuming and you
can move these little things around and
twist them to make little arcs I I don't
really use this barely ever in the
previous versions but uh it's pretty
cool if you probably practice a lot you
could make some
cool alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
