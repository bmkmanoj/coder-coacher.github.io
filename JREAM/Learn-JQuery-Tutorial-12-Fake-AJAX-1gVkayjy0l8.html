tutorial we're going to do a false Ajax
loading thing and we're going to use a
form and when they submit the form it's
just going to load this icon now
normally your form would probably
refresh the page but before it refreshes
we're just going to load this icon so
this isn't a real Ajax post it's just
kind of an artificial way of doing it
and then after you click that it would
refresh but we get this cool little icon
here so the first thing we're going to
do is just create a new HTML file and
i'll just call mine index.html and yes i
want to change that and in the actual
folder i have my jquery library and you
can get that from jQuery calm and then
loader and this is just a image you can
find these anywhere really an image you
like and I'm just going to pop these
into this folder so I'll load my
index.html and let's edit this
so I'll just start with a doctype HTML
my HTML tags my body tags and whoops and
then let's do some head tags and if
you're wondering how i'm getting this to
automatically type in the HTML for me
this is a notepad plus plus under text
settings and autocomplete the XHTML text
and that's pretty useful so in the head
head tag we're just going to do script
SRC equals jquery jas that's good and i
guess i'll just put in a title and call
it test and then we're also going to do
a style normally i would put the
stylesheet in another file but this is
just for this example trying to keep it
short and simple and let's make a input
form we'll just do a form tag and i'm
going to make this a little bigger let's
do input type equals text and a line
break and for the labels let's put these
on labels and let's just say name
and age and this one's going to be empty
because this will be our submit button
let's change the type here to submit and
let's see what we have right now we have
a name age and submit you click it it
doesn't do anything good so what we're
going to do is put the image inside of
this label when they click it so first
thing we got to do is make a class for
the label so i'm going to say label oh
sorry I mean loader and i'm going to say
let's see here's the gift and the
dimensions are 32 by 32 as you can see
down here i'm going to say height 32
pixels width 32 pixels and i'm going to
do display inline block so it's still a
block element but it's in line and then
we're going to do the background i'm
going to say background URL and that
will be loader dot gif and we do not
want to repeat that ok and let's just
put a little div class equals loader
inside of here don't forget to end your
div tag i have that on automatically and
they're refreshing i have this ok it's
looking good and now for the jquery part
let's do some script tags and we'll do
the document ready
and we're going to put a function inside
here okay if you're not familiar with
jquery i have a bunch of tutorials on
this document ready function but i'm
assuming you are and let me just type
alert one I always do this to make sure
jquery's loaded in the document ready
let me redo that there it is right there
and first thing we're going to do is
we're going to hide this and that's
called loader it's a div class floater
so i'm going to say dot loader and hide
so i'll refresh that looks good
obviously you would have your labels
like a certain width let me just do that
let's say I'm label width and I guess
200 pixels that might be kind of big
display inline block maybe ok that's
kind of big let's say a hundred pixels
ok that'll be good and let's go back to
the loader and what we're going to do is
when they submit the form we're going to
make the thing up here you don't want to
do the click you know you can do form
dot click but we want to do submit so it
knows when it's submitting the form and
I'm going to pop in a function here and
the first thing we're going to do for
this example is type return false if
you're not using real Ajax get rid of
this so that it will do the regular form
submission and show the image but since
i'm on the localhost it doesn't have
time to show you the example so let me
put a comment here
this if you are not using index for real
okay so that's just for this example and
what we're going to do is copy this and
do loader dot show and I'll refresh this
and submit and there you have it and
once again in reality this form would
have something like action equals you
know handle the page method equals post
and normally you'd click this and it
would do that the reason I have this
down here is just to prevent that from
happening because you'll see on
localhost everything happened so fast
you know you can barely see that so
that's just for this example alright
guys I hope this tutorial was fun thanks
