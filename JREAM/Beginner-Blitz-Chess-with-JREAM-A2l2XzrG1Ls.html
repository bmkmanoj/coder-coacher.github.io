going to open with a standard opening
change up the YouTube videos it's a nice
relaxing thing I like chess calm it's
fun and I rating for ten minutes is
pretty poor I don't give a lot of
thought into all of it but I'll do my
best
so this
let's see how aggressive a player this
guy is
so this horse was unprotected and it's
blocking the king so both if you put
that's dead a shoe here's that pawn oh
you didn't take it um okay what's my
next move here
if I move up that blocks him but I'll
just try to move my pawn up two spots
once he threatens it with a pawn here I
think he wants this no I don't think he
cares about that structure he's going to
castle on the Kings side
I think silly like when I castle with a
pawn out of the way so i have this rook
here and i feel like i'm less locked in
so let's see my whites not opened don't
went over my white or my firm I think
there's more opportunity with the white
at this moment okay so
I could move here to threaten
no I'll get taken
um
the Queen to hear I'll get taken night
here now you're mad I can't do much with
this is bishops like that at all don't
appreciate that hmm
here he'll take what a pawn probably
open up his rook I doubt he would take
with him maybe oh I never play how I
want okay just to put some fear into his
bones
he's probably wondering why did you do
that well I can't believe as Queen here
and let's say so this is a very
irritating place to put something so you
can't go here can't go here can't go
here you can only go there or there
I'm gonna turn it no I can't check made
him from your Dan
I think I gotta check me down oh he
didn't go to the this one he knows what
he's doing
dang it I'm going to trade queens now if
he doesn't
this is Pawn
he wants us pawn but I can have a free
piece here I'll take the free piece he
could take that too so it would be even
those here check
I'll take the bishop
what's his night God he could go here or
here which doesn't serve a lot of
purpose so the rook take that or that
I'm looking free peace yeah miss I'm
missing the obvious quite a bit let's
see the score to do it yeah I'm up ahead
by him I think six points he resigned
I'll try to do another one because that
was a short game just to have fun I'd
like watching chest videos where people
are playing and you try to when you're
watching it you see the errors they're
making you're like no move there ok so
then he can vary out this guy which he
probably will and trying to threaten my
queen I'll just protect
and this guy down to here okay that will
protect that pawn unless he threatens
and let's cast no heat let's see is
there any reason if he puts his night
here I gotta watch out for that because
then he's going to take a free pawn and
then put me in a pickle let's put the
pressure on for that guy he's protected
but
sometimes it's inconvenient to lose
pieces a certain way all right so if I
move night here he can take with this
night my pawn takes threatens him he'll
move down here and with this opening
there is no threat so I'm going to try
that if he takes the bait if not I would
love it because then I could take his
night and then he'd break his prop palm
structure make it kind of ugly oh man
this guy is up to no good he will take
this because it's threatening his queen
so that breaks his pawn structure
and sometimes it's useful I wish she'd I
like it when it even block his own
pieces so with my night I'm doing a lot
of dancing with him let me think if I
move him down here he could get taken
and let's doing her I'm guessing your
rook to hear
actually he might hmm I was a weird move
he's going to challenge my corner pieces
I think so i'll do this ah i moved one
too many shoot he's going to take that I
want to move it one and then see if he
moves down and then train all right
drill in one place I can roll it safe
I'll trade
and threaten us work
her in this pawn I'll shoot he's got
that guy man but if I moved him up here
ok so moving here if he takes I'll take
with my night and then I have defensive
he takes up the other guy okay so take
see if he wants to trade
nope
so protect my bishop
actually I don't think I did that right
this Bishop will take my idea of cool
that's all I want to do it I was a bad
move clean here i'll try to free pawn
what's defended
I got one two three he's got four pieces
because I messed up on that night yeah
that's where he took that he could night
check is Queen his block so it was
killing
yep and I was going to get squeem over
here and try to checkmate me there
would that be bad because now he's done
checkmate well that was a fun games guys
i just wanted to change the youtube
videos up see what else is fun to do
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
