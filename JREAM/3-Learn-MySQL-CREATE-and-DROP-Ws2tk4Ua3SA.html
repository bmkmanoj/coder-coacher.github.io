MySQL we're gonna be jumping into heidi
SQL this is a free application to
connect to databases and you can just
download it off google and what we're
gonna do is once you have this installed
go ahead and create a new session your
hostname is good if it's local and your
user and password are most likely route
with no password and you just press open
and save your session ok so on the Left
we have databases the names of them or
the right here and for this tutorial
we're going to be working in the query
tab right here and it shows you SQL down
here what it looks like and we're gonna
type some ourself now you can use the
GUI right click and create a new
database and table but what we want to
do is learn SQL ok so the first thing
we're going to do is create a database
so i'm gonna say create database and
then you choose the name and I'm gonna
put these little back ticks here and
inside these back ticks we pick a
database name so let's call this one
friends ok and you end the command with
a semicolon and you want you don't have
to do these in capital letters but you
should because it's easier to tell what
you're doing and everyone else does it
I guess it's a style convention or
something and what these back takes do
are escape this text in case it was a
key work if I did de SC and I wanted to
make a table name desc
that's a reserved keyword and it won't
let us do that so you put these little
back ticks here and that's right next to
the number one key there them
funny-looking ticks okay so back to this
I'm just gonna do one called friends and
press play or execute the query and down
here you see one rows affected and it
appears nothing really happened what you
have to do is right-click and go to
refresh or you could just press
five and here's our database friends now
I'll notice when you click friends it
says use friends down here and you can
click this and then query from this
point but we're just gonna do it in the
lowest level right here and do it
ourselves so I'm gonna say use friends
by the way you don't always have to use
backticks but sometimes we will so a
database has tables okay
tables and to create a table we do it
just like we did the database we say
create table and let's call this one
names okay and a table can't be empty so
we put these little parentheses here and
inside the parentheses are the table
names okay sorry the column names by the
way this - - is a comment if you ever
need to comment your SQL so let's create
one let's um create some names let's
start with an ID the first one is the
name of our field
we'll just type these out first name and
let's do last name and first name now if
you look at this this is fine and
everything but you want to follow a nice
easy-to-follow style and just say name
last and name first you don't have to do
that but I prefer it because it's easier
to read okay so let's just do an age
also okay
now we're not done yet we just have our
names in for every table next we have to
tell my skew what kind of columns they
are and ID is gonna be int with 11 digit
placeholders like we did in the last
tutorial and make sure to use a comma
one guy SQL expert named Rudy always
puts as commas before the next item
because it's easier to tell if you
missed one and that's pretty good
practice I might not do that all the
time but I'll do it in this
for the name last we're gonna do var
character and we're gonna do let's just
say 20 spaces and I'll do the same for
the next one with 20 I don't forget
there's commas here on the front of
these which will really translate to if
we had it on the end of them they're
just easier to read on the left and for
the Aged let's do an int and someone can
only be a hundred years old or 999 so
three-digit places are good and this is
pretty good so far what we want is a
primary key for a table though and to
assign a primary key you actually go a
line down and put another comma and say
primary space key and inside our primary
key is gonna be ID and which is the key
we can I identify rows in our tables
from ok and if we don't want null values
to be allowed you can also put whoops
not Bowl not null there we go no no okay
and that looks good let's hit play and
it says zero rows affected
da-da-da-da-da and again it appears like
nothing has happened but let's click
this and here we have a names table and
if you click this we can go to the table
sorry I'm working with limited space
here
and here we have the ID name last name
first and age pretty cool we'll get into
inserts and selects later I'm just
showing you how to do this stuff first
so let's erase this and what we're going
to do is delete that table we just made
the command is probably different than
you think it's called drop and remember
when we did create we did create
database name create table name okay let
me comment these out
we always have to define what it is that
we're doing we're creating what a
database we're dropping one we're gonna
drop a table and the name of the table
is names and you see that some blue that
kind of scares me so I'm gonna do these
little backticks okay so drop the table
names to play and let's hit f5 to
refresh and that names is gone cool and
if we want to delete the friend's
database we have to do drop database and
we'll just drop friends okay and then
press play to execute f5 to refresh and
work good so those are some basics to
creating tables and columns and database
or sorry my wards are messed up alright
you guys get the drift
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
