brain is working very slowly and we're
going to try to make this work in part
two so I got on the phone immediately
with Dan saket and asked him what is an
auto prefix or for CSS because I'm not
really in the front end game these days
and he said it's because a source map
for CSS when it's minified is hard to
use the book to debug and like a chrome
developer tool or something like that
and it just makes it feasible like to
find the line numbers or that was what I
got from it I was half-listening but you
know so package.json we're going to add
a few packages one mistake I made was we
want to use gulp auto prefix ER and the
version is different to point 1 point 0
and again the auto prefix sir will add
mods border radius and all that stuff
tier CSS once it compiles now and we're
going to do gulp dash source maps and
that version is 150 and I have one for
gulp image men now I'm having trouble
with this one but I'll get you started
on it and this is two to one and then we
have image min I it's called PNG quaint
and version of that is 400 and we have
gulp notified just so i can show you
what it does if you want to know and
that's 220 okay so and like dance saket
said before if i went down let me make a
new terminal make their tests and I'll
see the in the test I believe he said I
can do NP
and knit and yeah here we go outside
it's a dog one point O a entry point
into xjs blah blah blah i'll get and
asks you all the stuff you want and it
makes a JSON file for your soul oh sorry
yes vim package.json and you see it
basically created a bunch of stuff for
us so npm in it is pretty nice and we
would just throw in our dependencies so
there's also the command line to save
dependencies as you type in the terminal
but I digress let's get to it let's
clear this stuff out so we have this
stuff and let's just try NPM install
make sure that all works mmm don't worry
about my Bower thing here I just was
goofing around and messed something up
so we have everything we need yours
might take a while because I already
have mine installed I wrote the code and
tried testing it out a bit before I did
this so I don't look as dumb and
hopefully I pass that so I open this and
right away I see an error I must have
erased some code or I didn't add it so
for SAS let me do stardoll SCSS and for
jas its star jazz but what's more is
what if our source file had subfolders
like if i made a new folder and called
this just misc and a new file and i just
said test is background right i'll call
this test scss right i would want that
merged in and the trick to do that is to
use two asterisks to read any folder so
we should do the same for js2
yeah and that that looks good so let's
add some of these plugins let's add some
plugins guys do to do to do so we
started off at uglify and under uglify
they'll do source maps and that's plural
gulp source Maps comma might be easier
just to duplicate a line also I change
prefix or whatever to prefix and that's
gulp dash auto prefix er I was duplicate
this line this was image min that's cool
image min then we have a PNG Quantic
Wayne and this one was image min PNG
quaint I just want to make sure I have
everything one more is notify so boom
we'll just say notify and this is gold
dash notify I personally think the image
guys should be at the bottom because
they start breaking apart from the gold
pattern alright so we have all this
stuff set up
I could probably make a better way to
describe this like a object I'll just
leave it like this for now and leave
that up to you guys you could also call
this styles instead of sass and then
this could be scripts instead of jas i
might change that at some point so what
we forgot to do was to come cat the sass
in our last video so i can just copy
this and where I kind of cat it it
or did I concat it right after the
prefix so those says now it's important
to have these orders these in the right
order remember this is a CSS file by the
way so we're going to do a pipe here and
prefix and let's just say last two
versions you can look up the docs for
the goal auto prefix ER to see what you
can do it can go back for more fallbacks
for old browsers by think two versions
is fine you know everyone's problems
Internet Explorer anyways okay so we
have our prefix there which will add the
code that we don't want to have to type
in every time we concat we set the
destination and before we minify let's
comment it out we want to make sure the
prefix ER and the source Maps work saw
the pipe source Maps dot and knit I blue
that's what I wrote yep and then dot
right oops not this one coming out to
minify okay and what we'll do is we're
just going to say gulp sass all right
and if I go to the dist CSS app min okay
I'm going to need some code that would
probably minify better than whatever I
did let's try it in the test one I have
some examples I'll this paste this in
Seoul past that it would be one in the
box size and all right so we run it
again
okay so then the app min and you see how
I added all this extra stuff that's nice
and here's our source map data down on
the bottom it's just adjacent base64
string what we want to do is we want to
minify it and then add this to it since
this is a comment it's going to get
omitted when you minify so we'll go
ahead and go to go file and now minify
so you see minify is below so i'll go
ahead and run again and go here and it
looks like it's missing silly me I put
that in wanted to put it right there
above the source Maps okay so there we
go so here's all our compressed CSS with
all that special stuff in our source map
at the bottom nice and tidy okay let me
look at this um one thing we want to do
is return the actual gult source so when
we're running a watch or whatever it's
going to return the gulp source so it
can keep recalling it so this pace
return in front of those guys um the
other thing we had was a
notify so we can add a dot pipe notify
the message and we'll say hello world we
are done okay and I'll just go ahead and
run that now the notify might be not
what you expect okay so i'll scroll this
over here and you can see in the top
right it gives that there so i don't
know if it's useful to you or not I
don't find it necessary but if you want
to use it it's it's cool okay so i'm
just going to comment that out I don't
want it maybe I'll just do it like that
so that it remains there and we have a
jay s plumber we want source maps for
that also so I'll duplicate and I'll say
source whoops source maps in it and it
up loaf eyes it it can cats it and then
we want to write it so I'll just put
this all in one and say right okay now
do we have jay is here commands jayus
okay so let's just try to run gulp j/s
okay so here's the j s appt min here's
the source stuff and minified beautiful
so that works great one thing we do want
to do is since we're going to be doing a
watch let's go ahead and start building
the watch okay so i'll just copy this
guy
and i'll call this watch will do a gulp
task and we'll call it a watch and a
function and then here will say gulp dot
watch and we want to watch the a folder
of SRC javascript and we can run any
number of commands tasks on it and we
just want to run the j s task if you had
multiple you could do that too I'll
duplicate that and do um was it CSS or
SAS yeah we're gonna watch SAS okay
loose and we'll try to run gulp watch
see if it behaves so finished it's still
hanging there okay so if i go to my test
file and space save you see it updates
it
had some cold and it saves it and it's
minified so you can't really see it well
so that will run it but what if I did
this if I said it got rid of this colon
here in the seat here you see it has an
error right so I'll fix it now plumber
keeps it running but the problem is it
doesn't know how to return now that i
fixed it so we can add a little error
handler here let me go to the pipe
plumber code so i'll just that a object
in here and error handler and you can
write this in here but let's just do it
on error like that end up here will save
our on-air equals function just make
sure I got it right and we'll just
console.log the air and to return to it
we do emit sorry this amit and so let's
try that again and I'll say go up watch
ok so it's running let's try to break it
save and you see it logs this error for
so we know what the problem is I'll undo
it and save and now it's back to working
so that's pretty sweet ok so there is
SAS we could do the same for the jas if
it had a problem so we have those
covered what we're going to do is also
images so I'll do just test of image
image so this is going to create a
folder in the distribution called images
and then we'll have a source of image
now in here we're going to do image /
star and I'll make a new folder called
image and I'm going to need an image
actually so let's open up the good old
boy and I'll just say everyone likes
cats so I'll say kitty images 0 gosh
it's hello kitty ok so I like these guys
in the tops they're kind of little
wallpaper all right don't get too
distracted by the kitties save-image-as
okay and let's just call them kitty okay
so i can close this as long as yep okay
so we'll make a image 1 so i'll just say
images and gulp that task of image
function okay i will return kolb dot SRC
and that source is source image and will
type it i think one or on image min and
set the destination so pipe will be
called that dest oops a gulp that desk
yes and best image destination image so
that would work if that's all you wanted
to do so if i write ran a gulp image
oops cope image
okay so let's see image and it copies
the kitty over there and we can do this
one pipe and this one's a little
trickier I actually looked at the NPM
package so image min okay and they had
progressive of true they had this thing
SVG Oh plugins and remove view box false
I have no idea what that is I didn't
have enough time to read it and then use
PNG quaint as a function okay so um you
can also set the quality totally forgot
the command but just run it to make sure
it works and this says minified one
image saved X amount of bytes it's it's
it's on the tip of my tongue I remember
what it was I'll look it up on the other
screen image men
it was on the tip of my tongue
optimization level okay that's only for
pngs deducted a progressive interlace
SVG Oh plugins yeah there would be a bit
of reading to do on this because
optimization level only applies to PNG
graphics okay so let's we're almost done
now we did that just check my work here
okay that's done we have the error
logging okay and what we can do is
instead of having to type watch we can
also set a default now this is optional
so instead of typing watch we could say
whoops default
and we'll say gulp that task default and
then we can pass in all the tasks we
want to do well I want to watch and
actually you know what we forgot to add
an image to this source of image and
it's going to call the image task so
watch and we want to run watch and we
want to run SAS j/s and image so now I
can just type gulp and it should just
listen okay so now if I change some
JavaScript and say alert 1 it recompile
zit and there should be an alert one in
here right near the end there it is
alert one okay and then you can change
your sass green obviously this is
incorrect SAS or very good JavaScript
but it's to show you and then updates
that let's see if we let's open the
containing folder and paste it and you
see when I pasted it went into there now
the only downside i believe is if i
delete it it doesn't delete it from here
now there's a package called de el that
it could probably look and delete that
in the source okay so that's a good
start and check out the repository you
guys if you like all this stuff here i
am going to yeah i'll just leave
everything here alright thanks for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
