a raise and this is very important
because you'll be using these a lot just
to start out I have the body onload init
function and I'm putting on my coat
inside this little function here so it
appears when documents ready so we've
made a strings like a equals dog B
equals 10 those are just strings or
integers and array is kind of similar
but it holds a pocket of data so if I
wanted to have a series of animals I
could create a new array and I could say
dog fish cat and that's an array of
animals what i can do is output that
document dot write animals i'll refresh
that and i get dog fish cat what i can
do is select only one and the first item
always starts with a0 so if i wanted to
show the fish this would actually be one
is it goes 0 1 2 and i put these little
square brackets here and say 1 so 0 1 it
should give us fish okay and there's
other ways to make a race here's another
way to do it you could say animals
equals and then use these little square
brackets this is called the literal way
and we'll say um horse and
chicken I'll call that animals too and
refresh when we get horse and chicken
and you can do the same thing stop a one
there which should get chicken looks
good if you wanted to add to an array
you could do animals let's see 1 2 3
equals pig and I will output animals 3
refresh it's in there let's see the
whole thing you know this is just it's
not too complex it's a lot of monkeying
around though there's also something
called multi-dimensional arrays I'll
bring this up to see how this is a digit
it doesn't have to be a digit this is
what you call an enumerated array with a
digit you could use a associative key or
a hash sometimes it's called and you
could say other so i could do animals
dot other and refresh and I get pig okay
and notice the dot notation we're using
let's make a multi-dimensional array
this is where things can get confusing
so we're going to make a new one called
animals equals and I prefer to use the
literal way of doing it most of the time
and i will say dog or let's let's
categorize these exile do new array and
i'll say animals
mammals equals new array and animals
birds equals new array okay so on the
mammals I'll put dog and cat and in
Birds I'll put a blue jay and i guess a
toucan okay and if i try to print out
animals it has other arrays in it and i
refresh and it looks like nothing's
working here but what I have to do is
specify the array i want to show because
it can only show one array at a time not
a multidimensional one so i could do
animal animals die mammals refresh and i
get dog and cat and then i can grab the
little ID in there and say one and get
the cat areas and I could change this
two birds one and that should give me
two can cool that's pretty much it for
arrays there are a lot of things like
slicing I'll do that real quick i'll say
animals equals on cat dog and fish and
what we can do is let's say slice it so
i want to slice from 0 to 2 and refresh
and we get cat and dog basically what it
says is i want to slice like you know
like cutting a piece of pizza i'm going
to take 01 and i'm going to stop it too
so stops right here only gives us that
i'll show you a couple more that are
really common ones called pop and
refresh and that takes well that's not
supposed to take two of them off animals
dot pop how about shift
it's supposed to take the last item off
on that it looks like it's giving us
back the I have to reassign this if I'm
trying to get that let me just say x so
x equals animals shift and what this
does it will shift off the cat well it
should animals dot shift I see I think
actually shift is a reference function
animals refresh okay a reference
function meaning you don't have to
reassign it that's that's another thing
that would be harder to explain so I'll
do a pop that should take off the last
one cool shift where did that there's
one called on shift which allows us to
add here refresh and head here that's
another way of doing it we can sort
reverse there's a lot of functions for
arrays and try to get familiar with
creating them and call them things in
them so like all animals one or how
about zero refresh it gives me fish
that's because we reverse the array I'll
keep this video short and thanks for
