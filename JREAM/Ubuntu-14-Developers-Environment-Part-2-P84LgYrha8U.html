probably developers let's go ahead and
get set up with a few goodies I'll open
up my terminator you can also press ctrl
alt T and that will open the default
terminal but if you've installed
terminator already you'll feel good so
let's do a sudo apt-get update always
make sure we're up to date with our
thingies
and after that lets first install Java
Runtime environment so let's do sudo apt
cache search for JRE okay and they have
a JRE default or it's called default
Jerry I'll make this a little taller
there it is and that's what I want to
install standard Java for java
compatible runtime so sudo apt-get
install default JRE and I just do dash y
so I don't have to type Y and confirm i
want to install it so that's installing
i'm going to open up firefox and the
reason it is slows because i'm in a
virtual box saudi beaver is what I'm
looking for oh that doesn't want to
listen okay well just let me go to
Google this is silly looking Saudi
beaver is a my sequel database manager
and it requires the JavaScript runtime
so i downloaded that first and this is a
really it's a pretty decent guy so i'm
using 64-bit so i'll just download him
and I'll just save the file
and I said I wouldn't install sublime
text but gosh Firefox is rather annoying
with that default search going on there
so I want to download version 3 and I'll
get a bunt to 64-bit and this is another
dot debian file those are easy to
install let's also install Heidi SQL up
let's go back to Google Heidi SQL and
obviously you don't have to do this I
really like Heidi SQL and this is for
windows it's written in a shoe what's
that language so we're going to run it
with wine so we'll be installing wine
tour on some windows apps it's fairly
compatible with it I forget the name of
the languages was written in one of
those weird ones ok so back to my
terminal jari is installed so since
these r dot debian files i can just open
up my file manager and go to downloads
and these will open the package
installer and pardon me for the lag and
this will install sublime text most
people love it and if it delays it's
usually waiting to pop up that window so
you can authenticate to install it and
while that's running i'll install debe
ver because it's it will be native to
linux where's Heidi SQL is great but you
got to install wine so here's debe ver
and since I have the software center
open and already put in my password it
should harass me again ok and there's
Heidi SQL ok and let's do a sudo apt-get
how about apt-cache search wine and i'm
just going to install line sudo apt-get
install line yes and this one's 191
megabytes so it'll take a little bit to
download ok so we have d beaver and
sublime text installed and they're not
on the menu and we can just click this
guy or hit our super windows key and
i'll just type sub blur and it'll open
up ok so here's sublime text and you see
it's right here to keep it on this menu
i'm just going to right click and lock
to the launcher and i'll close it out
and now he's there for good and
sometimes if you try to move stuff on
the launcher it doesn't want to listen
so what you do is you dragged out and
then back up like that ok and the other
one was debe ver this guy i thought you
could just drag them on here to like
that i didn't want to listen there we go
and here's debe ver and this is it's
similar to Heidi SQL so much and it's
really lightweight I think you'd like it
and you first have to set up a database
it would probably be my sequel for most
developers but that's a great
application I'm going to unpin this file
manager for my launcher because I I'm
used to my Windows key super e2open that
guy up and I'm going to go back and
download chrome I find chrome is a very
good browser I'll get the 64-bit guy and
I always prefer to save the file so that
it's sitting there and I can open it
when I want it
okay and in my file manager Google
Chrome
oh I don't know if I'll be able to
install it just yet because wine might
be using the package system at the
moment and TTFN font agreement always
hit the right arrow on hit okay and I do
accept and you can install TTFN fonts on
here obviously i find that linux has
pretty much everything I need once in a
while I use my old adobe cs5 programs
adobe photoshop and illustrator but i'm
not really married to them and i use
them seldomly nowadays so it's not a big
deal for me not to have them on here I
do not personally like gnome or inkscape
it in the very least especially after
being so accustomed to adobe and but you
know they're free and they've done a
very good job but for me it's difficult
to get used to okay so that's going to
take a little while to install wine but
we'll have some compatibility I'll go
ahead and open up a new oops I don't
have my hot key set on here let me do a
split horizontal and let's just didn't
prepare some installations I'll do sudo
apt-get install them that's a good text
editor curl for HTTP stuff h top that's
a process manager x clip and yes so i
did that after this just finished the
reason i had to type in my password
because this is a new terminal and these
are small little libraries that they're
useful
so for example if now i type h top i can
see all my colors my process is what's
being used and all that stuff and just
control c to cancel it versus top which
is a bit more boring and harder to read
i just prefer that so let me clear that
okay so wine is done installing i'll go
ahead and install Chrome they shouldn't
harass me for a password who knows I
don't believe I closed the software
center and since we have wine I can
right click this and do open with wine
windows program loader
so this is a Microsoft Application it
works pretty good on Linux I did notice
one black button oh by the way Heidi SQL
is written in Delphie that's what it was
so is this guy going to install or be a
pain in the butt okay so I'm going to
alt tab to see what's going on see
what's happening here it seems like
something's kind of hanging okay wine
completed there and look it looks like
Microsoft Windows like the old versions
ok
so Heidi SQL is installed I'll go ahead
and close that guy out and here's the
link here this is Microsoft Lync this is
a linux link and it looks like I can't
drag them over so I'm just going to
click here and type Heidi and try to pin
them over here I missed it there we go
okay so you might not have to database
things i prefer the lightweight guys
such as Heidi navicat possibly my sequel
workbench is pretty cool but it's it's a
bit bulky so chrome is done installing
I'll go ahead and say chrome and I'll
pin this guy I use him cry right there
ok and I'm going to close out this ok
and I'll close out Firefox and to get a
lamp server setup let's do that sudo
apt-get install apache2 php5 and i'll
just start there and that way we'll be
able to check what version of PHP
they're giving us I believe it's 5.5
hopefully yep it looks like I just saw
in the cold air which is nice because
5.5 we don't have to compile it
ourselves or add any extra repository so
that's pretty nice
okay now you can also install engine X
and php5 fpm if you prefer but it's all
whatcha want so sudo apt-get install and
we're going to need a few things one is
my sequel server and my sequel client
and we're going to want to bind that too
php5 dash mysql and i'll say yes and of
course my sequel when you install it it
pops up with about 50 things to say are
you sure you want this the root password
yep I'm just going to leave it empty
I think it does it three times
and we bound that to PHP okay and it
looks like lib Apache to my PHP 5 it
appears that's installed which I was
going to do let me just try it sudo
apt-get install the Apache to mod php5
it's already installed huh that's cool
so what else do we need let's install
curl whoops not PHP LLS do PHP version
and it is five point five point nine
very nice so sudo apt-get install Redis
server and Python pip yes
don't know if you'll be using rattus or
not or even Python but it's good to have
pip installed pip is the Python package
manager okay I'll let that run
and up in this guy let's CD into etc'
php5 CD into mods available and list
them out okay so it looks like we're
going to need curl to make calls in PHP
so we'll need to install that module
there's PDO in my sequel that's good I
think curl is probably the only one and
what's interesting now is Jason's in its
own ini file so the other thing I want
to install is the lib perl-compatible
regular expressions development and the
reason for that is I recall us to
install certain things to compile them
and I've needed that in the past before
okay so we'll say peace I keep doing the
sudo apt-get install PHP five dash curl
and I think we already did my sequel but
I'll do it again anyways yeah we already
installed that and let's do sudo apt-get
install lib perl-compatible regular
expression three dev okay
another thing you'll probably why if
you're probably a PHP developer is
composer
so I look for a composer get composure
and it's really easy to get I believe
this is a here so remember how we
installed curl we need curl to do all
that good stuff whoops let me cancel
that and put sudo in front of it all
right let's do this sudo php5 enable mod
curl ok and I'll try pacing it down here
shouldn't have a problem with that ok so
there's composer we just had to enable
the module we installed and what I like
to do is move it to sudo move composer
that far to user local bin composer so
now I should just type composer and I
can use it all the days of my life ok
I'll close out chrome and that's kind of
frustrating Chrome has the close buttons
on the right side have other
applications on the left side so let's
go ahead and check if our local host is
up cool there's our local host and if I
CD into patchy to sites available it
would be the ooo default guy telling us
where so I'll say cat o.o default and
it's invar right there I usually disable
this guy with a two-disc site and then i
create my own apache config and then if
we go to CD mods available we have a lot
of them and let's go into mods enabled
and it looks like a rewrite I don't see
it there so pseudo apache2 and mod
rewrite ok and
okay and this is just a symbolic link to
the actual config file so rewrites
enabled because pretty much everyone
uses that and let's just type redis c li
see if that's working cool if you don't
get a terminal I you should say sudo
service British server start like that
I'll say restart okay so this was a long
video and it's just getting us started
with some goodies let me close things
out and wrap it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
