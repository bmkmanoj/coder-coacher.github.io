jump right into classes and objects it's
a little ahead of the game but I like to
skip around a bit so that we can learn
to use other things and a class and an
object is considered peak or object
oriented programming so this is a little
more difficult than just the regular
stuff so if you don't understand this
that's okay just remember that you did
this and it'll probably sink in later so
what is a class like this a class is
kind of like a template and inside the
class we have a series of functions
however in a class these are called
methods even though they're the same
thing as a function you refer to them as
a method inside of a class and we can
give attributes at the top and let's say
name equals Jessie so this name variable
is only available inside the class the
chat object and in other languages this
might be called a property it looks like
Python calls this attributes pretty much
the same thing and one thing that's a
little tricky about Python is that you
have to type self inside of the methods
of the object and that's because in
order to create an object we have to
create an instance and let's do that I'm
going to run this and I'll say C equals
chat okay and I have these parentheses
here so chat which is this we're going
to assign everything available in this
class to the C variable I'll hit enter
now I'll hit C and that just lets me
know that it's in the memory I'm gonna
do one more and say D equals chat okay
and I'll type D now look at these values
here you can tell that they're different
it's because they are even though chat
is the same thing
it's used in a different instance
meaning this is just a template that's
used on different objects and blah blah
blah so let's go ahead and run one let's
say see that insert and it says we
inserted something you use the dot
notation to go into objects so we first
call the instance which is C dot and
then the method delete and even though
it says self here you can disregard this
when you're actually typing it out and
we can also do C dot name but this has
no parameters after it and that will
give us this attribute up here so far I
hope you're following along we haven't
gotten to complex yet let's make another
one that lets us change the name value
now you could say C dot name equals Tom
and type C dot name but for this example
let's make a function to do that we'll
say def change self and how about value
okay so disregard the self just always
put that in your methods and the value
is going to be the parameter that we
pass inside of the little parentheses in
the main area so we're going to say self
dot name equals value you see we can
assign it up here is just name that's
okay because this is going to go through
all methods in here but if we want to
grab it inside of a method we have to
use self before if you've done PHP it's
called this it's kind of like
this and I think javis self as well
I don't remember I'm not very good at
Java so let's go ahead and run that and
I'll say C equals chat okay we got our C
object an instance of it and I'll say C
dot name it's Jesse then see that change
let's change it to Tom enter and I'll
put C dot name and there we go we can
manipulate values in here okay so lastly
why would you want to make a class
that's a good question but a class if we
had a variety of things going on like if
this was an actual chat system this
class would probably be called save and
we'd have insert delete change to save
messages we'd have another class for
maybe formatting the text or something
like that and it's just basically like a
bunch of building blocks to accomplish
things in easier ways there's a lot of
built-in objects that you can use but
it's going to be good to start learning
