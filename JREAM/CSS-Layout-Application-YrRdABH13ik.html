microsoft expression web for super
preview and it's a neat little
application if you make website layouts
and you need consistency and a lot of
browsers and different operating systems
down here we can also change our browser
size if we want i'll leave it at 1024
because that's a great size and what we
do first is type in our website and
mine's already up there and pick the
browser that you think looks the best i
usually looks best in chrome or firefox
and i will mention it comes with local
browsers all up here and you have to
sign up for their services if you want
to preview the safari mac and other
things and it's in beta it's free by the
way so i'm going to load up firefox for
my base site view and this is what my
site looks like in firefox and i'll
compare that to ie8
and it's loading all right so I can pan
around this and see problems or
similarities it's a little difficult on
my screen view because it's not the
biggest so what i can do is i can change
the layout to horizontal if i want look
for flaws here or i can do an overlay
and you can see it's a little blurry
that's because it's overlaying the text
just like by a pixel or something but
this layout is almost identical to
firefox so IE 8 is not terrible i can
zoom out a little bit okay so i'll go
back to this let's try ie6 basically
what this does is it creates a panel
that you can flip through rendered
copies of your sites so really nice and
i think i'm going to do 7 as well so
let's go to six wow that looks bad it
looks like it's broken there's a
portable network graphics it doesn't
have transparency in ie6 and it looks
like something got messed up on here so
that's no good I don't know if people
actually use IE 6 much anymore let's see
an overlay okay they also have a tool
here you can click this and you can just
quickly flip through your site if you
need to scroll faster around zoom in and
I really like how this shares where
you're moving cie 7 and let's try safari
five on a mac this one's the online
based one so it's a little bit slower
but it still works pretty good and yeah
this looks pretty good on the mac for a
safari looks just how i wanted to look
you can also select elements and get the
absolute details like if i click this
and see these boxes down here it gives
me a little bit of details if i flip to
let's say ie7 now you see this box
changed to red that means the values are
different
if you are trying to do a pixel perfect
layout they also have the light bulb
which is where you can kind of do the
same thing and just be real specific and
click on exactly what you want and it's
a nice little application check it out
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
