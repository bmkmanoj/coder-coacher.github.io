this story we're going to look at lists
in Python and a list is exactly what it
sounds like a list has a name and a list
has a bunch of values in it just like
this I think of a list kind of similar
to an array in other languages but not
totally the same thing in my opinion so
to make a list we'd say give it a
variable name we're gonna call this list
users equals and to do the less you use
these brackets okay and inside these
brackets go a bunch of values so since
we're doing string values we'd have to
use strings or or whatever these things
are called quotes and bread okay hey
enter and type in users and we have a
list we want to make a list of numbers
we could say 12 24 36 and with integers
you don't have to type the quotes so
ages and that's pretty cool now what if
we wanted to grab a couple of things out
of here but now we could say ages and
just like our previous tutorial with
this string you use these square
brackets again and we could select 0
which will give us or sorry that would
give us 12 we could say users 0 and if
we wanted to select a range of people
like let's say John and Amy we could say
users 0 to 1 sorry users 0 to 2 okay so
0 1 and the 2 here is where it stops at
so it's going to stop at this one and
not actually include it now if we wanted
to add something on the end of the list
let's just type users if we wanted to
add a number user you can use a method
from an object and
to explain that kind of simply a method
is like a function you remember we made
a function with death function that's
how you make a function but a method is
a function like this wrapped inside of a
class okay you don't need to worry too
much about that but there are a little
bit different functions and methods but
they're kind of the same thing and
everything in Python is an object so you
see this users here this is an object so
we can use string model or modifiers on
it or sorry what do you call it
methods on it so I could say users dot
append and I'm going to a pen sampson
enter and if i type users will get
sampson on the end now try to remember a
function like we said before which is a
maithili the same thing they use these
parentheses and a list uses these square
brackets so let's say we wanted to get
an item off the end of the list we could
say user stop pop and when you think of
pop I actually make the sound if I can
say like that
it just helps me remember it so that
takes off the last one on the end you
say well why do I need to know this
because if you memorize this you're
actually going to be programming you're
a bit like well I got to get the last
person off this list or this spot and
it's gonna be a lot easier than trying
to do something manually so we pop that
off type in users and it gets rid of
that there's other things like users
insert and the place you want to insert
it let's say we want to insert a girl
after John we could say the index which
is the number value so there's John
which is 0-1 which is a me and we want
to insert it where amy is and that'll
shift Amy over so I'd say insert one and
let's say
jano click enter and type users and
there we have it we can pop jhana right
in there sorry insert don't want to get
poppin insert confused if you want to
find the index of a number
remember when we typed user stat insert
and we get this where it says index
right here what you can do is you can
say users dot index and then the name of
it like what place is Jenna this would
be useful if you had a really long list
of just hundreds of items or something
that tells us the place holder you can
combine lists so let's say we wanted you
to combine the users plus the ages we
could say users plus ages now you want
to assign this a variable to so we'd say
all of them equals users plus ages okay
and when you type users it gives us that
when you type ages gives the ages but if
you type all of them okay and that'll
give us them all the reason I did
capital letters is this is called camel
casing and that's a popular coding
convention for multiple words and a lot
of programming languages one that I
prefer one thing to remember is that
your variables are case sensitive so if
you typed all of them that's not going
to give us the same thing as all of them
and if you do camel casing it's easier
to read maybe not so much with this word
but this looks like one long word this
one's a little more readable
nevertheless I digress let's say you
wanted to delete an item let's go to
users I would say or you'd actually use
a function you could say del and just
think of that as delete you say users
and which one our going to let's say a
me so that is two and type in users and
that gets rid of two you could do it
that way or you could use pop or
something like that you can also sort
lists like let's say ages this is
already sorted so let's make a new one
called
um num equals um - 33 - just some random
numbers and Titan um okay and you can
say sorted and iterable is something
I'll I won't get into that you just type
in the parameter here let's say num and
it sorts it out now that doesn't save it
that way so if you type nome again it's
not going to be sorted if you wanted to
save it as sort of you say num equal
sorted no okay just type num and it
sorts it for us and you can do other
things like if you wanted to reverse it
you could say num equal sorted and num
and you see this variable here that says
reverse run type comma reverse equals
fault cursor true and just type num and
it'll reverse its order for us one thing
I should mention while I got time is if
you want to create a copy of a list like
let's say we have num and we want num -
equals num if I type num - and if I type
num they look like the same thing okay
so let's say num dot pop - and type in
num and num2 they're the same thing the
referencing the same item it's not
creating a copy of this what I mean so
if you want to create a copy of
something you could say num - equals num
and then use these little brackets this
is probably a little confusing and don't
worry about this because you probably
won't need to do this anytime soon so
now if I said
nom de path let's say one if I said numb
and I said no I'm too you see they're
different so if you need to create a
copy just typing num 2 equals nom that's
not gonna create a copy but if you use
this little bracket piece it's just
saying num 2 equals everything that's
inside of nom okay I'm just bringing
that up just in case there's a lot more
to list but lists are pretty important
in something you should get comfortable
