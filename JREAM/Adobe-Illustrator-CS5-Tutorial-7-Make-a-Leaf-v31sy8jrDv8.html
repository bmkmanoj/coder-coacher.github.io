dream.com and we're gonna make a leaf in
this tutorial so there's a lot of ways
to do it I'm just gonna do it away that
I've done it before I'm just gonna make
a circle and okay then I'm gonna take my
pen tool and choose this little convert
Anchor Point and I'm gonna convert this
little bottom one okay and this would be
a cute little shape of a leaf but I'm
gonna do it a little differently I'm
just gonna move this bottom point down
about three shift spaces and then I'm
gonna grab this little piece here and
I'm gonna kind of turn it over like that
you might say well that don't look like
a leaf just hold on and I guess I'll
rotate it a little bit okay let me just
make it a solid color oh that's hard to
see okay and then what I'm going to do
is take the pen tool and I want a line
to go through the middle but make sure
you start the line outside of the leaf
because we're gonna split this little
object so like that and then just make
sure the rest of this line surrounds the
rest of the leaf okay and what we're
going to do is select both of these and
intersect well that's not exactly what I
wanted so let me undo that
click the leaf and just hit control C to
make a copy and then let's do intersect
again okay and then control V so now we
have this little piece here and I'll
make that a different color and move it
to the front all right and then I'll
just grab this little point at the
bottom and put it on top of the point
there and it's kind of a funny shape but
you can make it nicer if you'd like
and then I'll click the backside and
then the gradient tool and if you don't
have this tool on the side just go to
window gradient and just select the
default gradient you're just probably
black that's ok and I'm just gonna do a
green color and a dark green color and
I'm going to click this side and the
eyedropper tool to letter I and click
that leaf okay
and this actually looks kind of decent
but let me play with it the dark part
should kind of be in the middle I think
so yeah that's kind of decent looking
I'm really not liking this edge hanging
over here so select the square so that
you're selecting the underlying layer as
well oh that didn't work I think that
looks so that'll look better that's cute
all right and let me see what's this
underlying layer that down there okay
I'm just gonna move that underlying
layer there we go that's a cute little
leaf man I like this cool and then I
guess the leaf has a little stem
actually I'll just make a square I'm
trying not to make these tutorials too
tricky so I'll make a square like this
and I'll rotate it down here and I'll
move it to the back and maybe we want to
warp this so I'm going to go to effect
warp and just select something let's see
what arc does yeah arcs perfect and
always hit OK and I'll drag that to the
center of it
now I'm going to go to object expand
appearance okay and there you have a
cute little leaf yeah that's good thanks
for watching
and I'll also upload this file to my
website in the description if you want
to download it thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
