series I'm just going to log in real
quick and the first thing we're going to
want to do is learn how to change our
password and that's really easy you just
type passwd which is short for password
and you hit enter and you type in your
new password and I just have a very
simple thing i typed in so what we'll
start out doing is moving and renaming
files so if I did list if you follow our
last tutorial I had some junk folders in
there what I'm going to do is just clear
out this directory and be careful with
this command don't just use it crazy
just in this case and this holder I'm
just going to do it now so I'm going to
do a remove recursive force of
everything asterisk means everything
okay so first let's create a directory
called test and let's create another
director a file called doc okay so I
list those and to copy a file we use the
command to CP you'll notice that my file
doesn't have an extension I just did it
that way don't worry about it so I could
do CP for copy and file I want to copy
his dog and want to copy it into test
okay and if I go into the test folder by
doing change directory to test and list
I have doc cool
I'll go back down a level and let's list
that again now what if we're working
with important files and we want to be
sure we want to overwrite it or not we
can use the dash I so if I did copy dash
I dog to test says you want to overwrite
dot I'll say n for note and you'd
absolutely type Y for yes now moving is
the same way it's just envy so first let
me do make directory called test two and
unless that make sure it's there and I'm
going to move dog to test two and if I
list that out it shows that it's not
there so I'll go to CD test tube and
list and there's doc what if I wanted to
rename dog to something you have to
actually do it like this move dog 2 on 2
and list and basically that's how you
rename you're moving a file but you're
really renaming it kind of tricky but
not really I guess we're going to get
into something a little more interesting
which will be editing files so i'm going
to type PWD to the null where i am and
i'm just going to go back to my root
directory with the squiggly and we we
don't have to create a file using the
command touch that just creates an empty
file we can actually open an editor such
as VI them
and this is Vin now this is kind of
tricky to use so for a beginner I would
probably use nano it's kind of a lot
easier to use so if we wanted to create
a file called let's just say nano test
txt and we have this editor here and you
see all these little up arrow carrots
and the letter that up arrow is the
control symbol so if I hit ctrl G it
takes me to that ok and these lines down
here change I'll just press ctrl x to
get back so I'll type hello world and to
save it which you have to exit the file
and if you look here its control x ok is
this save it so i'll just type the
letter Y for yes and it just says do you
want to write to this file yes ok and
now let's just make sure it's still
there and if i want to read like let's
say the top or the end of the file
there's two commands called head and
tail head would be the top tail would be
the bottom now this file is really short
so we'll probably get the same results
if we use either command so if i type
head test txt hello world tail test txt
hello world so let's go to the manual
page of head and we can select how many
lines we want to do with the dash end
argument so let me type Q let's go back
in nano test txt and
I'm just going to put a couple numbers
on here so we have 10 lines and control
x the letter Y and enter so let's try
head dash and five test txt and it'll
give us the first 5 lines and tail is
the exact same but in Reverse let's do
three tests txt and ten nine eight those
are handy if you don't feel like opening
a log or reading a whole bunch of stuff
so that's pretty easy to and make a file
okay now what we're gonna look at now is
how to update our list of packages i'm
using sent off so i use young i'm going
to type young list updates and it might
take a little bit to go through the list
of updates we need it's just checking if
there's anything to update and you'll
see on the list there's updates updates
updates and all that if you're using a
dbm you would do apt-get list updates
but that's not in our Santa less here so
to update i'll just type yelm update and
it's getting all the packages and all
that stuff and it's going to ask me do I
want to update I'll say yes and this
might take a little while but to cancel
it in this situation you can press ctrl
C and it will cancel everything what's
going on so try to remember that control
C for the most part will cancel you
ought to anything if you're doing a
search so if i did find / all and i
wanted to cancel this i just press
ctrl-c to get out of that
I'm not going to do the actual yum
update here because that'll take about
10 minutes the other thing I guess we'll
look at is the find command so we have a
couple minutes left so um let's see why
am I find so I'm going to go directory
down and list and find you can set where
you want to find from if i did find here
/ name test txt the slash is where to
begin finding from and this would begin
finding from the very lowest level so it
would go through every one of these
folders and you could imagine that would
take a while but let's try it anyways
you see how the cursor is just sitting
here it was looking for stuff still but
wow that's actually pretty quick I did
find a sh test txt Oh looks like it up
looks through everything that way
strange so I don't know everything if I
go to man find where are the options
follow yeah there's a lot of options to
this usually finds things pretty quick
whoops q there's also um where is let's
say test txt sometimes that works real
good i'm not sure why sometimes i can't
find stuff melissa directory and then go
back into our group director and you see
how test is there i'll do where is test
txt and it's not showing up there and if
you don't know this you can do stuff
like where is test dot s turks and that
would mean test dot any file extension
so i did find from the base director of
aim test
name test txt ok so it finds it there ok
anyways before we get into a bunch of
hoopla I think that's a pretty good
start and thanks for watching us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
