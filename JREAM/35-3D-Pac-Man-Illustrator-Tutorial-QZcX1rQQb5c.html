we're going to use some 3d tools and
make a pacman and a pacman ghosts this
isn't gonna be terribly detailed but
it'll help you get started with the 3d
tools so the first thing I'm gonna do is
get the ellipse tool here and hold shift
and make a circle that's a decent size
and I'm also going to make another
circle this will be the top of the ghost
on the left is going to be pac-man and
the ghost is long so connect the lines
here so you see the lines that lock in
and we're gonna make this kind of long
you say well that's not the size of a
ghost I know it's because we're gonna do
3d and this is actually gonna become
kind of like twice as thick so it might
actually need to be a little longer so
let's start with pac-man I know he's not
blue we'll change that later and go to
effect 3d and revolve okay go ahead and
click preview see what we have and we
get a donut and obviously this doesn't
look like pac-man at all not yet anyways
and what we can do is flip this up on
its face you might get a little a couple
problems in it but no big deal
and what they were evolved we're gonna
change the angle and make it less there
we go
now I should mention you want this to be
the angle that you want to keep it
because if you're gonna try to rotate
this square after you create the 3d it's
not going to rotate unless you expand
the appearance so rotate it in the
position that you want that looks good
I have plastic shading on here and find
something you like that doesn't destroy
his face I'm kind of looking like
something like that okay and okay and
here's a little pac-man let's give him
the color of yellow and our swatches
yellow now it's looking like pac-man
onto the ghost first we need to select
these and Pathfinder and join those
together boom and let's close this and
let's click the little ghost guy and go
to the same thing 3d revolve and let's
click preview let's need some space over
here okay and I'm going to I kind of
want the top of his head showing so what
I'm gonna do is actually make this
corner a square so I'm gonna click this
and where's that hand tool I'll use the
white arrow tool see if I can do it this
way and I'm just gonna drag up until I
get that green line there okay and I'm
gonna get this convert Anchor Point
click and now it's straight
easy-peasy okay so let's click this
little bugger go to effect 3d and
revolve and let's preview that so he's
not revolving in the direction that we
want so from the right edge we're gonna
revolve it see how we change that around
the left edge does it from where you got
it just play with it and you'll see what
I mean
so pac-man is kind of facing upwards I
want this guy's head to be showing a
little bit it was good how about some
shading how this look shadings not as
cool on this little shape here no big
deal and I'll just hit OK and I know the
ghost has little what do they call
little drooping things here we could do
something with that I suppose maybe I'll
make pac-man's eye and it's black for
the eye I'm just gonna leave it like
that I haven't looked at pac-man in a
really long time so I'm not sure what he
looks like
for the ghost let me grab a picture real
quick okay these are nothing very
difficult to draw I'll just draw some
circles for the I move this on top white
and white
then he has uh some little beady eyes in
here make some blue in there and whoops
it seems like they're always looking in
some kind of weird direction and their
mouth when they're sad they have like a
funny little mouth but I'm not going to
do that just for fun I'm going to mmm
effect 3d I really want to re-edit this
shape here because his curve needs to be
better and I just double click that and
I'm gonna move that down a little bit
and his head
could be a little rounder okay that's
kind of funny-looking no big deal no big
deal okay so far the go size just to
have some fun I'm gonna click this and
want to go to object create gradient
mesh and I'm just gonna do three by
three okay and zoom in here I'm holding
ctrl + alt to zoom in and I'm using
spacebar to move around sorry if I
didn't mention that and around these
little edges I'm gonna create a little
bit of grey if I can select an edge
piece here oh there we go
it's not really that dark
this will just give them some an
interesting look I suppose so it's not
as plain since these other pieces are
somewhat 3d and I want to make sure this
inner piece is 100% white yeah it looks
good
first I I think I'll just do this black
and put this into there okay so I'm
going to delete those pieces and I'm
gonna add a drop shadow just to do
something different effect stylize drop
shadow preview now X goes left and right
and Y goes up and down I want X to be a
zero okay there we have that and I'm
gonna select these two holding shift
right click and group okay so now that
it's is one piece and alt drag over here
and hold shift okay and control one
there's a little Ghost Face not too sure
what to do about pac-man's I I guess we
could do I don't know I'll just leave it
maybe with this I'd like his mouth to be
dark but if you object expand appearance
it can usually lose a lot of quality and
you can see this white line going
through it and if I hit control one it's
still there so I'm going to leave that
the same so it's this little piece here
you could just draw a circle kind of
like this make it black and take your
time and rotate it into there so let's
just laying on top
I'm not going to monkey with it
because this video tutorial is getting
along so the ghosts he needs his eyes
closer together and I'd say they need to
be bigger so this alt track this haha
that's a funny-looking ghost for as
little alright so how we're gonna make
the little Draper's I'll attempt to try
doing that with the pen tool and you see
the colors don't change a whole lot down
here so I think it's safe to just use
some hand quality stuff let's just make
a Draper and I'll stretch this here so I
make sure it goes into the background
and oops I'm going to mirror this over
with the reflect tool and click it here
and let's find about the center point of
this object and it doesn't give us hints
because he's 3d and objects physically
right here alright and I'll just alt
drag this make this one bigger and with
the white arrow tool how about we move
this puppy up here and we'll just
reflect this one also like that okay so
he might look a little bit like a squid
and we can grab a gradient for this
so grab all these colors make it that
blue and let's make this a gradient
whoops
okay so double-click this and let's pick
a swatch oh boy it's gonna be kind of
tricky to find a blue color that we like
about something in here that's a decent
color well I'm not even going to get
into this because that's gonna make the
video kinda long but hopefully you guys
get the idea
playing with 3ds kind of cool and this
is just a nice little intro no thanks
