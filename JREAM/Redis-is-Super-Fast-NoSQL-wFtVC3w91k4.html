playing with Redis for a bit and the
reason is because it seems to be the
fastest no SQL database and it's really
easy to use I'm using this actually to
parse a very large set of data and I
found this without a joke I kid you not
with the amount of data I'm crunching is
40,000 percent times faster 40,000 than
MySQL it doesn't matter how much data
you're crunching it's so fast
anyways so I'm using Windows and you
know it's running on a linux server to
get out of Windows you just go to
download and you'd go to this Windows
guy here and clone it and is actually
done by Microsoft I believe who made it
and I I just downloaded the zip but
really the files you need are in the bin
folder the releases and I downloaded
this 64 bit one and I just threw with my
C Drive and made a shortcut here ready
server
and once you load that bad boy up you
got Redis right here I was messing
around let me close it and you should
get something like this I don't know if
it's as stable as the Linux one this is
kind of flaky with what I'm doing and
then there's also the Redis CLI and all
this does is it connects to the Redis
server so I'll just say set name Ted get
name yeah so it's just key value stuff
this isn't a video about data types and
how to use Redis I just want to show you
how fast it is and it's pretty sweet so
I got my reddit server open what I'm
going to do is just make a folder file I
suppose I'll save this as Redis how
about test dot PHP and I'm already
inside of a Redis folder here just
chilling out and I'm going to make a new
file
I call this let's say require and I'm
going to say this as composer dr. Chasen
and let's head over to packages and I
like to use P Redis I find it the
easiest library to use and I like to
grab these solid guys here so I'll just
grab that bad boy and okay so my again
let me clear this guy out and here's my
stuff here so I'll just do a composer
whoops
update okay so that's going to update
and back in my test PHP I'll just
require of vendor auto loan and to get
started in this guy here once that's
auto loaded it's quite easy I'll just
say new P Redis client okay let's call
this Redis okay and we can pass in some
data scheme will be TCP pulse will be 1
to 700 won and the port is going to be
the same port on your router guide shown
here which is six three seven nine
that's just the default port that
stuff's configurable but I actually
don't know how configure it is with the
Windows client okay so we have Redis
here and let's see make sure this guy
finished up okay and I'm just going to
PHP test okay no errors or anything and
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to make a big array I'll say range
equals range 1 to 5,000 and I'm going to
make a list and it's going to be called
users and I'm going to say if
let's do this Redis exists list okay so
if it does not exist then we create
stuff otherwise what I want to do is
just kind of dump out the data and what
I'm going to do is create a bunch of
fake data in a list this isn't the same
as just a string value but again this
isn't really about datatypes so let's
say for each range as key value okay and
I'll say let's make an array fake data
equals an array and I'll say name equals
Jessie age equals 29 okay and I'm going
to echo out that I'm setting value key
okay now let's push it into the list so
I'll do Redis list push or I'll push
into the list name the list name is
users and I'm going to push in JSON and
coded data of fake data okay so that's
it and all that and then to get it will
say data equals Redis list range on the
list which is users there and I want to
get 0 to negative 1 all the records I'm
going to print are of data so what's
going to happen is when I run this if I
want to rerun it and overlap it I need
to flush the database and I'll create
that in a second but let's go ahead and
run this for each line
tene I spelled this wrong okay and it
looks like I have abused something some
reason Redis on Windows is a little bit
flaky time to time me reload the guy
he's chilling there sets all the values
okay so start now if I ran it again
it's going to reset them all or it's
going to uh if I wanted to reset them
all I can do something like this Redis
flush all okay let me check if I got
that roof yeah flush off okay so this
will unset all data from the databases
so I'll just be like I wanted to start
over and I said Ted let me comment that
out and I'll show you that it should not
run KC is still showing Jessie but if I
wanted to make sure that it resets at
all I'll just flush all setting
obviously you'd have different data and
there's a different data like sets and
stuff and sorted sets where you have to
have unique values but with this set you
know I could go through this with PHP or
I could just print it out I could say
for each data as key value and I'll echo
value which might be correct maybe not
hey all that printed are all my stuff
and I don't have enough of room when we
comment him out boom boom and there's my
stuff so I could do JSON decode value
and I'll say stuff equals that and I'll
echo stuff name stuff age and echo a new
line see what happens there cool
obviously it's the same data but ah
let's check off the key actually
eko key okay there so it just ran 5,000
records like like nothing it's pretty
sweet so four key value data I ran this
and let me write down the number again
for you I ran a very very very complex
thing that handles a hundred thousand to
millions of users and very complex
situations and a lot of database
check-ins required so it would take me
to process 100 users through a series of
all this kind of stuff it would take my
sequel about 8 seconds ok and Redis I
can do 40,000 people in 8 seconds and
the funny thing is with Redis I could do
500 or 5,000 people in about 7 or 8
seconds pretty much the same thing the
only downside of this is populating the
Redis with my sequel since all the data
is stored in my sequel but once you get
the initial hump over where it's like
hey I'm going to fetch 5,000 records
from my sequel you process that into
Redis the rest is gravy
your applications a million times faster
because you know we don't use this Redis
of primary database it's more like
really good for processing stuff but
that's the gist of it hopefully by
watching this you might get a couple
ideas thanks for watching dudes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
