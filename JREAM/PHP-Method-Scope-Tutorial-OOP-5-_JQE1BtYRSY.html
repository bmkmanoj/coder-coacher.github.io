last tutorial when we made this file
logger and the log here what I'm going
to show you now is called method scope
and we'll cover this a little bit so if
you go to your file logger you wrote you
see we have public function right and
public function read we're going to make
some private properties and methods now
on this this isn't like the absolute way
to write log class just so you know it
usually takes me hours or days to think
of the best way to go about it but I'm
just making it pretty quick for the sake
of tutorial so let's do um private file
name now when you name a variable
private property I you should always use
a underscore it's not required but when
you're looking through your files and
you see a bunch of properties if it has
an underscore you'll know immediately
it's either private or protected so i
really suggest doing that and we're just
going to say we're going to change this
is writable too or we're going to set
the string file name and we're going to
set this file name equal string filename
and we'll do a string data is going to
be private let's call that data and this
oh not supposed to have that there data
equals string data and this is so that
we can't grab these outside of the
object and it has to be set inside of
the write function so we have these set
and the reason I'm doing this also is
because we're going to put this little
thing inside of a checking function so
just
cut this here and let's go down to the
bottom let's do a private function
um check permission you can pop that in
and remember we have a private string
now so it'll be this file name just like
that
so we first make sure that that is good
and we also have to change this string
and let's also do another check for
string data make sure that's not empty
I'll just do another function private
function check data and we'll say if I
guess string length this data if the
string length of this data is less than
one we will kill the script you must
have more than one character for data
and one thing to consider is we had a
bunch of checking things we'd probably
actually use some type of validation
class maybe but this is very simple and
to the point so check data check
permission others copy these and when we
write to the file we do this check
permission and this shed data so before
anything happens we are checking stuff
and you probably want to comment this
and say set class VARs check data and
write the file okay
and when we read we don't really need to
use the actual
object properties here I mean because
this is really to the point I guess
let's do one for if the file exists and
the reason I'm going to pass this into
the value once again is because we're
going to use it in another method so
this file name equals string file name
and let's say this check exists it will
do private function check exists and
will do if file exists this file name
will say if it does not exist died the
file does not exist and I'm trying to
give you an example of what we're doing
is we're transferring the I guess you'd
call it the role of the object into a
bunch of sub methods that where each
method does kind of its own thing and so
we check if it exists and let's see if
this works so back on here let's try
just again to read okay that's good what
if we try to read test - okay the file
does not exist good let's get rid of the
reading now let's try writing and for
the writing let's just put in a new
string here Joe Joe Joe refresh and
let's open up that little file here good
so this is all working and hopefully
this gives you a little idea of how to
pass things along you could probably
imagine things could get out of order I
you know it's up to you where you put
your private methods and public ones I
usually just kind of put them as close
together
possible so it doesn't get too confusing
you could even make these more details
and say you know if read check is this
because when you read this code later
you're going to really regret not
commenting it so desk check is anyways I
don't type up all these notes okay I
think that gives you a better idea
