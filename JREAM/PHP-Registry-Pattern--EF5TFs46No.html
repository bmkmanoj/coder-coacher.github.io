this is a tutorial about the registry
pattern and PHP basically what it is is
it is a container for objects to be
reused and it saves on resources for
example I'm going to create a static
registry object so I'll just require
once ok and what it's going to look like
is this registry set the easiest example
I can think of as a database and just do
new database this is assuming that we
have some kind of database already
required okay just pretend that's there
so in the registry object or class we'd
have a setter and together and I'm gonna
make those static public static function
set and public static function get so
mm-hmm you have to imagine we have a
couple of sections let's say we have a
page with a header content and footer
just a regular page but these are all
PHP things right and then you want let's
just say a cor dot PHP and this is
loaded at the top of every page kay and
we want to be able to use the database
throughout the header content and footer
pages without creating new database
connection
because if we had in the header if we
had this new database new database we're
gonna have three database links inside
of one page okay so a good thing you can
do is use a registry pattern okay so to
do this we set the database and we go
like this we set the name and the object
and let's create a premade private array
for objects and when we set it we're
gonna say this equals well this object
name equals object okay so this will
place for example if we inserted this it
would look like this
this odd DB equals and you know that
would hold our database resource object
okay and then for the get we're just
going to get it by the name
and we're going to return what you're
going to want to do is make the get a
reference so basically what that means
is you put a hand signed before it and
this will grab the exact same object
here in memory and actually we have to
change this to self since these are
static classes okay so this is a pretty
poor example you probably want to make
sure that name is set get the name set
it to null just if they leave a blank
and if name is not equal to null we'll
try to return something I guess just
don't worry about all this right now but
there's pre-made registry objects you
can use that will be a lot better than
what I can try to think about right now
anyways what you do is you let's say
you're in a quarry HP page okay you
would set the database to your new
database and to use it you would do
you would get the database here then in
the header you could do you know select
something in the end you wouldn't need
the new database to be called there so
now you're saving a lot of resources and
you can just reuse your objects you know
a database isn't the only object that
you could use it for you can use it for
quite a bit else all right I hope some
of this made sense I'm not sure how this
explanation turned out it's kind of hard
to explain in my opinion I I don't know
why maybe you have to monkey with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
