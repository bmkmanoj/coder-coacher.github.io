controllers so we made our home
controller I can drop my index
controller here sorry my welcome
controller we're no longer gonna want to
use that and in my config I want to
change the default controller what that
is is if you go to this page without a
controller and the URL I wanted to go to
my home controller so what I'll do is go
to confer outs and the default
controller will be called home remember
we just created that right there so
index is the first thing that's loaded
by default in a controller let's create
another one public function about this
for an example we can echo this is an
about page okay so up here I'll refresh
there's home and if I go to home slash
about we have this as an about page and
you can see from the URL but it's very
easy
there's looking the class name home and
here's the method name about furthermore
you can pass in arguments like dog cat
and all echo dog cat so if we go here
and we put fish and some stuff there
we'll get it in the URL as well okay so
what we're going to do is start building
a login system because that's what
everyone seems to want I can get rid of
this stuff here so we'll have our home
controller let's work on a user model
just to prepare it so I'll do a new PHP
class called user on this form model
and I'll say class user model extends
codeigniter
model okay then I'll do a public
function construct and a parent instruct
not sure if this is totally necessary in
CodeIgniter but I'll do it anyways okay
so remember our user table we've created
we have a user email and a password
that's all that's in there so public
function create public function delete
and I guess we'll leave it at that right
now
what we want to use is the database
class almost all the time so in order to
get that in our model just we can just
go up to auto load and then this list we
can load libraries so here's libraries
and I'll just throw in database okay and
for create I'll say this DB insert the
table name is user and I'm using PHP 5.4
so I'm just going to go ahead and use
the square brackets and we have an email
and the password
okay and we'll get into improving this
later and this method will say email and
password okay so this is a model that
handles database logic in here we're
going to delete based on the user ID so
I'll say to this TV where user ID equals
user ID and this DB delete you might be
sitting here thinking I don't know what
you're doing but if you just follow
along as you do it it's gonna start
making sense I figure that's the best
way to learn just messing around we want
to delete from the user table okay so
all this model does is mess with the
database and from our home controller
let's make another one let's call it
admin and inside of here we ought to
change the class name to admin and the
page is going to be called admin we'll
get to that later in another video and
then we'll have some publicly accessible
functions called great music delete user
and then we're going to load the model
so we'll go this load model use your
model this user model and what did we
write in there I better open it again
delete and create so delete
these are deep and this will be great
email and password okay so a quick
rundown what's happening someone's going
to go to our site let's say they go to
the admin panel we're going to make a
form that allows them to pass in a way
to create a user so since we're in the
admin class we'll pass in slash create
user and with that it's going to call
this here and then it's going to call
the model the user model right and well
first we load the user model and then we
call the function we just created and
we're gonna pass in an email and
password we'll get to that that'll be
posting data and then it's gonna save in
the database okay so that's a good start
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
