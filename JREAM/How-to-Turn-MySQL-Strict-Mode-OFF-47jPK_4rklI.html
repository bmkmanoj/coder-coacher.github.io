how to disable my sequel strict mode and
the reason is my sequel 5.7 shifts will
on by default so if you're using a fork
as well like I am such as percona or
Maria DB and maybe on by default and my
sequel strict mode in itself isn't a bad
thing but a lot of applications are not
primetime ready for the strictness of it
that being if you were to insert a null
value into a field that doesn't have
null ticked off things have problems and
I've noticed this with Drupal even
laravel direct us and several ORM s it
seems it affects database abstraction
layers and really a lot of web based
Dewey's so the first thing we have to
know is where is our my sequel config
I'm just going to go to it
it's XC my sequel and I'll just do a LS
and keep in mind that I am using percona
but it doesn't change all the folders
now you can see my CNF fare it's in blue
so if I do a symlink this is where the
actual file is yet with symlinks I can
still view it so I'm just going to cat
my dot CNF what we can do is it says in
this file let's see my sequel my CNF
which is really editing this symlink
will set global options where I showed
you before the tilled which is your user
directory
oh it's a dot my CNF is for a user
directory I don't really ever use that
but I want to change this system-wide
and I don't want to edit the my config
file so I'm just going to CD into the
comp D which is an included folder now
let's see what's in here and I'm going
to create a new file I also want to run
one command real quick and before I make
this file just search for that so the
default options are read in the given
order the first one being XE my config
let's see my sequel my config and then
you're either one so what happens is in
order
the last one will overwrite if it has
other settings so if you had a user base
my sequel config it would overwrite
whatever would be in here or in here
okay but since I don't have that to
worry about I'll go ahead and create my
file we can call it anything we want I'm
just going to say sudo I have to do sudo
because super user this is kind of a
protected area them you can always use
Nano and I'll say disable strict mode
dot C and F and it has the end with CNF
so enter you might have to enter your
password I had done before and we put
square brackets here and MySQL D as in
Damon not just my sequel which is the
client and we do SQL underscore mode
equals and what we want to do is put the
traditional settings in place and I have
a copy here and I'll just paste it now
I'll put this in the comments sorry not
the comments the description so that you
can just copy paste it and I will save
it however you like to save it
and it's just two lines of code okay and
then I'll say sudo service my sequel
restart and if you get no errors you
should be good and whatever application
you're working with you should no longer
receive those errors if I list what's
here if I wanted to re-enable it I could
just sudo move the disabled strict mode
and my sequel will only read dot C on
that file so I could just call this
underscore off if I wanted to and then
preserve the code that I have and that's
it thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
