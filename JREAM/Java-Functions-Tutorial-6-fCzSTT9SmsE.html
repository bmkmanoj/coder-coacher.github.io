youtubers today I'm going to talk about
functions in a Java and here we have a
class called funk I've saved it saved it
as funk Java short for function and you
might notice in my thing up here I move
these little brackets in front of string
you can have them either or and we've
already gone over that and I just have a
print line and one thing to notice is
this word static and what static means
static basically means you can call a
function from within a class without
having an instance of the class and
that's kind of a mouthful and if you're
not familiar with the ohoopee this might
sound confusing so I'm going to try to
go slow and explain that what we're
going to do is make a instance of a
class so that we can use a regular
function okay so let's say T test t
equals new test okay and this might be
your first time doing this we're
creating a custom object first we have
to have a object called test so I'm
going to make a new file and we'll just
say class test and we can create a
function so I would say public void and
then the name of it let's just say talk
and we'll do a system dot out dot print
line hello I'm from talk ok and save
this as test dot Java the same directory
and now that we have an instance of the
test object we have to say hey this test
object is going to be the variable T and
this is going to be a new test object
you could say test d equals new test as
well and these will both use the same
object here called test so in teak and
Andy I can use this function called talk
and if they were saving data the classes
T&amp;amp;D would be different because there are
different instances so an object is just
basically a reusable thing and used in
different instances so I'll just have
tea and I'll call the function with T
dot talk safe and let us compile this I
will say Java Sea funk dot Java and Java
funk and here we have it called and this
is in the same directory Java
automatically knows to find the test
object so we're compiling this funk
class from the Java console and what's
being happen is it's running this main
static argument and remember i'm not
sure if i mention the static can be
called with a class not instantiate it
so when we run this in the console this
function class isn't really there's not
an instance of it it's just calling this
static function so in the case of a
regular function like public void dog
I'll just copy this here so if I had a
regular function like we do in talked
and I said dog it's going to give us an
error I'll just recompile that and it
says non-static method dog cannot be
referenced from a static context and
what's what's the saying is that you
can't call dog from the static function
because we need an instance of the funk
class to call it so in this case you
could do public static void dog and I
think that might work well c java funk
and there's dog if it's static you're
really not going to get obsessed over
static because I kind of prefer to do
everything regular objects but we'll
move on now and what if I wanted to pass
a variable inside of talk for example I
wanted it to say hello I'm from and then
my name what i could do is type in some
text here and i'll say america and
inside the talk function i'll go here
and i'm going to do string and i will
just call it X ok and what's happening
is we're passing what we just typed
within the talk and we're making it a
string so over here see where it says
talk and then I put America the variable
X is going to hold that value that i
typed in if I want to put this on the
end of the stern I can do plus X
and I'll go ahead and run that and hello
I'm from America not too bad and you
could also do you know the things like
what was it to upper I think I don't to
upper case Java Sea and Joe and it will
go and we can do cool stuff with that so
the last thing I think I'll talk about
is the argument up here and since I just
showed you how to pass data into the
function there let's go ahead and pass
some data into this string args and what
that basically means is when we run the
function we can pass arguments in here
so for example we'll do a loop and say
for
string x4 args don't worry about what
this says right now and we'll do a
system out print line x okay so I'm just
going to print out these args here and
I'm representing the arguments as the
variable X and I'm printing it out and
I'll just run this okay and you run it
looks the same but if I run it and say
hey hey hey it's going to print hey hey
hey and it can read our input when we
compile the thing and without going too
far I think that'll be a good warm-up
and perhaps we'll talk about loops
sometime next and for now this is just a
getting you familiar with other files
passing data into regular functions and
just a general discussion about what
static is thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
