with dream.com in this tutorial we're
going to list some mp3's in a folder and
then use yahoo media player to make it
playable this will save you a lot of
time because you can imagine if you were
listing out mp3 files manually like this
you'd have to name each one over and
over so we just want to create a
directory I called mine mp3s and in
there I just have a couple mp3's what we
want to do is cycle through the mp3's
directory so i'll just call it der
equals mp3s and we'll make a handle to
open the directory open derp derp derp
stands for directory and i will do a
while loop to read the directory so a
while and read their handle and we want
to actually give this a file assign this
a file equals reader handle and so while
it's reading it let's build up an array
and let's just say mp3 s equals file
this should have brackets and let's say
mp3 s equals alright then we want to
close the directory close door handle
ered yeah handle and if we refresh this
we won't see anything I don't think
let's do a print our of mp3's see what
comes up and here it is it's working let
me echo a pre to format the output
okay so in this folder we have a dot a
dot dot and then the mp3's we don't want
these dots I believe the dot dot goes a
directory up kind of like a back arrow I
can't remember what the dot does to get
rid of those we can just do an if
statement in here I suppose so if file
is not equal to dot then make the array
cable got rid of that one and file is
not equal to dot dot okay and there we
have a nice little array of our files
now there's a way to read id3 tags I'm
not going to do that today because I
just want to get some basics in here
okay so what we want to do now is a for
each loop of the arrays and then we want
to kind of format them in HTML so just
put some HTML down here push body
Ishmael for this I'm going to use a
header in HTML because we're going to do
some script and for the body let's just
include those PHP tags again we're going
to say for each mp3's as key value and
we are going to echo the value I believe
is what we want let's just make sure
okay we got those listing that's good
and for we're going to plug in the Yahoo
media player whoops and we're going to
plug in the Yahoo media player and
that's just found it developers
yahoo.com / media player and this makes
it really easy to have a media player on
your page they give you this script
right here it's actually a pretty nice
player too so up here let's just pop
that in and refresh these need to be
links to the mp3 files so go back here
and let's do echo a href equals actually
I got to switch these quotes around okay
a href equals um der which is mp3's
remembered der is defined right here and
/ value there and here we should end the
anchor and refresh looks like one of
them is working and you'll see down here
we got this that's pretty cool um there
might be a problem with the spacing it
looks like uh some of its getting
chopped off inside of the loop so let's
see let me echo 0 0 value let me view
the source real quick okay you see the
problem we have these dashes here and
that's causing a conflict so we can do
stripslashes
so for something like this you would
probably use ad slashes because you see
this character here that's in conflict
with this character here there is a
function called add slashes ah but I'm
going to do it this way since we have
single quotes I'm going to backslash
quotation backslash quotation and that
makes it so that we can print those
there and there we have it let me show
you the source once again as we did the
backslash it made this a literal quote
and we can play the songs look how nice
of mp3 player this is by yahoo gives you
a playlist switches songs in that pretty
easy see now you're now you're getting
things done saving a lot of time that it
was a kind of fun tutorial very easy to
do I hope you have fun with it and you
know be cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
