tutorial we're going to make a super
mario star so hold down your little
toolbox and grab your star tool and
we're just going to make a star kind of
straight up and down if you have too
many stars use your up and down arrow
keys and I'm going to hold shift so that
it's straight up and down and in your
little color palette let's do a gradient
I'm going to click this little gradient
icon or you can go to window gradients
and you get this and I selected a linear
gradient sorry a radial gradient and for
the color just double click this and
click this little swatches tab and I
picked this yellow one right here and to
get this color I double click this one I
picked yellow and then went back to the
color tab and I just kind of drag this
down a little bit and well let's go back
and choose this color right next to it
and drag that down just a little bit
okay looks good and now I'll just adjust
the gradient click the little gradient
tool whoops and click this and I'm going
to make mine comment from the top and
I'm going to move this down
whoops kind of like that I'm having a
little trouble clicking today so now the
star has little rounded edges so click
the star and go to affect style eyes and
rounded corners and i have minus 18
pixels you can click preview change the
number and test it out now if you change
the number and don't see anything change
just click the box in this little area
here to see a update or you could just
unclick and click preview and i'll press
ok so we got this cool looking star here
and he has some eyes and his eyes are a
circle or oval and those are black so i
don't want a gradient on this there we
go and then he had some a little inner
glow that is white so i'll just go ahead
and put white in here but right there i
think i'm going to make his I agreed ian
i'm just going to use a black on one
edge and maybe kind of a grayish color
like that and i'll try moving this
gradient once again from top to bottom
because the light is coming from the top
okay so that looks good and what we're
going to do is click the circle here and
the circle here so we have both selected
I held shift to do that then press ctrl
G and that groups them together and you
can see I can move this around and let's
try to get these in place there we go
and for the last thing I'm going to make
a little shiny line I think I'll just
use the pen tool how about I was drive
from here to here and then I'm going to
click up here but I'm going to hold it
down to get a curve whoops there we go
that looks like a good curve and flip
this over to the stroke and let's make
this a little thicker looks good and now
for the little tool here I forgot the
name of it what is it called all this
stroke transform tool I don't know the
name and what I'm going to do is make it
fatter in the middle and thinner on the
edges
hmm oh there we go whoops I have to
monkey around with this
it is very embarrassing anyways i'm not
going to do a perfect you get the idea
and i'm going to make this a little
transparent and you can go to window
transparency for this mines down here
kind of hard to see and i'm just going
to add a little transparency that and
that looks good to go thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
