a series for using coded nighter which
is a model view controller framework and
I talked a lot about MVC so I'm not
going to go over the basics of MVC but
if you want to learn that you could look
this on my other videos we're just going
to kind of jump in and get moving with
it so what we'll do first is we would
download code igniter to our hard drive
and you'd place that on a website or
your local host I put that on my
localhost I have one set up an Apache
for work space I just called it see I
tutorial okay and what you'll get is a
user guide folder I just deleted mine
because you can look at the user guide
online and it takes up a little bit of
space when you zip up your project so
this is just the same thing that comes
with it and all of our work is going to
happen inside the application folder so
go ahead and head over here and we got a
lot of these which we'll go over a few
shortly what I'm going to do is open up
netbeans and create a project for this
because netbeans is my favorite ide and
it's a pretty easy to use just takes a
minute to load up
there will okay what is that okay I was
mucking around in here and decided to
redo the video because I was going too
fast okay so here's our folder and when
we go to our local host set up we have
this as our main page and it tells us
what it is it's a welcome message so
what I first will do is look inside the
applications folder and controllers and
here's the Welcome message as you know
controllers are what handle what goes
where on the pages and all that okay so
i could delete some of those comments
and what i'm going to do is rename this
to home because it makes more sense and
the view i'm going to change that now
you can't use index you can't call this
index the main controller because it
will conflict with codeigniter you also
can't call it default because that's a
PHP word so if you wanted you could call
a main if you want I kind of prefer home
ok so our home controller is going to
load the home view so if I go over to
views I have one called welcome message
I'll go ahead and just delete that ok
and I'll make a new PHP file and call
this home
and we'll say hey I am home ok now we're
going to have a problem because when I'm
here and I refresh there's no longer any
welcome page and that has to do with the
config folder ok so we've looked at
views and controllers very easy now the
big config folder and it's probably a
little scary at first but what you're
going to go to is the routes and there's
only two settings in here if you scroll
to the bottom and it's the default
controller basically what do you want
your index page to be and I want mine to
be the home controller ok so if I go
back and refresh oops I save that yeah
routes is home i forgot to rename the
controller to home oh there and i'll go
ahead and refresh and hey i'm home so
that's a how we do that and routes is
good to go i can just close that up what
i'm going to do for this video tutorial
and keep it kind of short is we're going
to create a layout so what I'm going to
do inside the views I'm going to create
a new folder and the way I prefer to do
it is for every controller it has its
own folder so home will have its own
folder so I'll put home in there and now
i'm going to rename home to i guess just
default you could call yours index i'll
go home / default and then i refresh ok
looks good and basically what this does
is when we load the view it goes to the
folder home and then it goes to the file
default notice that it strips out the
dot PHP and it needs to match up perfect
for that so for my header and footer
which are generally in all websites
upgrading the PHP file i'll call a
header and i'll create a new page speak
file call it footer okay and inside the
header will have something like you know
doctype HTML HTML I'm going to pause the
video just to type this out one second
okay and basically what I did was for
the header file i just threw in a basic
layout so we have our body starting here
i like to put these little notes here so
i know when things start and begin
because what happens is it first
compiled our header that's going to
include are actual controller view and
then we're going to include the footer
okay so in the footer I did this I
wrapped it with end content you know
start the footer and then end the
wrapper okay so that looks all good
right now it's not going to do a whole
lot this isn't going to do anything
either yet however to load these what
I'll do is this we're inside of the home
controller I'll do the load view and I
want to load the header
and here I want to load the footer okay
so i'll save that and refresh and header
footer and home and what we would need
to do is create some CSS files here I
always include a reset because that's a
good idea or you could just include it
in your default and in this case I'll
just include it in my default file so
inside my views I kind of prefer to put
my CSS and all that outside of the
application folder I'm not sure if
that's good or bad practice so i'll just
do it that way for now because that's
the way i prefer it so open my source
files i'll create one called public so
let me share this down so you can see so
now I application in a public folder
it's up to you where you want to put
these little folders just create a
couple of sample folders j/s okay and
inside the CSS folder we're going to
create a new cascading style sheet I'll
call it the default and was thrown like
a body background of silver
and don't forget our every set code
that's just to make sure it's working
looks pretty oops we forgot to tell it
where to get the CSS file so I'll go
ahead and close that and an header what
i would do is was at public CSS
default.css i'll go ahead and refresh
now depending on the scope like let's
say we were at index dot PHP / home now
the CSS doesn't load like if you are
under different segments in the URL
because the path has changed so what I
would do is echo base URL and we might
actually need a helper for that I guess
that'll be an introduction for that and
what do we have going on here undefined
variable title and we'll get to that
okay my errors aren't displaying for
some reason I mean there's this but i
don't think that usually kills it yes it
does so what we're going to do before we
get to this so just kind of put us in
the back burner we're going to go to our
home and we're going to pass in a title
I'll say title equals my project okay
and to pass a variable into a view who
can set an array I'll say title
title actually I could just grab it like
that okay so title will be the variable
and the header will take that title
there ok so I'll refresh and refresh
what is going on I think I have a
problem with that helper here usually
you'll get a problem that appears i'm
not sure why mine's not might have it
configured kind of funny ok so let me go
back refresh and the title isn't up to
hearing HP echo title Oh title oh I have
to do in the header whoops there I'm
working on the header file not the
actual content file refresh ok now we
have my present so now if I go forward
to say like one of these where the CSS
doesn't load we need that base URL
helper and what we can do is go to
application config and auto load there
it is there's a lot of stuff in here so
we have packages we have libraries like
for your database and we have helpers
which you what I'll use one and we'll
start pretty simple I'm going to just
throw in the URL helper and a helper
basically if we go to the code igniter
docks expand this let's here we go help
our references here's your a helper and
you can manually load them like that
like if I want my controller and loaded
it like that but I prefer an auto load
for something like this that's going to
use be used all the time so let's look
at this we got base URL helper site URL
i'll try site URL
so since that's enabled we'll go back to
my header file and slightly to RL no I
want a base URL actually because I place
this outside of the application
directory let's see if that does this
any good refresh there we go and now
that works good so back here I'm going
to go ahead and close out header go to
my home and what we're going to do is
create another section in our home and
I'll just call this public function
about whoops and what we want to do is
maybe include something like this about
I'll just call that about the reason I'm
doing this is just for your example of
creating another view get your hands a
little dirty so inside our home i'll
create a new PHP file and call it about
i generally won't use this to make like
a regular website really but in this
case i'll just do what we can so you'll
notice i don't have my mod rewrite on so
if i met / home it doesn't work so you
have to have index PHP before that so if
i were to go to about would be home /
about and there about me shows now i
think you're going to want to get rid of
this index PHP because it's turning me
kind of crazy and it just doesn't look
good to do that
we will go to our config file and our
base URL is empty but we want to change
our index page and make that empty ok
and let me see each other junk in here
others save that and we're going to need
an HT Access file in our lowest level
here right next to the actual index page
that handles everything so I'll make a
new empty file i'll call it HT access
i'm going to open up a HD access so i
don't have to rewrite this all again and
i just use the one from oh what's his
face this guy so you could hit up google
and say hey code igniter mod rewrite and
let's see if it's the first one
okay there's Elliot talkin I just copy
this whole thing and just place it in
there I'll close that off now you'll
notice something that might trip you up
I'm not in just the workspace area i'm
in /ci tutorial so in my HT access i
actually have to put in CI tutorial okay
and let's see how that looks or refresh
and i should be able to strip out this
and it works so i can just go to home
and now about and that's how you to hook
that up so i can close this not worried
about my config you'll probably coming
back to autoload well we will and i
think this is a good place to stop and
think about what we're doing if you're
not familiar with the NBC that well you
might be very very confused and you
should just look at a different video to
learn how to do that alright i hope you
guys like this video in the series
coming up we're going to make something
that's actually going to be useful and
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
