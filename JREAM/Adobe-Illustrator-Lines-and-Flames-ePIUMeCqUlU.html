making a framework in PHP for databases
called flames so i thought i'd throw up
a little tutorial on making like a
little fireball kind of an abstract one
and i also i have this little key thing
down here to show what key i'm pressing
so you could get familiar with the
hotkeys and you can see I'm holding it
down to pan so what we're going to do is
make a new document and I'm going to
zoom into a hundred percent with control
one and let's start with a circle I'm
going to hold the shift key so that it's
a perfect circle and what I'm going to
do is I want this to point up a little
bit kind of like it's coming at you just
a little bit and to do so if I grab my
white arrow tool with the letter A I
click this guy you see these little
edges these handles I want to get rid of
that so that it points so I'll go to my
pen tool and i'll pick convert Anchor
Point and click there we have it so back
to my black arrow I'm going to copy this
guy with ctrl C and then I'm going to
press ctrl f and it pasted in front but
it looks like it pasted the wrong chunk
of it it looks like it pasted it only
the top let me try that again and select
control C and ctrl f okay and what I'm
going to do is just kind of cut along
the top so i'll change the color of this
okay i'm going to move this down I'm
going to hold shift and press down okay
and what I could actually do is probably
instead of cutting this up with the
Pathfinders just remove the point at the
top there so i'll go ahead and grab my
subtraction tool with the delete Anchor
Point and I'll go boom that's exactly
what I wanted so I'll press the letter V
to get back to my black arrow and hold
shift and press whoops looks like
got a point selected I bet every let me
control Z a couple times now move it up
cool that's exactly what I want and what
I'm going to do is make this background
a little bit darker orange so with this
color I'll go to my swatches I'll
double-click this guy and I'll just drag
them down a little bit like so just let
me open my swatches tab I'm going to
drag this watch all the way over here
now I can click here a background color
and I don't have any lines if you have
lines on yours make sure you have this /
you could just select this whole thing
and just click this little nun or you
could pressure / tool anyways back to
this I want to get to my foreground
color you can press the letter X or you
can just press this and we're going to
apply that swatch there so boom that
looks cool so move that down what I'm
going to do is kind of make some
abstract looking flames so with my pen
tool make sure you have the pen that
doesn't have the plus or the minus buy
it just a plain pen tool and I will
click this tip here now this did not
create an anchor point on top of this it
didn't create an anchor point as part of
this object it's a new one just so you
know and i'll go up a little ways and
hold the mouse down and a hold shift and
just drag it like that move up with my
mouse with a little bit and if i hover
over this anchor point i can see this
little green line get a nice straight
line um that looks good what i'm going
to do is convert this into a line so
boom and that line is a little thin so
let me get this focus here and you
should have your stroke window open
somewhere if you don't you can always
find every window you need inside the
window panel you
go to stroke and I'm going to make that
a bit thicker okay and i think the caps
of it I guess now I'll just leave them
like that and I'll put this behind I
hold shift a lot when I move stuff so
then I'll pan to get a little more room
around here looks kind of funny like at
a corner with a really long stem so what
I'm going to do is duplicate this line a
couple times by holding alt and dragging
let's see I think I'll put one right
here and i still have it all tile down I
think I'll put one right here doesn't
have to be perfect and I'll just drag it
up and make it bigger you'll notice my
stroke got a lot thicker if you want to
change that option when you resize them
let me undo that you can press ctrl k to
open up your preferences and you can go
to oh it's right on the general scale
strokes and effects I'll uncheck that ok
so now if I resize this it'll stay the
same width that's an important one to
remember so let's see what we can do
here this looks like kind of part of a
flame I think I'll throw this guy right
here I'm going to send them to the
background see the key i press ctrl
shift bracket you can also use control
bracket to send it one back those are
really important keys strokes to
remember you'll use them all the time
for everything ok and I'll duplicate
this guy and throw them up right here
you might be thinking well this looks
kind of silly and I know it does I'll
send him to the back control shift back
bracket
okay and I think this guy could be moved
over a little ways make them a little
bigger what we're going to do is we're
going to fill these in in in a kind of
clever way I think I'll move this guy
down like so rotate them a little bit
okay I gotta make sure to send him to
the back okay and we haven't peeping out
there so I'm going to do is I'm going to
hold ctrl and alt I won't show both the
hot keys at the same time and I'm going
to delete one of the anchor points which
would be this one whoops the one down
here so I'll go to my pen tool delete
boom now that won't be a problem anymore
okay and I'm gonna line this guy up
since it's a stroke it's kind of a
tricky to line up just kind of eyeball
it a little bit I suppose and the way I
want my flames I like how the these two
look but this guy is bothering me so how
about me
that's kind of cool okay so we'll work
with that so I'm going to zoom in a ways
and I'm going to grab my handy pen tool
this isn't the only way you could do it
we're going to draw a shape behind here
another way you could do it I'll show
you first we'll draw a shape and just
kind of follow the lines and boom and I
got to flip the background color like
this i'm going to change the color just
to something random oops better get rid
of that okay let's send my guide to the
back another way you could do this is
make say a square polygon will probably
be easier to use so we got a couple of
edges to work with and I'll just like
drag some corner pieces over it's pretty
much the same thing since they're not
going to see the edges of this it
doesn't really matter how perfect they
are I'll lined up they are thing is I
want to curve this one so I'll take my
pen tool and I'm going to delete this
anchor point boom and then I will
convert this one I'll just kind of there
we go that's not the look I want there
we go like that so I find just using the
pen tool itself is a little bit easier
send that guy to the back zoom out a
little ways and I think I'll fill in
this entire flame here so I'll get my
regular pen tool and just boom boom
just make sure you stay in the lines and
send him to the back and make it a
little interesting I think we'll add one
right here now this one's going to curve
up so I'll go up here and just be like
boom and kill the anchor point oops i
attached to a different line
accidentally click that anchor point so
let's just draw those lines that little
white space they're dead fill in so undo
and boom and send to back it looks like
again I did something wrong I'm
attaching it to the wrong oh I have a
subtract symbol that's odd no what's
going on here that shouldn't be a
subtraction but let me actually move the
object up with the black arrow see
what's happening this path doesn't I
guess it's closed that's funny didn't
seem like it must be too late at night
so i'll send that to the back boom and
i'll go to one hundred percent view okay
so now we just got to pick out some
colors for flames I'll base it off this
orange color so i'll double click here
I'll just drag this guy down a little
bit and I'll throw him and my swatches
I'll do that again
whoops I should just snap this out of
here boom there we go you can also
create a new folder of swatches if you'd
like so this could be our little color
group in here if you prefer that do not
know and then here just a couple of
variations of red okay good enough so
let me get back to that orange color
oops sorry about that because I like the
orange color it looked cool something
like that let me throw him in there too
boom and give him some color so let's
color these flames up this will be one
color this will be another color this
will be another color wait that's not
dark enough
and I think I'll just darken him up a
little bit
and obviously the problem with this
thing is the color of the borders these
lines look silly so let's just pick a
red color and I think we'll make it a
dark red and click the rest of these
guys and holding shift just click the
lines I'll press the letter I and go
boom get those colors in there with them
all selected I'll send those to them
actually I'm moving one back at a time
there we go and this one's overlapping
so I got to send him all the way back
okay so this guy I suppose I'll try
matching the color of the border might
look a little silly actually I think it
looks kind of silly without a border on
it maybe that could be the issue so I'll
just press I and copy that and we have a
beautiful sexy border here um it has no
interior color yet so let me get that
stroke in here I'll grab this guy and
fill the interior okay then we have this
guy
okay and that's starting to look a
little bit like a flame I think it looks
kind of silly with the idea I had of it
what I'm going to do is kind of modify
it so I'll zoom out drag him over just
so I have a copy and I'll alt drag with
shift I'm going to delete this like that
and we have a couple of cool shapes here
we could actually do something
interesting I'm just going to group this
together and what that does is it's just
so i can drag it all is one chunk and
i'll hold alt down and drag boom and
i'll take the reflect tool and just kind
of drag with shift let's see what this
gives us oh this might look retarded
yeah this is gonna look really retarded
let me do the rotate tool so that's not
lined up like that um to get that right
no that's not right okay rotate boom now
move them down a little bit looks a
little crazy crazy man so you could be a
little creative with lines and stuff
that's what I like about illustrator you
can mess up so much and then fix it so
easily so what I'll do is I'll attach
some of these lines with my pen tool so
I'll go this guy here is just going to
touch their I won't worry about the
lines being flawless I think this guy
will overlap to hear
okay and so we need to make this shape a
little bit bigger so I'm going to go
into this group by double clicking and
you see how it's kind of isolated and
I'm going to select him and I'm going to
add some anchor points let's add one
here in here and with my white arrow
tool I will drag this guy drag that guy
like so and he needs a curve to be
honest I think I'm just going to do it a
little quick way I'll just draw a new
curve like that boom boom boom and let's
merge these two shapes together with the
Pathfinder and that's your best friend
the Pathfinder boom group them together
and move them back okay and over here
this guy is also going to need some some
goods i'll do the same pathfinder way I
don't want my line to overlap that
groups line that's one tricky thing
about working with groups is that the
entire group cannot be moved early below
other objects there so there's benefits
to groups and there's downsides I
suppose so there's a shape their group
those guys together send them to the
back where they belong then you can see
my shapes a little bit off let me adjust
that
looks like it's off right there voila
okay and since the shapes on top I
didn't really totally realize that let's
go into here add an anchor point I'll
just had to cuz you never know if you
need another one and whoop and okay and
let's see what we've got going on a
little bit of funny business going on
down here so let me go into this group
again with a black arrow a little bit of
funny business let me see that again
we couldn't move it over maybe then the
lines don't match up perfectly but I can
fix that this is really turned into kind
of a ghetto rigging if you ask me now
maybe looks kind of cool that way so now
group it again and now what we have is
it looks like one item if you double
click it now it's two separate items if
you double click it now we're in this
item so I'm not going to make it perfect
no big deal i'll try flipping this guy
over all flames it looks more like
leaves looks like an abstract kind of
logo really with me in Illustrator it's
kind of like it requires luck to come up
with something creative to be honest so
flames that's the worst font to go with
this so I hope this tutorial helped you
out in some way I just wanted to make
something today thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
