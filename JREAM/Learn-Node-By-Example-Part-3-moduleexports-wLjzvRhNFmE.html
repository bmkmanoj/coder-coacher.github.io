exports works so if i go to say index jf
or users j/s you can see that we're
requiring the router assigned to this
variable then I exports the router and
this is the routes for the index file
and the users file does the same thing
what we can do is just create our own we
just select all this stuff create a new
file paste save I'll save it as
dashboard jf and I'll say dashboard go
ahead and get rid of this guy and this
will say rendered dashboard and I'm not
going to worry about this stuff right
now i'll just put dashboard and
eventually this would be a place where
only users can log in and everything
under here it would pretty much be
prefixed with dashboard / you know like
profile or something but i'm not going
to do that part there right now and i
spelled this wrong dashboard ok so like
that and we're doing module that exports
router so whatever is defined in this
little file we can export everything to
find attached to this which is really
nice so and then when we require in
another file it just gets attached to a
different variable name so if i go to my
app JS file you see we're requiring the
route index and users so let's just go
ahead and do dashboard route stash board
we're not done yet though we'll have to
duplicate this line say whoops this will
be dashboard
and we can prefix it like this and go
back like that so now the slash
dashboard and everything under the
dashboard like / profile if I were to do
one here you know instead of doing
dashboard / profile you would just put
dashboard or sorry profile like that
okay so let me just add a view I'll just
copy this save this as dashboard dot J
and I don't even know if we're passing
anything I thought as a title okay and
then in the app folder will do npm start
ok and i'll try to go to dashboard and
you see that works perfectly fine and
that's basically what module exports
does even though this is saying export
router it's really like just taking all
the crap that's in here like this and
just whatever you define its chunking it
all in that variable and then we have
the ability well if i could get back to
the apt GS right here the ability to use
require and that requires the module
under a different name and then we can
do anything we want with it I mean if we
had something like router dot do this
equals function all right just like
return true how about console dot log
hey I actually don't know if this will
work I've never tried it this way with
the existing router because we're going
on expressive stuff but then you could
say you know this is under the users j/s
file you could say users dot do
they're right and it would act like a
regular function so it's basically like
it's if you're familiar PHP it's pretty
much like PHP include file name but
looks users it'd be kinda like that or
in Python it would be like import users
dot router right that's pretty much what
it's doing as much needed so that's a
short video for module exports I think
it's good to know i'll go ahead and
delete this crap and it does it's not
just for routes it can be used for
anywhere inside of note j s not just
expressed but no Jas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
