this story we're going to make a text
logo and let me just think of a name
real quick I'll just say Linda because
that's a real lovely name and all right
you all have the character Mira Mariette
bro if you have cs5 and I'm just going
to make mine not bold okay and I'll make
it a little bigger okay so now we have
this text to work with the first thing
I'll do is make a backup copy I do that
so that I don't forget the font and I
can always reuse it if I want I'll go to
object expand okay
now we have this all grouped together
hold a ctrl shift and press g to ungroup
it and you can probably right-click it
to do that so now we can work with each
one of these and I used a little white
arrow you can attach the bottoms of them
like so
oops that doesn't go all the way there
and you know create other squares to
attach them that doesn't look like it
matches so I'll put it down here and
stretch this little piece over to the D
okay and the D is kind of going over so
I'll just make a box here and then
subtract from it there we go and you
know you can really do whatever you like
with these things you can even warp the
text reshape it but let's make it a
little interesting let me just subtract
this from the N expand
and the N will now be somewhat part of
the I the L is a little too long in my
opinion and let's move this over and the
a I'll attach the a to the D I guess let
me break off this little arc here and
whoops
make sure you expand it where are we
there we go and I'm going to attach the
a from there to here so it's going to be
a pretty ugly logo but who really cares
and so that doesn't look very good at
all
this looks really bad all right
so that's good enough who cares and I'm
gonna select this whole object and I'm
just going to Union it and expand so now
this is one solid object and see it's
not like a logo if it was any good and
to make it a little cooler you might
want to add a silver gradient and I find
it looks kind of cool if like let's say
you have the it's a little darker at the
top and copy ctrl F and then shift
up arrow and do a copy ctrl F once again
then just hit down right down right and
then select both these layers and
subtract now shift down arrow back so
that you're on top of it and let's just
give this a white color okay and this
will look good because if we put this
background here you can see it pops off
a little bit there we go
and that's a little bit how I made the
dream logo I spent a little bit more
time on it
oh so that's were context good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
