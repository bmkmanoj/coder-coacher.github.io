do some css3 and play with selectors and
this is pretty cool stuff so I have a
document here and I'm including my
default CSS file which right now is just
blank little thing with a background
what we got to do is just create some
content so i'll create an h1 and just
call the css3 tutorial and i'll make a
paragraph and just say this is a ver F
and I like to eat cheese and make that a
couple lines and I'll do one more
paragraph okay next I'll make a list
i'll do a ul and in li just call this
item one oops i can go through here two
three four five and the last thing I'm
going to do is create a couple of form
items I'll do an input type equals
submit disabled equals disabled will do
two of these one disabled deals are not
disabled and also do one for input type
equals text and all copy paste that
and refreshing here is what we have so
we're going to play with some css3 now
the first thing we're going to do is
some pseudo classes and you've done
these before probably if you've ever
done this a link a visited or maybe it's
a view I just get that messed up
actually so these are pseudo classes
with this colon and what we're going to
do is first a list item let me make an
empty one I'll do Li and I'll add an
empty one there what we can do is say Li
empty and I'll say border bottom one
pixel solid green refresh I'll just do a
regular border and we can select based
on something that's empty we could also
add content and say hey man I guess we
can't do that there let's see we can do
enabled let's say input enabled border 3
pixels solid red I'm just doing border
so you can see where i am and you see we
now select these enable forms and input
disabled and we'll do a border through
pixel solid grey refresh and you can
separate your things like that here's
one that's pretty cool you can do L i
en't child okay and and what this means
is like the n is supposed to be a value
and we put the value in here so I said
for and I set font weight Boulder
refresh it takes the fourth item on the
list and makes a boulder one two three
four this empty one counted four slot 3
oh let's see okay we can do it we can do
it the other way to we can do Li and
last child and I'll say one and i'll say
font style flips it he'll it and refresh
and item 5 is at allit because this
basically does the same thing as entha
child but it does it in reverse order I
did three we should be able to hit item
for there we go so that's pretty cool
there's quite a few of these to play
around with another one could be what if
we wanted to select the input fields
that are enabled but not the submit
buttons we can actually chain this
together with more things so i could say
not okay and then our thing goes inside
not you could type a class in here but
i'm going to do something that gets an
attribute and you do an attribute in
these square brackets so i'll say type
equals submit and refresh and you see it
selects the input fields that are
enabled but that are not submit button
and you could do that vice versa text no
okay so let's play with some pseudo
types are sorry soooo selector types
I'll say input and then we're going in
the square remember it's an attribute
you could do rel equals something but
we're going to do type starts with sub
and I'll say
font weight is bolder refresh and you
see how these both got bold if you know
anything about regular expressions in
expression starts with the carrot and it
ends with a dollar sign okay if I go
down here and see how we're getting the
type and it starts with sub okay you can
also do ends with so we want to do let's
say ends with mitt I can do the dollar
sign type dollar MIT and we still have
the same thing there because submit and
we could also chain these together and
say disabled works disabled and refresh
and it only bolds the disabled on I'll
just make this background purple just so
we can see it better there we go and
lastly to wrap this up we'll play with
some pseudo elements and this has two
colons on it and we'll do first letter
of a paragraph i will say font size
equals 25 pixels refresh let's do 35 and
see these paragraphs that's kind of cool
we could do first line p first line and
we could do letter spacing is 10 pixels
that's kind of big and you see how the
space is all letters and here's what's
cool if you stretch the window anything
that falls on that line will also change
with whatever size your browser's at we
can add content as well this doesn't
just have to be in these elements i'm
just showing you a quick example so if
we have a p we can add content before it
and say hey how's life refresh and says
hey how's life p after
content I'm at the end and here it is
i'm at the end so these are some suede o
stuff and CSS the selectors and they're
really useful there's a lot of them
there's enabled disabled checked
selection only child empty route you
know you should look for a css3 cheat
sheet to find all these there's also
selector types which are symbols like
this for all so I could say all um font
weight boulder and that makes every
element on the page bold you know
obviously there's grouping you know pli
with a little comma there is a the
little bracket so i could say body each
one let's do color green refresh and
this is a oh what's it called just a
child directly below that on the
documentary anyways play around with
these and they're good to know not only
for CSS but they actually use these in
jquery and prototype so they're good
selectors good thing to know alright
