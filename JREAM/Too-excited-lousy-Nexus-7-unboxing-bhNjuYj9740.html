nexus for Christmas from my wife and I
know it's a little early but I couldn't
wait and it's box very nice it's pretty
heavy this is the 16 gigabyte one made
by asus and what i'm going to do is
unbox this beauty and where do I start I
guess I just slide it out now the reason
I went with the Google tablet is because
Android is my favorite operating system
for the phone and tablet and my wife has
a 10 inch tablet so let's say I cut this
little piece of tape here
and I must have opened it upside down
yes I did so I was supposed to pull that
off so really what it looks like it oh
that looks pretty this has Nexus and
silver it's a nice seven incher here's
the beauty you pull it out that's a nice
looking piece of machinery and I'll just
go ahead and pull the covers off gently
what we have the back is kind of a
grippy feeling it feels really nice just
to hold in your hand and the front we'll
explore that in a moment so I'm going to
see if it has a charge does it come with
a battery charge so I'll hold the button
down here yes it does Google well that's
going let's see what else we got in this
little packet little box here what's
inside well I call it packaged it it's
really nice a little manual and probably
just our power cords the USB and
something down in here looks like an
adapter for the USC so one would take
this and to plug it either into USB or
into the wall it looks like a little
adapter so I'll clean up this mess later
so this is a 7-inch it has a really nice
weight the thickness feels really good
if you look at the thickness it's pretty
nice I was comparing this to the 7-inch
galaxy s sorry the galaxy tab 2 7 inch
and I just feel good about this one so
I'll connect to my Wi-Fi Josh what's the
password nice to know my password
because I won't be able to get on
so this is jellybean 4.2 I don't want to
set this up right now not now googling
location Wi-Fi location and i'll put in
my name this tablet feels really nice it
was two hundred dollars this has a
quad-core processor and i don't know a
whole lot house it was really smoke so
here's all my current apps wow i'm going
to have fun with this it's very nice so
I'll go to my widgets drop a clock on
here go back home
I don't know where my clock one I guess
I couldn't drop it there um how about
here no room here there we go that's a
weird-looking clock and let's try the
camera sorry i haven't used to the new
jelly bean and this is really cool i
like how it feels it's really nice size
i'll compare this to my galaxy s3
actually that's in your hand okay so
yeah i'll play around with it and I feel
like it's a very good bang for your buck
