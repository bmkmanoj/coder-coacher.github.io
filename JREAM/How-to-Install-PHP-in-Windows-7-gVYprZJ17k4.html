in this tutorial I'm going to show you
how to install PHP on your hard drive
and what you need is something called
Apache which is a web server and that
can run all your other stuff like PHP
from it or MySQL the easiest way to do
that is to get an all-in-one program
like if you're using Windows I would get
WAMP server and you can go to lamp
server comm to get this and you would
just download the latest release or just
download one from here there's also one
called xampp XA MPP and you can use this
for Linux Windows Mac and solar switch I
know nothing about so go ahead and grab
one of those packages it might be about
15 to 20 megabytes in size and remember
where you install it like the directory
you might install it under C Drive
Program Files slash WAMP
I put mine in C Drive mm-hmm
lamp right here just so I know where it
is and after you install it you'll have
this little icon in your task or you can
click that you got a left click it and
you'll see all this stuff here and at
the top is a link to localhost and that
will take you to your webserver so and
then PHP myadmin this will take you to
your database and it looks something
like this except yours will be empty you
don't really need to monkey with this
unless you get into like MySQL or if
you're going to install WordPress on
your hard drive so really don't worry
about that back to this Apache is the
service that's running to keep your
webserver up on your hard drive so you
can shut off Apache and you can
configure it in different ways with the
HTTP D config file but I won't really
worry about that you have your pH
file settings here and you can open PHP
dot ini if you want for the most part
you don't need to do any of this and you
could just go to localhost and where
these files are they will be in your
WAMP install directory and in the WWF I
configured my apache a little different
so that it loads my workspace directory
so I can just keep track of things a
little easier but I won't go into
configuring apache so in your working
directory what you would do is you would
just right-click and say new text
document and I'll just call mine 6 stop
PHP ok and I have mine to open up with
notepad plus plus it's a free program
for Windows and I'd recommend getting
this rather than using let's say notepad
just a regular one you can use
Dreamweaver notepad plus plus Eclipse
really any text editor but don't use
Microsoft Word and don't use a Microsoft
WordPad because those are rich text
editors you just want a regular text
editor what's nice about this notepad
plus plus is the syntax highlighting ok
see how nice that looks and you can tell
if you're making an error just based on
the colors and what I would do is go to
settings style configurator and pick a
color thing that you like I prefer it
dark because if you're looking at the
screen for a long time your eyes might
hurt and then you can just save your
file and refresh your localhost remember
I saved that one a six dot PHP and I'll
click that and it says one and let's do
a hello world echo hello world and
refresh and there we have it now you
won't be in C Drive workspace remember
you'll be in lamp
ww
or if you did XA MPP you'd be in
probably a WWE and one thing that you
should realize is that the let's say you
go here and you wanted a page to load on
your localhost like it's your main page
what you would call that is index.php so
I'll make a new text document and say
index dot PHP and just do the little PHP
tags whoops and say echo all those echo
some numbers K and I'll refresh this and
it loads the index dot PHP
that's because index is the default main
page however I like to work in little
directories and see my file lists so I
just remove the dot pete the index file
alright I think that's it ah
good luck and have fun programming in
PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
