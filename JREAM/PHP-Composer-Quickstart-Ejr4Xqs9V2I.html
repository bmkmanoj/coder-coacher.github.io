about composer a PHP dependency manager
and this has been needed for a while
I haven't personally got into the thick
of it but I know at some point it's just
ridiculously good idea Python has
something called pip for Python package
management and PHP really really needs
this so to get started what you just
want to do is go to the download to get
it on your computer and if you have a
console with curl enabled you can just
download it like this
I'm using Windows so I just go to the
windows installer and get composer setup
and I previously installed this but I'll
go through anyways again it's very
simple to install and it just locates
your PHP executable since I'm using WAMP
it found that if you're using xx a.m. P
or whatever it's called don't do that
and it says yeah there it is it's
downloading the far file and you might
get this error that says the OpenSSL
extension is missing and that's an easy
fix
now the first thing you might think is I
have to recompile PHP well if you
downloaded WAMP you don't have to I
don't think you do with xampp either so
finish install and finish and first
thing is if I open up my WAMP toolbar
and I go to PHP ini
and I look for SSL and comment the
uncomment the semicolon and save it it's
not going to work because lamp
unfortunately uses a different PHP I and
I that you open from here than it does
in the console and it's kind of a pain
in the butt so I'm going to my lamp
directory C Drive lamp I'm going to go
to bin which is binary I'm going to go
to PHP
and then PHP five four three and then
I'll go down to PHP ini and in here I'll
look for SSL and you see how the other
one was uncommented but this one wasn't
because this applies to the console now
that's not true in a linux environment
you just have one PHP ini unless you're
doing something crazy with a bunch of
virtual hosts that allow their own ini
files and I'll just restart WAMP okay so
what I'm going to do is open up a
console I'll just open up a git bash
it's my favorite because it's really
sweet and simple now if you had a
console open previously you're going to
want to close it so that it can rear
edge astir Composer solve this type
composer and if you get a list of
commands you're ready to go so it's very
simple right there so what we're going
to do is actually install a couple
packages just to test it out so they're
stored at packages org ok if I go to the
main site they show you how to define
your dependencies and this is why it's
good if you're building an application
and you have a framework with some other
third party software or you don't have
to reinvent the wheel
you can simply define the version you
want to use and when you deploy it on
your server it's always going to use the
correct version so you don't have to
worry about breaking changes and things
if you already have everything working
that's why it's really useful so with
that said I'm going to go to just C
drive workspace and I'm going to make a
directory called
my app okay and this is just for pretend
and I'll CD into my app and there's
nothing in here and the way we do this
is it's in JSON code so I'll say touch
composer dot JSON okay and you could
type notepad to open notepad for
composer dot JSON like this well I guess
it's not in my shell but I have sublime
shortcut it in here so I'll just do sub
blah and here it is here so what I'll do
is I'll just copy this stuff and paste
it in here and we can actually get rid
of all this okay and remember this is
just JSON formatted it's telling you
what to require and this is just one of
the simple things you can do so let's
start with a couple things let's say I
want to install XP SPL to some PHP
signal library and there's a whole bunch
of stuff here that looks confusing what
I would suggest is scrolling down to a
stable version so I'll do 4.01 and right
here it says require and it gives us the
code right here so I'll copy this and
I'll paste it in there and do a comma
because I'm going to add something else
and let's try G data for Zenergy data
now this can get big but though we'll
try it anyways
and you see there's a dev master the
reason I don't want to do dev masters
because it could be changing so I'm
going to pick a version that's already
stable and not going to change so I'll
copy this and I'll paste it in here okay
so this should get two items and let's
go ahead and run it so here's my file
I'll just ctrl C to cancel out and list
all I have to do is say composer install
and since I have a composer JSON file
it's just going to do whatever is in
there so let's take a moment and watch
it do its magic
so let's say you had to pass a project
along to somebody it'd be great just
fantastic to be able to install the
exact same packages without digging
around downloading a bunch of things I
know you have get but this is a very
nice we use this for Python and it's
really a lifesaver okay so it's done
there I'll list the file directories out
and I'm just going to type Explorer
period
I guess this get console doesn't like me
very much
I'll just open Windows Explorer
workspace and we made one called my app
and we just have some our composer files
and all that so inside of vendors where
it put the code
okay so we have programmer which is the
XP SPL library all this stuff I go back
and I go to Zen I have G data boom it's
all there ridiculously easy to use and
this autoload guy right here let me open
this up this is generated by composer
and this in my opinion when I first saw
it it looks a little crazy like what is
this it looks like a I don't know a
sha-1 182 183 in length not exactly sure
what it is
besides that this is just something you
leave there so that's how you could get
started with composer and inside your my
app you could just make a new file and
playground PHP and you can require any
of these vendors that are needed they
pass it along to a friend you say just
run composer install and it will install
whatever's in here and you're good to go
hope that helps guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
