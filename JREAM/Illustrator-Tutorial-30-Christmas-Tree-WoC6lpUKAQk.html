gonna make a Christmas tree so just make
a square not too big and then select
your pen tool and do delete Anchor Point
and we're gonna delete the top left one
so that it's like a triangle like this
and now is where the magic happens
select this item and go to object
transform and transform each and we get
a box like this I'm just gonna make sure
all these values are on there default
and what we're gonna do is transform
this so we're gonna move it down let's
say 1-inch vertically and that's a
little too high let's see what point 1
and this will be the distance between
our bristles on the tree I think I'm
going to go with 0.1 and you can just
click preview to see the difference it's
going to make and you can select a point
here it's probably in the middle I'm
just going to select the right side and
that'll keep it positioned according to
the right and let's see preview that and
we want to make it grow a little bit so
horizontally I guess I'll make a girl
with 10% each iteration as you can see
and just click the copy button make sure
don't click OK click copy and before you
do anything else we're gonna duplicate
what we just did and that would be on
their object transform and transform
again or ctrl + D and just press that a
couple of times until it looks like a
decent tree now that one's a little big
so I'm going to delete a few of them ok
so we had this now if you have your
stroke lines getting bigger you can
always change that in your settings of
ctrl K and it's under general and it's
right here scale strokes and effects I
for to have mine on and then just select
all this if your strokes are uneven I'll
just do one and what I'm going to do
with this is I'm going to open my
Pathfinder and merge all the objects so
I'm gonna go to window Pathfinder and
all these are selected I'm just going to
click this one I think it's Union or
merge ok and we have a nice little half
of a tree here
it curves a little far out for my liking
and that's going to be really wide so I
think I'm gonna slim it up like that ok
and a tree is obviously green and I'm
going to get rid of this line here
before I mirror it over what I'm gonna
do is create a duplicate of this object
by holding alt and it's just going to
look like a lighter layer over top of it
and let's see if I can move that in a
little bit like that I think I'll do
that one more time and a little bit
lighter and I'll just drag it to the tip
ok and maybe a little further out ok now
I'm going to select all these and press
ctrl G to group them and let's press o
to get the reflect tool and you can just
click like the top Anchor Point and then
hold alt and shift and flip it around ok
now it looks like there's a little gap
between here that's really not a big
deal
if you want you could make it perfect
and snap it up there it looks like
there's a little bit of a color overlay
on this object so I guess I'll move that
manually and the line up here is not
perfect so actually these are all a
little bit off whoops
need the white arrow
and I'm not gonna worry about making a
perfect and then let's make a stump and
that's just a square not very hard and
say Brown control shift and you left
bracket to send it to the back and
probably pop on a gradient on this just
a little delicate one whoops okay and
then maybe a star at the top when and
I'll send that to the front and I think
this look good with a little stroke
around it and make it the same color
yeah I don't know how good that looks
move it down a little bit I'm not sure
how a star looks on a tree exactly and
you know you could obviously decorate
this kind of plane but the point of this
tutorial was to show you the object
transform and transform each and I hope
this tutorial helped I'm not going to
put this up on the downloads because
it's just really stupid alright thanks
