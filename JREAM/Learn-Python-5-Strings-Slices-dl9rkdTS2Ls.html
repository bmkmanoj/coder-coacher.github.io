we're going to look a little more on
strings in Python and you know that
we've done this before let's say name
equals John and last equal Smith we've
done aware would say print name plus
last and we've done print name plus with
these little quotes to go to space last
now you can go print name comma last and
this is a function of the thing of the
print feature which puts a little space
in here for you automatically so you
could say print hello sir and do comma
John or sorry name and last hello sir
john smith also you can i just get the
little portions of strings and this is
usually called a substring or slicing
and in other languages it's a little
more complex where you have to cast a
function onto the string for example
this isn't Python you'd say like a
string string name and you'd select the
position to start and a position to end
at and that would give us something like
Jo ok in Python you everything's a much
easier you'd say name and you put in
these little square brackets here and
this means this variable right here we
want to select a portion of its value so
if I said name too they'll give me H now
that might look confusing because H
appears to be the third character
doesn't it 1 2 3 now you have to
remember and this is true with a lot of
programs that things start with a0 so
it's really 012 and that'll be true of
Lists that will get into later so you
could say
if we wanted to select the first three
letters we'd say name 0 to 3 so 0 is
where we start colon and three is where
we end and we get j 0 h and try to think
of that again 3 is where it stops it
doesn't take the third parameter so it's
going to say 0 for j 1 and 2 and stop at
the third one and the third one is n
okay so we wanted to get all of that
would say name 04 you can also do
negative let's say we had a directory
listing let's just make one called dirt
equal C Drive programs files and let's
say for some reason we wanted to find
out if they had this last / at the end
of the file you could say dur- one and
when you do a negative rather than
starting here at zero and going forward
it'll start on the right and it'll go
negative 1 negative 2 you can't do
negative 0 because 0 is 0 so that could
be useful if let's say you had to put a
file on the end of the string like what
if we had something called file equals
file dot jpg and if I said there plus
file if we didn't have this backslash
then it looked like files file dot jpg
and the reason you do that is maybe to
validate something like that that's just
a really simple example and sorry let me
move this window up there we go now you
might be asking why are you talking
about these things that don't seem to
make much of a difference the reason is
because these little square brackets
you're actually going to use these a lot
especially in lists and a list is much
like an array so try to give
familiar with how this works in the
number placement just remember it always
starts on zero and it goes left to right
but if it's negative it goes right to
left so alright guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
