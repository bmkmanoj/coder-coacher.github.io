tutorial we're going to do type hinting
and basically type hinting kind of
forces someone to use certain parameters
and if you look at this test class we
just have a basic construct it doesn't
really do anything
so I'm going to create a function in
here just say public function right and
I'll say oops echo um I'm writing from
test okay now if we go down to foo it
has a construct as well but we're
enforcing the test object to be
constructed with it or passed in to this
parameter now when you look at this it
might look a little confusing because it
says test a so it looks like a stands
alone but a is actually this entire
instance of the tests that we're going
to create and the a is what represents
it so I'd say something like this um
this um nuage
a okay and with this right here we have
access to everything inside of test as
long as it is public I'm not sure about
protected because I don't think this
actually extends it or inherits it so to
build this you'd say no foo new test and
I'll refresh that okay no errors now
let's call something from the test
object I'd say this nuage right and
refresh and now we're writing from the
test object the reason I bring this up
is because you'll see this in design
pattern sometimes and let's try a
protected just to make sure
see okay it cannot be that way they have
to be public okay so this is a pretty
short easy tutorial you might want to
play around with it and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
