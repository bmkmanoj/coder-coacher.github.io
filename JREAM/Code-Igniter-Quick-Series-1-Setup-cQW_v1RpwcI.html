codeigniter
and to get started with these tutorials
go to github.com slash dream and just
look for CI tutorial and for this series
or this episode you'll want to download
from this drop down menu and the tags
and version 1 start ok and it has all
these files here you could just download
the zip file if you want and we had this
and basically I just dropped all this
stuff into my local host and I called
mine CI tutorial and this is how it
looks so you'll have all these files
depending on where you are in your
directory path you might have to change
your HT access so you see mines and CI -
tutorial changers - whatever you name
your folder ok and in my application
config the config file I just changed my
index page to have nothing because I'm
using my to rewrite and if I close it
open up the page I have my welcome page
and this is where we'll get started
we're gonna try to do it kind of quick
and easy so these are shorter tutorials
and it doesn't waste a lot of your time
so I'm gonna open that bean since it's
coated know there's a larger system I
like to work in a IDE so I'll create a
new project PHP PHP with existing source
and I'll go to my CodeIgniter folder the
CI tutorial and I'm gonna use 5.4 you
don't have to but I prefer to and here
we have it so the first thing we want to
do is know that all of our work goes in
the application folder we never mess
with the system folder and it's pretty
straightforward what we're going to be
using to config to configure things and
a couple of these which we'll go through
over time it'll be easier to follow as
you go so the first thing we'll do is
create a database open the database
config file and I'm gonna go down here
I already put in my databases CI
tutorial and my username is root with no
password now if you're using PHP myadmin
or heidi SQL
I prefer heidi SQL you can just connect
to your localhost and I created a
database for this and you should too and
what I'm going to do is right click this
and create a new table I'm gonna call
this user and I'll say user ID along
null auto-increment
and make him a primary key okay I'll
have an email of a var character a
password of of our character 64 long and
a date to add it don't worry if I'm
going too fast because I'll export this
for you okay okay and okay so now we
have something to work with and I'll
just export database export make sure I
got the right one and what I like to do
is just keep a schema file in my
directory so I'll just call this schema
SQL and this will be the dump of stuff
okay so what we're going to do is just
quickly make a controller so we have our
welcome controller I'll just copy and
then paste in the folder I'll call this
index I'll change the class to index get
rid of all this junk and the reason I'm
doing this quickly is to make sure we
have everything working correctly so if
I go here and I go to slash index it's
not loading it correctly so I have my
mod rewrite incorrectly configured let
me open up htaccess slash the eye
tutorial
and if I go to my config config baseurl
index page there is naval query strings
and all this crap looks like it's not in
there that's strange behavior so I could
do index dot PHP question C equals index
that's bizarre well maybe it's because I
have the name of the controller being
indexed it could be the problem so I'll
call it home I'll try going to slash
home okay let me rename the file home
refresh there we go and that's a quick
start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
