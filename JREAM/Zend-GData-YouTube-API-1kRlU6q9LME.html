I'm going to show you how to use these n
frameworks of gene data YouTube
objects in order to connect to the
YouTube API and fetch some videos and
this will just be a good little practice
run the first thing we need to do is get
send framework you could just get these
ng data downloads I've already
downloaded
Zenji data right here does it file so if
I open my little thing up here downloads
I haves ng data right here and I want
the library and I want this big Zen
folder so in my project folder I'll go
to the folder market and I've popped it
in here so it's right there if I go back
one thing I did do extract is actually
download the entire Zend framework you
could download this if you want but it
has so many files I didn't want to
download the whole thing all I got out
of here is the molder folder right there
because this has the auto loader in it
which will take care of all the
dependencies for me
so I just popped it into the folder
there so to get started what we're gonna
do is use the auto loader because these
Zen Framework files have a lot of
dependencies so if I go into hero C's
end loader auto loader and what's his
end user underscore for each directory
that's how they organized it so I would
say require I'll record the file and
then
send folder autoloader and get instance
and to include it it's just you replace
the underscores and slashes like a soap
and to make sure we didn't make a typo
I'll just refresh the page looks good
and now it's time to use the YouTube API
I'll just say YT equals new is end
Google data you too and you can find
that also in the G data G's for Google
and then down here is YouTube I will
mention that this is the main class and
then it has a ton of other classes here
to get stuff with what we're going to do
is a simple search so I'll make a
comment say query YouTube YT is for
YouTube I don't feel like typing it out
all the time so I'll say Q equals
YouTube video we're okay so we're going
to start the video query and with the
query I'll say set query what do we want
to look for this is a string I'll say
dogs is it just like typing in the
youtube search I'll say Q set
I think we'll just try that so I'll say
YouTube get video feed of the query okay
and I'm going to print our of this guy
I'll call this the feed so very simple
basically what we're doing is we're
starting up a new video query with the
cue variable or setting the query we
want just the string there and then
we're getting the video feed there and
hopefully this gives us something if not
it's not a big deal it looks like we
have a bunch of stuff bunch of
namespaces I'll go down some more I'm
gonna go down quite a ways
looks like we're getting something so
what we can do is actually loop through
this I've already gone through it and
done it so I'll just type it out what
I'm gonna do is start with an array so
I'll say output equals all right
and for each feed as key value and we'll
say I'll put key so each listing and the
video ID equals value get video ID this
is basically like going through this
object that Zen framework created each
one of these and conveniently fetching
the only things we want so duplicate
that line would also want the title this
one's a little bit different you got a
media group title and I'm going to cast
this to a string because I've had
problems with that and then a
description I'll just call this one desk
and media group description okay so
we're building an output array so that
it's all clean this is our actual data
to use and I want to print our of output
okay so I'll refresh call to media
YouTube extension Media Group title so
Media Group title this is not a function
it's just the actual literal thing
refresh and here we have skateboarding
dog amazing dog birth with a video ID
okay what else we'll how about the
thumbnail so I'll duplicate this line
I'll call this thumbnail I prefer this
to be all lower case video ID thumbnail
media group thumbnail let me see what
that gets us okay this is too big so in
the thumbnail I have to get the URL this
is what I want right here
so if I copy this
there's the thumbnail so I want a zero
you are at all zero you are refresh ooh
there it is cool so we can also adjust
our query parameters to say Q let's say
we want to set the start index if you
have multiple pages we'll start at one
we could also do set max results I'm not
certain but I believe the max is 50 so
there's 1 to 20 I'll refresh all right
I'll try 20 to 40 and cool see it has
different videos go back to 1 to 20 here
there's also one you can do called set
time just like the psyche you set time
and this week arts this is under so it's
like that um there's a ton of parameters
to mess with and get all crazy with so
with this what we could do for fun is
let's say I say if is that get cute
obviously I'd implement this in a much
cleaner way and I'll show you in a
moment
so if is set get Q I'll say query string
equals get Q okay else
query string equals dogs so inside of
here we can pass in very stern
so now I can pass the custom clear so go
ahead and refresh that guy
okay now I'll try q equals fish look at
that will get fish I'd probably do a
post parameter because it query with the
spaces I think it's what percent twenty
and percent twenty chips something like
to have their fish and chips not sure
what happened to do fish and chips maybe
it does automatically for us so there's
that one thing we could do is instead of
outputting it like that I could say echo
I don't even have to make this an array
if I don't want it so I could delete
that and I'll just call this guy
thumbnail video ID title
so I want to echo image' SRC equals
thumbnail I would obviously I probably
do this in a model view controller so
echo the thumbnail you don't have to put
these little squigglies around here the
reason to do this and I do it a lot is
because if this were on a Ray I could
actually put like an associative array
in there like that because you know
without the brackets those quotes would
actually break it that's why I do that
I don't always do it but who knows so
the title description
oh hey chopper so refresh that guy and
look at those big thumbnails
yikes you just put him at the top make
him a h1 or h2 llama throw a paragraph
tag around him and for the thumbnail
I'll just say height equals 150 refresh
and here's a bunch of YouTube videos
like that if you'd like to get the
playlist URL we actually have to loop
through the media group content so I'll
say for each value Media Group content
as C and I'm looking for a flash URL
flash URL equals C
okay so then I'll do if the content type
equals application X shockwave flash
we found our flash URL and I will break
the fort so I'll just echo an anchor
link but you can embed this code so I'll
say a href equals flash URL /url eager
refresh let's see what happens
undefined variable content so media
group content okay and if we click this
takes us to the playlist and you could
use that little JavaScript player for
that so I have a working example for you
I built called cliff lemon calm so I'll
just search for pigs and I'll click this
guy place him in a modal you can view up
a shoe I have some local changes that I
did also horses what I did also is I
made a cache it's not caching on the
server
I just cache some stuff so I don't have
to keep sending to their server
hopefully this has been a decent
introduction and hope you guys have fun
with it thanks a lot for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
