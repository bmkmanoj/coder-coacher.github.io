this tutorial we're going to look at the
inner join and possibly a few types of
joins and you might say well why do I
want to join anything and what does that
mean this is what a joint
okay we have a table here called posts
and a table here called users if I do a
query and select from post let's just go
ahead and do that select star from posts
and execute okay I get the assign user
which is a foreign key and we've gone
over this the foreign key represents a
primary key inside of user so assign
user one would represent the admin and
anything that would be to the right of
this and the reason to join is because
let's say we retrieve this content and
in a programming language if we're going
to display this let's say on a website
you might also say select all from users
and then you'd compare if assign user
equals one you know grab the data from
the other query and that's going to
waste a lot of processing power and it's
a bad idea
so what we're going to do is we're going
to grab the user name and add it onto
the edge of the field okay and to do
that we're first going to do an inner
join I'm gonna break down this query so
let me tab that over and I'll have this
over as well and what we do is inner
join okay and then we tell the table
name let's call it users because that's
the table right here and then we do on
and the little parentheses okay so we're
going to join the users on what
condition on the condition that posts
dot assign user equal users ID now that
might look a little confusing right off
the bat I'm going to slow down and
explain it from the post field right
here where it says assign user
were we're going to join the the user
records on to the end of these post
fields where the condition is that the
assign user equals the user ID okay so
let's go ahead and hit play or execute
and you see we get the names on the end
the problem is you usually can't have
duplicate IDs column names so what
you're going to want to do is maybe
something like this select posts dot all
the asterisks for all and select users
dot name and make sure you do not put a
comma after the last select thing this
will probably trip you up a lot if you
have a comma here you're going to get an
error okay that's that's one that'll
trip you up so be ready for it
so I'm going to execute and now we have
a beautiful one query that gives us the
name according to the assigned user and
everything's organized in different
tables beautiful and I have a record
inside of posts okay I made one I called
it new the ID doesn't matter but the
assign user I set them to three and you
might say why'd you do that
because I want to show you the
difference between some joints and if we
go to users there is no idea three okay
and you'll notice with the query we just
did we don't see the assign user three
here because inner join only adds on
things that match it okay and if you
wanted to do a join where you wanted
empty columns to appear to don't match
the condition you would use here's one
left outer join and let's execute this
and if you go down here you'll get the
new one with the assigned user of three
but the name doesn't match however it
still grabbed it anyway so you can use
left outer join two
the grab all the items from the post
table okay let me try to break this down
for you
when we say left what does that really
mean
okay what's the first table we're
selecting posts
okay so posts would be on the left and
the table we're adding on is users so
this would be on the right okay so in
your left hand you have posts in your
right hand you have users and we're
going to join users based on the left
where it meets these conditions so that
it it'll grab all the post records and
it will join the users where it meets
these conditions now if you did right
outer join and execute this you see we
don't get that one record that was kind
of funny why is that that's because now
we're putting the right one is the
dominant table to say you know join all
these based on yadda yadda yadda and
then grab the left tables afterwards I
think that's it oh boy this is probably
sounding really confusing basically you
should just for the most part I always
use left outer join and inner join okay
sorry if my words are a little fumbled
it's difficult to explain and work
through my brain at the same time so
inner join execute looks good for the
most part you'll probably want to use
inner joins or left outer joins and I'm
sorry if my words or terms are a little
inaccurate I hope this was easy to
follow if it's not I'll try to do a
little better next time
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
