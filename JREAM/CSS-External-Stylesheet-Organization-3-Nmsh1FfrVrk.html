and you're probably doing good if you're
this far this fast in this tutorial
we're going to cover the external style
sheet and organization because you'll
quickly notice that this is a lot of
junk to put in a page and you'll also
realize let's say we had a second page
I'll just copy all this paste and I'll
save this as uh page 2.html and if this
was a different page you see we're going
to have to page 2.html other page this
page we have to include all this style
stuff so we wanted to change the
background let's say to read and we
wanted to change that on every page we'd
have to change that in every single a
little page and with most websites you
want to lay out that's very consistent
so what we're going to do is we're going
to copy or cut rather all of this stuff
create a new file and save it as a CSS
file now you can call it whatever you
want most people just call their style
or main i like to call mine default so
that's what I'll call mine it doesn't
really matter it's up to you so back in
our index file within the head which is
where I should have had the original CSS
will do link relationship or rel equals
style sheet and then hrf equals the name
of the style and mine was default dot
CSS
and that's a self closing tag and there
it is it's working and I'm just going to
delete page two so we have all our code
looking pretty and all this gets applied
from an external style sheet like you
can also do something called import and
one reason you want probably the import
is to import a reset file and if I could
quickly explain that what that means is
i'm using google chrome right here but
there's firefox and a couple other
browsers and they have a default setting
where the padding on objects and
everything has a default value and they
differ so your site will look different
in different browsers so using a little
reset file will make sure all the
browsers are consistent so let's do the
at sign import reset dot CSS now this
isn't something you need to concern
yourself with too much but i would
suggest just using it in most your files
or you could just paste it above the
body code because you want the reset to
happen first okay now obviously we have
to create a reset file and i'm just
going to include the yahoo reset file
just look for on google yahoo reset CSS
and once you get there if you want the
actual link you can pause the video and
type in this link and i'm just going to
create my new reset file and paste that
into here and save it as reset dot CSS
you don't need to worry about what this
looks like what it really does i guess
just be happy that it's there and leave
it alone and it's good to go so now we
have our reset installed and you can see
it took away a little margin if you
watch closely now these colors are
driving me nuts so I want to show you a
little tool that I use a lot and there's
probably a lot of these this is called
color picker calm and in the last
tutorial tutorial i talked about
hexadecimals and that's what these are
up here and you can get really uh
perfect colors I really like this color
so I'm going to copy this open up my
thing here and for the background you
don't want to forget to put the pound
sign see I'm not putting it well I guess
it works that time sometimes it doesn't
I don't know why that happened but I
always don't forget this pound sign if
you're using hexadecimals now since I
got some time left i'll cover a couple
of other things about style sheets now
the first one i showed you was the
embedded style when it's in the head for
the most part that's not recommended
this right here is the external this is
the way you should do it all the time
there's almost no reason not to and
there's another way which is called in
line this is generally a bad idea and
I'll show you why you can do style
equals then you type in your CSS here
let's say color red and we refresh this
the inline style is overriding the
object or the ids definition see the ID
of header says the color should be white
but the style class is overriding it so
when you're further along in your
project and you want to change something
and it's not working you might really
bump your head against the wall trying
to figure out what you did
and the best way to fix that is to avoid
inline styles whenever possible it
actually be better just to add a class
equal something you'd have to define
that class of course alright I think
that covers it for style sheet and
organization thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
