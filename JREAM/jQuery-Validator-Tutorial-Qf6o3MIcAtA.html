going to look at the jquery plugin for
validation and this is at the be
assistance de site and it's been around
for quite a while so go ahead and
download it and i'm going to load up the
documentation page and here I have it
just plugged into a site template and if
I open up my folder open up my index
file I have that open at the top so I've
just included jquery and then the jquery
validate there's also another one called
additional methods that you can use if
you look at the non meta fide version it
has ranges zip codes and a couple other
validation methods what i have down here
is a form and it's similar to the one on
the example page of the jquery validator
and that would be on this page if you
scroll down and just go to the view
source and it's similar to this form
here but we're going to do with kind of
our own way in a cleaner way so you give
your form an ID so that we can grab it
and we have a label for each input so a
label for name and that represents name
equals name age equals age so the name
field attaches to the label the ID is so
that the actual validator can grab it
based on the ID because that's how it
does it so to get started what we're
going to do is say my form
not validate whoops now in the demo
you'll see that you can add classes such
as this I could say class equals
required and I'll go ahead and refresh
that guy refresh Submit and it says that
is required okay however I'm not going
to do it this way because I think it's
kind of a messy way to do it I'd rather
do it all in here so what we do is we
throw in an object and would create a
section for rules another object and
then we use the ID names of the fields
so if I scroll down I have name age
email URL and to agree boxes so I'll say
name age email URL agree one
and agreed to and you don't want to
forget your little commas after these
guys
boom-boom-boom-boom
okay so instead we could say required is
true and in this branch of rules you see
this line we're adding rules for each
one of these and I want to make all of
these required so just let's test that
out and I'll just hit submit and says
this field is required it's all required
and you can check that off it'll
disappear test submit and it goes away
okay so for a name we can do stuff like
mid length of two and max length of ten
and try not to forget your commas I do
that sometimes and get confused so I'll
put te so the min length is two that
passes let's just try one please enter
at least two characters cool now there
are html5 validators but I don't know if
you should use that yet I don't know how
well that works with ie or upper and
Safari I'm not too up-to-date on those
so for let's say age we could say number
is true for email we can validate
against email just say email is true so
I'll go ahead and refresh and test test
test test submit and something went
wrong it looks like I missed a comma
so something goes wrong just try it and
forget your commas I'll try that once
more
test test test test submit and enter a
valid email test a test calm submit the
valid number twenty two four and those
are some generic rules so what we're
going to do is work on the messages now
I'll show you the message section will
do comma messages and just like the
rules we create another object and for
each message rule we can add our own so
for name and create another object and
for required I'll say
don't forget your form in length
men like that's not right okay so that's
the way we can do custom messages so
I'll submit and it says don't forget
your name
and that's optionally up to you if you
wanted to let's say throw in what the
digit was so let's say for min length
your min length of those little squiggly
brackets and 0 but we have to jQuery
format that so I'll say dollar dot
validator dot format okay and let's try
that out
refresh submit to and it says your men
like the two is not right so with this
little symbol layer we can throw in a
formatted value of whatever it is at the
top and you just have to use that there
one thing I will show you also is we can
override all of the defaults if we want
I could do extend whoops extend dot
validator dot messages and we just
thrown an object and what I could say is
required equals you've got to do it bro
and
go ahead and refresh that guy and submit
and this field is required so that is
not working correctly so let me try take
query validator message is not message
refresh and submit and you got to do it
bro so you can extend if you wanted to
override all the defaults like email
would be the same right playboy and the
emails required let's do yeah this ain't
right playboy so that's if you want to
extend it in this instance I'm not going
to do that at all I'll just leave the
help I have it set up another thing we
can do is change the default behavior
and to do so I'll just do it up here
I'll say dot validate or dot set
defaults and make an object inside that
guy and let's take a look at something
I'm going to press ctrl shift C in
chrome so I can open up the little
selector and when I select this it
creates a label for an error okay so
it's a label and the class is error and
we can change those we can do an error
class I'll call it form error and error
element will be a div instead and I'll
refresh
and submit and there's dibs now you see
the little yellow box that says div form
error or you could look down here div
form error
it really depends on how you want to
handle it you can also change our error
placement so error placement and this is
a function where you pass in the error
and the element okay and I'm not gonna
do anything here yet so we're going to
look at another part of the script which
will be the submit handler and success
so I'll just pop this below messages
I'll say success and this is a function
so function by default are called labels
what they create but you can just call
this anyone anything you want I'll just
call it element so it's easier to
understand so I'll say element dot
remove okay so I'll go ahead and refresh
submit no errors it looks like I have a
comma problem again let me take a look
actually might be this guy here who's
causing the problem so
refresh submit and he was the problem
so there's don't forget your name I'll
go ahead and press submit and it gets
rid of that element you could change the
class name or do a whole bunch of custom
things whatever you want inside the
success handler and what we also want to
do is a submit handler so I'll say
submit handler function and inside of
here
what I want to do is get the data from
the entire field when it's good and post
that so save our data equals my form
which was the form ID dot serialized and
that's just like something we can nicely
pass into PHP I'll say post of I'll say
save dot PHP and I'll pass in data and a
function of Oh
and that's just kind of a standard post
thing I'll make a JSON compatible and I
will console dot log of 1 X I'm going to
console log of oh just a standard Ajax
request so this is submit handler
shouldn't fire until we're good to go so
I'm going to open up Firebug because I
prefer that for Ajax calls much more so
I'm refresh and let's see submit okay so
I'll say jesse 22 test to test comm
check and check and submit and you see
down here when the form is valid the
submit handler is called I do have a
file called save dot PHP that I created
and I can open that up called save PHP
and I just did a print R of post and it
didn't post because I forgot the pound
sign before the my form so I could try
that again post and it didn't work that
time either serialize post save PHP and
data I forgot to refresh the page
chessy 22 test to test calm
oops
and submit and there's our array we got
that so we'll work with that in PHP so
that's a basic layout something else we
can do is called a remote action so for
email let's say I'll say remote and for
that we can call it PHP script
I'll just call remote PHP and I've
already created one in here called
remote dot PHP and what happens is when
you do a remote call it does a it passes
a get URL so I'll go ahead and refresh
this we'll take another look
email say test submit and it says enter
valid email address test those rules
have to pass but can't really get enough
space down here and submit and there we
go now you see this get request it
throws on email and it passes in a URL
encoded thing as test at test com so
instead I do something like email and in
here you might have something for your
database which checks if there's like a
duplicate or something so
if one true now here's the thing with
this validator I'll comment these out
and now there's echo false for my remote
function and actually if you echo
anything else like I'll just echo out
dog alright so I'll say I got to get
down there to the bottom submit okay and
it looks like that's not calling again
test at test comm that is a valid enough
it looks like we have a problem with
that and that brings up a good question
of what's it called resetting the data
for the validator or shoe what was it
called when you think for a second it'll
come to mind we'll just ignore that just
for the time being we'll get back to it
I'll say test at test comm submit and
whoops counseling and this gives back
dog
so for remote failure let's make a
message if I go to index and under email
and remote I'll go
email remote
which is kind of a general error' so let
me refresh and try that again test
attest calm submit and I'm not sure why
that's passing with dawn because if I in
the past what I've done is I've just
returned false okay that's an error so
echo true let's try it echoing out true
ten Santa's calm submit that's not well
in the past I've had it where it doesn't
behave correctly unless you echo out
exactly the word true I think what it's
doing is it's translating this to a
string or something I don't know so
anyways back to the forum part so we
have this error here if we resubmit it
won't let us redo the email forms over
our well well so that you see how that
Ajax it looks like it's good but it's
not recalling so what we're going to do
is a submission is reset the cache and
what was hard for me to figure out is
that the validator actually stores
something in the system called data so
jQuery data here it is there and inside
of here it's storing values and we need
to remove that from this field so I'm
just going to manually set up a little
handler
and I'll say email not change function
and I'll say this dot remove data so
every time they do a key up it should
change it Tess Tess Tess com submit
agree agree I can't get to the bottom of
that
there we go submit to submit okay try to
test there we go so every time it
changes we could also do that with the
submit button when the submit is clicked
so if I wanted to manually do this I
guess I could get the ID of my form
rather than a form change the problem is
I don't know if it's going to pass if I
were to do my form dot submit because
the validator I believe is blocking it
so I'm not certain about that that's
something you could play around with
another thing you can do is if you do
not want this to go through like save
that PHP and have to call something like
window dot location dot href equals
success dot PHP like you don't want the
post to actually go through JSON or
sorry through Ajax call you could do
something like this and I just copied
this off their page
so they'll say form so for the submit
handler we have the form and we're just
going to make the form submit itself if
you are really lazy you could just say
my form dot submit kind of the same
thing and the others get rid of this for
now let's see how that works I'll go
ahead and refresh this page also named
SC 20 submit and it looks like that is
passing but we need to check if it's
valid because something is holding it up
so for the submit handler what I'll do
is um check of its valid and I'll say my
form not valid and we'll do an alert
valid and that will tell us if it's
valid now the thing that's concerned me
is that the submit handler looks like
it's again locking out some stuff so I
guess I'll do it in here as well just
because I'm not certain refresh submit
on to test this test
test calm okay okay submit and yeah
that's not calling so for the email form
let's change this once more and the form
says that is valid so it should be going
through so it looks like I'm going to
manually make my own submit handler so
let's cut that guy out and I'll say my
form dot submit function and I will do
return false so the form doesn't do
anything by default and let's see a
submit handler and we're just going to
check out the form is valid
so if valid else
and I'm throwing some bullets here to
see where we are it will be there 0 or a
1 so the form is valid we'll see what
happens let me click Submit and it
alerts false good and a console logs 1
so it logged this ok so what you might
want to do is um either your Ajax here
you'd probably be forced to do that now
in this case so if it's valid successful
fail your code and what you would
probably do in here is a again looks a
post of saved PHP this serialize we're
just serialize in the form or in and
function oh you might want to do say a
JSON callback so you'd say you know if
ODOT error equals false
else show the poster or some place and
here we do like window dot location HR F
equals success that PHP if we were to
redirect it so for the safe PHP page
you'd have to output some JSON encoded
data I'll comment this out and I'll say
echo JSON and code of an array and
inside this array I'll say error of one
that way we can test it up so if the
form is valid we will check the post
otherwise I don't know let's just learn
the form is invalid you can make it all
pretty at some point so test my three
calm and we got that I email Handler
still on there so submit and save an
error of one the form is invalid I want
to write saying that form is invalid
this serialize function it's having a
problem with the remote data so a
potential workaround would be something
like with the post whatever happens I
suppose if it's invalid we're going to
unset the data variable so I'll say my
form dot data validator of null because
I believe it's storing that in there we
try again test 22
des calm and test boom-boom cement and
it saved it and form its invalid again
okay and I'm going to get rid of the
email change thing that's learned the
valid okay so I believe the problem is
what's happening is let me refresh I'll
say test just throw in some values again
sorry I have to keep doing this boom
submit and we get all this to process
Kay I hit submit again the form is
invalid press it again it just erases
everything the form already had its day
in the Sun and it needs to be reinstated
so what I would do is validate I'd give
this a variable so I guess I'll just
call this elevator let me just call it V
I'm sorry I was call it V okay so V
equals that and what I'm going to do is
when it fails if Fallot is invalid okay
so down here what's happening is they
submit the form and if it's valid if
it's invalid
either way we want to clear the data
especially if it's invalid because it's
going to redirect the page if it is okay
so I'm going to do
let me think I'm going to create a
function actually so this might be a
little bit different way to do it if
anyone knows a better way holler at me
with a comment I'm actually going to put
this outside the thing in here well I'll
put it in the document ready so I'll say
function in it
and boom I'll just declare all this
stuff in there
okay so it'll reapply the validation so
we're going to call init down here so
I'll say connect and we could let's try
that again refresh and test3
that's it does calm low submit and save
got called submit again save as call
submit submit okay so it's reinstating
it because of that little problem there
and in the save file let's do an error
of 0 meaning there is no error so I'll
submit and it refreshes us to a success
PHP page which I'll just create a blank
one call it success okay refresh boom
okay so that's a pretty good start there
are quite a few more features that you
could dig into I will upload this and
provide the URL and github if you want
to download it and that's a lot for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
