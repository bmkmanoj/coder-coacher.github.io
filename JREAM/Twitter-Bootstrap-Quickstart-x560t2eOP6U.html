talk about the bootstrap by Twitter guy
showed me this at work and I was
creating the night administrative panel
with it and it's pretty sweet so really
this has nothing to do with Twitter or
the Twitter API it's just a big library
well not really big it's a library made
by Twitter for html5 CSS and JavaScript
and it's pretty sweet so um has a lot of
stuff to it and what I like about it is
if you go to the JavaScript plugins they
have a bunch of plugins that you use
often and they're all consistent and
they're all like similar meaning your
mortal windows won't be light box and
your tooltips won't be you know q tip
tip tip so they're all like one plug-in
brand and one just makes it really
convenient you don't have to hunt around
for different plugins and they have all
their examples here which you can dig
through what I'm going to do is go to
customize and I'm just going to go all
the way to the bottom you see where it
says select jQuery plugins I want them
all in my boot strap so I'll customizing
download okay and i'll just create a new
folder called twitter again this doesn't
have anything to do with twitter api or
anything like that it's just a layout
and i'll create a new index HTML file so
i go to the javascript library the
javascript plugins require jquery so you
can head over to jquery calm and
download that if you'd like i'll just
copy all that stuff their new jquery j/s
paste boom okay so I have an index file
i'll go ahead and edit this with notepad
and to get started quickly i'll just go
to the examples page on the bootstrap
and i'll grab the starter template right
click and view page source
cocktail at a Stalin and see we don't
have all this stuff here at the bottom
all we have is the bootstrap which
actually includes all these plugins so i
can delete those and up at the top some
favorite icons i can get rid of and this
loads html5 shiv or it looks like a shim
I don't know the difference and I'll
scared of this guy here so what we're
going to go ahead and do is include the
JavaScript so say script SRC and we have
j s / boot strap j/s and before that
i'll include jquery like so and these
asset files I'm just going to replace
the word assets with nothing so you can
see what we're doing I just have my
index here there's my j s a CSS my image
and sound of those i don't have this
responsive CSS file in there either
and now we are ready to play with it so
I'll go back refresh and go to Twitter
and here's the bootstrap sometimes if
something looks funny I like to view the
page source and make sure that it's
there there's the bootstrap there's
jquery there's the JSO bootstrap ok so
let's make something they have a lot
they have a perfect documentation so
going through this one by one is just
going to be silly the navigation bar at
the top there how about we make a drop
down menu so what I do is I go to the
JavaScript plugins and drop down and we
just copy this little piece in here
called drop down toggle I'll make a
script tag here so script script I'll do
this with a jquery function document
ready whatever so we got our drop-down
toggle that will need a class of
drop-down toggle and in their examples
they just have a menu you all class
equals drop-down menu copy and looks
like i have a little bit more there we
go there
okay those have collapse let's pace this
guy in here like and you should go in
the UL like to have them over so I'm
placing him in the main list item for
the drop-down so let me make sure this
works boom boom drop down look at that
we have a drop-down menu now really easy
if you want to add another one I don't
like how they space their code on this
though it's not like four spaces per tab
or something so I'll copy this guy and
paste and i'll call this admin stuff and
see where the ID says many 1 i'll just
change this to menu to ok and delete
some of those refresh and we have these
easy-to-use little admin menus and
obviously you can change the CSS and all
the colors and all that stuff the layout
called scaffolding is a grid so here's
the grid system it has 12 columns like
this and they show how we can do it will
just create a row so i'll copy this down
in the container so just paste a row
okay so what that gives us refresh and
we got a little problem because i erase
the CSS at the top because they have
this navigation menu here I'm just going
to get rid of the navigation for now
because I just showed you something real
easy to use in there refresh okay so
let's make that more visible these dots
I'll say boom boom in here I can say are
too okay so remember to 12 column grid
you see we have a row which goes left to
right in a span which divides it into so
many pieces so span for would be four
spaces out of 12 and eight would be
eight out of 12 and you just add a plus
four equals 12 so you have this if I
inspect this you see this actually goes
all the way to the end that takes up for
so when you're creating rose it's up to
you how you want to break it up div
class equals Rho div and I'll say do
class equals span one and I'll say
and one and this one I'll say take out
four spaces and all you got to do is
just add it up to 12 sore five now I'll
do five more and then spend two to add 2
12 like that and refresh and it looks
fresher okay so I span one span for span
5 and span two if I inspect these guys
there's one there's four there's five
and there's two so it makes things a
pretty nice to lay out and you're not
stuck with that you can offset your
things here so if you just wanted a span
of like four to be offset so many let me
get rid of all of these actually i'll
say span for offset for if I wanted it
to be to the very right I'd say twelve
minus four is eight and it's for big so
that equals 12 and I'll refresh and
here's my span for on the right side and
that pretty sweet you can also nest them
together and all they did was they
created a new row inside of a span we
could actually just copy this I'll say
boom boom boom and span three let's see
three six nine twelve okay refresh and
inside of the column here we have all
these guys it looks like I added it
wrong because the left column is taking
up six so
it's taking up six spaces so this is 3
and 3 is 6 then we could do a right
column and this would be pretty much the
right side refresh and here's level one
level one level two and we don't have a
little highlighting in there for the
background so it's hard to see but
here's the left here's the right here's
the children and the right so you can do
a lot of stuff with this nice grid
system there's also tons of components
that make this pretty sweet buttons so
i'll scroll down and see this action
button let's do one of these so I'll do
I guess I'll just throw it in here I'll
just make an a href equals nothing I'll
call it a button all we gotta do is give
this guy class equals button or BTN
refresh whoops and there it is right
there and you can hover and he already
has some pre-built stuff in them it also
has some colors so size is to actually
so if I want to do a large button button
dash large i can say button dash large
and let's throw a color onto it let's
buttons
those are groups I want the colors I
guess I'll just inspect this guy but in
danger I don't remember that being a
color button primary oh okay that's how
they did it I could say button primary
and refresh and here's my big button
it's a primary button easy to throw on a
carrot you say span class carrot throw
this down inside that button and boom we
got a carrot obviously he's not dropping
down right now if we wanted to we do
sued the drop down and I guess we'll
just follow this code here this is
really easy stuff it's a super super
easy you can just go through here and
try their example so there's not much to
me much reason for me to go through all
this stuff that built in tool tips you
guys should just check it out whoops you
won't need to download these files
unless you want it to be separate if you
just do customized it'll be inside of
your file of called bootstrap and the
jas folder bootstrap right there let's
just do one more plugin I'll do the
tooltip so here's tooth it
I'll grab him boom boom and i'll just
say blah let me give this button an idea
of blah okay and using the tool tips
let's see title first tool tip so it
looks like we use a title okay so that
guy in there let's see if it worked
whether that isn't that beautiful so
this makes templating building the site
and everything just ridiculously easy
and it comes with everything you need
for a front-end in my opinion so let me
go let let me know what you guys think
if you like it at least play around with
it a little bit because I was extremely
impressed by it and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
