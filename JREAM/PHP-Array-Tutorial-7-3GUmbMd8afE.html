for a while it's almost 6 a.m. and I
don't feel like working so I'm making
another tutorial this one's about arrays
and you're going to be using these all
the time so let's start out you can do
an array like this array equals array
and one way you can do it is just add
items inside an item another way is to
do array and square brackets equals item
now this will automatically append to
the last one so this is 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 the keys
see these really have keys like this and
if you don't assign them it'll just
automatically do so there's two
functions you're gonna want to know one
is print R which means print array the
other is var dump I kind of prefer using
print R because it's a little cleaner to
read it var dump has a couple more
details in it so for this others use a
print R and I'm going to do echo 3 and
that is formatted text for HTML so that
it displays nicely so print our array
and you see how nicely that prints and
you see how we set the array with just
two items and we appended another one on
it you could do it again just to give
you the idea see how it adds to it and
if we wanted to remove an item you would
actually use unset so unset array and
the key and remember the key
as you can see it's in this little
bracket here key and value and let's
just unset number two whoops and refresh
and that is gone you can also navigate
through an array with current and this
will tell you what it's on so let's do
echo current and it's on item let's do
echo next let me give this easier to
differentiate okay and it's on item B so
if you do current it'll start at 0 you
do next it goes down and down if we do
whoops and you can see it just can keep
moving down if you want to reset the
pointer you just do reset array you
probably won't be using that too much
but it's just nice to know in the future
I've already told you about associative
arrays and that's when they have text in
here as you can see the key is now
identified by other
let me make this array a little more
easier to read for the most part I just
do an array like this and then I declare
the variables inside here well actually
that's not true it just depends on how
you feel I suppose so animals equals
let's say dog catfish and a horse okay
I'll just see undefined variable array
whoops got to change this down here and
there we have that list and let's make
another array called more animals and
just to try to get you a little more
familiar I'll just type it in this way
and say pig bird and what's the number 1
Pikachu okay things you can do are like
array merge and we want to merge animals
with more animals and nothing happened
and that's because we should make
animals equals array merge and there we
have it it can do kind of cool stuff
automatically for you like if you have
dog in here again um array merge wasn't
what I was looking for but I always
don't worry about that right now you'll
have time to go through functions for a
long time you can do array slice and
let's say we want to slice
animals and we want to start at zero and
end it too so 0 1 2 this should remove
horse sorry the pointer actually goes to
this spot so it removes a at number 2 it
doesn't keep it so 0 1 and then 2 is
where it starts removing other things
you can do which you might actually
really use is called explode let's make
a separator animals
sorry I meant implode and we can create
a little list out of it if you put a
little this is the separator right here
you could put a space make it look
pretty let's say we call this test
equals implode echo test and we still
have this now if we want to turn that
back into an array we use X quote so
test equals explode
whoops animals and echo test sorry once
again
right
it's our umm anyways you'll be able to
play around with that implode explode
when you're toying around with the erase
if you want to create a
multi-dimensional this way you could do
animals this equals array
let's just give this a number so that we
know where we're at let's say 12 and
what if you want to add to 12 as you can
see here it's an array you would
actually do animals 12 and then another
bracket in a refresh and it adds to the
multi-dimensional array I don't even
know what a pygmy or crab rat is but you
know that's that and you know obviously
you can sort sort animals and that sorts
of alphabetically you should notice it
when you sort it does not sort the
multi-dimensional array you would need a
I believe an iterator something a little
above this level right now but let's say
we have a key names the same mammal
actually we can't do this because the
key has to be unique so you can do key
sort as case sort and you know they're
already in order but let's say we add
these out of order okay and before we do
this you'll see it prints the array out
of order based on the keys and if you
want to do key sort and it sorts it by
the keys there's also things like
reverse or arm shuffle to
demise it and one thing you'll end up
using time to time is the for each loop
to go through the array and you just do
this for each animals as key value now
you can call these anything you want the
key and the value but I just do that
because it's the placeholders form and
it's usually easy to remember and key
dot value echo and you can print those
out that way and in a previous tutorial
I showed you how to do the
multi-dimensional one I'll just show you
one more time because as you can see
number twelve right here or right here
it's not printing out because we need to
for each that one so we do if is array
value for each value as K V and we will
do echo up key dot value dot V R we
probably add some spaces and we'd want
to echo out the original kita value BR
else and you can see we have this which
does not look right because I'm supposed
to do K and V okay
and there we have it anyways I hope I
explained this all right and it made
sense and
you guys for being so tired keep
practicing with these because they're
very important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
