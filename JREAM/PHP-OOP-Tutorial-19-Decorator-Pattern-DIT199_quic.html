tutorial we're going to do the decorator
pattern I'm gonna do an example with a
user or let's just call it a player so
say class player and we'll just do a
public function construct this will emit
makes sense in a moment and then I'm
going to pass in an array of info and
let's just say I don't know data public
data and I'll say um this data equals
info okay so I'll create a new player
let's just say new player and it's an
array and I'll just say strength is
going to be ten and Dex is going to be
15 okay and let's just let's echo out
the player let's say P equals new player
will do P um data echo P data and
refresh would get an array so we could
do P data strength to see what that is
okay we got ten okay good so a decorator
basically is what it sounds like it
decorates something without creating a
huge inheritance tree if you imagine you
had a player and he wanted to change his
strength and dexterity his armor and
everything rather than putting that all
in one gigantic class or having to
extend it a whole bunch of times just to
manipulate things we would use a
decorator pattern and usually people use
an interface or an abstract class but
I'm going to keep this pretty simple and
the reason you use those is to keep kind
of the decorators templated so what I'll
do is I'll say class
user how about player strength decorate
scroll down a little bit
whoops okay and I'll do a public
function dropped and I'll do player as P
and if you don't understand typecasting
yet just look at video number 18 the
previous one and we're going to say on
this player equals P and we'll add to
his strength so this player data and
remember data is up here and this is an
array if it helps I'll just do array and
strength and we'll just do plus equals
five and okay that looks good
and let's just say class player decks
decorate and I'll just do the same thing
here except with the decks and I'll do
25 okay now to pass these in I would say
um oh let's see
I'll call it strength equals um new
player strength decorate and I'm going
to have to pass in the player so I will
pass in P because P right here is the
player with the array of data and I will
do um echo
strength um player data strength I hope
that's right let me refresh that okay uh
yeah EP let me echo a line break or a
horizontal rule okay
I'll also do one for decks and just say
decks equals new player decks decorate P
and I'll just copy this okay Dex Dex
okay
and I refresh that and you can see it
added to these values um obviously you
could manipulate this a lot better you
could say you know public function add
and we'll do just an integer and we'll
say this player data Dex plus equals int
and I'll just get rid of this here and
down here we will say Dex add 25 and
refresh was that the same number I used
other 55 there we go so you could easily
manage player statistics or other things
like that by using a decorator pattern
normally there's um like an interface
like twelve or an abstract class
abstract um I just call a player
decorator and public function add int so
you'd usually have something like this
and you just say extends player
decorator and
we'll keep all your little decorator
pieces lined up to behave and we should
get an error because we're missing an ad
line 16 error whoops forgot the word
class okay let me add down here and data
stream
now obviously you wouldn't have to use
different classes for strength and Dex
I probably bundle those into one but
this could be an example if this was
like his armor pieces and this was his
health and points and all that you'd
separate these and it'd be a lot easier
to work with class player decorator not
found' decorator okay
not a very good speller I'm not sure
what way is correct
refresh okay and this way we have kind
of a uniform system working get rid of
this and okay well that's basically it
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
