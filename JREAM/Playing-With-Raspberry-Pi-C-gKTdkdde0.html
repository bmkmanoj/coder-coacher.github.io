order and just a little tiny computer
here I put some of these little cheap
heatsinks on it and it came with this
plastic case it's pretty cool it has two
USB ports and Ethernet port then over
here has two audio jacks at the bottom
it has the SD card reader over here has
the hdmi and this isn't so much about
the raspberry pi as setting it up so I'm
going to put a wireless adapter in here
so pop that guy in and then I bought
this cheap $20 keyboard from target and
it has a little touch pad so it makes it
easier to use an OS or something and it
it works right out of the box of this
little logitech wireless guy so pop him
in right and what i did i put raspberry
and pie on this SD card it's a 32 gig at
the OS and I'll just slide him into here
like that and i had that hdmi i already
plugged into the television so then plug
it in right here so and then i plug in
the microUSB to get power i always do
this backwards there we go and it just
turns on automatically will see a boot
up so now it's booting and first what we
have to do is set it up so it's kind of
funny seeing a computer on your TV like
this i had 700 megahertz cpu 512
megabyte bytes ram it's not like a
killer machine i don't know what the GPU
is but i installed XMBC and i was able
to run videos very good so we have our
first thing expand file system yes I'll
do that change your password and enable
boot to desktop I would want that on
okay and it says a naval camera a bunch
of other stuff that I don't want to care
about right now it's pretty easy to set
up on sit finish and it reboots and from
here on out it will boot up a lot
quicker and then we will have the rest
burien weezy operating system on here
now I will say it's not fitting on the
screen it does fit on my other smaller
TV this is a pretty old TV I don't know
what the deal is it's a plat smite think
now let's download the GUI and I'm going
to show you how to set up Wi-Fi because
this having a little confused for a
minute and you can see here i can just
easily move this it didn't need any
drivers or anything i think type on it
is pretty nice so where you want to go
is to Wi-Fi config I'll just double
click this guy and here it is and this
is actually a little hard to read on
here and I'm just going to click scan
and it found my wireless network called
dream and skin close and manage manage
networks I forgot how i did this
WPS one second Oh kinect kinect scan
want this guy click click there we go ad
to double click it so wa p is what i'm
using yeah most people are probably
using that the encryption i don't even
know what that is then you have to type
in your key here let me type mine in
real quick okay and i'll say add whoops
and let's make sure that's scanning
manage networks there we go and i should
be online i believe let's see the
current status cool i'm on so now i can
open this midori and load up the browser
that comes with it has a lot of python
on here oops i double click that okay
make sure this works whoops i opened two
of them it's not like the fastest
computer obviously so let's go to
google.com see Wi-Fi is actually working
there we go cool um so if I go to the PI
store right here they have a bunch of
add-ons and everything it's pretty
simple operating system I think it's
only about 300 to 600 megs I don't
recall and it's loading according this
indicator but most people like to use
this maybe as a media center or
something I might need something a
little faster if i'm going to use XMBC
because it does tie up a little bit but
it's extremely easy to use and you can
see the hardware is just it's a little
ugly looking but if you hid it behind
the TV it might be kind of cool you got
your keyboard to control it and it has
you know just a linux OS with all this
stuff here python idle and a bunch of
stuff you kinda want need to use but if
you want a cheap gift for somebody it's
a whole computer you could even put
windows on here i believe so that about
wrap it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
