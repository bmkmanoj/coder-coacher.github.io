to talk about programmer and you can
find this at programmer dot orc so what
do we have here this is an event driven
framework okay this is a lot different
than say a Model View controller or your
average PHP stuff and has the power to
do a lot of things I've been using it
for a couple months and it's pretty
fantastic I think if anyone's familiar
with event-driven software it might come
in handy otherwise it's it's pretty
useful for doing a million things you
can run on an entire website and project
off it or run things and Linux so I'm
going to head over to is github and
here's URL at the top I'll provide a
link for that inside the description and
what I'm going to do is download from
the tags so where you see this branch
that says master on its little github
who's going to click the arrow and go to
tags and the latest one is one point two
point four and i'm going to get this zip
file okay
so what I'm going to do is open up my c
drive here and I'm going to create a new
folder and call it lib you don't have to
do this you could just drop this in a
directory but I prefer to do this way
and i will show you why as well because
you can use this for more than one
project and it's just easier to do it
this way in my opinion so i'll drag this
guy over to the libs folder close that
up and i will rename him to programmer
if i go in here we got all these files
and test files and examples really what
we're going to focus on is straight up
using the source files just this where
the whole framework lives and there's
also a bin file and we're going to run
this on Windows you can run on mac or
linux if you want but since i'm on
windows that's all i'll show you how to
do it so we're chillin up in here and
what I'm going to do is open notepad
plus plus first let me get this URL so
I'm up here C Drive lip programmer SRC
and i have a new file here Otis a PHP
and that will require see dr lib
programmer SRC and let me call this I'll
just going to call it programmer ok one
thing to pay attention to is you might
actually type this wrong p our do gmr
sometimes i type NMR so just try to
watch off that and i'm going to change
my backslashes two forward slashes just
because okay and i need to actually
require the programmer main file at
and I'm just going to go one make sure
nothing goes wrong and I'm going to head
over to a working directory and the
program and PHP file so I just deck
without one let's do something now okay
so an event framework let's let's break
it down very simply the first thing we
have in this framework are something we
call handles and these are basically
like definitions and they do all your
stuff okay once they're called the
second thing we have our signals okay
and these call the handles okay so on a
regular programming you might have a
function test whoops and you call it
like that so this here this would be
like the handle and this here would be
like the signal and for a little while
it might feel like what's the point of
this I can just write functions and all
that but there's a lot more to this than
meets the eye so what we're going to do
is create our first handle and to make
life easier for me I'm going to use the
namespace programmer as P okay so step
one let's create a handle i'll say p
namespace handle
ok and i'm going to do p signal ok so
those are our main guys and inside of
handle will create a closure or an
anonymous function so i just type
function and this looks a little bit
like jquery donut i'm just going to pick
all hello ok and we have to give our
handle a name so i'll just call this guy
hello so here's our handle ok and signal
is not signaling anything right now so
I'm going to signal hello ok I'm just
going to put the number 500 there so we
can see that it's that going so i'll go
ahead and refresh the patrons as hello
500 and you're probably thinking what
what's so amazing about that well we're
just getting started with some of the
basics so if i were to do this you would
kind of expect this to behave as a
regular function that's called over and
over so if i hit refresh we don't have
that that's because signals are sorry
handles have an exhaust straight by
default they can be called once and i'm
just going to make it easy without going
into deep descriptions i'll say no no
and this means that the exhaust Sheree
is infinite so I can go ahead and
refresh and now it happens three times
so let me make a couple more of these
and I'll put the exhaust rate 22 even
though we're calling it six times
refresh own shows up two times ok we
have other things in here like intervals
so we can keep repeating something over
and over there's also a URL handler and
I will show you that after I show you
this so if you're on Linux or Mac you
use your bash shell to do what we're
going to do next if you're on Windows
you're going to need c YG win and i have
that installed right here this bad boy
and you're going to be able to need to
run PHP from your terminal so I'll just
die PHP dash
and that has been our environment
variables so I'm going to head over to
the directory where this files chillin
I'll say CDC drive workspace okay and
here it is program dot PHP that's just
what I called the file and what I can do
is actually run the binary file from the
command line so I'll go to programmer
bin and here's the file in lib
programmer been okay so say PHP see dr
workspace programmer whoops wrong thing
see dr lid programmer bin programmer if
you're in mac or linux you can just
create a symbolic link us lowly windows
users have to type this out i haven't
figured out a way to do it yet and on
this run program dot PHP now we're going
to get an error because i'm already
requiring the file so i'll have to
comment that guy out whoops i'll close
this back here i'll try running it again
and nothing happened because i erased
all the signals so be signal hello okay
and i'll hit the up arrow and says hello
500 so I know that's not the most
amazing thing you've ever seen so let's
make it interesting and create an
interval
and an interval has no tag or anything I
can get rid of the signal and what I'll
do is I'll interval this in milliseconds
so every second I'm going to echo 1 ok
and I'll go ahead and tip up arrow 111
and that kind of cool so I'll do ever
have a second and you might be thinking
well what's the point of doing this if
you actually look at some of the
examples the developers made a matrix
rain thing it was pretty sweet so what
you can do with this is actually loot
jobs running on your linux box to an
actual PHP code you know talking to a
database on intervals you can set this
to you know a day two days whatever and
it'll just keep running and you're good
to go so just to make things interesting
what I'm going to do is create a handle
I'm going to call him Jolly Roger I'm
going to signal Jolly Roger I'll say
echo Jolly Roger and I want to have new
lines for this guy so I'll do the escape
n however you got to have these in
double quotes for that to register so
we're going to from the interval we're
going to signal this every half a second
kind of the terminology is a little
difficult to get used to a first handle
to that jolly roger and let's make
another one just for fun i'll call this
from becky beans Becky beans and I can
create another interval and I'll say
thank you means obviously you can you
can do a lot more on these functions dog
then just echoing out strings you can
actually connect to databases one thing
I will tell you is that if you're going
to connect to a database and leave it
going you're going to want to
instantiate it within the interval
because eventually your database is
going to timeout its connection so
you're going to want to have it
reinstate its connection every time the
interval sets off and that's just for
whatever reason so I'll put this one to
run really fast
I'll run that again and we couldn't
automate a lot of stuff so that's
basically some very basics to this the
programmer developer does have a channel
and let me head to a real quick there it
is youtube com user programmer he talks
about PHP 5.4 Python and event-driven
programming probably a lot better
because he actually wrote it so you
should subscribe to him and check out
some of the stuff i play this framework
lastly what we're going to do is play
with the uri handler so i'm going to
uncomment the requirement because i'm
going to run this through the browser
and what i'm going to do is clean up my
mess and what I'm first going to do is
create an HT Access file I'll just say
this is HT access and then here we're
going to create a basic rewrite so i'll
say rewrite engine on this requires a
patch in this situation rewrite basis
just where we are and the rewrite
condition is going to be request books
filename the dynamic request of a file
name it cannot be equal to a file it
cannot be equal to a directory and will
create a rewrite rule of anything start
with and with anything in this group
okay and I'll say index dot PHP the
dynamic value query string a pen and I
forgot what L does okay so what we're
going to do is we are going to actually
load up the signal for HTTP so say P
load signal HTTP ok oh where do I begin
there are things called signal
interrupts but that's a whole nother
story for a whole nother day so I guess
what else is there to do but to try this
out so say HTTP so we have a programmer
signal HTTP let me just double check
something
api you are i request that's a mouthful
so i'm going to namespace this guy so
i'll say i want to use it's not a class
so i'll have to get those guys like boom
i'll use all that is H so I'll say huri
request do a function and I need a URI
let's call it dog I don't know that's
going to work my name space there so
I'll go to slash dog internal server
error do i have mod rewrite on Patchi
modules let me open up this Apache ini
file of fur rewrite yes I do so what
seems to be the problem here what I'll
do is try a little debugging let's see
if my problem lies this refresh nope
it's my Apache configuration so HT
access rewrite rewrite engine on right
base that's just chillin their request
filename
hmm well there it is rewrite condition
doesn't exist it's called rewritecond
okay so let me try to refresh that no
dice what's the deal we get rid of
rewrites base request filename rewrite
rule let me open other HD excess file
and just copy paste this stuff in looks
exactly the same to me oh we're not in
an index dot PHP file we're trying to
rewrite that file that is so
embarrassing so I'm going to file save
as and call this index dot PHP so
everything will be routed from him so
I'm going to head over to index dot PHP
and blah blah blah let's fix that
unexpected as let me get rid of this for
a second and rename her
so I'm just going to use HTTP as HTTP
refresh there's one okay so i'll try i
think i believe i need to load the
library but let's just have some fun
I'll do HTTP API you are I request I
know that's kind of scary but hey it's
organized nicely and just like I handle
we're just going to do almost the exact
same thing as I handle I mean you could
rename this to a handle if you want it
but this will now behave with the URLs
so I'll say echo dog and I believe I
need a slash there I don't recall
exactly though state dog index line 12
oops summit go on refresh hey what did I
do wrong there it is Alton that needs a
semicolon refresh unexpected end the
file I guess I do this on my colon
refresh undefined function so sorry
about that i have to actually include
the library so i'll just open it up in
this file that i use i'll pass him in
right here okay so refresh and there's
the dog page but it's not echoing dog
what happens if I do this dog
oh you don't say dog Just My Luck oh
this is so embarrassing I've been using
this for so long and I totally forgot I
have to run a loop just let me do a p /
whoops I can't stand PHP's namespaces
they use this backslash separator so
weird refreshing there's dog dog okay so
now what we can do is we can build an
entire website out of this and literally
do whatever we want so it'll be like hey
this will be my homepage this will be
about me
this will be some crazy URL oops
something weird okay so I'll just go
here and welcome home let's go to about
there's the about page and I'll go to my
favorite song and things boom and some
crazy URL it's pretty dope one cool
thing is you can also throw in
parameters so i'm going to rename this
to let's just call this projects i'm
just going to list a project by its ID
right so with that ID the semicolon here
this will actually map to a variable in
here called ID so i'll say echo ID and
i'll go to project 3 and it gives me
three so you can do all kinds of my
sequel queries and crap with that one
thing is if you actually go here low to
just project it doesn't show anything so
you would probably have to create
another one of these guys like
this unless you wanted to list all your
projects here you could do that too so
I'll refresh nothing here and isn't that
pretty cool very simple and you can
manage all your URLs and everything and
it doesn't all have to be in one file
either nevertheless this video is
getting along so check out the links and
have fun guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
