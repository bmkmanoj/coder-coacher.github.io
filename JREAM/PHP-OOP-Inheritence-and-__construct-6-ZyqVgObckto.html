we're going to learn about inheritance
and what we're going to do is we're
going to create a character and then
we're going to create three sub
characters these are all going to be
characters but there's going to be one
main character so let's do require ones
equals character class dot PHP and let's
just do that for the wolf dragon in
human so wolf dragon and human and I'll
just create a new file do PHP class a
character okay save that is character
class PHP and let's do one for human
human dot class dot PHP one for dragon
dragon dot class dot PHP and one for
what we have a wolf wolf dot class dot
PHP so well good as inheritance let's
see
and all our characters if we were making
a game they'd all have hit points so
let's say protected HP and again
protected means it can be accessed by
this class or the classes that extend it
so let's extend those extends character
okay whoops and we're going to put those
in all of our other subclasses I'm going
to reload these files because I'm going
to move them so I would do to organize
things I'd say make a new folder called
character and you put the children of
the character inside of there so that
just keeps it more organized so open
character once again
and I'll open these three and instead of
this I'll do care dirt because it's a
different directory okay and I'm just
going to refresh the page to make sure
there's no error good so in the
character class they have HP protected
let's just say damage for damage points
what else can we do um magic power I
guess uh protected I'll just do I guess
armor okay and since all three of these
guys are going to have this we can
extend the defaults to them so let's say
HP the default is 100 the damage default
is 10 I'm going to get rid of MP and the
armor default equals 10 unless we define
otherwise so off the bat let's do
character equals new dragon this won't
do anything yet so let's set this up
let's do a public function construct and
what a construct does is when you create
the object it will load this whatever's
in here right away
so if we did echo one as soon as we
create the new dragon it will output 1
see we can also do since this extends we
can get this HP and that will get this
from the character since it extends it
there we go
and what do we want to do let's see that
a couple this how about let's make a
construct for the character protected
function construct
you might say well why are you making
everything protected in the character
the reason is we don't want them to be
able to create a character it has to be
a certain type of character so you hit
refresh you get a you can't do this it's
protected and that's why this is
protected that we can only create the
character from the child and to do so
you type parent construct well this is
only if the character has a construct
but and just to echo the character was
created okay and this parent construct
will run the constructor of the parent
obviously if there is no constructor you
don't have to call this because it will
already inherit its properties so let's
do a new dragon and refresh the
character was created see that um if we
want some basic actions like protected
function attack and we would actually
let's make this public because we want
to be able to say character attack okay
we want to be able to use attack from
this point so echo we attacked for
damage and character attack undefined
variable dmg and that's because I forgot
the dis damage there we go and I'm not
exactly sure why I made all these
classes but it's just to show you a
better example so in the dragon we could
say um public function setup and let's
say um this HP equals HP this dmg
equals dmg and this what was the other
one
Armour equals Armour and we're going to
pass these into here so HP dmg and armor
and when you create the dragon let's
give them some HP let's say 150 10 and
20 okay so what we're doing here is
we're overriding the default values in
the character and then if we have the
damage it'll be different see the
default is damage for 10 and then the
dragon the default let's do a 330 if we
had attack that didn't work because we
have to set it up my mistake you have to
go character setup there whoops there we
go
we attack for 330 I mean you could also
put this in the construct to make it
even cleaner and the setup will be right
when you create the little dragon there
and pop this back over into the
construct there you have it same thing
ah that's inheritance and it's pretty
cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
