to you about bitbucket today which is an
alternative to github for git hosting a
bloke at work named Sam Horton talked
about this and we all convert it because
it's too good to be true
so bitbucket org and you go to pricing
and sign up you get unlimited private
repositories public ones too and you get
a bunch of stuff like wiki's and stuff
it's basically a git repository okay and
it's free and with five users to
collaborate on projects together it's
absolutely free now I love github but
you can't beat this pricing on github it
costs $7 for five repositories private
on this one you get unlimited private
ones so if you want you could sign up
here it's free and here's my little
profile you'll have a nice little thing
like this when you create repositories
you can create your little private ones
that will have locks by it and your
public ones won't have locks and you can
change the icons as well it's just very
elegant looking when I look at this it's
just so clean and nice they recently
redesigned it I'm not sure how fact how
far back one but it's extremely nice and
if you don't know what get or a
repository is it's just a way to keep
control of your source code and there's
kind of a learning curve to it I don't
know I'm not like the master I get but
I've been loving it it saves your life a
lot so if you're not a fan of the
console what you can do is get this it's
called source tree app it's available
for Windows or Mac and it runs pretty
smoothly and you can use this to take
your local copy and put it on git it's
really easy to use it's just setting it
up that might be the trickiest part so
let's do it first thing is I will load
source tree there it is and I already
have a repository in here but what I'm
going to do is first set it up so you
guys know how and to set it up you have
to go to tools create or import SSH keys
and the reason is because when you go to
bitbucket and this is the same with
github you go to manage account SSH keys
let me delete that one and we add a key
so we have to generate one so that it's
super secure so I'll say tools create or
import keys and we get the putty key
generator I'll just click generate move
the mouse around and you see the bar
stops when you stop moving it it's just
making some kind of random stuff okay
and what I'll do is copy this public key
here and we'll paste that I'll just call
this really your paste it in here and
make sure you copy the whole thing or
you'll get an error that says hey it's
not a valid key okay so now we have our
public key here in the way our computer
communicates to this bitbucket account
is with our private key so I'll open the
putty key generator I want to save my
public key I'll just save it as test
I'll rewrite it just so I have a backup
of it but the private key is what you
don't want to lose and I want to save
mine without a passphrase you can put in
a passphrase here but every time you
commit and do stuff you're going to have
to type in your password and I think a
SSH key it's pretty secure I'll just
call this test PPK I'll overwrite my
private key okay
so I'll close that out and we're going
to launch SSH agent and if you're on
Windows it's going to show up in your
top right and it's going to open this
call the pageant key list
and let me add a key this step isn't
totally necessary sometimes I just want
to do it and I'll load this private key
here looks like it's already loaded let
me remove it and reload it there we go
just make sure it's in there it's kind
of like a little third party thing
that's listening so that it can do SSH
stuff so to get a repository you can
either create one from scratch I'll call
this dog face and I'll make it public
and now I have a dog face repository and
I have all this stuff here if you're
using a command line but I'll just copy
this line right here SSH at github get
bucket or dream dog face okay and inside
a source tree we'll click clone slash
new I'll paste that in once you change
your you click down on this box it'll
check if it's a real repository and you
can place it wherever you like I like to
place mine in my workspace folder
because that's PHP enabled and that's
where I do most of the PHP stuff I'll
just make something called dog face ok
and I'll click clone and there we have
dog face now there's nothing in it so
let me open up Windows Explorer I'll go
to workspace dog face and you'll see the
dot get folder you never want to delete
that because that keeps track of all
your goodies and I'll create a new file
you text not rich text text document
I'll call this readme dot MD and that's
short for markdown I'll say dog face
this is the future I'll make another
file just for fun and I'll just call
this file dot PHP okay
I'll close this guy out so dogface now
has two working copy changes on my hard
drive
and these aren't added to the repository
so I have to select both both of those
I'll click Add okay and they're not
going to be there until I commit it so
what I would do is say commit and you
write a message you don't really have to
write a whole lot sometimes you can just
write update I'll say in it repo and
I'll say commit okay it's committed but
let's go to the website and I refresh
I still have this blank page because we
have to push it so back here I'll say
push I want to push to the master branch
okay let's cross our fingers and hope it
works so full output
okay this has completed successfully
I'll go here and refresh and now I have
an init repo and this is the moment I
created it and here's when I committed
it you can click this little hex value
or whatever it is and it shows what you
may have added or removed it shows I've
added two files if I were to go back and
manipulate those files let's say dog
face and I said life
I'll close those guys out and I'll go
back to source tree click him and you
see these little dots here it means it's
modified meaning hey you got changes you
should push to the server so what I
would do is I would um
where's the update add okay I guess they
just use add instead of you know just -
you in the console commit I'll say add
it a line and commit okay and then I
will say push push okay and it's only
momentarily
and there we go go back here and see it
says I push to come into dog face and if
I click this it shows exactly what I
added now this is so important for
editing code there's a lot of other
things like you can access it via SSH or
HTTPS I usually do SSH this way and I
think it's easier if I go to my source
tab these are my branches and what
branches are is let's say you have a
live copy and a local copy I could go
here and I could right-click what I'll
let me right click new branch I could
call this testing and you could really
put anything you want in here you would
probably start out with a copy of
whatever your main branch was so I'll
create another branch ok and then you
can push to the testing branch I believe
you have to push this commit or let me
add a file to it commit I guess not
adding branch commit haven't added
anything okay all I'm wondering is is
this pushed
just put I'm used to using the console
so we still have the master branch I
think I could just right-click him and
go push to origin okay what's going to
happen show full output of dog-faced
target okay close now with one
repository you can work in two different
branches so I'll refresh and you see I
have a testing and a master branch you
can create a whole bunch if you want if
you want to create tags that's like a
compiled zip file of a current state of
your application if you wanted to give
someone downloads let's see if this has
it oh cool
so I'll tag this and I'll say version
one add tag and there's my tag there
what I need to do is commit nope
push
see what happens I'm used to using the
console where you just type push tags
I'll show you how to use the console
it's not too bad
okay now don't know if anything happened
we'll see and tags and we have version
one here and here's version one now I'm
used to seeing a zip file download for
version one where is she
well I don't know about that exactly yet
so the other thing you can do is use a
console and windows I use mingw so I go
to CDC drive workspace and see the dog
face okay and I'll just do VI file dot
PHP I'll just edit this is another test
okay and let me do right quit okay so I
update that file and all I do is get ad
period and that will update files that
already exist now I can type git status
it says modified so let me touch a new
file I'll say hand just I don't know
what that is and get add dot I will say
get status and it says new file usually
you have to do get add - you so let's do
get status okay I don't know why it's
working maybe it's because it's synced
up with SourceTree or just a complete
newbie so anyways we can say get commit
- M this is a update
let's get commit - M that a a little
exclamation point ruin it
there and then I can say git push origin
and then the branch I want to push that
you see I'm on branch testing right now
so I'll get push origin testing dream is
allowed accepted payload so let's go to
testing and look we have hand here yet
if we go to master we don't have it
let's see where'd my console go there we
go git branch master I want to switch
branches I need to do a check out so I'd
say get check out and then the name of
my branch was master and I'll do it
LS maybe see hands not there so just for
fun I'll say touch master okay I can do
a git add let's see what the get status
is new file so get commit M added a file
the console is pretty easy to use if you
get used to the command so I really only
use less than ten commands total get
push origin master for this one and in
total three writes stream is allowed a
septic payload refresh refresh
where is that there it is and look at
that and now we can look at our commits
we have a history of all our code what
we committed what we did people can
approve it if other people are working
with you
you can view RAW files and keep a
history of all your programming problems
so I would definitely hop on this train
you guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
