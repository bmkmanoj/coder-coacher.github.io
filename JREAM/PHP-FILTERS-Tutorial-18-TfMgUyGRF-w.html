talk about PHP filters and a filter you
can think of like a coffee cup and you
pour your coffee and it only lets
through the good stuff and that's what
we're gonna do now there's a lot to
these filters so try to listen carefully
if I go to php.net what we have are
functions to use our filters on we're
going to look at filter of our filter of
our array and filter input okay and
you'll be able to pick up the rest after
I give you a short walk through and
basically we can use filters to validate
or sanitize data validating making sure
that it is what we want it to be and
sanitizing to clean it up okay they have
some examples on here but it is a little
busy and a little tricky so the first
thing we can do we can say filter list
and I'll just do F equals filter list
and let me echo a pre tag and I will do
print R of F and refresh and these are
all of our filters we can use and that's
just if you want to type this I guess
but we don't need it for this so what we
do is filter var and that's the number
one that we're going to play around with
first and what we do is we type in the
value I'll just say 22 and then the type
of filter we want to apply and you can
see here we can use all of these now you
might think I want to validate an int so
you type int but that's not right
because you know that's just not a real
thing you'd have to type filter whoops
filter validate int okay
and it's really long and this is a
constant there's a lot of these you can
just attach the string here at the end
of it so if this was an email I would
attach email at the end
and this is a very simple example so
I'll save this and refresh and it gives
me back 22 now what if I have an A in
there I'll refresh and I get nothing and
it looks like well there's a problem but
nope it's just a false value so if you
actually had this in an if statement so
if this was true we'll say echo true
else echo false and refresh and it gives
us false and delete the a refresh and
it's true okay so nothing too complex
about that it either gives us the value
or gives us false
let's do filter bar and we'll do tests
that test calm and we'll do filter
validate email and refresh oh did I make
it I spelled this wrong filter VAR
refresh and we're not getting anything
because I didn't echo it that's
embarrassing
okay refresh that and we'll get the
email address what about comm dot dot au
for Australia that passes and let's see
if it passes for this one
wow that's strange
- at signs refresh and then it fails now
I'll show you how to put some stricter
rules on this one more I'll show you is
they have a validate IP and we could do
filter validate IP you can validate IP
version 4 and 6 and to do that we can
add another thing down here and we add a
flag to it so I'll say filter
Flagg IP version 4 and refresh and that
one's good
now that's not an IP version 4 because
too many decimals there's a lot of flags
also on here so you first apply your
filter and then you apply optional
options or Flags ok so it might seem a
little confusing at first let me do a
URL by showing you two examples I think
it'll be easier to understand okay so
I'm going to validate mysite.com
and I want this to be a URL so filter
validate URL and refresh that's good and
you can also put on a couple flags for
this one one for example would be filter
flag path required okay and the path
would be the HTTP so if I get rid of
this it's going to be false if I put
this back well
I guess we need the page name sorry
index.php for the path name and there it
is wrong thing another one would be
flagged query required and what is a
query that's the string on the end ID
equals four four and that one will pass
so you can validate your input this way
and there's no need to go through all of
these let's do the sanitized real quick
and let's to get rid of this and get rid
of this
let's sanitize a string to make it only
a number so what if we had five hundred
see four hundred see okay and we want to
get rid of the number we can say filter
sanitized number and now you need to put
number here because there are other
types of numbers let me open up the PHP
area and I was just showing you some of
these validators here okay under
validate filters and you have options
and you have flags and I was just
showing you all the options in here
right now we moved on to sanitize and
you can sanitize stuff and it tells you
what it does no need to go all through
these it's just kind of playing around
but I want to show you some that are
cool
so we're sanitizing this one and you see
how it strips out the letter C and we
only get integer values so it's kind of
a quick way of doing stuff we can do
filter sanitized string
now let's do hey see what that does
gets rid of these little brackets it
appears let me view the page source yeah
it gets rid of these brackets and extra
things so let me also show you some
options this one's a little bit
different but we're going to do the
filter validate end so try to remember
there's validate and there's sanitized
okay and validate is for checking things
and sanitizing is for cleaning when I
think of sanitized to think of like a
dirty toilet bowl and you put some
bleach in it okay okay so for options we
put an array at the end and I'll just
hit enter so it's easier to read so for
filter validate int you can do some
options and up in here you see filter
validate int and it says you can specify
a min range and a max range and
optionally you can also put flags on it
I'm just going to show you the min and
Max range and I can say min range is
zero
oops that says mix and max range is four
and refresh it gives us our value back
good and what if we do the number number
five refresh that's not supposed to work
six
let me get rid of this zero and try it
this way well I had it working a minute
ago I'm not too sure what I did wrong
okay so now let's move on to filter var
array if we want to do the same thing to
a bunch of array values rather than one
by one let's first make an array let's
call it data and let's do a associative
array and let's say key is 500 all there
and this will be another array and let's
say 5 20 and I guess I'll just pop in a
name up here name is Jessie comma let me
refresh make sure I have no errors looks
like I do a semicolon in there okay
there we go and then we can pass some
arguments first let me say we're gonna
do this filter var array we're going to
pass in our data and then we're going to
pass in our arguments okay so we have to
create an argument array also so let's
say args equals array and what we do is
we match up each of these associative
keys with how we want to validate it so
if I say name I want to validate this
with filter validate strength about key
and I'll do filter validate int
and other this one might trick you up
because this one is an array this other
one so we actually created an another
array with our values in here and I'll
say filter to apply to every one of
these I'm gonna say filter validate int
and let's echo this out okay refresh and
this is a mouthful sorry there is no
validate string I'm an sanitize refresh
we get an array let's say e equals this
and I'll print R of e so we can see the
results
refresh it looks like it worked for
Jessie what if I had um up in my name it
was Jessie four four four well that is a
strength how about for the integer I'll
say dot e refresh and this one's empty
because it's false it looks like this
arrayed and passed through let's see
what happens if I pop some little
strings around there refresh no good
flags filter require scale are okay I
don't know what I've done wrong on this
one but it's something like this just
check out the documents salt this is
just a different way to validate it has
its uses oh the last one filter input
let's go ahead and do that real quick
and this is another cool thing let's say
if is set of get ID
then we're going to do a filter input
I'll just say a equals filter input and
we we specify the kind of input we're
doing we're doing input underscore get
and then we choose the name of the get
which would be ID in this case and then
what do we want to validate let's do a
filter validate int I keep doing that
because that's what I seem to only
remember var dump of a and I'll refresh
and nothing showing up so I'll go to the
end of this and pop in ID equals three
four four and we'll get that okay and
it's kind of doing the same thing if I
put a letter in there it's not going to
work how about we validate an email dog
a dog calm cool so I think you get the
idea
no need to stretch this on any longer
than is going and happy holidays
everyone thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
