some JavaScript because it's really good
to know
I made a folder on my desktop called
JavaScript inside I have a file called
index.html and I've opened that up in my
Google Chrome you can just drag it into
your browser and I just have a basic
HTML layout you should already know HTML
if you're gonna do JavaScript and the
first thing to do is your JavaScript
always goes in these script tags okay
and this is where we type is so the
first thing we'll do is a function
called alert okay and this is how
functions written has a name it has the
parenthesis and that has a semicolon to
end the command so alert is a pop-up
window and we'll say hello world and go
ahead and refresh and we get hello world
nothing that spectacular but it's
getting started JavaScript I'll also say
this is not at all the same thing as
Java okay JavaScript and Java are
completely different languages you may
have heard of things such as jQuery
prototype mootools
script Acula s-- every spell that and
those are all JavaScript frameworks
which kind of wrap around your code that
will be typing here to make it easier to
do stuff but you should really learn the
fundamentals of JavaScript because you
don't a framework doesn't replace
everything okay so like with every
language we have variables and we'll
make one say x equals 10 and make sure
you end that with the semicolon
we'll say y equals 20 and we'll say Z
equals dog and XYZ see how this doesn't
have any quotes around at the 10 and the
20 that means these are integer values
and Z has quotes around it that's a
string value okay
if I did a W equals 10 even though this
is a digit inside there it's in these
quotes so it's a strength meaning you
usually can't do math operations like
you can't do W plus X and I'll show you
what I mean we're going to do a function
with the document object and we're going
to write and say W plus X and refresh
and it gives us ten ten so that's giving
us the string literal and this integer
but if I did X plus y I'll just change
that to Y refresh it adds it up together
and that's because it's an actual
integer and I won't get into that right
now too much I will say that this is a
lot like PHP and Java the actual
language itself and a lot of other
languages we have loops we have if
statements switch statements functions
and these are some of the things I hope
to go through with you so the first
thing is will be an if statement and
this is very very very easy we do if
okay by the way let me just say this for
slash slash this is a comment it doesn't
show up on the page and doesn't do
anything so an if statement whenever we
do that we'll say if and we do these
little parentheses so if what let's say
if X is greater than Y and they see what
that saying is if 10 is greater than 20
then we got to do something and we use
these little squiggly brackets to
contain what we want to happen if this
condition is true and let's do a
document dot write and we'll say true
okay refresh that's not true and to see
that we'll say else document dot write
false and refreshingly get false I will
also say there's an else if statement so
I could do else if this is another
condition so let's say Y is greater than
Z or weight Y is greater than X sorry
and I'll say document dot write blah and
refresh oops there we go blah basically
the reason I brought up else--if is
because if you need to put in other
conditions and stuff and in other
languages it might be right we written
like LF or else if is one word but in
JavaScript try not to confuse yourself
because it's two words don't panic if
you don't understand all this this is
just basic stuff familiar with every
other language and I suppose that's a
good enough start and practice these a
little bit and we'll move on from there
