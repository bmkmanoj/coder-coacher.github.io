look at tuples and dictionaries in this
tutorial let's just quickly step back a
second we looked at lists okay let's
just say L equals one two three remember
we use the square brackets that's how
you make a list and tuples or tuples and
dictionaries are kind of the same let's
say T equals but this time we use
parenthesis one two three okay and I'm
just showing you how to make them first
before I try to explain them and then
Dictionary would say D equals and this
time we use the little squiggly brackets
and dictionary is a little bit different
because we have to use key and value
pairs
if you come from let's say Perl or PHP
you can think of this as an associative
array okay and to add another one we'd
say key 2 and value 2
one thing to keep in mind is that since
these are indexes by Association you
can't have the same index or the key
sorry got my wording a little messed up
so these are the index or the key and
this is the value so I can't have key
here and then key there anyways let's
hit f5 and load this in there and I'll
type L and we have a list we've gone
over this a little bit we can do l1
equals 200 and we'll change a value in
there we can also do L dot append 2000
type that in and it goes in but then
when you get to tuples press T and let's
try that let's say T 0 equals 500 it
doesn't let us and how about t dot
append 500 it doesn't let us we click T
it just remains the same so basically a
tuple is like a constant value that
doesn't change you use it for something
maybe you needed to pass parameters
throughout a project they remain the
same
a tuple would be a good example with
dictionaries let's just press D
dictionaries also don't have this
feature d dot append say try to append
something to it and you see that a DI
dict object has no attribute for that
however you can assign dictionary items
if you do it this way you do
let's see D is our dictionary right
let's say D and then you define the key
let's say name equals Jessie then just
press D again and you can insert that in
and put it right there however if I said
if I wanted to insert another key too
and I said D key 2 equals blah and I
press D you see it didn't add one on
because we just replace this key so
let's go through a dictionary and do a
little looping we have dictionary here
with our squiggly brackets I'm going to
make one called boss and I'm just going
to give them a number kid I'll say he's
12 mom will be 33 and we'll do one more
let's say XYZ equals 50 okay and we're
going to loop through this let's say for
K and P are sorry d dot items now items
is a function that grabs all these items
and semi colon will say print K and
press f5 and it prints out each item now
what we can do is print them separately
as the key and the value
so what we could say is for K V you
don't have to use these exact letters
but it's easy to remember k for k k for
key V for value so say print k
, equals V and f5 and we can see what
we're working with let's say we wanted
to sort the items what we could do is
say sorted on this function and f5 and
this sort sit well it doesn't look like
it's sorted for K V in sorted D items f5
front huh well I'm not exactly sure what
I did wrong here this is really
embarrassing this is so embarrassing and
I really don't want to remake this video
all right so I don't know what I'm doing
wrong here so just think of dictionaries
is Ashoka so shi'ite of a race for the
most part I like lists because it's
simple tuples they're just like constant
permanent values and dictionaries are
like associative arrays if you need to
say this equals this and that equals
that and I think that'll be fine for
this tutorial thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
