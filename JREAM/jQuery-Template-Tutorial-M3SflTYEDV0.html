show you how to use jQuery to create
templates in JavaScript
okay so what you'll need is a site with
a couple of included files already and
I'll provide a link in my description if
you'd like to download my template PHP
files now don't get that confused with
the jQuery template okay so if I go
ahead and do right click and view page
source all this page really is is it has
a stylesheet so it's not terribly ugly
and I've included jQuery and jQuery UI
but that's not required and I've already
downloaded the template script and I
have a custom JavaScript file where I'll
be doing all my JavaScript in so to get
the jQuery template file all you got to
do is go to Google look for jQuery
template here it is the first item and
you'll scroll down just a little ways
and it gives you the link to github and
inside of github the one I downloaded
was this one I didn't want to compress
because I want to read through it a
little bit from time to time so I
clicked this and what I did I just went
raw I got the raw code I selected it all
I put it in a new file called jst MPL
and i paste it in there and then just
included in your page so I'm gonna open
my custom J's file and to make sure this
is working I'm just going to do dollar
template and then I'm going to open up
Google Chrome's console with ctrl shift
I and I'll go I to refresh and just to
test I'll type it again looks complete
okay if the template was broken we get
it wouldn't know what to do with this so
what we're gonna do is create a basic
template so I'm going to make a variable
that stores some HTML so I'll save our
user list equals I'll say div you know
just for the heck of it let's do a well
yeah let's do some divs div okay and in
order to parse a variable through here
we use the dollar symbol and the french
braces so I'll say ID and you'll see
what we're doing in a moment name and
age so just some basic HTML for this
example and with template what we do is
we create a name and all this whole is
user list again and a matter of fact I'm
gonna get rid of this variable and just
pop this down in there so it's a little
less the reason you might want a
variable is this could get long and big
and you want it to look less ugly okay
so what we'll do next is we need JSON
data okay because Jason's the easiest to
work with I'm going to go to my PHP page
because I'm in PHP and I'm just gonna
dump out some PHP what I'm gonna do is
make an array
I'll say a equals alright and what we
have a user list with ID name and age
okay idea 0 25 okay so I'll repeat this
a couple of times and then I'm going to
echo out the JSON encode a okay so I'll
refresh and here's my nice little clean
JSON data I'll copy that line a text and
just paste it up here I'll just say
Jason equals okay and we are going to
want to loop through the template let me
just do an alert of Jason dot or Jason 0
dot I D make sure that's working refresh
and we get 0 okay let me try age age 25
okay so the jason data looks good i'm
going to get rid of this right here
because i don't need this anymore okay
so remember this is just some sample
json data you'd normally get this and
this will be your pair a template and
we're going to loop through the jason
data so i'll do a for loop i'll save our
i is 0 if I is less than Jason dot
length oops that's not a function I plus
plus okay and I'll do console dot log
Jason I
okay so refresh and in my console I get
all the guys names cool and what we'll
do now is we're gonna pop this into our
little template so to use that I can do
dollar symbol TM PL and the name of the
template I want is user list and the
data I want to pass in it is going to be
JSON I so that it's really gonna appear
like name is gonna fit inside of this
name here see how all these are gonna
fit in there okay might look a little
confusing I don't know a very better way
to explain it and we want to actually
put this in a page so we're going to do
append to and we'll just call we'll just
make a difficult data
if ID equals data and I'll go ahead and
refresh and there it is
obviously this is one a dog other
looking thing what if I did
table ideas table data and I changed
this to a TR TD TD changed all these
gifts to TDs and TRS okay and I'll go
ahead and refresh and now we have this
which is 100% generated by JavaScript if
I view the source I don't even see it in
here and okay that can be useful for
quite a few things your template is
obviously going to be more advanced than
this but say I want to break this down
into new lines I can do a backslash and
enter I can put a backslash after new
lines if you want it to be more readable
and there okay and make sure you don't
have a space after that can't have a
space after your backslash because
that's an escape character you want to
escape the new line okay so that's a
that's a very basic overview you and you
could do something like if you wanted to
just dump this somewhere else
which would make a little button like
let's say input type equals submit ID
equals new so we make a new button okay
and here it is there it doesn't do
anything just yet and I'll say new dot
click
function and inside of here we could do
TM PL I want to use the user list
template I don't know what I want to
pass in yet and I'm gonna append to data
ok and in here I could just pass in my
own stuff I could say how about I was
passing a single object and say ID is 5
age is 2255 and name and Benji the dog
refresh that and submit and we can add
new fields all through JavaScript using
the same template and it's pretty sweet
very easy to use just TM PL first you
prepare your template with the dollar
template and then you use the template
with TM PL the name you gave it which is
the first parameter and basically the
data you pass in the second parameter is
going to fill in these little dollar
fields and then you can just do whatever
you want with the template and I hope
this was useful and hooked me up with a
thumbs up if you're feeling generous
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
