and we're going to cover aliases al is I
I don't know how to spell Elias and an
Elias is basically kind of like a
shortcut and I'm gonna use our previous
inner join example to make an alias okay
so if we had a bunch of joins and things
on here this could get pretty busy and
you might want to shorten things up so
if your table name was you know a lot
longer than this you might want to
shorten it up and to do that wherever we
are picking the table we're selecting
from is where we apply the alias okay so
here's one from posts we're gonna apply
one here a s and P so what does this
mean a s this is short for alias just
get rid of the three letters in the
middle and now P will represent post and
when you do that you have to change this
to P and that to Pete and notice you
can't do it up here you can't say user
Scott name as you because then this will
represent only this field users name as
you and we want to apply this to the
whole table to shorten it up so inner
join users as you and then there we go
and then we'll shorten users up here and
execute no database selected sorry let
me do use learning and execute and there
we have it there's a simple alias pretty
easy to use let me show you how to do it
in this as well you can do it here so
for you name we could say as blob poop
and play and then to get this role we
can now represent the name as blah poof
and you might say why do you want to do
that here's a very good example if we
select looks all from users and all from
posts you see we have these conflicting
IDs so what you can do is say you da ID
as maybe you ID and you da name and I'll
play execute sorry and you see even
though these have conflicting IDs we now
alias it and we get a sound query pretty
cool and I think that will cover for the
most part for our aliases practice this
a little bit and always use the period
when you're saying the alias little
short piece you don't have to do one
letter I just like to because it's
really short and easy to read and thanks
for watching this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
