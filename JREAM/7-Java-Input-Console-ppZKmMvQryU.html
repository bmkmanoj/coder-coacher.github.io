input data into the console so that you
can register it in a variable and I've
made a class called input test and I've
named input test dot Java and this one's
a little different because the first
thing you have to do is import a utility
called Java dot util dot scanner ok
there is another way to do this and that
uses import Java dot input output but
this one seems to be a little more work
so I'm just going to do the scanner here
and we have our basic PS vm and i will
do a system dot out dot print line what
is your name and to take the input you
would probably think that you would do
system dot in but that's not the case we
have to do a scanner so i'll say scanner
input equals new scanner system dot in
ok and this will allow us to type in
some input and i want to get the line
that's inputted from here into a
variable so what i'm going to do is make
a new string and say name equals input
which is this and this input object is
the scanner so when they type something
into this i want to get the input in the
next line so next line and then lets out
put it with system dot out dot print
line
and I'll say welcome to java and then
i'm going to concoct in tonight however
you say that with the plus symbol and
i'll do name and for fun I'll do to
uppercase so I'll compile that now and
say Java Sea input test dot java and
i'll say java input test what is your
name jese rodriguez Belafonte okay and
says welcome to java jese rodriguez
Belafonte pretty easy and good to use
and will probably be using this a couple
times and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
