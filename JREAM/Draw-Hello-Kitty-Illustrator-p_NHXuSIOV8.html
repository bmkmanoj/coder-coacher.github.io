tutorial I'm going to attempt to draw a
Hello Kitty I need a reference picture
because I'm I don't know what she looks
like off the top of my head I'm gonna
start with a circle and try to get it a
pretty close size to what her head looks
like and okay that's good and I'm just
gonna lock this layer with control - and
I think I'll draw her ears by hand with
the pen tool and just click and drag it
don't make a point there
and her head goes up a little further so
I'll just do it from here to find the
center point here and kind of make it a
curve okay
so let's create a mirror of this we have
the shape of a head and I guess I'll
just merge these together cool and let's
see her eyes and nose these are pretty
easy to draw actually looked kind of
like rounded rectangles so you might
want to use this tool but I'm gonna use
circles just because I don't want to
waste your time
and let's see the nose I guess that'll
be a circle also okay and let's get the
color of that and the border it's just
kinda like a brown color and the stroke
will be a lot fatter and I'm going to
put the stroke on the outside and maybe
maybe three pixels okay now let's see
her eyes here here she's calm a fat head
and her whiskers I'll just draw a arc
well they actually look kind of like
straight lines
so I'll just use the line tool draw a
line there and these will be the brown
color and I'm gonna use the fattened
thingy there we go and just through
whiskers looks like the middle ones a
little smaller we got that and I'll just
mirror these over cool and for her head
guess it'll use the same kind of stroke
about five pixels and the inside will be
white okay boy this is a really basic
looking kitty that nose is a little big
they should be a little less wide a
little smaller okay and for the bow
looks like it's just a circle with a
half of a circle on each part make these
a little smaller and then this looks
like a boy that's a tough shape I think
I'll just draw it it's kind of like a
little bow here we can close that off
and pop it to the back here and then I
can mirror this over from the center
point of the middle circle and then
actually I'm going to rotate it I don't
want it to be mirrored there we go and
the inside is a red color and the border
I guess just brown and
okay and I'm gonna let me move that down
a second and control G to group them and
we'll pop this fire a little here I
think this should be a little thicker
let me get the right border color okay
and this color and let's see her feet
are just ovals I guess we'll just go
ahead make an oval and rotate it a
little bit there's our foot and I'll
mirror the other one over and for her
hand it just looks like an oval but it
gets a little fatter at the bottom so
I'll grab this convert anchor point and
make this a little fatter and chisel a
little thumb that's attached to it okay
and let me get rid of the border to see
how it looks I put it on top of the pink
yeah that doesn't look exactly right
yeah that's probably good enough and
I'll put that border back to 3 pixels so
merge it and her little hand here okay
and her pink dress which I can't see I'm
not gonna draw the teddy bear and back
so I'll just mirror this over okay
that's pretty funny looking okay and the
last thing is we'll just draw her little
dress and I'll just make a little square
behind here and it looks like it's this
pink color and we'll give it a border
and say three pixels send it to the back
looks like she's doing some kind of
Michael Jackson move or something and
you know she might have a little collar
it shows a little bit of white there so
I'll just do
Circle right here and cool and white and
move it back with the little arrow keys
I don't think I missed anything you know
you could be more picky about the line
strokes if you want it just for fun
Allah makes some of these a little
fatter a little thinner it could just
make things a little more interesting I
think this is a really cool tool by the
way really not something to rush through
in my opinion but if you took your time
with it I think you could do something
really classy with different stroke
weight widths and everything and I guess
I'll door nose I guess it's not gonna
let me because it has a fill and I guess
that'll be it for this tutorial I'm not
going to put this one on the site
because it's just I don't know kind of
junky but thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
