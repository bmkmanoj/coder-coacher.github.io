dream.com I'm just redoing this tutorial
because I forgot the voice on the last
one here's a bike wheel we're going to
make just grab a circle hold alt and
shift and we'll get a circle and then
ctrl C to copy and ctrl F to paste in
front which is right here and I'm just
going to make that circle light I'm
going to hold alt and shift and make it
smaller and then make sure you have your
Pathfinder open window Pathfinder and
then I'm just going to subtract whoops
subtract those shapes and let's make a
little circle in the middle okay and for
bike spokes I guess we'll just start
going straight up and down and that
should be a black line and I'm going to
let this go over just a little bit umm
now bike spokes they kinda go in a funny
direction so I'll do that like that and
I'll alt drag this and well I'm going to
make a new line actually
and how about mm I guess kind of like
that I'm not exactly sure what they're
supposed to look like it'll make a
circle a little bigger okay so now I'll
just grab these two items and grab this
rotate tool and find a center point in
this circle and make sure you hold alt
and then you're going to drag it and
then hold shift and I get 45 degrees
there and I'll do that and before you
click anything press control-d and what
that does is transform again right here
you just press that a couple times till
you get all the way around looks good
and let's add some treads on the the
wheel so I'm going to take a rounded
rectangle and let's see
I guess pressure down arrow until it's
almost square but just a little round
there'll be little treads like that flip
those colors around and then grab the
center point of this and just make sure
it lines up with the center of the wheel
there we go like that and we're going to
do kind of the same thing click the
object and create a center point hold
alt and drag it just a little bit over
then just hold ctrl + D and we get to
the end almost looks like a perfect
shape and I'll copy ctrl F paste in
front and move this down so that we have
kind of a bike tire look and you could
let's say add a radial gradient to this
and I'll do radial um looks kind of bad
with the little spoke spoke in there so
what I would do is just select this and
I move to the back and there we have it
there's a little bike wheel thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
