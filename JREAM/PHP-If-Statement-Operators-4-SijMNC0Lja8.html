we covered some loops and now we're
going to do some if statements and
operators first let's cover the
operators there is the assignment
operator the comparison operator there's
a couple others like bitwise that you
don't need to worry about right now and
an assignment operator is just something
like this name equals Joseph it's this
little equal sign and this assigns the
value of Joseph to name a comparison
operator is more like name equals equals
test this doesn't make name equal Joseph
it's saying is this equal to it but we
have to put that inside an if statement
see it produces nothing so let's do an
if statement is pretty simple it's just
like this if our arguments and then our
content so if name equals test then one
echo the name is test ok and since
that's not the name nothing appears
let's do an else statement and an else
statement comes right after the if so if
if the name is not test then we're going
to do this make sense and we could even
throw in another trick it's called the
else if statement now an if statement
must start with if and end with else if
you use an else if statement it must go
between these two
so else if what else if name equals
Joseph echo the name is Joseph so what's
going to happen if we lower case the
letter let's see it doesn't work so PHP
can be kind of picky what if we add
three equal signs this mean it's the
same type it means it's very strict kind
of hard to explain I think but I'm not
going to go into that here are some
other comparison operators if name is
not equal to Joseph let go it's not Joe
else it is Joe ok this means not equal
to there's another thing you can do
let's say if name and a ! and the !
equals not so what is this evaluating
hmm it's saying if name is false and
since name has text inside of it this
makes it true but what if we had nothing
in it same thing what if it was null
it's nothing so this returns nothing so
if we put name equals fall
it's not Joe but if name is true it is
Joe or if name is set to anything it's
true okay what about like numbers let's
do some numbers let's say if 10 is
greater than 100 say true okay so 10 is
not greater than 100 so it went to the
else statement now you can also do
things and throwing more parameters
let's say if 10 is greater than 5 we
know that's true so we'll get true and
if you want to do and you do and and 5
is greater than one so both of these
conditions must be met in order for true
to be outputted okay but if you have a
10 is greater than 5 and 5 is greater
than 7 this one's false and this
requires both of these to be true so we
get false you can use an or statement
which is two pipes that means only one
of these have to be true in order for
this if statement to render true so we
know 10 is greater than 55 is not
greater than 7 but since this is true it
says true okay there is also one that
you might not use a lot it's called XOR
and basically it means this one of these
have to be true
and one of these have to be false but
they both can't be false and they both
can't be true kind of confusing so this
is just kind of a basic rundown I hope
it makes sense and just to overview one
more time if name equals test if name
equals test echo test else if name
equals blah echo blah else go unknown
there we go so it's pretty easy to
follow the logic once you play with it a
few times and also this usually isn't
recommended but sometimes I suppose if
you like things a certain way you don't
have to have these brackets only if you
have one statement after it so this is
legitimate and this all is considered
one block so you'll get the same result
but if you wanted to do two things after
it like this you're going to have a
problem okay so I don't know what
people's opinion is on this I use it
sometimes for simple things but for the
most part try to use these little
squiggly brackets all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
