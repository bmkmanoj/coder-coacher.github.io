we covered some loops and now we're
going to do some if statements and
operators first let's cover the
operators there is the assignment
operator the comparison operator there's
a couple others like bitwise that you
don't need to worry about right now and
an assignment operator is just something
like this name equals Joseph it's this
little equal sign and this assigns the
value of Joseph to name a comparison
operator is more like name equals equals
test this doesn't make name equal Joseph
it's saying is this equal to it but we
have to put that inside an if statement
see it produces nothing let's do an if
statements pretty simple it's just like
this if our arguments and then our
content so if name equals test then want
echo the name is test okay and since
that's not the name nothing appears
let's do an else statement and an else
statement comes right after the if so if
if the name is not test then we're going
to do this make sense and we could even
throw in another trick it's called the
else if statement now an if statement
must start with if and end with else if
you use an else if statement it must go
between these two
so elsif what elsif name equals joseph
echo the name is joseph so what's going
to happen if we lowercase the letter
let's see it doesn't work so PHP can be
kind of picky what if we add three equal
signs this mean it's the same type it
means it's very strict kind of hard to
explain I think but I'm not going to go
into that here are some other comparison
operators if name is not equal to Joseph
it's not Joe else it is Joe okay this
means not equal to there's another thing
you can do let's say if name and a
exclamation point and the exclamation
point equals not so what is this
evaluating hmm it's saying if name is
false and since name has text inside of
it this makes it true but what if we had
nothing in it same thing what if it was
null
it's nothing
so this returns nothing so if we put
name equals false it's not Joe
but if name is true it is Joe or if name
is set to anything it's true okay what
about like numbers let's do some numbers
let's say if 10 is greater than 100 say
true okay so 10 is not greater than 100
so it went to the else statement now you
can also do things and throw in more
parameters let's say if 10 is greater
than 5 we know that's true so we'll get
true and if you want to do and you do
and and 5 is greater than 1 so both of
these conditions must be met in order
for true to be outputted okay but if you
have 10 is greater than 5 and 5 is
greater than 7 this one's false and this
requires both of these to be true so we
get false you can use an or statement
which is 2 pipes that means only one of
these have to be true in order for this
if statement to render true so we know
10 is greater than 5 5 is not greater
than 7 but since this is true it says
true okay
there is also one that you might not use
a lot it's called
EXOR and basically it means this one of
these have to be true and one of these
have to be false but they both can't be
false and they both can't be true kind
of confusing so this is just kind of a
basic rundown I hope it makes sense and
just to overview one more time if name
equals test if name equals test echo
test else if name equals blah echo blah
else I've gone unknown there we go so
it's pretty easy to follow the logic
once you play with it a few times and
also this usually isn't recommended but
sometimes I suppose if you like things a
certain way you don't have to have these
brackets only if you have one statement
after it so this is legitimate and this
all is considered one block see we get
the same result but if you wanted to do
two things after it like this you're
gonna have a problem okay so I don't
know what people's opinion is on this I
use it sometimes for simple things but
for the most part try to use these
little squiggly brackets all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
