bit about PHP object-oriented design and
for this example let's imagine the
client code and this is where we create
our objects and use them and custom ways
we need to and the form of the validate
these would be separate classes in our
library and the goal of Hopi is to
separate things so that they all have
their own role okay and others quickly
run through what I did here we have the
form and there's a function for post in
it for you know grabbing an HTML form
and then there's a function for
validating in and this creates the
validate object right here and I just
put in a fake validation function and a
call magic method in case the method
doesn't exists and we throw an exception
and this is a problem because with the
form this is always going to be
dependent on the eval validate class so
if you decide to put your form object
into another project you can never
forget to bring the validate object with
it because it's now dependent on it and
things are kind of coupled together now
so these are our couple kind of like
they got two wedding rings on you know
so let's write in an example in the
client code and I'll show you what I
mean so if I was posting a form and I
said post oops this is supposed to be
called form now I'll do F for that so if
we did form post and I got name and form
post and I got age you know so far no
problem
logically or anything and then if I
wanted to validate the age I could say F
Val and I'll do number and I will do
age okay now I'm aware that this isn't
the actual exact working example I would
actually have to put down here this
field something like that so what this
basically does it says all right post
this store the variable in the form we
get name and age their values and their
name in the object and then we're going
to validate it and we call it here and
it opens the new validator and then it
jumps over here to number four this
example and it'll either return true or
false then here it will return to true
or false as well so we probably have an
if statement for this valise and this is
very bad because we don't want things to
be coupled up like this a better way to
do this would be to make objects have
one role and I'm sure you've heard that
a lot so I just delete this whole thing
all together there I'd let form do its
own thing all the form does is mess with
forms and if you want it to validate you
could just make a new instance up here
say new validate and over here I will do
V number age so now this form stands
alone okay and this is all it does and
the responsibilities are less confusing
and if you have problems you're going to
do less dinging around because you know
exactly what these classes stand for and
validate this also stands alone which is
very very good now in some cases you
actually might want to do more things
and have you know all these things plug
into a base form class but in this
example for the most part I would do it
this way I mean can you imagine getting
to many if you had even another level
deeper and validate you know your
functions could look like F Val other
well that's a bad example but just a
quick talk so always keep your objects
standalone unless you're very creative
and can find an intelligent way to
systematically couple things that should
be coupled most of the time you
shouldn't do that because I know you can
imagine this could get very long you
know if we had like 20 items and then 20
validate items validating it so there
are cases when it's good to make use of
putting them together and all right I
think that's a decent explanation I hope
