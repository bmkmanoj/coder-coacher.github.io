out the update command now and inside a
post we have our layout yeah yeah and
then inside of data we have a couple
things here and let's change one of
these fields
so first let's say we're already inside
of learning here as you can see it's
clicked here I'll just go back to here
how are you doing and do use learning
and let's say update posts and then you
you it's it's different than the insert
remember when we did insert we did
insert into table there were values and
then value like that update is update
posts set and then we do field name
equals value where something okay and
this is our first introduction into the
wire command as well I'll probably get
into that later
but let's go ahead and do this so we're
going to update posts which is this
we're gonna set the let's check table
posts let's change content so we'll say
set content equals
I changed it and where do we want to
change it we want to change it according
to the primary key so we'll say where ID
equals to where ID equals to and
semicolon that and execute and now let's
go back to posts and the data and hit f5
to refresh and check it out we changed
it and if you're wondering why did we
use we're here's why if you do update
posts set content equals I changed it
and if we run this and refresh this
it'll change everything and you always
want to define where in your updates
where you want to do it and most of the
time it's under the ID so that's a
pretty quick tutorial thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
