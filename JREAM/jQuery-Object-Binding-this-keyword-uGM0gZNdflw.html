show you how to use a jquery object
today and for the example I have I just
have an input form with a lowercase in
an uppercase button and this HTML is
right here and I have an output div
nothing fancy pause the video and type
it if you want to do it exactly like I
did and if you're desperate you could
always go to dream / lab / open source
and download the little website template
only for desperate ok so what we're
going to do is in our javascript file is
do some good stuff we're going to make
an object so i could say ab equals flips
a little squiggly french braces that's
an object i'm going to give my nav are
just before it for no reason I guess so
it's not global and to use an object we
say ab dot something we have nothing in
there right now so inside of our object
let's just give it a name and i'll just
say john smith and you separate values
with a comma you don't separate them
with a semicolon I'll say age he's 55
and in it short for initialize I'm going
to make a function okay alert one so
what I want to do is say object dot in
it okay and it's saying object dot in it
and with the little things here function
and you know we could up pass in a value
in here so I set in it dog it should say
dog like that okay we obviously don't
want to do that I'm just trying to show
you an example so inside of here we have
what are called properties and methods
okay if I wanted to get the value of a
property inside an object function what
I would say is alert this dot name this
dot name and this refers to the object
we're in and although this is an
anonymous function this function here is
part of this object now we're going to
come back to that because that's going
to probably confuse you so if I hit
refresh we get John Smith okay and if we
want to do an event of let's say
clicking that lowercase button I can do
lowercase dot click
function and when they click lower case
we're going to do this alert this name
now we're going to pop it in here
remember how it did just work refresh
click lower case and we get nothing and
it's like why is that aren't we still
inside of this object the answer is no
because now what we have is another
function and this function is not part
of the object it's just anonymous and in
order to get properties of the object
we're in with this we have to bind this
object to this function basically put a
belt around it and pull it back in and
to do so at the end of the french brace
we do that bind of this remember this is
referring to the object warren so
refresh and click lower case oops what
we do wrong dot buying this it looks
like I was missing a parenthesis thing
there refresh lower case and we get John
Smith pretty easy peasy a little
confusing and let's say we want to
observe the lowercase and uppercase
button and they're both going to do
different things so let's make a new
thing and we'll say lowercase
I'll say observe lowercase boy can't
type today function and observe
uppercase function and this is just
handling the buttons when they're
clicked ok so i could say uppercase dot
click function ok and I'll just stay
alert you for upper case and I'll copy
this and paste it in here put in the
word lowercase get rid all that junk and
this will not work just yet and if
you're curious or want to figure it out
yourself you could pause the video and
just look at the code refresh click
click it doesn't work and the reason is
we're calling in it right here and all
that happens is whatever is in here well
we could make a net behave like is a
facade pattern so I could say this dot
observe lower case whoops let's say
there this stop observe uppercase so now
when an it's called it also calls these
functions which in turn will make those
little observations work so we got Alfre
lowercase and you for uppercase cool and
what we want to do is get the data from
this field to appear let's say in the
output and we could make a function
that's reusable inside this object and
we'll say get text this will just be a
function and we'll say return of this
or not this it was called a text dot Val
and I'm just going to put it in here so
I'll say
I'll put dot HTML will be get text now
that's not going to work because
remember we're inside of an object the
object so it'd be this get text the
problem still comes up that we need to
bind it because you see we're in this
function here and inside this function
it's not happening inside the object
necessarily so we have to bind it down a
little belt strap find this ok refresh
and I'll say test lower case and we get
that so notice how this bind this
happening I'll go ahead and pop this
into the upper case one and I'm going to
do it without the bind refresh I'll
click test good refresh I'll click test
no good because it doesn't know where
it's happening so that bind this and
what I'm going to do is add that to
uppercase and dot to lowercase refresh
test good how about Tess good it keeps
making a lowercase how about dog
uppercase and it says dog and that's a
nice little way to reuse a little
function if necessary and obviously you
know mmm yeah I guess that's good for
now I hope that helps you with binding
and objects thanks a lot for watching
guys give it a thumbs up if it helped
otherwise leave a comment if you're
still confused peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
