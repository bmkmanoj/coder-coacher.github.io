we're gonna draw a Sonic the Hedgehog
and I guess we'll start with a nose
which is like an oval and I'm just gonna
switch those colors around and use black
whoops
I'm gonna go through this kind of quick
because I don't want to take too long
and then he's got kind of a little bit
of a curve there and I'm just gonna okay
that looks good
whoops and I'll close that little piece
and his color here is kind of like a
skin color so I'm gonna open the
swatches library and pick skin tones
yeah that's good enough move this to the
back and this right here needs a circle
so I'll just try to line up the I'll
just do it like that line up the top of
this circle with that and there okay
now this isn't going to be perfect but
I'm kind of hurrying through it then his
head is blue and his head is a like a
circle it's usually pretty big so I'd
say that's pretty good and let's pick a
blue and now I'm going to get rid of
this down here sorry wrong piece okay
and I'll just kind of whoops
I better expand these okay then just
move this piece up a little bit
all right now for his eyes these will be
tricky I think I'll just start with some
white circles and also here and then I'm
going to connect them they kind of go
down and then back up again and try to
smooth that into the circle I'm just
gonna have it down there I'll merge
these shapes and expand also this one
okay and the side of his head it
probably needs to be a just a little bit
move that behind the mouth well I think
this will be alright next thing I'll do
is draw his eyeballs like this and I'll
just cut these pieces right here okay
well that's not where I want his eye let
me make that year he's got a ear that
goes right here okay pop that in the
back and he's got an ear about right
here I don't remember how big they are
and he has like the inner ear and that's
kind of like a skin color this year's
going to be facing the other direction
so I'll make that a little darker and
this year is kind of blue then I'll make
that a little darker okay and then his
little blades on top of his head I'm
gonna use a circle and I think I could
get a nice blade effect from this
track these and I'll just use that shape
send that to the back then copy it again
copy it again think this top ones a
little wider okay and these back blades
I'll just make them a little darker
still so that his ear kind of pops and
there's a little mouth here it's got to
be bigger okay see these two joints here
I'm gonna join these so that it's a lot
easier let's say I think it's ctrl J
okay
actually these can't line up so I need
to remove it there we go and now I'll
try to convert the point there we go and
his little jaw here should be bigger I
think over here should slide over maybe
a little more whoops okay and this
little head piece here I guess I'll kind
of move it in a little bit slide the ear
down I'm not gonna be too picky and then
he's got a little smiley we could just
use this little line tool like that I'll
use black for a line and now back to his
eyes let's do some circles let me see
what lines up pretty good he usually has
like one eye over here looking at you
and where would this look
that'll look kind of funny okay that'll
look pretty decent and his eyes usually
have like a little white circle on it
okay okay sonic doesn't look too healthy
now I'm going to add a gradient to make
them look a little more attractive let's
just do a skin here skin here and I'll
just say radial now you know we're just
cooking this up pretty quick if you put
time into it you'll get a a pretty good
looking Sonic and let's make his head
darker and I'll select all these pieces
and do the gradient as well except for
these I kinda I think I want to do
linear so I'm going to do linear and his
ear is dark and this blade it'll start
off dark and get lighter
okay
and he's looking kind of funny I think
it's not the best sonic not the best at
all but you can see what we're working
with here okay I think that'll wrap it
up for this tutorial thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
