your PHP quick as possible
one thing is echo hello these double
quotes you should use single quotes
whoops
because I in double quotes PHP parses
this in case there's a variable in there
in case that was there it would parse
this another thing is to use commas
instead of periods so the PHP doesn't
have to combine the string and then
output rather it does it like echo hello
my darling
rather than hello my darling now these
should be single quotes to and period
there because first PHP says all right
let's build the string here and then
we'll output it but with this one it
just says yeah it's all one thing let's
just say it another thing is with a for
loop or really any loop if you do a loop
like this for I equals 0 if I is less
than the total count of array then add 1
to I if it goes through one loop it'll
say all right number one is done then it
goes back to this and it recounts the
array and then it is wasting resources
every time it counts in the loop so
instead you do a value equals count
array and then you just put Val down
there if I is less than that
another thing that's obviously is
caching my friend David said the best
one you can use is a PC and that's a
peer package you can unset junk to free
memory if you have an array
when you're done with it just unset
array you can pass values by reference
rather than we creating them into the
function that's just done with a little
+ sign and those are some speed tips
there's probably a lot more and
obviously it's not going to make
everything super fast or probably even
noticeable but if you did have an
application that got 10,000 people every
minute all these little things are going
to add up and it'd be important to have
something as fast as possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
