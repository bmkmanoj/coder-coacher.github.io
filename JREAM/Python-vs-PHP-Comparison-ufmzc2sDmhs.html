differences between Python and PHP a
couple other differences because on
Twitter someone asks why are you hopping
on the Python train and you see PHP in
the distance I personally like Python I
love learning new languages but I really
like the way pythons written and when
you look at your code it's it's really
elegant and that's not to say PHP is bad
in any way it has its shortcomings in my
opinion but Python it's just it can do a
lot of stuff it's not just for a
webserver
so let me show you some examples on the
Left I have Python on the right I have
PHP code and you can use a pound sign
for a comment and you notice that I use
the slash slash for a comment in PHP I
believe you can also use a pound sign in
PHP and you can do the star star
brackets for a comment in HP also
pythons comments can also be a comment
like this for a multi-line comment so
you know it's not a debate over who has
better comments I'll show you a couple
things so we can get rid of the comments
here I'll leave the main PHP one there
how about let's start with namespaces in
PHP well if I want to access a namespace
Zend framework something else
right it's not that attractive if I did
namespace Jessie life you know we're
using these back slashes this is just
how it looks and in my opinion I really
just like the backslash but and Python
you'll do import Zen framework something
while you do from Zen firm or something
import else obviously this isn't a real
import but you see it's a lot different
with the dot syntax
and to use a namespace in Python it's
actually different
you don't just set it anywhere you want
you actually have to have your file name
this file name will have to be called
something and it would have to belong in
a folder called framework and in another
folder called Zend so a python has a
forced way to organize so that's one
thing the namespaces let's look at a
couple other things how about a variable
let's say name equals Jessie age equals
28 and we end those with a semicolons I
have no problem with PHP variables in
Python I'll just say name equals Jessie
age equals 28 for some reason I still
think I'm 25 but I act like I'm 12 okay
so it's essentially the same thing not a
big deal let's check out an if statement
if age is greater than 10 let go it's
true now with PHP you have a lot of
leniency how you do your if statements
you know you can put your brackets down
there and all that then we have an else
statement it's not true and then we have
our else if statements else if age is
less than 10 how about age equals 10
we'll just say echo on the money okay
and we don't want to forget to end these
with our little semicolons okay now if I
was doing this in Python I'd say if age
is greater than 10 print it's true
and then LF age equals 10 print yadda
else print
Hey okay just so you can see the
difference here the syntax highlighting
might throw you off a little bit try not
to be bothered by that in Python we
don't have the parentheses like you're
forced to in PHP nor the variables have
to have the dollar symbol so the if
statement is pretty cool we can mix it
up with some functions now if I want to
make a function in Python I use the word
death and I'll just say Lam I okay and
I'll say print name okay like that in
PHP was a function
Who am I name and print name okay
now if I stick take it a step further
one thing the piece P needs is keyword
arguments so what if I had age I would
say H equals none I can do this I can
say Who am I
age equals 25 name equals test now
perhaps that's a bad example all I did
was flip them around the point is being
that you can call items in the order
that they're specified like this so test
would represent name and if you wanted
to do a keyword argument like let's say
I had another one gender is none I could
say gender equals male and you know you
can you can skip arguments a lot easier
in here if I did age gender I'll just do
false for defaults
I would have to say um
ami and test false mail not really a big
deal but once in a while you'll get into
situations you're gonna be like wow I
really want keyword arguments especially
if these got really long and it's a
function you want to use okay so let me
scroll down a little ways the types are
a little bit different so with Python
let me just make something called L
equals this and I'll say 1 2 3 K and
what is this this is a list PHP doesn't
have these the thing in PHP you
represent would be a equals array 1 2 3
or if you're doing if a new way you
would do a e equals 1 2 3 and I really
like the new way that's in a 5.4 and
above and then we have dictionaries so
I'll say D equals and we use the curly
braces I'll make a new line so it's
easier to read this looks just like JSON
code I'll say name equals head age
equals 25 and PHP we'd say D equals I'll
use the shorthand syntax whoops
name equals arrow head age equals zero
25 so essentially it's pretty close to
the same thing you know you have numbers
and those are the same you know
Namie equals five and PHP be num equals
five another thing would be chopping up
your arrays and strings so if I had us
I'll just say dog equals Betsy and if I
wanted to get a part of dog I could say
let's say I want to reverse the string I
can just do negative 1 and that will
spell Betsy backwards so it'd be like
that
whoops if I wanted to just get a little
piece of it I could say dog what point
do I want to start it if I start at 1
and go to 3 so 1 3 it would be e it's
like that it's really easy to manipulate
a string that way in PHP to do that I
could have dog equals Betsy and I could
do string reverse of dog and that will
give me the reverse thing there is also
a reverse inside of Python like that but
it's a lot easier just to get used to
these colons in the brackets if I wanted
to get a portion of the string I could
do a string I could do a substring of I
always forget the needle in the haystack
that's what frustrates me I'm just going
to guess off the top of my head and I'd
say 1 2 3 if this is in the right order
sometimes it's the haystack comes last I
always have to look at the docs if I
don't have a pop up bugs me so but
beside that that's not a big deal it's
pretty nice we're dealing with arrays
and lists like let's say I have a l
equals 1 2 3 once again and let's just
type it out again l equals 1 2 3 in PHP
remember that's 5.4 and up if I want to
grab a section I would say L 1 that will
give me the second value because 0 1 ok
if I wanted values 1 &amp;amp; 2 I would have to
do something like array shift L l equals
um that would be to pop off like the 3 I
think I always get pop and shift mixed
up all the time something like that K
this isn't like totally perfect in
Python what I would do is I would say L
the place I want to get it would be 1 to
mimic this to get that place and this
one would give me that value to get the
first two values I could say L 0 to 1
that will give me 0 &amp;amp; 1
I know there's like a ray splice that
you can also use L equals array splice L
and a bunch of array functions that you
got to memorize but I feel like all
these underscore array functions there's
a lot of them I wish you could just
import an array item look at all those
like PHP should have something like
import or sorry in PHP be use system
slash array and then you'd say splice
split you know what I mean or you could
just use the namespace
because it's all wonky but that's a
personal preference classes are pretty
close to each other so in Python to make
a class I'll make one called dog and
I'll make a definition called bark and
print ARF
now in classes was after reference
itself because this definition of
references is the class dog here and
inside PHP we would say class dog and
public function bark and print
ARF okay so you can see it's a bit
simpler it's just tabbed over instead of
using the braces and in Sutton
you know you might hate it first you
might start to like it I don't know I
think both ways are pretty decent I do
like the Java language and PHP is pretty
close to that with this you know to make
a variable up here you could say public
name up here you could say name equals
Jesse or something like that
looping in Python is a little better in
my opinion at least I think so so we
have a for I equals 1 I is less than 10
I plus plus echo I write in Python I'll
say for I in range of 10 print I and
what range does range is the exact same
things if I were to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10
there's just a function to make it
easier and interesting range can also
take steps so I could do comma 2 and it
would print 2 4 6 8 10 rather than
having to say do a modulus and say if
I % 2 equals 0
echo I like that sorry for the tone in
my voice I'll assign it sounds a little
sarcastic I really do like PHP so I'm
not trying to diss it at all it's not
it's not really a language war I just
want to show you the comparison of a
couple of things so the difference is
that in this loop this has to be an
iterable item and by default a list is
iterable but if you had a dictionary
such as this d let me copy this down
here you'd have to be like for I in D
print I but sometimes you have to do
something like it are items or enter
values if you want to get the key Val
similar to that but in PHP before each
something as key value echo key ethical
value so it's pretty close sometimes you
can enumerate like that let me delete
that
but I guess what I like a lot about
Python is if you want to use something
others import things I need write or I
could do it this way
however you like to do it in PHP
everything's accessible which you know
isn't a big deal but it would seem to me
that it's just saving a lot of resources
by not using what you don't need so this
is just kind of a summary of the
language I will say I don't like Ruby
Ruby's a little bit like Python but it
has a lot of funny things to it and I'm
not really interested in Ruby at all but
when you get into a big project and you
really start looking at the code if
something's a badge a bad Python
programmer it looks a lot better than a
bad PHP programmer I think pythons more
readable just probably cuz it has less
characters when you use a framework like
say an MVC framework like laravel or
CodeIgniter
those are very nice frameworks and easy
to use but when you use Python Django
it's actually got a really hard learning
curve it's very difficult but it's also
very clean when you look at flask and
tornado and Python those are also really
nice and one thing that's really nice on
this is it has method decorators as
method decorator and you can do those to
just and these can do custom things
method decorators which are cool those
do not exist in PHP yet
and I don't know if they will but this
video is getting a bit long I hope this
gives you an idea of kind of a little
bit of the differences they're close but
hey if you learn one language you can
learn the other because you know they
all share common things so thanks for
watching dudes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
