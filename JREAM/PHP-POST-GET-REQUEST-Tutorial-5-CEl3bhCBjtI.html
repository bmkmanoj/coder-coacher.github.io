be getting a little bored I know I do
when I am studying something that I
can't really make a whole lot out of so
now we're going to work on the post get
and request and these deal with user
interaction so the first thing we're
going to want to do is end our PHP
script and create a form this is just
basic HTML and for the action we're just
going to do index dot PHP and the method
is going to be post the first thing we
will do is learn how to post now I know
I did this in tutorial 1 but I'll try to
help you understand better let's do an
input type equals text name equals name
and we'll do a let's just say a message
and for this one we'll do a text area
and lastly we'll need a submit button
input type equals submit value equals
send message now this isn't actually
going to send a message yet because we I
don't want to go too far into that but
I'll show you what a post does post
grabs a value from a form so once again
we'll change this variable and say check
ok so when we click this and you look at
our URL we have question check after and
this is what you call a get variable
which or you can get it so do get it has
no value though so let's say check
equals 1 get check
okay whoops and you see we can echo
things from the URL quit string and if
we want to put more values in there you
might do something like and amp now
normally it's any variable after the
question mark is an ampersand but to
make it valid I'm typing and amp valid
HTML and let's do just say I guess age
okay okay and so we'll submit that
undefined index age there we go so we
can take these URL parameters and pop
them into the page those are using get
now you can also use request actually I
didn't mention this but notice the
underscore before it that means it's a
super global anyways request it does the
same thing now request is a little
interesting because request is like post
and get combined it can do either/or so
if we I'll try to show you let's just
make sure that this form is being
checked so if get check equals one then
we'll process our form the reason we
want to do this is because if someone
lands on the page here we'll get
undefined index after we post it and you
can see we have one here so what we want
to do is if is set get check
okay there's the warning message gone
away and what we want to do now is post
the forum and we can do post and the
name is name now you'll notice these
brackets look pretty familiar when
you're working with an array because it
is an array and then we'll do post
message okay so we'll echo the name and
the message there it is now what if we
put request for this it does the same
thing because request behaves is both
get and post so I suppose it's up to you
request seems kind of like a fallback if
you're not totally sure which one to use
maybe most the time i use request when
I'm getting a URL parameter now things
to consider
what if someone typed in Jessie bold hey
see it puts in the HTML so there's a
couple of functions you can do uh one is
strip tags I think it's like that off
the top of my head there we go and that
gets rid of the HTML there's also one
called
HTML entities and that will turn that
HTML entities maybe there's no
underscore
there we go HTML entities and that will
print it out as the HTML entity code
which is I'm not sure why that's doing
that ill just print that out well I
suppose this is uh there wasn't as much
to cover as I thought so you can play
around with that a little bit and get
good at making forms one thing to always
remember is the user data should never
be trusted and that's nothing personal
against the user it's just for your
software's own well-being perhaps I'll
go into that a little later but we
haven't dealt with storing data or
anything so it's probably not necessary
right now all right good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
