quick rundown of Adobe edge which is a
new application by Adobe and I'm using
preview 3 and you can get a free
download like it and what this does is
it's kind of like flash but it publishes
thing in html5 css3 and JavaScript and
from what I can tell it uses jQuery for
its back-end their efforts plug-in for
the little JavaScript system and I'll
give you a little demo on something we
could create with this so I'll go ahead
and create a new file and a quick
overview of this GUI I mean it's not
anything complex we have our main
workspace here on the Left we have
properties for whatever items selected
so I only have this stage right now so
you know you can just select this stage
so if I were to make a square I get all
my little options here and there's a lot
of time dick and harry to mess around
with there if you'd like and to the
right is just kind of like a layers
panel in a way and notice how you might
not be able to read this it says div
these are actual HTML elements and
because it publishes those asset and at
the bottom is a timeline if you if
you've ever used flash it's pretty
similar to it where you have keyframes
and I think most animation uses
keyframes or all of it and this little
red guy here this will automatically
create keyframes when you move objects
which is really convenient so what I've
done is I created two images I'm going
to create a little demonstration and I'm
gonna go to file import and the first
thing I'll put in is the background I
made and I made this 300 pixels high in
Photoshop so that would fit my little
workspace here it's about twelve hundred
wide and what I want to do is make this
move left to right so it looks like
clouds are moving and I know it's not
look a little cheap but you gotta have
mercy on me so when you import this it
looks like nothing happened down here
and for right now what I can tell you
can just drag it and
right there it'll appear right on your
timeline so I'll put him back there so
this is where I want him to start and I
want him to go to about five seconds to
move from left to right so I'll zoom out
and although - ten seconds
I'm gonna drive this white ticker over
to ten seconds
and since I had this auto-keyframe
checked if I drag this guy over I'll
automatically create this keyframe here
since that's where my selections at and
I'll just move him to the right okay
so if I go back and I could just play it
you see we'll have moving clouds I'm
also going to import a little piece of
text just to make it a little more
interesting called
hey guys and what I want him to do is
just to kind of come from above the
screen and then just kind of come down
so I moved him already he made the key
frames and I'm gonna drag him over here
and he'll come in right here I think
I'll do it for five seconds actually so
I gotta drag that over looks cool so if
I play I'll say hey guys so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna publish this for
the web so file save as I'll just save
it it's word test let's look at what
Adobe gives us they give us our HTML CSS
some JavaScript I believe this
JavaScript applies to our project and
this one as well and the includes they
have a jQuery included jQuery ease in
plugin and not sure what those are just
yet edge and images anything that we
included so bills projects nice 2/4 and
let me open this up in a browser
okay we have this that says hey guys now
if you right-click this is html5 which
is pretty incredible if I view the page
source it's using this div here and all
that junk in there and you see how when
i refresh this this looks kind of funny
like I want it to stay in one box
I would probably set my stage overflow
to hidden and that's like a HTML
property and you can also do a bunch of
actions on things so let's say I have my
little hey guys here and I wanted to add
some script to this little script icon
by there and they give you some options
how about when we click him we can do
actual JavaScript code and to keep it
simple for this introduction one outside
word you click hey guys okay and I will
say file save as HTML and rear Enders
everything and let's refresh and see how
this is proportioned inside that div now
and I'll click him it says you clicked
hey guys pretty cool intro so I think
this looks kind of promising I think it
needs a lot more features obviously
they've just given us a preview and this
has got my whistle wet because this is
really cool and I'm not gonna use it
just yet until like more features come
out but it's pretty interesting and the
way it compiles it doesn't look too bad
not too many files to scare you away it
just has the includes folder and then
stuff in here and the other one let's
see I'd like to know where my alert
happens I guess I'll try
no wonder if it compiles it oh here it
is
so it builds that for us cool okay oh I
hope you guys found this interesting and
download it and check it out thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
