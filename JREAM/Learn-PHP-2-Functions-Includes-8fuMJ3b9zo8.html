over just some basics of variables
strings quotes and a little bit on a
raise and we made a form and this one
it's going to be a little more fun and
useful we're going to work on functions
and includes so just start with the
index.php file and start your PHP tags
and create a going to function is
basically to reuse something over and
over so here's a very simple example
let's say wanted to echo 1 okay if we
wanted to repeat this five times you
could do that now with a function you
started out with the word function and
you give it a name so for example let's
just call this make numbers okay and
then the function named after that you
put these little i forgot what they're
called anyways after that you do the
little curly braces and everything
within the function is inside these two
curly braces you can see they're
highlighted now so let's make some
numbers um we'll just do echo 1 dot BR
i'm just adding this to make a new line
okay and you'll notice this does nothing
so what we do is we type make numbers
and it will make one now you could just
make numbers over and over and over or
you could even do a loop with a function
but I'm not going to cover loops just
yet so let's say you want to you have a
bunch of pages and you want to include a
bunch of functions
first thing I do is I'd create a new
file and I would call it functions PHP
okay and we would take this function
here and we would paste it into here
okay now you're going to notice this has
a problem because it doesn't know
anything about the function so you can
do include functions.php and that gives
us access to this file and the function
within it and there it is it echoes one
instead of include you can also do
require once which is what I use most
the time basically it means that it can
only be included one time this is
probably the safest bet to avoid
conflict because if you do include
functions twice on accident it's
thinking that you're trying to read
Eclair this function twice so I would
just use require once so since we have
this what if we wanted to make a number
and add five to it okay the way we pass
arguments inside of a function is we set
it up here between these little of
parentheses and you just give it a
variable name and let's just call it
number okay make numbers number this
doesn't do anything right now so let's
just say echo number just to make it
simple at first now you'll notice right
here says make numbers if we leave a
blank it's going to say missing an
argument
because we have an argument right here
so an make numbers just put the number
six and it returns six easy enough you
can add the number like this let's say
number plus 5 and that gives us 11 now
what if we want um a default value so
that when there's nothing in here it'll
still print something you can do number
equals zero so if nothing said it's
going to default to zero and it should
output five now there's going to be
instances when you don't want to echo
something out and what you can do is
return so we can do return number now
this is a little bit different because
when you return something you can only
do a one time at a function and when we
call this let's just say five it's going
to do nothing it actually did do
something in the background but we just
can't see it so if you're monkeying with
return values you can do echo make
numbers it'll echo it or what you'll
often do a lot is say assign it to a
variable so now we have this function
assigned to value in whatever this
returns right here it's going to be
stored and value so you can do echo
value and it equals 10 again you can
still play with it and do echo value
plus 5 pretty cool
now with functions there are some things
to be aware of that there are reserved
keywords like function list that's
actually a function in PHP so you can't
use that most the time you'll be pretty
good if you just use camel case like
this make something so really what good
is a function on a bigger scope it might
be kind of hard to give you an example
and I'll try so let's imagine we have an
index page which is this one a people
page and about page and the company page
what we do is we just require once
inside of each of these pages and then
we have all these functions in this file
available to those pages so rather than
having to redefine everything we can
just reuse them inside a bunch of pages
there's a lot more to functions than
just making numbers let's see for
example a little dice roller okay
function roll okay here we have this
let's allow the user to set how many
dices are on the face of the dice so put
a variable in their faces and by default
it's going to equal six okay unless they
set it so let's get rid of this will say
roll okay and let's see since there's
well I don't know much about dice
is I'm I guess they go above the number
six but let's just pretend brand 126 so
there's a will echo a random number 126
okay and we get five four three two ok
now let's implement faces inside the
random number now this will roll a
random number one through six if
nothing's defined if something is
defined like 24 it will roll a random
number 12 24 as you can see well I think
that's a pretty decent start on some
functions and includes play around with
that a little bit and i'll make another
tutorial in a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
