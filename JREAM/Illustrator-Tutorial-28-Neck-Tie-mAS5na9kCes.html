we're going to make a tie just something
pretty easy so let me just make a new
document with it I'll just say a by 11
okay and it'll be just a real simple
little Thai let me grab this over here
let's make a square and flip it and with
the pen tool i will delete the top
anchor point so we have this and for the
thai piece um that one's also kind of
going to be a triangle so I'm just going
to alt drag this down and I guess what
I'll do is add an anchor point right in
the middle and I'll drag this up to here
and i'll just select this point and move
it in okay and this won't be the
fanciest I but we'll try to make it work
ok now I'm going to make it a prior
brown and red tie so I'll just get rid
of this and brown now i'm gonna i think
i'll do a gradient with these actually
oh there we go and let's add a warp
effect to this let's see a mark preview
and we'll just kind of make it look a
little chubbier or this one actually
look kind of cool now I'll just go to
object expand a pair
is okay and let's see what that does for
this piece that doesn't really look good
and I'm just going to draw inside with
the little thing here now we're drawing
inside it and I'll make a little slice
and this is going to be the stripe
whoops i lost my spot there we go whoops
and the stripes I want to roll hype if
we do the arc for these yeah that might
be cool and I'll just drag this up here
and up here and make this one a little
thinner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
