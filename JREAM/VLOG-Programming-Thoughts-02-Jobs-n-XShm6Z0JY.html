talk about jobs since it was requested
in a previous video so I'm an American I
live in Florida and I can really only
speak for what I know so I can't talk
about Europe China India or anything
like that but I will tell you what it's
like in America to get a job and what
it's like you may be surprised that it's
not that difficult to be successful
depending on your definition of success
so the first thing is your you shouldn't
look at it as a job what you're aiming
for what you're aiming for is a career
whether that be you're at a job for a
year let's say and you move okay
yes that was a job but you're in the
same industry which is software
development whatever you like to call it
so you just you know it's like one job
and then you move to another job in the
same category this is a career in your
career spans you know what you do
obviously that's not the same if you
played football because you know there's
only one NFL but there's tons of
companies that do it to build software
so that that's a good mindset to have
it's not just a job you're working on a
career for yourself
now the company types I've been to one
is a startup
then there's corporate and there's also
one in the middle so here's startup
corporate and there's like one in the
middle I don't know what it's called
kind of casual small business maybe and
I'd say my favorite are startups because
people are excited they're usually a lot
more cutting-edge if you're into really
adapting and depending on the startup it
could be a lot more pressure though so
it might not be your best
pick it could be a lot more work to but
the same could be said about corporate
jobs where you're basically a code
machine and they overwork you it just
really depends on the company
I've also worked remotely in freelance
it's I love I love remote work I there's
a lot of remote jobs in the USA
sometimes they're kind of hard to find
the here's an interesting thing is I had
a job making a lot more money than I do
now and I'm calling it a job but you
know this whole thing's a career what I
do with my time
I made a lot more money but I was so
busy that I never had time to really
enjoy life and so I went back and I
dropped a significant amount of income
just to be happier with life so your
career or job isn't all about money when
you think of it you have to say okay
what are my basic needs all right you
know home do you plan to have a family
and all that what do you like to do you
know what are your needs it's you don't
go to an employer and say this is what I
want you say this is what I need if you
come to negotiation or anything now when
you do the interview with wherever it's
going to be a toss-up wherever you go I
think people make too much fuss about a
dress code the only reason you should
over dress you probably shouldn't even
be watching this video if you're that
high up is if you're going for like a
you're overseeing a hundred people or
you're like a senior manager or over
everyone I've never seen someone come in
in a suit I think only once and now it's
just for a regular position
and he knows who he is but hey it was
good of them you know because the thing
that's important is is I've sat in a lot
of interviews too and I've had a weigh
in on my opinion I'm not saying I'm some
man with a lot of authority by the way
but it doesn't matter how someone
dresses to me it matters what comes out
of their mouth and if they're cool you
know
you know you what's a company looking
for they're looking for someone a they
can do the job and be that they can get
along with it's that simple
they're not looking for someone to show
and tell what kind of clothes they have
so in a programmer position interview
let's say sometimes they'll give you a
quiz sometimes they don't it just
depends on the company if you have a if
you want if you're doing graphics let's
say you'd probably just have to have a
portfolio because you can do a quiz on
graphics really if you're doing
programming they might do some logic
quizzes and stuff and those are always
kind of fun I usually fail but it's not
a big deal if you fail because they want
to know your line of thinking you're how
are you problem solving the equation if
they don't give you the time to sit
there and talk with you and ask so what
were you thinking while you were working
on this it's not worth your time because
they're just impatient people you see
you need to like the place you're gonna
work for and they need to like you it's
kind of like a date or maybe a long-term
or short-term marriage except you're
getting paid to go there you really need
to like where you're gonna work and have
a good vibe about it if you just look at
the money it's not worth it I promise
you if you think wow this place really
sucks and you know they're kind of rude
and strict and they work your really
hard to death
but they pay so well you're gonna end up
probably regretting it unless that's
your only option
you know because we all come to time in
life or hey we're in a pinch we need
whatever we can get but if I was you I
would try to find a company where you
feel like you got to meet the people
you'd work with you got to meet the
person that's over you because there's
always someone over you and there should
be a connection you know you should be
able to get along for me I like to be
able to laugh with people and tell jokes
that's how I feel comfortable around
people for you it might not be the same
it might just be like getting in a deep
intellectual conversation or something
you want to work with people that are
like-minded and kind of your
personalities complement each other and
you know as we sit in our rooms or
whatever we do behind these big screens
it's kind of hard to say well what am I
like well you'll know you know when you
like someone or get along with someone
it's not too complex don't don't make a
big deal about the dress code the
interview the quizzes it's probably hard
at first it was for me I I went to one
interview I was freelancing for a couple
years and then I went to an interview
and it was for a twenty dollar an hour
job and I mean I was having my heart was
racing so fast and my voice was shaking
in the interview I was really early 20s
I was pretty scared I don't know why
I've been a timid fellow a lot of life
but the more you do it you go through it
you get better at it that whole process
gets a lot easier it trust me it does so
so don't worry if you fail the first
time you feel like you did a terrible
job so what the worst thing you can do
is give up so you just do another
interview and it gets easier and then
you get used to it and that's just how
it goes especially if you're confident
in your skills once you start getting a
lot of skills without getting cocky
because someone can show you up real
quick when they're really smart if
you're confident in your skills that's
just going to show in the way you talk
and how you interviewing
explain stuff because that's really the
best quality you can have to prove to
them hey I'm your man or I'm your woman
is it you have some pretty good skills
and some background you will learn on
the job if you're not the job is a waste
of time that's how I see it every time
if you're not learning anything on the
job or you're not exercising something
and getting better at it it's just not
worth it because technology moves fast
but if you're working on something
that's so legacy like 10 years old boy
it's it just sucks the life out of you
you know because I remember I was
working in one place of course I don't
name the companies and we worked on OS
commerce I don't know what version it
was and it was the absolute worst time
in my life I quit after I think two
months or three months because it was so
mind-numbingly stupid they also forced
me to use an Apple computer which I
protested against because I don't like
using Apple computers and it was just
weird for me to use everything yeah
that's three months finally they got me
a VMware parallels on there and I was
using Windows at the time but I was
still doing the same code and it was
just a disaster so if you do know what
you're doing I would ask so what are you
working on what are you trying to
accomplish and what are you are you
using any framework of some sort you
know if they're using a framework and
you don't know it say you're willing to
learn it and it sounds kind of cool if
you think it does there's no reason to
lie in an interview if they don't use a
framework say are you following any
standards you know most languages have a
standard even Airbnb they have a github
repository about JavaScript standards
which is really cool
probably not a lot of companies use that
but there's some form of standard you
know like a global standard for PHP is
obviously is that called PHP fig and
then pythons pepp eight I'm sure Java is
kind of well-known you know the way you
camelcase and do all that stuff just
with the way you name stuff and organize
files called things certain names and
that's good stuff I would also ask about
like do you do code reviews do you use
git github and he get anything or if
they use mercurial don't know how to say
that it's pretty much the same as good
it just isn't as good you wouldn't have
a problem using it and for anybody I
would always suggest use and get no
matter what it's really lineage Torvalds
brilliant man and all the contributors
to get brilliant brilliant really
dominated SVN so lastly coming to
finding jobs finding jobs the one of a
really good place is to go on LinkedIn
build up your resume your tell about
yourself and well it's not a real resume
it's just like a profile heck most jobs
I've gone to they don't really look at
the real resume they just kind of glance
it over then they want to see what I've
made you know or know where what I've
worked on or something like that but you
know go on LinkedIn add recruiters ok
because the tech industry is hot it's
hot and there are not enough programmers
designers either or skilled people
enough skilled people for jobs there's
too many jobs and you might not even
believe that but every place is it's
ridiculous
I've seen it so much we're just there's
not enough people for placement or the
people that apply their skills are like
from there they're from 1995 so you know
that's why you want to keep up with your
skills so LinkedIn adding recruiters and
connections and people with common
interests is really really good if
you're a social person a meetup group
because the best way to get a job or a
client is to network with other people
say well I know a guy that knows this
and trust me that's the best way that's
that's how I've helped people get jobs
but I can't remember if someone's helped
me get a job that way and I know there's
all those job listing sites for me I
haven't had a lot of luck on like career
builder or monster I did search on
Craigslist a few times and some of those
four gigs yes for good-paying jobs
mediocre it just depends on your
location and what you see finding a job
is not hard once you get to chop the
ball rolling you just make more
connections and more connections and get
to know recruiters they will get
annoying
probably because recruiters the they've
got a job for everything and there's
also announced a lot of sites coming out
for remote development so if you're
comfortable talking like on a webcam to
do meetings you know it's the new
hotness I work from home four days a
week and I go into the office on Fridays
the reason is because I work for the
French if I didn't mention that at the
start I forgot and they're very nice
people
very not American put in your time
punching your punch in their beep beep
you know your little card to put counter
they're not as a corporate America you
know and that's not what I ever want to
be I I don't want to dress up you know
look at the most successful social
network in the world Facebook Mark
Zuckerberg wears like a t-shirt every
day you know cuz then he doesn't have to
think about trying to look pretty to
look professional again it depends on
where you go and it depends on your
personality me I don't want to impress
people with my appearance I just want to
work on something that I love if you
want to impress people on your
appearance that's fine I don't know if
programming would be the best career
because after your program awhile you're
gonna start to roll one of these things
on your face so lastly sorry I said
lastly for finding jobs but never sell
yourself short I know I've talked about
that in an old video people do it way
too much but if you're just getting your
feet in the water
sell yourself as short as you want just
get some experience and start climbing
that ladder to success and don't worry
about a college degree it's all about
skill I promise
what was I gonna say lastly salaries so
that's the part where it comes in are
you new or are you been around the block
if you've been around the block
feel free to negotiate whatever you want
you might not get it but it's always
good to try it means you're confident in
your skills obviously do your research
and don't ask too much and don't ask too
little obviously so in Florida a PHP
developer that has a lot of skill a good
pay grade is about 70 that is pretty
pretty good in fact $70,000 a year is a
good salary for happiness because when
you go over that it success and you'll
realize that's more than I probably need
in life unless
who want to live very wildly once you
get to my old age or if you're older you
realize that you don't need all the
money in the world you want a job that
you're happy at I don't want to work at
a job I'm unhappy at making tons of
money I know it sounds crazy but that's
I don't get it
I'd rather be happy so like the highest
paying jobs right now or at least they
used to be were like mobile development
those still pay pretty well if you can
do cross-platform especially you're
looking in the six figures Python pays
quite well ruby pays quite well
depending on your level of course if I
said like say a senior developer in a
Python you're probably looking around
the hundreds but same with Ruby but
they're harder to find PHP it's all over
the place I'd say a safe bet for a
beginner and PHP would be 45 to 55 k
once you have some experience and you've
been doing it for a few years and then
once you move up a good mid middle level
is around 70s and then what other
language Java pays a lot if you're high
up I don't even know where to go with
that
what other things pay pretty well
it also depends on your company just
because you might read a chart never do
this never print out a chart of the pay
rates of just some statistics around
your area and bring it to wherever
you're going and said I want this pay
grade because this is the average around
here don't do that because each company
is run by someone that took a risk and
they're trying to make their company
succeed and just demanding more money
based on what everyone else gets is a
silly idea you want they want to feel
like you want to be part of their team
and you're not just there to you know
try to get as much money you can by
sitting in the chair and just doing your
work with your head down so yeah I'd say
you should never write any code in
America for 30,000 a year unless you are
a very very beginner and you you maybe
you only do some HTML and CSS and that's
it that's like a 30k job I would think
but when you get in an actual code
designers can make pretty good money
depending on what the company thinks
your skill level I can't say a lot for
designers but the skill level really
makes a difference based on where you go
it's it's all over the map but for
programming it's kind of there's kind of
a normal that you'll find and don't work
too hard work smart not hard so my
advice is basically in summary it's just
chill and if you're in a comfortable
place right now you know I didn't move
out till I was embarrassingly old a lot
like lenez Torvalds but I am no Linna
star else he's the guy that made Linux
by the way the Linux kernel
you know take your time and make a plan
and move up from there if you're if
you're in a rush I understand you got to
do what you got to do and I wish the
best for you guys just keep sharpening
your skills you know you come into
programming with just a wooden stick and
what you got to do is just keep
sharpening that that's your brain you
know until it becomes a sharp blade you
know you can make a little wooden stick
into a sword that becomes pretty sharp
all right guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
