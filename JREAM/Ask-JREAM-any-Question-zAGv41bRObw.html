see how this goes
haven't used xsplit broadcaster before
okay
and live okay and then I will share the
virtual machine here if I do get any
questions I have a monitor over here and
then somehow there's a way to join this
chat let me turn I turn this slow motion
off
I'm not sure the best time to do this
but we will get going in a moment
okay
and that's all set up set up set up and
now those chanting slow motion so what I
want to do is anyone can ask any
questions
I wish sure as let me type it in here
anyone can ask any questions they have
old wise also I am if that's how you say
your name and I'm trying to turn the
slow chat off this is my first time
stream options let's see so what I have
is a virtual machine running here and if
anyone has cold questions I'll do my
best to answer them or in questions in
general so at the moment I would just
there's a chat not just I'm not too
familiar with YouTube chat I know it's
been a while since I've been down here
feel free to really ask anything if you
are stuck on anything it'd be fun to go
through something might even turn into a
little tutorial kind of hopefully I can
be heard okay so
that did it uh it's a car basic info is
it advanced settings
yeah cause right now it has a slow mode
on in the chat and it only allows like
every oh there it is
Save Changes slow mode should be off
there we go
good good good I guess you know we don't
have many people here I'm just gonna
dive in and start playing with some code
so my favorite editor has become Visual
Studio code
I do love pycharm the JetBrains products
but Visual Studio code is just it does
everything for me and what I'm gonna do
let's see I think I'm gonna play with
some Xmas script me exit T MUX so pc d
dev so I made a dev repository and what
I do is that anything I practice I just
make sub repositories in here and then I
just pull everything from here and just
because I have stuff like c-sharp and
Android it doesn't mean I'm a master at
it at all and we move this over here
okay
so I'm going to go into dev j/s okay
played with a lot of type scripting
stuff in here
and I'm gonna make a new folder I
haven't called es6 I'll call it es6
youtube es6 youtube and i'm going to
copy an es lint file oops
oh la okay and then I'll just type code
to open this folder here and close this
guy out
so here's es6 YouTube and we just have a
es lint rcj son I'm using nvm for node
version management so if I type nvm it's
been on a version 0.38 a while so I can
tell you note - - version and I'm using
8 9 - that's the latest long-term
support 1 at the moment and what I want
to do in this folder is just in it npm
in it and then - why to create it and
then i want to install some things
because i love
es lint so npm I and I'll just do with a
capital D to save to dev and I'm gonna
do yes lint yes lint
I think it's plugging in forked make
sure I get those right I was using the
not bash terminal but zsh it just ran a
little bit slow for me okay those are
good and I'll need so I'm gonna be doing
node so development
yes lint config yes lint and yes
lint oh there's one called Airbnb config
Airbnb base I hope I got it right okay
so in my package a son I have those guys
there and also in my extensions of vs
code if I look for ESL for es Lin I had
this installed the main es lint package
and I just love this thing I'll press
ctrl comma to go to my settings
and if I go down a little ways you can
actually look for yes length once you
have it installed have it enabled I need
some more real estate here okay and it's
a little bit down here so what I have is
okay it's enabled and then editor format
unsaved now this can also apply it looks
like prettier might be interfering with
this there's a prettier plugin so I'm
just gonna make sure I disable that okay
so the first thing also one other good
package quote coca Jas definitely get
this I don't even really need to install
much es lint if I just play with coca
okay so I might be wasting my time with
that I'm gonna do ctrl shift P type oka
and I can do a new JavaScript or
typescript file I'll do JavaScript and
in here okay it's using my latest note
and what we can do is just try stuff out
so if you're using vs code I'll just
make a comment let me increase my font
size sorry
oh that's pretty big
let's make this beast fullscreen so yes
vs code and you want to get polka that's
what I'm using here and then ctrl +
Shift + p new javascript file if you had
node installed you should use node 7.5
and above in my opinion because that's
where you get the features of a weight
and a sync server side and that's
awesome so I'm just gonna go through
let's see can you do a video on shape
shift API shape shift API let me just
check a second I've never heard of that
okay Oh crypto crypto currencies oh boy
hey here's the funny thing I have look
at it I got this mining ether room in
the background on and was on Web
Services
I'm just trying that out let me see what
this is real quick shape-shift
mr. crypto Chan is what is this based on
shape-shift is it let me see about is
that a certain cryptocurrency or is
another one let's see
select Bitcoin as an input or input and
ether as the output I guess I could
watch it it's only a minute
let's do a better kind -
let's say you ate corn anyone out here
to terms this is ver yes okay I get here
I get the gist of it they must be taking
some kind of a little fee because it's
just very convenient but see if it's
worth it let's see
so it has get requests post requests so
what's this API tools I like to see
everything they have because oftentimes
I'll jump into something and just waste
a lot of time what's good about this is
it's always good to practice REST API so
a skeleton oh yes you can they give you
a skeleton if do it straight from your
site that's pretty neat I don't have
bitcoins and my coins myself to play
with hey Bob
New Zealand ah what time is it there oh
let's see
can you please describe a comparative
discussion PHP in first Java verse path
on first net well that that's uh that's
a big one
so the shape shift API let me just cover
this crypto Chan if you're trying to use
this like I would definitely get this
skeleton to start with and if I look at
the API I just want to see
okay so you constantly get a rate there
3:30 p.m. yes sir I am Alive I know it's
it's been a while it's been quite a
while I don't know if people probably
forgot about me it's okay oh this is
this is pretty nice this is a boy yeah
I'd have to do a different video
probably on like if I were to build this
out so obviously I won't be able to
answer everyone I was gonna play with
some things here but let me just do a
little breakdown so I'm gonna make a new
file and I'll say compared heck I'll do
type or it might be a little better to
compare code so I do like that question
cold comparisons type ORS right now it's
free I use this as my markdown editor no
folder open maybe I'll just make a new
file wherever it is oh react we could
compare a lot of things let me jump to
Nyame and I'm sorry for saying your name
our own PHP vs. oops
Java burst - versus net so and then
let's see the gentleman's name that I
can't pronounce
I guess yeah I can't say that there's
react
there's view and then there's angular
5.1 or two is out I am using gnome 3 and
if I was able hey cook how do you say
that sorry
Kamal whatever mine eat my name
highlight it that's cool okay so I mean
uh gnome 3 I played with a Ella bun -
qaboun to elementary our clinics budgie
EXO bun - cinnamon and mate and still
this one is my favorite this is a really
easy question so I'll answer it real
quick what Bob had asked the OS is a bun
- 1710 I actually have a whole bunch of
virtual machines installed here that you
probably can't see on the sidebar but
I'll just go to tweak I'd say my second
favorite would be cinnamon if I were to
not use no my extensions real quick this
is the one I like - to panel because I
come from windows I'm not ashamed to say
it but I'm still pretty comfortable in
it and that's how I have this up here
which you can customize pretty good the
docker integration so that you're where
your wired connections or wherever that
thing appears
isn't all crazy nothing too fancy though
and then you know a top panel scroll
real nice
if I do I'll let me see system there it
is about just to show you okay so here
it is this is a virtual machine just so
you know so you know that's why it's
seven point eight gigs just should be
seventy gigs hard drive oh yeah that's
it and I'm not the theme because people
will be asking this I guarantee at some
point
Oh angular who angular is I was doing
that for a bit now if you're talking
about angular one that is pretty easy it
makes sense
angular 2 to 5 I mean it gets pretty
crazy now let me answer this guy's
question his name was and I am and I am
and he was one of the first guys here so
I just want to insert a table so we have
I think four columns big for strong
unity next to LTS yeah um I'm not a fan
of unity very much but the default 1710
looks a lot like unity it just runs
really smooth you should you should try
cinnamon also you might like it
I'm not a big fan of elementary Python
and net so as far as my Ann's question
goes I'm covering this one that I want
to jump down to this guy
just want books this one's not too hard
so PHP I guess it's it's going to come
down to a lot of factors I suppose I'll
add another row in here here and
I'll just call this metric all right so
let's make this big so type the metric
like the type of what it does PHP is
interpreted is that the right work the
Java uses a Java Virtual Machine it's
compiled down to dot o should I forgot I
was just doing it the other day I'll
just say JVM for now Python you can turn
off pipe pyc files but it compiles down
to bike tote and dotnet compiles to DLLs
as far as I know I don't do done that
speed speed really differs on what
you're doing it's not just like one
thing fits almost people like let's say
requests a second I'm pretty sure that
net is number one last I checked I would
say of these four I'm pretty sure Python
is probably the last between PHP and
Java one or two I don't know which one
is faster
PHP seven point X is pretty much as fast
as hip-hop virtual machines so there's
no need for that
symphonie Ajax with Symphony hmm I
didn't
why would you be using a symphony
I don't like Laura valores that may be
job related Symphony is very good just
so you know the syntax this PHP you know
you guys know how most people know how
PHP is I would say I don't know trick
mode is like Java and don't kill me for
saying that
don't worry I'll get to your question I
see them guys JVM Java by the way Kotlin
is easier and it's even promoted by
Google okay so if you play with Java
Kotlin is amazing because you can
transcode you can transform from Kotlin
to java back and forth save a lot of
time you need to specify oh sorry
yeah because active server pages versus
dotnet could be an application and then
Python you know it's just tapped out
SP most people would be using c-sharp I
don't think anyone should ever use
Visual Basic anymore
and c-sharp is a pretty sexy language if
you use an IDE with it very good as far
as I mean we don't even have no mention
in here like if we're just looking at
all these from a language perspective or
a web perspective like this would be a
web perspective here request a second
now I know Microsoft did make the dotnet
I believe core open-source recently
which you know I'm not a Microsoft like
a huge fan of them but they've been
doing some pretty sweet stuff lately
okay open source and a lot of things and
promoting them also some of their
hardware which I normally wouldn't be
too impressed by I guess I mean if
you're looking at these PHP is it worth
learning yes Java yes but slowly because
it's in my opinion I'd say it's the
number two hardest on here Python
this one's debatable maybe the reason is
it's harder to find work but in my
opinion it's one of the funnest
languages to work and
a SP yes
slowly number one this so if you're
looking at this asp.net and C sharp at
least where I'm from this will pay the
most if you're thinking of it
financially Java would pay the second
highest and then between PHP and Python
it's a toss-up and that's in the USA
anyways but anything asp.net is pretty
big money usually six figures US dollar
I hope that kind of answers your
question I don't I don't use a Java
regularly I played with Android studio
and I really don't use asp.net c-sharp
has a lot of data types to so now the
other question was react
yeah SP and dotnet are there usually for
bigger corporations um it's fast it's
really fast one thing I didn't like I
did I think it was MVC three back in the
day I don't know what version they're
out on now it was so many things were do
we based unless you know how to use like
PowerShell and all that yeah freelancing
with.net asp.net that's gonna be tricky
but if you did and you were good at it
you could get some pretty good pay let
me say I was making a table all right so
we got four here and this is on this is
gonna be my opinion guys I don't know
everything so let's see feature and then
let's do frameworks all say I know if
you react and angular
okay so framework view no rat no angular
yes
sighs good size good size huge all right
so I'll give you a tip view GTG that
just means good to go react good to go
angular good to go with version five use
five because it is
I think 33% or more times faster it's a
big framework complexity number one
easiest number two and then number three
I'd say angular's by far the hardest let
me just put up angular 2 to 5 OV you to
I'm sorry I don't even mess with view 1
I'm usually on the bleeding edge of
things now the thing is I want to show
you guys something and you might be kind
of surprised if you're so github view
github react to me this was extremely
shocking if I could snag that / UJS ok
and then whoops sorry boom boom
okay react has 83 K stars and view is at
76 K and I remember a time
the view was probably like 40 K stars
below this is just I'm not saying that
one is better than the other it really
comes down to preference or maybe the
job market you're looking at it's just
amazing that this has gained this much
momentum as Facebook react that's really
cool let's see let me make sure I don't
skip anyone I know I had one guy first
okay there's the Symphony Symphony I
feel okay PHP MVC's let me copy this
what these two so that I don't forget
them I'm not trying to jump around too
much but this pace that there so then
going back down why I use a large
framework work when you can build your
own stuff okay so let me make sure I had
this in context Renovatio are you
speaking about PHP frameworks or just
like any framework in general I'm gonna
save this one too okay yeah you're
talking about PHP specifically so let me
make note of that what about rails oh
gosh not Ruby okay let me just figure
alright the rails plus react I'll answer
that in a moment
Symphony cube yeah Laura Bell ships with
view so it's good with that I think that
helped them make a popular um one thing
about this is you ad libs libraries
yourself which it's so easy I mean if
people complain about that it's silly ed
libraries to this you know so here you
have like view X for state management
here and believe they use Rennicks for
state and then angular what's it called
our X I'll just call it our X something
okay I know it starts with our X big
system a lot of big companies use it I
see most jobs for either react but most
of them for angular almost every like
job is for angular I don't know why and
that's talking about angular 2 and above
so you can use version 2 3 our way to 4
or 5 let me put that in there they don't
have a 3rx Rd exit no it's not hard X
it's something rxjs that's it yeah
that's for state remembering state and
all that I'm not a master at all these
I'd say the one I use the least is react
the templating I actually kind of want
to play with it because there is this
has one called weeks I believe which
would be like native to mobile if I'm
correct this has react native but you
have to use NPM version 4 not 5 yet
angular I'm not sure about I never
looked into that
you know honestly view is so easy to
learn but you know it can get complex
react it has its I'm not a big fan of
JSX the way they template things out
it's just a little little strange to me
angular is it's big and it's very
object-oriented and it uses typescript
at least when I use it I use typescript
and typescript is not difficult but you
got to get used to it so angular by far
has probably the biggest learning curve
okay so let me go back to some questions
I guess if I were to summarize this and
invest my time in something for myself
personally I think view so far is the
funnest but I can't say that totally
because I haven't given direct a fair
shot and angular is I would only use
angular if it was like a really large
application that just encompassed
everything and typescript does help a
lot from preventing errors so I'm just
switching the webcam to the screen to
make it a little interesting let me go
to the next question the fellow ahead so
that I'm not ignore okay so just to
cover some people are talking about
Symphony is Symphony a good framework
for work yes
Symphony made by Fabian potens here
I believe Oh tense here all right how do
I make the font bigger in this one too
so you guys can read it so we have some
guys that are like I guess I call them
like the grandfathers or
the leaders of PHP and then we have
laravel by taylor well however you spell
his last name and then Sebastian Bergman
or PHP unit and maybe I missed some
people but to me these are kind of the
big soldiers at the forefront I would
say Fabian potent sir you know he was
the original guy just brilliant the
library's he's he's made he's just an
incredible programmer and I believe he
also runs Senseo labs and we all know
look Taylor out well I mean does this
guy stop working
laravel beautiful I mean I used to just
Taylor really understands how to make
things that people want to use he's a
really smart guy I also like that ships
with laravel mix that's for view
components but you can change to react
if wanted phpunit you know that's just
unit testing so let's let me jump up
tutorials on Symphony um that's probably
not something I do just because I don't
know getting into a whole framework is a
big deal
Symphony is pretty robust and good in it
I often feel like I'm repeating the same
thing a lot let me go to the next guy's
questions so a dream I'm a bit
conflicted regarding PHP MVC most
tutorials I've found teach us to use
controllers as a middle member or a
handle between the view and models
however there are sound some let me go
up I must that state the model should
communicate directly to the view a model
communicate directly to the view that is
not an MVC alright so there's a couple
of MVC patterns you have any CK that's
Model View controller and that's exactly
what you said I believe at and it goes
kind of like you basically start out
with a front controller but this is
really like your bootstrap or index file
or whatever you want to call it and then
that loads a default controller
controller loads view
and before this we can load Oh
I'm not sharing my screen sorry there we
go somebody has the most stable robust
yeah definitely even all our values is a
ton of their frameworks
I don't think Lara about what I had as
much success without Symphony in fact I
don't think a lot of people would so I
give a lot of credit to Fabian potens
here if I say his name right there's
people like that that I mean I they're
just on another level I don't know how
they do things so well so what you're
looking at you if you jump from model to
so model to view model view so this kind
of seems like a bad idea
okay so in such an instance I think you
might be forgetting one thing
and they call it a router they're just
calling it something different and it's
probably really minimal so if you
thought of something like let's say slim
or sigh let's by default they don't have
controllers so you would have a model
and a view well a model you'd have to
you know set up obviously but views and
routes are set up so that's the closest
thing that would be really more like a
model view setup is that your router is
really kind of faking your controllers
purpose with it some cuz you know it's
like route /what and then you had like a
function anonymous and in here yet you
just have like same model call and then
a view call right as far as
let me make sure I answer that there's a
couple there's a lot of different
patterns there's hmbc which is your RP
NBC and if I recall this is how Symphony
does it I know at least Django from
Python they do
HMV see where basically what that is you
have an app let me make an example let's
say I have a project named project okay
and then I have a little list then I
would have an app let's say users and
then I have another app let's say tasks
so under each one of these I would have
views okay this is Python but I can't
recall symphony off the top of my head
URLs dot PI you'd have a separate
templates folder and then they have dev
admin builder too in this um just so you
guys know I don't really say this much
but Python or Django the framework in my
opinion it's probably my all-time
favorite framework because of the way
you create models and migrations it's
just beautiful model view viewmodel oh
and I know you're not messing with me
but I know that's true I don't know
everything controllers are still present
but they're used more for input I can
link to the article
yeah can you are you able to send linson
Here I am not totally sure what that is
let's see Marcus I'd like to reduce
series make your own MVC maybe you can
make community together develop dream
framework oh yeah I get you know I get a
lot of people out of nowhere that
sometimes I run into online because I'm
pretty hidden online and they'll say hey
I loved your MVC series I'm like that
thing that things like 5 years old I'm
just kind of surprised
that people like it me I guess it was
useful I'm glad but I'm not looking to
create my own framework it is fun but
it's a lot of reinventing the wheel
because if I just look at something like
check out wiki Model View I'm just
curious
I'll get to the model view viewmodel
this guy's not joking around yeah I do
better with picture so presentation
Audrey so view o of you model okay so I
can't recall this I've seen this before
so it's not model to view in this case
oh I'm glad yeah when I had to learn MVC
it took me a long time and then design
patterns oh mercy object-oriented
programming help me Lord it took me long
I always learn things the hard way
and I was like man people are gonna
struggle with this so I'm gonna try try
my best to make it easy so I I did try
I'm glad that it was helpful I know it's
pretty dated but so the model I wish I
had a better separation of development
of the graphical UI from the development
of the business logic the view model is
a value converter meaning the view model
is responsible or converting data
objects from the model so they're easily
managed and presented okay well that's
weird that it makes sense okay so I
could be totally off here in my opinion
this would just be a controller all
right
and if you needed to manipulate model
data just put functions in the model
because the goal has always been fat
models skinny controllers favorite NBA
team oh boy
it used to be the Pistons I've been like
in what's it the Golden State because I
forgot his name that short little guy
that makes every shot I find him very
entertaining you know what I'm talking
about
I so let me see lookee view yeah that
view viewmodel so here is a r dot J Eve
hues are not templates here it is art
sorry Renovatio I don't understand
oh is that a link that HTML I hope it's
not a virus but if it is others destroy
the virtual machine so model view
confusion series Oh book
so I'll just Roman numerals to me
alright let me just see yeah Wow from
2010 yep Steven Kurt Stefan curry VJ s
is mvvm yeah I've been doing a lot of
nodejs and MongoDB docker some DevOps
lately and it's uh it's been hard to
keep up with everything
let's see I have an allergy of reading
manuals how you read manuals to find
information about in things
okay scroll down let me see what am I
looking for man what is a model of you
moderate that's a pretty funny one I
don't like reading manuals or and much I
don't know how I find out about new
things I'm usually out-of-date
developing
you have the rent window does the mobile
you all of the mobile views triggered
okay okay well that guy's a PhD so did
this have pictures I love graphs and
pictures that just helps me the guy
Marcus I really love looking at things
with pictures that's my secret and
making graphs because I am an extremely
slow learner slow thinker and it takes
me a long time to learn stuff so I'm not
like I'm no I'm no tailor out well kind
of guy alright so let me just make sure
I know what I'm going to talk about and
we see we already know what MVC is ABC
models are not to move it the view gets
its own data from the model I understand
that so what's this kind of saying
that's right okay you see model
confusion ABC is a very common Amin
common architecture everyone seems to be
writing their own so yes it's a good
learning exercise much poorly written a
great deal is old-fashioned
sorry you got to tell me what you're
looking for man while I wait
let me know if there's a certain link on
here hi and zoo hi
what video are you talking about
the fellow that asked about rails and
react I would separate the two because
you know obviously react is its own
thing you can use if anything but if I
go to Oh Stack Overflow trending
languages I think it was 2017 rails or
Ruby in general it's it's not as hot as
it used to be okay so Stack Overflow
don't lie
they have one it's really really long I
think of it pearls the most disliked
language they had a really good graph a
breakdown that was really easy to read
and they have a lot of good metrics all
fine I know I'll just go to the big one
is there a Jackson angler yes there is
angular who it's a big framework has
everything
by the way rent Renovatio if you do find
that let me know Marcus yes angular it's
like a full framework I mean when you
get it set up I mean you're set up and I
usually I would recommend starting with
the CLI because it doesn't right but
dude if you look at their docks you
might lose your mind it's it's going to
take a while to get into ok technology I
just want to show you guys already so
most popular technologies JavaScript ok
you guys it's been killing it for I
think two years maybe three and that's
because of a few things no js' and these
front-end frameworks so it's kind of
like a double-edged sword we have the
front end and the back end and nodejs is
fantastic I wouldn't count SQL in here
because it's just you know that's like
throwing on Mongo in there it's just
database language you know everyone
almost everyone uses it somewhere all
right I'm not in love with jQuery but
much people use angular instead of
jQuery Markus angular is a good
investment if you're really serious
about it it's gonna be hard
don't use angular 1 I'm gonna try to
finish that thought well I have a vape
alright and I have a shirt on all my
favorite rappers are dead
hi mark kapha creative solutions you
know my name I wanted to thank you for
everything you well I don't know how to
respond to that kind of thing I don't
think I'm anyone's hero it's nice of you
to say
okay so let me just make sure I answer
if the fellow still hear about Ruby so
Ruby the language itself you guys might
have remembered a time when we on Rails
was just hot and it was it was all the
talk over in Silicon Valley everyone was
learning it and now it is just dying I
hope I don't get quoted for saying that
if it's not it's not as hot as it used
to be at all and python is storming
ahead Python and Ruby are very much
alike in syntax or they're the closest
to like compared to languages you'll
find with the indents except that you'll
write about 40% less code in Python and
Ruby is also a lot more confusing in the
sense that you can do the same thing of
three or four different ways where
Python is just like hey just do it this
way and Python
I would definitely learn Python a
thousand times more than Ruby I wouldn't
even mess with Ruby at this point in
life the only thing I know worthwhile is
like configuring vagrant but I don't
know how popular how long it's going to
last
let's see so Marcus wants to start
angular why do you need nodejs the
reason you need no js' is only to build
angular because angular is using two
things it's using typescript and then
it's using I think it's Babel Babel the
transpiler with webpack I believe it
ships with so what it has to do is
you're using all these new language
features as you build and then once it's
finally compiled crunched down in this
little package then you don't really
even need no dress you can put the
package wherever you want
so Ekman script all love ACMA script six
on above let's see maybe you could go
back to the page and search for text
let's take steps back okay I'm just
copying what he said maybe it's not what
how about take steps back
mmm VM a step back
do you think it's better to start with
you and then switch to angular no I
would say view and react are more
similar than angular angular is in its
entirely own ballpark if if I could whip
up a demo project for you it's not the
easiest thing in the world to start with
it's the documentation is huge you
really need someone that knows what
they're doing - so let me just I'll
answer you next run Renovatio Renovatio
of course I'm gonna name what I mean as
I've learned running up on I managed to
awesome man
I that that's the thing makes me feel
best is that I they somebody learn
something in that they can make some
money and you know we're all trying to
make it so do not RM 14 don't learn view
and then switch to angular because
they're gonna be worlds apart so let me
share my screen once more I highlighted
a text back rent rental voseo if I can
get his name right is talking about a
design pattern and VEC and I had well
that's a sight point book updating the
model based on user input like form
submissions this let me just read this
for a moment a possible point of
creation is to have a one-way data flow
where the view model have read-only
access to the model okay that makes
sense this allows better separation of
concerns view model was only ever used
to read data from the model okay by
giving the model readwrite access the
view model readwrite access
it's not acting as a controller would
the only difference is it has a state
exercise oh I think yes interesting okay
I I don't know a framework that does
this off the top of my head I swear I've
seen it it's been a while um I'm just
I'm on the wrong page again
Oh fuse are not templates sorry
like I called me mate wow this guy's a
short domain alright what I typed wrong
/ views are not templates I'm nobody
sensei there's a lot I don't know and I
struggle a lot man I get I'm like I'm
like all of you guys I get frustrated
I'm like I want to give up if you feel
that way at all Weis this uh I don't
think this pages are confused or not so
I get what you're saying how huge a s is
like mvvm because you can bind view
variables to that to the what do you
call it
I'm jumping around so much see mr. dream
has brain farts to mvvm mr. Stroehmann
new rules that's evolving into it
Oh a P W a progressive web app for view
- let me bookmark this
because for me to learn and understand
something it takes me a while I don't
want to waste everyone's time while I
sit here and try to scramble my brain
I like that short domain man you can do
a lot with that you PWA Google it's not
only uh NZT it's not only languages it's
also frameworks you know it's
frustrating it's frustrating all right
so I believe you're talking at all pwace
let me go to a real PWA and by the way
these are what Google want to replace
the web store apps with examples I don't
like the Google examples pw8 rocks these
are very interesting K progressive web
apps I haven't even had time to get into
them pokedex is insane like me all right
so this there's there's a chrome plugin
by the way where you can see what
something's made in DMX idea Mex
oh you saw my shirt he's uh he's a
pretty good rapper yeah he I can't tell
I CV Yui but it might just be
cryptographer
or dot J s there's a better way to find
this manifest
maybe this will tell us no all right
whatever I don't care what it's made
with what's better to use jQuery or
angular 5 those are completely different
jQuery is a library that helps you and
angular is a gigantic behemoth framework
so just real quick this is a progressive
web app so if I were able to show my
phone I could go to this site which
actually might do it's quite incredible
let me go ahead and try to load it one
moment I'll have to open up the web cam
yeah that's correct is that it WEP
Eliezer I'm in Eastern time zone Florida
if you guys are curious so it's ten here
but I often get stuck or stay up late
sorry
do they have a let's see download takes
me to I don't this isn't the one I was
looking for but it looks like it will
tell me a lot I'm gonna bookmark that
too
I gotta make a folder I'm also enjoying
Firefox quantum if you guys haven't
tried that I don't like being the center
of attention all the time I wish I could
share like the webcam with someone -
this is coca-cola I drink it sometimes
but I have essentia water
I'm just trying this out but where is it
oh okay hopefully you can see that 9.5
pH balance right under the red so your
body a default is I believe 7 and the
reason for that is it cleans out assets
in your stomach this is gonna be totally
off topic but I'm all about trying to
have my brain work better and what
happens is your stomach gets acid and I
just by regularly eating and stuff and
then if you drink a higher alkalinity in
your water however you say it with a
higher pH they usually say anything
above 8 is pretty good it washes out
those acids I'm not a scientist I don't
know so I'm trying it for a week to see
if it works I have two people that I
know very well to swear by it and if it
works that'd be really cool it's not too
much more expensive than other things
the other reason is I have attention
deficit disorder and a lot of times I'll
realize about 4 hours past and I forgot
what I was doing it's really frustrating
so beside that
see now I'm having trouble keeping up
let me just make sure I don't miss the
red laser
when you search asleep huh top right
there is a button blue one extension for
Chrome let me just do this real quick
Apple Iser Chrome Firefox Quantum's I'm
like oh cool this is rated 4.7 stars wow
this is better than the one I had it
looks like if it works I was gonna show
you guys pokÃ©dex
alright so let me refresh this uncurious
now I hope it works I think this is view
view Jas please tell me darn well at
least it's interesting to know that yeah
they might have it all encrypted I mean
just so this is pokedex I just want to
show you guys because this is relevant
to the future and when you have a system
such as angular react or view you can
make progressive web apps with that and
really what that is is it's not even
changing a web page they'll have their
own router and it looks like it's
changing a page but this whoops this is
never changing if I switch it's really
just changing the view but it acts like
a real thing so here I have the same
thing on my phone okay it's a little bit
shiny
so here's pokedex if I click one see
this it's just like it's it's like a web
app and it just it's flexible to mobile
devices and sorry for the blur but it's
incredible the other thing is I just put
up a fake site another technology J
Boyko and I didn't make this
rollercoaster but this is using WebGL
and it's so fast so let's say you use I
like cinema 4d for making models and
then you export it as an obj I'm not
sharing my screen there we go
Sasha's testing this out with the
library 3 Jas and there's a lot of demos
that are incredible this is a very low
polygon example it's going slow because
probably I'm recording and doing a bunch
of other things but this also loads on
your phone ridiculously WebGL better
than uh video players so let me just go
to that and show you real quick and then
I'll I get back to a couple of questions
so here's oops let me turn that back on
I mean look how smooth that runs it's
it's really awesome angular 5 is the
only way to go with angular now because
it's so fast so let me catch up on a few
of these questions don't have a vape
okay DMX is alive okay read that one
this is a link got that okay top right
okay which PHP framework your isn't more
often these days um I use I still use
Falcon a lot kind of cuz I'm a little
stuck with I was working on the main
dream site but it's driving me nuts
because it's it's it's a really big site
even though it doesn't look like it I
have dreamed that local set up hopefully
it's not broken so this is just if it's
not broken you'll see a little preview
I gotta change like the logo the logos
changed and stuff but it's changing all
to new Ajax and you know I'm not I just
don't have time to do everything and
then I'm just adding log and stuff it's
not my favorite thing but I want to
really do a REST API or something but if
you go to like dream.com it just looks
so dated even that's starting to look
dated to me so that's both of those this
one which is older and the previous ones
in Falcon also this dream studio I was
trying to do freelance work it's just
I'm not good to get in clients this is
done in larvell 5.4 not nothing really
impressive going on here though and when
I use this I really did like it you kind
of scroll down it just simple stuff so
I'd say for me it's been between PHP
wise larvell and Falcon but mostly
Falcon I don't know why I just I'm so
used to Falcon my sister ECE I don't
know what see she's startling with what
direction to take and what to do
computer
so I constantly keep talking and
employees are but she's um what is C II
I actually dropped out of room wants
angular five I dropped out of college
actually because they talk really slow
your sister's study Cee that could be
computer something CS is computer
science if I had everything to do over I
would probably not be a computer
programmer but it's how my brain is
wired so that's what I am it's because
it's a it's I didn't expect things to
change so much and so much to do
computer engineering I don't know a
whole lot about college man I know about
computer science degrees college isn't
gonna pave the way it's gonna be what
you do after really at every job that
I've held anyone that came in with a
degree it held less weight as someone
with experience but it does get you in
the door you have to I guess your sister
would have to say okay what about
computers do I like doing the most what
do I get lost in for me I get lost in
fiddling with code and making it better
at least better in my the way I know how
and that's what she should do whatever
you enjoy doing because if you do what
you hate you're gonna waste your life
pretty bad so angular 5 people keep
talking about I can't do a full series
on this I'm also not the master at it
but I will give you an idea so I just
want to discard
okay and oh man I forgot my little
windows let me just load them real quick
Ubuntu no this drives me nuts when I
don't have my minimize button because
I'm such a Windows newbie light guy all
right geez settings ah wrong side there
they are I got my little buttons back
drives me nuts all right so it's the
same thing I'm from Turkey in Istanbul
so there comes the name confusion okay
so angular five the first thing you have
to do is have note installed here's mine
you know version eight nine - that's LTS
long term support and if I do and the
immersion it's five something and I
would do n I or install mm-hmm ayah
shorthand and then G and if I recall
it's and sorry I just it was an angular
- CLI with the @ sign let's see some of
them have the a sign and it's kind of
weird to me I can check in a new tab
also my bash is kind of going slow cuz
I'm loading so much stuff to automate
for me then nvm update yeah it's at
angular CLI okay so you have globally
your angular CLI tool there's also a
engi Paradis abashed completion for the
angular as well which is helpful yeah I
know what Morocco is I worked with a
woman who was from there they people
from Morocco I don't know if all of them
can but this woman spoke four languages
I believe it was crazy
that's not common in America or the
United States so that's already
installed now let's go pee that's my
shortcut for projects
so obviously you need a terminal what am
I looking for
my dead folder and then dev J s so if I
were to type 10 G is it possible to
build a framework CLIs rest SP a website
without using angular and if yes yeah
you don't have to use angular at all you
don't have to use UJ s or react J s if
you have a REST API that's like the
foundation for all calls right and you
could use a backbone J s the the real
goal for s PA is I think I didn't read
all their docs it's that you don't
you're not reloading the page and it
works on mobile as it does on desktop I
guess it's all right so ng is the
shortcut so mm-hmm
if I want to create when I believe it's
generate or is it build no I'll just
call this Superman
and anything that says back which is SPE
see that usually is a test could be an
end-to-end test a unit test and this it
has it really has a lot of stuff Oh
Morocco yeah I don't know much about
that area I don't know much about a lot
of things I don't know who who's telling
you about angular like it's not your
only option I still know people that use
backbone and backbones pretty good the
goal is to reduce code just make it
easier for yourself and angular it's not
the easiest thing it's a big thing but
over time it could be really reliable
just because it's very it's like a it's
it's the only real framework like a real
framework where the other two popular
ones are libraries where you plug things
in but they're they're really good too
all right so I had Superman installed
and new code I'm gonna open code here vs
code by the way is fantastic to use with
angular okay if i zoom my node modules
are installed and you would go to your
source folder oops it's gonna do a
reload thing
let me see angular CLI Jason I'm
wondering what version yeah I installed
the latest so this should be five so it
should be super fast open this up all
right so this is um it can be get
overwhelming I have a git plug-in so
it's this color basically what you have
is your app folder
and let's see it was up modules okay a
module your module is like the main
thing this guy's asking what I would you
build an SP a in pure vanilla Jas I do
not know yet this is just a Linux
virtual machine here I do all my
development in Linux maybe I'm a weirdo
it's a bunt to 1710 gnome 3 with top
panel I have that light kind of it early
on video someone asked that so angular
you have your apps folder and then you
have a module in this module mmm is
where you load all your components in
components you could think of kind of
like it's pages so it's really hard to
sit down and do this off the top of my
head okay so here's an example of a
component and this is a decorator and
this is what they look like so you would
have things like public ng in it and I
believe you'd have a what does it
construct or a something there's
dependency injection in here and stuff
but I don't have any working projects
that I could show you this is not a IDE
this is a Visual Studio code it's free
it's on all platforms whoops
Visual Studio code it's incredible for
real I'm not kidding you can even debug
with it so angular is doing it that's a
whole nother story if I weren't here I
could run NPM I think it's run serve oh
no its ng sir
I think I can run I think that's it
okay
so angular the first build usually isn't
the fastest once you got everything
ready when you compare this to version
four and five it's like lightyears ahead
so I'll go ahead and open this link just
to see the default whoops I think a lot
of people want to learn auteur of heroes
this is a very good tutorial if you want
to learn angular in many parts of the
world neither nodejs backbone or angular
became into stranded unseen huh that's
pretty crazy honestly it depends on what
Google because I think Google's the one
pushing the spa apps laravel tutorials
there's actually quite a few of them on
Google I started YouTube single page app
that's ultimately the goal okay so if
you have a router somehow that like
fakes the path you're good to go
I mean that's what a single page
application is but it doesn't really
look like one angular I think typescript
is awesome because I like type languages
even in PHP I find angular a little
heavy compared to react or view but I'm
no expert to compare more
object-oriented I could let me just make
sure you guys know a few of my plugins
coca is awesome okay
this is so you can just test up so if
you guys are familiar with sublime text
it's a lot like that ctrl P open a file
ctrl shift P then you got all these
commands except you don't use a package
you just use extensions so let me clear
this list and they even recommend things
for you I mean you'll have a field to
have you've never used vs code even a
lot of Mac users use it so let me see
show installed all right so I have a lot
of these snippets are ones you might use
you might not
they don't always help because what you
do is you know you type in something
short and it suggests it angular
essentials I'm not sure which ones were
the best man I got a lot installed on
here
I would always add babel mabel
everything I might not need this other
one not sure but also yes lint
boy I really do but it's cool so like
let's say I was just like I just type
theme okay I can go down and change
color theme and let me go to my editor
let me open a new folder I'll open the
dream project because this one's a big
one with a bunch of code too much code
app mercy migrations most sometimes it
does that on my Linux box it reloads I
don't know what am I looking for library
something that might have some decent
write output how about this this is real
simple so what's cool about this is vs
code right this is a plugin for code
outline up this is the default one it
looks like because it's not working I
can drag this up here you can
right-click it hide it from the sidebar
you can look at get commits I think this
is pretty useless you can have projects
so I could flip through projects there's
so many plugins I don't even want to go
through them all the point is I should
actually just install that code
what's that thing called code outline
one
so let's see that is what the see that's
what I mean is it's not about what
framework we use in worldly matters good
yeah I'd agree with them more kapha
what he said there is it good practice
to use phpstorm for PHP and Visual
Studio for JavaScript rental bot geo is
right phpstorm
is I actually prefer phpstorm for a lot
of PHP work in pycharm 2 which is also
jetbrains they're extremely good
frameworks mm-hmm I think they're
probably actually the best ones that you
can get but if you want to write
JavaScript or PHP you can use anything
you want no this is my first time trying
a live video I haven't been on here for
quite a while YouTube I'm just trying to
I don't know do something different I
guess and what was I looking for a
quarter line right here so this is a
good one and I just do a reload I don't
know I guess it just depends on what
people are interested in so code on line
here it is so I should be able to
refresh well there's something wrong I
wonder if it's because I'm in Falcon I'm
not sure
oh I should have that installed but this
is just for the template engine no big
deal
code outline let me remove that one I
had so just to summarize vs code it's
basically like sublime text just in my
opinion a bit better you have get over
here
or is that yet where is it source
control I just don't have mine added in
here
it has a debugger where you can attach
it I have no configuration setup right
now I could probably add like PHP my PHP
on here or a docker box then you can
make little tick marks to stop it
breakpoints in different places and
it'll go through our output I mean it's
it's it's like a real good thing
I used to use Emmet but not not much
anymore it was kind of a front-end thing
but not so much let's see what do you
use let's see I have to go to animate
possibility differential parlor or
income project Lorien questions oh it's
no best way to do it I get it hopefully
they're not too hard of questions I
recently got let go so I'm uh on the
market busy with that but I still want
to do fun stuff us I would say the hello
up at dream.com I don't always answer it
because I've been pretty busy lately but
that would be a good one let me type it
that one I get those um so vs code and
let me make sure why do people use
docker instead of a pad she and my SQL
on a known PC I don't have my old work
but no man docker is so awesome so I
actually have if I shrink this down and
this I set up a docker RC file you guys
might not know what that is but if you
know what bash RC is and this is all
available in my github if you use Linux
or if you use them
there's get SCM a couple of terminals
you can use on Windows to do the same
thing so here I just separate it so I
made a docker RC file right so if I quit
I can just type these are commands
amazed Mongo set up and it's already set
up what's another one swagger you I set
up swagger editor set up obviously it's
not I'm just I just made it easy for
myself so if I just open this link and
it works perfectly
I believe I have a been docker sea port
a nur yeah let me load up porteÃ±o real
quick
poor caner setup this is like a little
gooey fur docker thanks for running
whatever RINO I'll call you know just
shoot me an email and I'll try to get to
that so if I go to what was the link
poor Taner oh I didn't echo out the link
doc RC I make sure to make the links
different because I have local copies
installed Oh 95 hundred so local hoes
9500 hide my favorites toolbars I
thought I had a password man I'll try
different all right so I can manage my
local environment with this and this is
cool because these are my containers I
can click this and this and start
hopefully they'll run and you're
wondering what is the point of this and
I'm gonna explain it the best I can
I'm using Ubuntu I always use a bun 217
point 10 but once 18 comes out I'll swap
to that because that's long-term support
that's in a few months though and then
I'm using gnome 3 and this is just uh
doctor doctor - the panel I think so doc
er this is just a GUI poor Taner there's
also one called rancher that I have that
one's pretty cool so the benefit of
docker is this
I'm gonna I'm processing how I can
explain this so it makes sense because
when you look at this it's like this
looks kind of crazy first of all let me
open up a text editor to try to explain
it I make a new whoops
so docker basically does this you have
images right and you know what an image
is it's like an ISO like you have a
Windows ISO but to ISO people are using
a LP an ISO a lot because they're really
tiny okay so with images I don't know
that I would use I like the terminal
myself but sometimes I'm lazy and I'm
just like yeah it was like look if I
want to look it like alright let's say
I'm having a problem with Mongo I don't
want to like type in the whole long
docker commands and I just want to read
the logs I just go down here to logs and
just scroll down it's just easier for me
to do and you you know you can use port
a nerf or remote deployments too if you
wanted to but I might I might suggest
Rancher which I have a script of that
whoops where's my terminal rancher set
up okay this one's bigger and by the way
if I go to github dream was a dot file
yeah dot files this is if you use any
Linux distro and install what you McCall
it doc docker yeah I know this is a lot
of crap so it's this docker RC file all
you have to do is
see my bash RC that's the entry point
you always have a dot bash RC and I said
okay if if this file exists then source
docker RC okay and I got to improve this
file a bit but basically I just made a
bunch of images I use pertain err
Rancher swagger Apache and genetics elk
elk is big
that's an elastic search log stash in
Cabana my sequel Nats and I still got
worked in doing this but it's working
and some shortcuts if I go down there's
a lot of duplicated code so if I were to
type nginx setup it just runs this is
the actual command you would run in
reality and then if I want to go up
there's also a way to connect some of
them I don't need to connect to like
Mongo I might want to connect to same as
my sequel but you know you guys are free
to take whatever you want it's all
hoping source so back to docker the
benefit I mean one of the many is it's
hard to please let me just briefly
explain you have a container right so
that would be like a virtual in instance
right like let's say I'm running
VirtualBox to Linux installations right
that would be like two containers all
right I won't go into volumes and
networks and stuff but you have
horizontal scaling
and what that does is you can have tiny
posts with like let's say an L pine box
inside that L pine box is PHP plush your
app and well maybe you might want to
toss an engine X or patchy it's up to
you how you set it up you can have
separate like three separate boxes or
two separate boxes in this case or three
or sorry have one and all you do is like
so you have host one is like let's say
here's host one host to host three host
four okay you have orchestration which
is mostly wings kubernetes or docker
cloud which is called swarm like this
this is called horizontal scaling so
let's say he dies poops out well you
still have these guys let's say you're
getting way too much traffic you don't
have to add hardware or anything you
just make another little host make
another little host and they're cheap
whereas the old way of vertical scaling
you have let's say box one box two these
are large boxes then you have a load
balancer and it's probably doing like a
round-robin going from one two back and
forth and what happens is okay I need
more now you can add another large box
here but it's still doing i brainfart it
all right go here docks dot-com I think
I uploaded my latest I published a notes
here a lot and I'm sorry for the mess I
gotta fix this bug here but I have one
for docker see if I
the latest I gotta fix this mermaid
thing docker breakdown shoot it helps so
much more I'll try to fix this tonight
because that's gonna bother me
basically docker isolates things so you
can update your OS to anything and you
won't break things ever because it's
isolated in its own OS I'm probably not
explaining it well then I've been
talking a while some of this stuff I
wanted to do es6 or a real tutorial but
I think I'm getting tired of talking and
hearing my my knowing voice but a couple
of things I would use if I was anybody
number one
nvm no version manager PI n plus PI and
virtual and this is for Python those are
only one I think there's one for go but
I wish there was a better PHP
environment manager to swap versions if
you're using a bunch of 1710 and having
issues with it I'm I'm guessing you're
probably talking about development
related or are you running a server
because III don't upgrade my server to
anything but LTS I've screwed it up too
many times
upgrading a server so also quota you if
you get a vs code it's free by Microsoft
Mac users use it you're not a trader
fuses it's so good
khoka is awesome okay I'm in cuoco right
now so if I just do Const a equals hello
and let's see if I hover room these
highlights okay I'm getting this because
I have my es lint guy chilling here so
control s it should oh I didn't want to
save that is this coca this is supposed
to be colca alright run code
all right so that didn't do anything let
me do console long yay it should be a
hotkey for this run code I can't
remember I'm not sure where they said
this might be the coder in our actually
let me make sure quote a new JavaScript
file ok so if you guys haven't learned
the arrow functions they're cool you
just be like let's say function name X
return X ok and then you can say name
console dot warn name whoops
by the way there is a come on tight boy
there's a console info warn debug and
error is it all inter no not sure why
that's just I guess it is run code so
that gives us Tom and then if you guys
never played with the arrow function on
this party and with this we can say
constant age equals mmm number and
return know this looks bad you actually
don't need these double quotes or this
or the return for one this is gonna
confuse to trap other people I'm not
even going to talk about this let me not
even go into that I wanted to but it's
another guy he explains it better um
let's see that's a computer I had an
issue with authorization NTFS 3g g I
don't what is and T I've only run x4
file systems on bun to let me see if I'm
able to switch my screen okay I think
this is gonna be a big screen all right
this is my main desktop here
so hey know that there are no jobs in
Deltona at all this is like the woods I
have two driveways like Mary or
Orlando's too far the traffic's pretty
bad Linux Mint here I'm not sure which
one this is who was asking kid in well I
was just answering a bunch of questions
the best I could kind of jumped around a
lot I don't feel like I answered Marcos
question about patch docker that well
mark Hari however you say you're fine
using Apache and my sequel on your own
PC I wouldn't even worry about docker if
you don't have to it's it's a bit that
everything takes a while to learn I
guess
oh you got the yeah the creators update
- so I got a couple of faces up here on
window I'm just showing Linux Mint yep I
only run Linux on my laptops Oz messing
with this for a while
this was bugging me I don't know why in
this virtual machine I can't fix this
background you know if I move it it's
moving virtual desktops but it's being
stupid but yeah this is I customize this
a little too bit playing around the next
minute it's pretty Windows like it if I
didn't really screw everything up like
this I probably did be my second choice
I do like know if you do switch to a bun
to start with a virtual machine I'm
recording a course on a bun - and trying
to do my best
that's all we can do but coupon - which
is really cool bun - with KDE is the
most windows like and I think it's in
the top - one of the most popular I
think and it's also the most
customizable but it requires um it's not
the best for really old pcs if you had a
really old PC you would use something
like ella ella bun - or something
artificial intelligence I am NOT a fan
of I don't like it at all
hi I can't say anyone's name thank you
I'm glad you liked the tutorials I I
don't know I I'm not I don't like AI
know I'm just doing a live today I don't
this isn't something regular I do I
don't think it's very popular either but
this is qaboun tube or KDE on Ubuntu
1710 and you right-click it's really
really good so I can add an application
menu bar there's one at the top and we
have some things are kind of annoying it
takes a little practice I forgot what
this was but I hate it so I'm not gonna
worry about that but you can add widgets
I not widgets I forgot they were called
you can add a whole bunch of junk to
your desktop if you want you look at the
menu it's like so windows like but it's
really cool obviously I haven't been
using it in this stuff panel cinnamon
called it something else panel settings
change the height like you can customize
this stuff crazy
that's KDE let me just do type of thow
KDE plasma
my opinion on AI I'm not Elon Musk
Batman is absolutely a genius he's
concerned about it so that's a little
concerning but I don't know I'm I'm not
afraid of technology I just don't I just
feel like crap they just I don't know if
it's gonna make things harder or easier
do you suggest a MacBook Air for web
development
it depends what you're developing really
I would only get a MacBook Air if I was
making Mac applications iOS and Swift
because Mac is very vendor Locken III
personally find it more cost-effective
to build or buy my own I always buy like
a think pad I know they're not that
pretty but hear me out if you're really
into Mac that much I'm sorry I can't
really adjust my screen when it's
running
where's the Tony Mac x86 com
this guy has guides if you want to build
an a hackintosh yes it works with the
App Store and everything you can build
custom Mac minis the reason to do this
is I kid you not
you'll spend probably three times is
less money and it'll be three times more
powerful you can go go search YouTube
and look for custom Mac minis or any-any
make a custom hackintosh that's what
you're looking for and they they just
destroy what's out there
like the prices are just it's not right
if you got it I think MacBook Air
they're thorough I mean they're good
computers but there
you can get a lot better value nowadays
what I'm afraid of is not the type of
the government's interested most
meaningful isn't oh I don't know hey I
think but I mean there's a lot of the
quote AI with ads and Google ad tracking
a lot of companies have that going on I
don't know I'm just gonna do a little
bit of code here and try to enjoy life
not put in what do you call it Google
device to listen to my conversation all
day because that's kind of weird
I don't need it if you want to be a PHP
developer well you just gotta jump in
and practice and if you're using Windows
you should get lorig on there going slow
with me is that cool oh you're interning
for PHP okay hopefully you're doing PHP
seven if I was you I would rush into
things and break things not not not at
your internship but like in your free
time log on if you're on Windows it's
great and this is I'm only PHP either
you can get the mean stack if you want
on Windows it's a bit older version and
an older right there which kind of
stinks but see you want no that's a good
version go lang I don't know what mint
is how's this twelve megabytes PHP and
my sequel for twelve Meg's it's cuz this
has no js' nginx okay well you want some
kind of server because with just the CLI
you can't serve well you could run the
PHP - s server that's what lara laravel
does i believe to mimic it
okay I think my brains gonna fry we've
talked a lot about a lot of stuff and
nope for PHP developer what I've got no
free time they keep putting me into
testing and making business websites
well an internship is always kind of if
it's not fast enough it can get boring a
lot of people run on a free time the
older they get it it really stinks so
what do you mean note for PHP developer
Oh basically no js' even if you do PHP
you're gonna install something like web
pack maybe or go here here's a whole
bunch of them here's gulp j/s angularjs
react view mostly for a builder but gulf
wet pack roll that's what most PHP
developers use for with nodejs but they
don't use a frog a server
so I think the last thing I'll do before
I close this off this show you guys two
little things I don't have I do have I'm
not a rich man
but let's let's let it run blur one blur
oh come on there we go all right and
then it blurs again I'm trying to just
show a laptop maybe I could get it if I
move it moving a little bit this is a
ThinkPad t4 40s all right it's a pretty
low resolution screen I bought it used I
buy everything used it's only i5 I just
replaced the hard drive and you know it
has those nice big keys 14 inches and
it's it cost me 200 bucks you know back
in the day this cost I think 12 under
and then over here I won't say who did
this but I've been trying to repair this
x1 carbon for quite a while and I cannot
figure it out I haven't bought a new
motherboard for it this is my favorite
laptop 2 x1 carbon I think I need a new
power switch that's the last and the
only thing I can think of I'm just
baffled the battery charges and
everything but yeah you know I didn't
buy all this stuff at once I bought this
used for I don't know a long time ago I
thought I had my main laptop I'm trying
to sell it's a x1 carbon but it's a
touchscreen you know I just don't use a
touchscreen enough to make it worth it
yeah I shaved yep and I said to the
beard I don't know other than that it's
a pretty quiet lonely house and I think
I'm going to try to write some code I
wish I really wish someone else I had
someone else that could like dual webcam
with me because it'd be a lot more
interesting to kick back and forth the
best laptop for a developer it depends
on what less you want to use I'm really
weird and the reason I prefer ThinkPads
is because of the keyboard oh they get
up sticker on the laptop yeah I have
another one I have some other sticker on
that or it is so I'd say this let me
just show you if I compare the width
well this doesn't have the full thing
screwed on I'm not telling you this to
get a think pad but in my experience
besides this this was by someone you
know it wasn't too happy with me I
didn't do anything well maybe I did but
um so just if you care okay so see where
this is really thin at the nose we're
right here at the nose the thinness I
mean it's not super thin but in my hands
this sends light this is also really
light but it's more square the
difference is this has dual batteries
one internal and an external here you
can get a bigger battery that's why I
like the pink pads also this man you can
change the hard drive here in an x1
carbon you can't do anything with the
RAM CPU and pretty much nothing else
most ThinkPads this you can buy a six
cell battery whatever I won't take it
out this this one doesn't have like I'll
try to show you Frank can't see it but
I'm so picky just look up a ThinkPad
keyboard it's like a religion man I run
Linux on these early I don't run Windows
on them this holds I think the T 40s T
for 40s holds 12.5 inch SSD and a a 40
millimeter m2 SSD which are actually
kind of hard weird weird size usually
they're 80 millimeters like the one I
showed you the was this I'm a PHP
learning node good practice the version
number Keenen what are you asking if
this is what I would do if you need a
laptop for development
don't go lease don't go buy something
new it's it's never worth it in my
opinion you know same with phones
everyone's flirty camera this Microsoft
what is it a Microsoft LifeCam there's
like a hundred bucks like a year ago it
just kind of stinks so like my phone
maybe I'm just cheap but the phone by
these band-aids aren't because I showed
up heroin RA all of the ThinkPad that's
a t4 4s I'll show you in a moment
like this this phone here my I had a
Nexus 6p
it's kind of dirty I know but it just
doesn't well it's charged it dies at 40%
I had it Friday I think two years or
more
and then I got an LG v20 a couple months
ago I paid 300 but being a cheapskate
that I am I saw for 200 on eBay so I
returned it and got the eBay one who's
just as good so this phone used to cost
you know I think was six seven hundred
just get a couple old versions you're
good to go
let me share my screen one moment I've
been wanting to rebuild my desktop I
just don't have any money to do that the
main yeah all right
so eBay it would be eighty four four
zero there's a zero and an S version
I forgot the difference I think it was
something to do with the screen but t44
TSR can be really cheap I can't even
remember what the P is so what you do in
my opinion this is just because I like
ThinkPads okay there's Dells and HP's
but I just can't live without the thing
keyboard alright so the ThinkPad T these
you know you drop from buildings and
stuff and they're usually good alright
so they're at four seventy right so you
know I'm a little bit behind on it but I
don't care and you scroll down to like
buy it now see what some of the prices
are buy it now for twenty three now if
I'm in the right category price with the
shipping lowest first sometimes they're
just parts
all right so here's a t4 for TP I don't
know what the P is let me do an S
because I know you can buy what I bought
it for even cheaper so it comes with
this touchpad which I don't like I
actually ordered one of these
replacements which has buttons I bought
I did spend this much money on it though
that's a ripoff I spent like I think 15
bucks which I still have to get but if
you go to like say the T 4:30 I didn't
know they had a test yeah all right now
you're looking at something a lot
cheaper the t4 30s I mean if you just
want a developer machine it would be
great but it has it just depends how
picky you are the touchpad no most
notably has the fantastic keyboard has
all your f keys and all the keys that
types well the touchpad is just it's not
like wide like modern ones let's see if
see how it's kind of funny so once you
go to 4:30 it looks I don't know
I would actually still buy it if I knew
I just have to see the specs a lot of
these you can toss in a whole bunch of
crap
sometimes they offer let me see what
at44 TP specs seems like something that
because p is usually oh this comes with
the graphics ah yeah so the t 440 all of
them t 450 usually just use the intel
cpu graphics but oh they still have that
ok so this guy might be a bit fatter
since it has a dedicated video card you
also want to look at the screen
resolution probably mine's only like
1600 by something but I'm like yeah who
cares just going to use it to write code
yeah it looks like it has this and a
mini displayport
which I'm pretty sure this has double
check yeah it has a hold VGA Ethernet
USB SD card reader
yep mini DisplayPort always on SS or USB
yeah so whatever you're looking for look
for something used the only reason I
suggest Lenovo is because these things
are durable these are like they use
these in NASA man outer space I know
they're not pretty hi Moses uh five
years ago Wow well I'm glad it helped
man that that's that that kind of stuff
makes recording videos fun so the
question here know diverse go oh boy
go is way faster the language is a lot
different go in my opinion is more you
know that docker is written and go going
to me go seems more lower-level
like something you drop create for a
server
well like docker can't think of a whole
bunch of programs written in it but you
can run a go web server which I don't
use
so it has a little bit of different a
little bit different way it's made but
you compile it yeah I mean look around
man I take months to decide on what used
laptop I'm gonna buy and so cheap it's
like I go like I go to Best Buy first
thing I do is I run my fingers over all
the keyboards nothing I like the
ThinkPad yoga even though it looked
really cool the price was too much but
the keyboard was horrible I need that I
need to feel like it's almost like kind
of desktop II also I did buy the what
you call in its surface look the first
one this was a room it was a good laptop
but I had features I don't need at all
like a whole pen and everything honestly
this is a cool laptop it's heavy and the
whole screen coming off it's neat but
dude I'll buy a two hundred dollar
laptop and say peace you know I mean
yeah I'm just I don't need that I don't
need to know that my dad has one of the
surface I think one of the touch ones
that's over that's actually cooler I
think yeah surface pro 3 I think it is
yeah so just so you know Lenovo
durability t-series there's let's see
there's a whole bunch of series but if
you're on a real big budget look at the
e-series they'll probably still be in
good condition crap I didn't even think
about that I don't even know what the
difference is let me check
I wish I had like a programmer friend
they lived nearby we'd be such dorks
thing pad e it should be the same number
efore 40 maybe there's no less to it hmm
so this one is one thing you'll want to
consider if you do buy a think pad or
really any used computers you want to
replace it with an SSD and it'll be you
know twice as fast I bought a used SSD
off eBay it's great 500 gigs I saved
like 200 bucks
cuz he's gonna spend that much 450 I
don't know they got weird numbers here
$600 for easy and what da heck
this is all big scam I got uh so many
computer parts so this is my old
motherboard okay I don't even think
anything's wrong with it
this is the motherboard for the ThinkPad
x1 carbon third generation the problem
seems to be the stupid BIOS battery
right there but I have an itch that it's
where the little power connector goes
but this is the CPU where that shiny
thing is that's the muck I scraped off
it I guarantee this works so I just
wasted like some money on a motherboard
I still can't get it to work I got so
much computer junk sitting over here
it's terrible I got motherboards in
there I don't even know what works
anymore I got it I need someone to clean
my house for me this is horrible
alright and if you saw my desktop here I
got six hearts I did buy them all once
over time cuz you know I'm a cheapskate
and like I try to look for the cheap
deals cuz you know I spend more they
work just fine
that's what I run all my virtual
machines on the SSDs and yeah alright I
think my brains given out and everyone
else is probably like man what am i
doing up at this
well whatever time it is there so all my
favorite rappers are dead guys has good
talking I wish I wish I could pull
people on the cam with me if they wanted
to I don't know how so this is a first
time for that if anyone did have
questions you're gonna look at my the
docs dream.com and it should work
hopefully even though the diagrams
broken right now if you are asking about
stuff I have some stuff on here
yeah I'll see you know it looks like I
only got like 15 people watch and I
don't know if it's something people
would be interested in I think I'd have
to start some kind of topic because
right now it's just pretty random and I
know people like to get their fingers
dirty I also know that if someone's
behind and then everyone's all caught up
people are gonna be like wait for me ha
ha ha you're a madman hurry up you know
so I don't know how to go about all that
that's why I've done a lot of recorded
video so say ok they're gonna pause it
maybe they can maybe they can do that on
this but uh Wow
yeah let me close that out I'll see how
whatever this that's where it's not all
about stats is just honestly for me to
talk for two hours is exhausting
Hangouts with emails cam together you
might be right because I'm using
something called X what is this X
streamer I don't want to pay money for
the thing but it is pretty good I won't
lie
yeah extramural okay yeah I'd have to
find out someone that likes talking I'm
not very popular around here like with
the big guys you know there's a you know
the big YouTube people I don't know who
they are I don't talk to them there are
another lead but my goal is not to be a
YouTube celebrity alright guys I'm gonna
try to figure out how to close this and
hopefully you guys found something
interesting and thanks for the company
and see you later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
