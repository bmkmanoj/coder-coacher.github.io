some selecting and jquery and also a
tool and chrome that i really like what
I have here is jQuery included style to
make element red and down here i have an
unordered list with just a bunch of
items in it and my second list i have a
bunch of items that have numbers by them
and we're just going to play around a
second so instead of typing everything
inside of here and refreshing of what
you can do is press ctrl shift and I in
a chrome or you could go to the little
wrench tools and JavaScript console and
sometimes it might appear down here and
kind of like this i'm just going to
undock this so it's over here and this
little icon here this has show council
that's what i want and i can type in
javascript in here and this is really
nice it's a lot like firebug so you can
see what you're working with and how
deep in the damn you are see HTML body
to do so first I'll just type alert one
make sure it works looks good and we can
use jQuery in here so i'll stretch this
up and let's just do li add class red
enter and it gives us the return of
everything it selected and that looks
good if you need to type more than one
line you have to press Shift + Enter so
if I want like Li dot each function I
just held shift and press Enter
and again it's a little tricky just to
do it off the top foot not too bad and
I'll say on this dot append adding looks
cool so what I was going to do was show
you the how to select list items with a
CSS selector css3 and when you have
something like this and you want to
select all these items that are kind of
like a same category but different names
you use a css3 selector like this I'll
say li and then these little square
brackets we can put an attribute in it
and the attribute I want to select this
class and equals item but not just
equals item we just want to start with
item because it has a underscore and
then a number we could even say equals
item underscore like that and I'll press
ENTER and I'll tell me what I selected
and it shows I selected all of these and
that's a cool little CSS selector I
talked about this in a prototype
tutorial but might as well bring this
one up we can also do li class ends with
well that's not going to work because
those are all different but the dollar
would be ends with so like if it ended
with a 3 we get item 3 so maybe a better
example would be lets say we have a list
item here and let's just add another li
and i'm going to add another list item
okay and I'll just call this yeah that's
fine okay let me refresh that and what I
want to do is select the how about the
second one in here so I could do
something like let's see UL li UL li and
child one that gives me test that
actually didn't tell me what I just
typed in by the way press the up arrow
to get the last thing I type back so
I'll do add class read it looks like I
want number two I thought it started
with a zero there we go and what's good
about this is it'll help us Traverse so
if we're in this one right here and if i
want to go to the parent what i could do
is a child to dot parent add class bread
and add its class of the whole ul and
then you can just practice going up so i
want to go up to another parent so dot
parent add class Fred and that adds it
to the UL you could even do it to the
next parent and it'll get you familiar
with traversing I still have a little
bit of trouble with it let's go back to
just add class of that and i'm going to
do parents with an s so parents and ul
and that will add a class to every
parent that's the unordered list so edit
it to this one and this one anyways
check this thing out it will help you
get familiar with prototype or
javascript and it's pretty cool hope it
helps thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
