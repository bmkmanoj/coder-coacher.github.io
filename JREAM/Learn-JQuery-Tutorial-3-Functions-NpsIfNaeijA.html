we're going to create a function and a
function something that can be reused
over and over rather than just happening
once so let's create a div and give it
an ID of hello and just type some text
and let's say we want to hide it we'd
say hello da hide okay and if we refresh
it's just gonna be hidden I have some
text down at the bottom I gotta get rid
of down here okay and refresh that there
should be nothing there now a function
what if we want a button that says hey I
want to toggle hello on and off we can
do that that's good news so let's create
a button I'll just say input type equals
submit and ID equals button okay so we
have a little button here it doesn't do
anything right now so we're gonna create
a function that can be reused and we
want to toggle hello so what we would do
we would say when the button is clicked
which has the idea of button so button
dot click okay we're used to this
already now just like the document.ready
above we're going to create a function
inside the click so we say function and
then those little curly brackets you got
to get used to this nesting and it can
get pretty confusing pretty quick let's
just say alert one
to make sure it's working so click your
button and I get my alert
good to go
now what we want to do is we want the
hello div to go on and off so when we
click the button we'll say hello dot hi
and refresh we have the text down here
so click the button and now it hides and
if you click it again we can't get it
back so we're going to use a different
function that makes it a lot easier or I
say hello dot toggle so refresh again
and if you click the button it can go on
and off and that's how you can create a
little function inside of your action
and you could also do more things like
what if we wanted to change the button
value we could say button dot Val toggle
me so we click the button says toggle me
so you can do a lot of things within a
function that's pretty good for now play
around with this and have a little bit
of fun and I'll try to think of
something clever for the next tutorial
