this python tutorial we're going to do a
little bit on functions and how to get
help remember the last lesson variables
we can just assign them like that and
just type the variable now with
functions what these do is they can
manipulate data and the way a function
looks is like this it has the word and
then it has these parentheses on the
left and right and you put the data in
between here so if I said Len 5 Len is
short for length you actually have to
put a string in there so if I said Len
of Jessie it gives me 5 because it's 5
letters long if I did um Len without
parentheses and I did name remember we
assign name up here it also give us 5 so
you can use a variable or you can put in
a string a good thing to know is if you
need help on a function you can just
type help and then help is a function
and you do help lend but when you're
getting help you don't put the brackets
for the function so I type help link and
it tells me what it does there's quite a
bit of built-in functions and then also
something called import but I won't
cover that right now if you wanted to
let's say do find a maximum number say
max of 10 244 yeah enter and it's 200
now you can also use variables in there
so let's say B equals 50 C equals 1000
and make sure I had a typed up okay so
we can do max a b c and it'll give us
one thousand which is the c value
functions are available on a global
scale and what that means is that you
can use a function anywhere anytime the
variables you can't if we created a
custom function and add variables in
there we won't be able to use those
variables outside of the function unless
we specifically told it to but we might
get into that a little later let's make
a new python file and go to file new
window and we have this big blank area
let's just do something let's make a
comment and say my fun item okay and
what we're going to do is say a equals
10 b equals 100 and c equals 1000 and
we're going to say max but this is going
to be a let's assign this a variable
like biggest equals max a b c and now
biggest is a variable and this is going
to give us the maximum out of these
three and again it's going to be 1000
and then let's say print vegas okay and
i'm gonna file save as test dot py and
I'm going to go to run run module and it
gives us 1000 there's also other things
you can do like import objects and use
those I don't want to get too far ahead
though but just for fun let's do that
let's say import sys and that stands for
system if you want to see what's inside
of system you can type help sys
and it'll give us all this stuff here
and it might look kind of confusing you
can see copyright is a string of text
some of these are text and this just
appears to be system data so if I said
if I wanted better help on someone I'd
say help sis dot and then the name
let's do max size max size
okay enter and we get a bunch of details
on what this does and it looks a little
scary to look through all this stuff
let's go back down and without going too
far into import the reason for the dot
sis not let me get one sis taught
something this is the object and this is
the function or value within the object
but this is a little more advanced I'm
just showing you what it does because we
might have to use some imports for
general functionality
anyways that'll wrap up this tutorial
