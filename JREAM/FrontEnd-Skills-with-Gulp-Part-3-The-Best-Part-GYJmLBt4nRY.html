planned a two-part series but let's make
it even better this is going to be
really cool and I think you'll like it
for front-end development so if you
pulled the latest repository you'll
notice I made some few a few changes
I'll provide the repository in the
description I just kind of dominated it
so there's a little more organized I
prefer to do one clear line and then two
empty lines little stuff I also change
these for the paths instead of just
variables I kind of prefer this way so
the source for sass J is an image and
then the output I changed all this to an
output folder which we can delete
because Gopal generated and then here
just the names of our files so we can
change everything in one place so to
begin what I want to do is add a couple
of add-ons and I made sure to write the
code beforehand so it won't take
eternity all this to close out some of
these files so let's open our package
JSON and let's add a new one we're gonna
do browser - sync and we're going to use
two point two point three and a
gentleman mentioned that we can use a
squiggly and what that would do if I
understood correctly it would upgrade up
to well I guess if you can go to ten or
at least two point nine point nine those
kind of releases I'm gonna stick with
just hard coding it but if you want to
add the squiggly you can and I could
have sworn I saw a carrot but that could
have been a different package manager'
one other one I'd like to add right
above this would be cool
jas hint and jazz hint is a javascript
validator and that's 192 I'll say 190
okay so where am i okay so I'm just
going to do a npm install and i probably
have all this installed because i was
playing with it
browser sent might be a little large but
it's definitely worth it
in our gulp file now that we have that
installed we're gonna set some variables
so let's do a browser sync equals for
choir browser - sync and ok and let me
change the font size just in case you're
straining your eyes i usually don't work
in this size let's say 14 okay alright
so you're not straining your eyes okay
and let's go ahead and add j/s hint
pretty much the same thing it's a gold
guy so I'll keep them gathered with the
gulp guy so jus hint
and Jas hint okay so you'll notice that
we change these if you'd like you could
pause the screen and copy these out or
just go to the repository and copy paste
and we're gonna get flying shortly now
all in my repository I already replace
these with source sass and everything so
if you don't want to do any lifting it's
your call
so we have our sass file and when this
changes we want to update the browser
and to do so we need to do a browser
sync and add that in so let's add a pipe
at the bottom of this and we'll do
browser sync dot reload and we'll set a
string to true okay and I'm just gonna
make sure I didn't miss anything because
there's a lot of options okay now at the
moment that's not really gonna do
anything hey let's go down a little ways
okay and because we need to reload the
browser sync so to the watch method so
within here we can say browser sync in
it and do a little object in here and
the server name and for the server name
I'm gonna actually do mine an output
because that's where all the files go so
you do dot slash output this one will
generate our files remember we have an
output folder it used to be called dist
but I felt that was a little confusing
so let's make it a little easier and
then at the end of watching these guys
happen we'll do another gulp watch and
we want to watch for HTML files so if I
go to the top again
we don't have any HTML stuff in there so
let's go ahead and add HTML
I'll put it down here now this is the
output this isn't the source because
we're not really going to compile HTML
together unless you are using something
like I forget the name that short-handed
a Hamel h a ml but I'm not doing that so
I'll just end this HTML will be output
slash dot HTML and hopefully that is
correct I think we could probably do
subfolders where it's going to look
ok so I'll try this so look for any HTML
within subfolders and then going back
down let's see
okay so in our watch method we'll do
output 'html so remember we put one in
SAS
so if SAS is updated it's gonna trigger
browserify with right here it's gonna
trigger this guy reload and then down
here when it's watching this is going to
do the actual good stuff so it's going
to be that change event change now we're
gonna do browser sync dot reload okay so
since SAS has a listener for that it
will reload it and this also watches for
output dot HTML sorry that's not right
this is supposed to be stopped that is
right I keep reading this and it makes
me think of an HTML page I think that's
what's throwing me off so with this I'm
just gonna go ahead and test it and just
type cold now we have no HTML pages
there unfortunately
so this loads up a browser for you and
it gives you a place to work on so it
says cannot get right so if we look at
our output folder first thing I need to
do is make an index page so I'll go
ahead and do this and I'll just save
this as index.html because that's what
it's looking for and I already wrote
this code is just some Nancy pantsy
stuff okay and I'll save this now all we
did was include here's the index file
and we include the j/s app min and the
CSS admin right nothing super crazy okay
so I'm just gonna control see to cancel
this and try again and hopefully we get
something and it reloads okay now we're
in business so this is just sitting here
listening and what I'm gonna do is go to
my I can shrink the output folder and go
to the source files and the background
we could say background will be F D F D
F D and you see how it reloads live and
in 10px do we have an h1 in there I
don't remember I thought we did let's
check
I'll put index we have an h1 okay
that's inside a container so let's just
set a default h1 background of silver
ctrl s to save and we're looking at this
in real time padding 5 pixels and you
know if you fit this on your screen it's
just amazing
so that's browserify it's awesome it's
just really cool you can make a bunch of
HTML files in there too
I will say if you're using let's say PHP
or Django dance a candle side a set of
Django I have a monkey with that he that
is so well I don't even bother touching
it but with browser in it here you can
do something called proxy and then you
can pass your local development
environment
mine would be like project that's my
local environment and that local
environment is in your etc' host file
which i won't go into
I have no idea what this would do in
this situation this would be really
weird
I think it'll break it but I'll just try
it for your sake and you see that little
pop-ups I disconnected all you can't
specify both so I don't know what the
heck would happen because I don't even I
don't think it'll work okay
yeah it's loading my localhost okay but
that's cool you can proxy it to run an
actual project you know just for the
heck of it let's just try it
dream that out I don't even know if
that'll work so run gulp and let's see
what she opens wow that's cool so yeah
you could easily use a PHP server and
look at that so this is my local copy of
dream calm that's awesome I really like
it so I'll just come this out you might
have something like localhost / your
project whatever it is okay and for now
I'll just leave it first static pages
and I'll make sure to commit that output
right there you don't have to use output
you can make a separate folder called
app or whatever you want so let's go
ahead and wrap this video up with one
more thing and this is called a Jas int
so nsj let's do before the uglify and
brow yes we'll do dot pipe a Jas hint
and plate yes hint that reporter and we
can do a default they have a couple of
reporter options you can write to files
you can use a stylish one
the only problem with this I don't
believe it works with browserify if I
look at the browsersync because I
believe it needs a page reload for phone
we can go ahead and try it out and it's
kind of scary that go let me close that
close that okay and what I'm gonna do is
try to change you know gosh
close that okay change some JavaScript
and see what happens
alert dog oops
so I have an error here and let's see
some kind of it's telling me about a
semicolon I think it's from right here
so save again and you're kidding me I
didn't think that would work that's
pretty crazy man so coool obviously an
alert is incredibly annoying so you
probably don't want that but I'll leave
it there one other thing I want to show
you is when this is running you can go
to 3001 and you can create new tabs and
do quite a few things this is I haven't
gone through the full gamut of how this
works but it's pretty awesome it shows
where you're serving files from your
connected browsers a bunch of sync
options history and remote debugging I
mean this is just amazing so this is
really cool very impressed so hope you
guys like this video I will push this go
to the repository now thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
