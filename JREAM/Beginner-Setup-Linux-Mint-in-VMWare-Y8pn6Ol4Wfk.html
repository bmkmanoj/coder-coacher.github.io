video just on how to set up Linux in a
virtual machine and I hope you enjoy it
and feel free to skip through areas
first we need to choose our virtual
machine software there is VMware
Workstation Pro which is what I'll be
using I find it to be the most stable
for the most part or at least the
fastest there's also VMware Workstation
player however there is a VMware Player
that is 100% free
and there's the popular VirtualBox which
is also free to find the free version of
the VMware Player you might have to
download it from a third-party site
because their site VMware is a bit hard
to navigate to quickly look at
VirtualBox it looks a bit like this and
these are virtual machines for example
this says sent OS I actually don't have
this anymore I'll go ahead and remove
this or I don't want it and it's pretty
simple to configure Oracle VirtualBox we
will go to file preferences and this
would be our global preferences you can
set your default machine folder where
all of your virtual machines go so in
this example mine go to my user folder
VirtualBox VMs authentication things you
don't need to worry about then it just
has some settings here that really
you're not gonna monkey with what you'll
do is install third-party tools for the
guest so there's a host and a guest with
virtual machines if you look at my
background here this is Windows this is
my host and my host has a guest that
would be my virtual machine the wording
might be a little confusing sometimes
when you hear virtual machine but
just think of it as running an operating
system inside a container that's really
what you're doing and to summarize
VirtualBox if you were to create a new
machine you would need to say new give
it a name
I won't create one but I'll just say
we'll bun two for fun and you would
probably select 32 or 64 and I'll just
say next how much memory do you want to
assign it and this has to do with your
actual system memory on this computer I
have 32 gigs so I might give it let's
just pretend two gigs a small little
machine and what we do is create a
virtual hard disk but this is really a
file on your hard drive it's just called
a virtual hard disk and you can go ahead
and create one and I would just keep it
with the default VDI you don't really
need to worry about these and next and
you can do dynamically allocated or
fixed size if you're just beginning just
do dynamic and they give you details why
you might want to do something and you
can choose the size and change its
location and create it and once it's
created you would start it up it may
need a CD on it but I'll just press
Start quickly for an example okay and
then what it does is it asks us for an
ISO file and you would add the ISO from
this folder icon and go with the install
but I won't be using VirtualBox myself
you're free to it's uh it's great it's
easy I just like VMware so in VMware it
doesn't matter really what version you
have if you have let's say version 11
that'll work just fine
and what I'm gonna do is just shrink
some of these folders down I do have a
few hard drives on here to try to stay
organized and now I will go through with
the installation I'm gonna say file new
virtual machine and I'll just say custom
advanced and I want mine compatible with
I don't know twelve I don't need all the
new features and I will install the
operating system later or if you already
have the ISO you can click this I'm
gonna do it later because I want to make
sure that if you do this you'll know how
to add it on I'll say next and this is
going to be Linux I just selected the
version 3.0 X which is the kernel most
likely what you'll have if you're doing
Linux Mint if you're doing
Ubuntu you can usually probably get away
with this here we'll do that and what I
want to call mine I'm just gonna call
mine
int Y for NT and I'm gonna put mine in a
specific location so I don't fill up my
main hard drive like this so I'm gonna
put mine in T Drive in T just a short
little name and the name of this will be
the same name as our hosts that it
defines now by hosts I mean inside the
Linux machine because it thinks it's a
real system and the number of processors
I'm just going to give it to processors
and 2 cores it's not a big deal if you
should at least have two processors
unless you have a really old CPU it's
not going to use all of it but it's
available this is an 8 core CPU on my
machine it's a little bit dated now AMD
FX 8350 I believe and I'll say next and
the memory I want a lot of memory for
this so I'm gonna say 8 gigs
and that's really overkill but you can
get away with two gigs and for
networking all this is saying is use our
network that we currently have this one
used bridged networking would just have
its own IP different from your current
internet connection on your host machine
such as Windows but just stick with NAT
you'll be fine
and this just stick with LSI logic these
are details we don't really need to get
crazy about and the virtual disk type
looks like there's nvme support in the
newer versions possibly but I'm just
using a solid-state drive so I'll stick
with SCSI this isn't a real gamechanger
you can choose SATA if you want because
most of our connections are now SATA 3
so I'll say next and I'm gonna create a
new virtual disk and I can choose how
big I want this to be able to get and
I'm just gonna choose 50 gigabytes and
that's huge you can either allocate the
space now or just let it grow as it
grows the benefit to this is that you
have the size allocated permanently and
it can be a little bit faster I don't
want to do that I want to kind of save
disk space because they're getting full
and by default is a split virtual disk
into multiple files so you'll have a
whole bunch of files it's not too bad in
smaller chunks so it's easier to move
around or you can do one big file so if
this were to get to let's say 12
gigabytes it would be a 12 gigabyte file
the multiple one it may be twelve
different files all of each that are one
gigabyte to me I'm just gonna do
single file even though it organizes it
in a folder just nice it doesn't make a
difference either way and I'm just gonna
leave the disc filename to NT now notice
they use VMDK that's just a file
extension for a virtual machine which is
also compatible with virtual box ok and
you can customize your hardware and it
opens up our guy here we kind of went
through this through the helper and I'm
not gonna change anything here I'm just
gonna finish and you should have a new
box up here I'm gonna pop mine under a
folder if you want to make folders you
should be able to right click my
computer and say new folder but you
don't have to do that so I have NT here
it's a little bit small to read so if I
try to power it on I don't have a disk
image installed and it says do you want
to try to connect to the virtual device
every time and what it's trying to do is
connect to the hard drive right now now
there's actually nothing here so it
doesn't know what to do remember we
didn't attach a CD and I did that on
purpose so I'm gonna open Windows
Explorer and I apologize that it's a
little bit small so here's T Drive and I
made the folder in T and inside of here
we've got a few files if it has a lck
file that just means it's locked these
will go away once it's done running this
is a virtual memory file that it
reserves only when it's running as well
nothing you need to worry about this is
your main file for your virtual machine
the VMDK now you can actually open this
and let's say sublime text and oh my
mistake
that's not the right file you want to
open the vmx file
whoops such as this and this is the
actual configuration now this isn't
something you're really gonna have to
mess with only in some cases and older
versions you might have to add a few
lines to fix the mouse so if I wanted to
fix the mouse mm-hmm back buttons
because it's a virtual machine I'm gonna
go ahead and head over to github in a
web browser and I'm here I'm just going
to go to my repository and this is just
called whoops configure ubuntu
just so you know my main repository is
github.com slash dream and you can find
configure ubuntu and I'll just scroll
down and look for VMware fix mouse side
buttons okay
so this would be really the only example
that I use for virtual sorry VMware I
don't you don't do this in virtual box
the one by Oracle so I'll copy this for
example and I can close that and go back
to this file and you might just paste it
in there what it's doing is just enable
a USB and virtual USB so if needed pause
the video and copy or type these lines
and you'll be able to enter this back at
any time you need to if your back
buttons what I mean are like side
buttons on your mouse is generally what
this fix is if I try to save it it might
it looks like it did save so that's good
so I'll go ahead and shut this down
power shutdown guess and you're going to
need to download an OS and I'm going to
go with Linux Mint the reason is because
I think it'll be the easiest and most
comfortable for you let's say you're
coming from Windows and you would just
go to download and the difference
between mate well these are for whoops
these are for different options you have
here
cinnamon mate xfce and KDE what this is
is these are the user interfaces and you
could do a simple google search for
cinnamon mate xfce or KDE and I know the
naming there are a lot of gooeys it can
get confusing so cinnamon is what I
downloaded and also you can install any
of these later on if you want to and I'm
using 64-bit if you do not have a 64-bit
processor make sure to get a 32-bit I
will say that cinnamon in general just
due to the graphics will use a a
gigabyte or more of memory vs mate mate
is basically the very stripped-down
version of cinnamon xfce is very
stripped-down and lightweight and KDE is
probably the heaviest and it's one of
the most popular it's probably the most
similar to Windows but if you use
cinnamon mate xfce the user interface
they're all very similar
I just think sentiments kind of pretty
and I think most people will like it so
with this I need to right-click go to
settings
and I need to add a CD or dvd item in
here now you don't have to do it this
way I'm just doing it this way to show
you in case you forget that step some
time some time so use ISO image file and
I will browse and I like to save my
downloads into a certain folder called
OS operating systems and you'll have a
ISO that you downloaded at this point of
recording I have Linux Mint 18 point
three cinnamon and I'll press ok and
connect on power on and ok and hopefully
that runs or boots that is I might have
to press up there goes if it doesn't
boot you may have to press f1 and go
into BIOS and then just boot from there
there's a boot menu in BIOS but it
should work so I'll just start Linux
Mint and what they call this is the live
CD almost every Linux distribution has
it except for something like Arch Linux
which is something a bit it's too
complicated where you have to customize
everything nowadays Linux is really good
about drivers and most things will work
just fine
so we're powering the live CD on so it's
not actually installed in the hard drive
on our hard drive the disk size I'm
gonna go ahead and close this while it
boots up
and you'll get a pretty little welcome
screen if I stretch it you'll notice
that the size of them big and there's
two reasons for that it has to do with
the VM install the VMware tools or
sometimes that automatically installs
with the late later Linux version but we
can also say right-click and change the
screen size not sure if it's under I
think it's under desktop no desktop
settings yeah it's a little hard to work
in this tiny window but it's not gonna
matter too much I'll go back and then
I'm looking for displays so I'll just
type D is this play and you could change
it here I'll just make this a little bit
bigger and apply it I'll just keep it
but this is temporary so I'm going to
install an ex Mint by clicking the CD
and all of these installations are
pretty much the same for Linux English
continue and install third-party
software I'm gonna go ahead and do it
why not although I won't be using flash
or mp3 Wi-Fi will work anyways because
this is a virtual machine that goes
through our hosts so as long as for me
Windows is installed it should be fine
and if you don't want to do that step
that's fine and it's perfectly fine in
this case to just use the default option
there if you do install on a laptop or
as an actual boot device it's a little
bit different and please do not select
this option if you want it to dual boot
but this is a virtual machine that lives
by itself so I'll install now and I'll
just continue because there really is
nothing
in this virtual imaginary device and
your time zone and the keyboard it
usually gets it right you can click the
tech keyboard layout
it'll just ask you hey type these but
English for me and English us for me if
yours is different you would change that
and your name I'll just say Jessie and
your computer name actually had it wrong
at the start I'm gonna call this NT that
may have to do with the other
VirtualBox this fellow the blue guy that
defaults it to your file name and I'd
like to login automatically and use a
really simple password make sure you set
a password because you want to be able
to do super user commands I just do a
really easy password okay and you can
call this whatever you want by the way
continue now in the background it was
already working which is quite nice and
if you're really curious what is it
doing it's installing things here and we
just wait for this to install it's quite
a bit faster than say installing Windows
10 might take about five to 15 minutes
depending on your computer setup so our
installation has completed let's go
ahead and restart now
I'll go ahead and press ENTER because by
default it should be removed once it's
installed if not you would simply go to
VM removable devices the CD and there
would be a disconnect option there so
this will be our first boot up of
cinnamon and we get a welcome screen
feel free to go through this if you like
and I don't want this to show up now if
I stretch it it's not stretching what I
want to do is go to VM install VMware
tools and this is going to add a CD
drive that pops up and we don't have
much real estate here but there's a
tar.gz file I'm just gonna right-click
and copy and I'll go to my home folder
and I suppose download some place to
place it and just paste it here because
that is a virtual DVD we can't extract
it I'll right-click and I should be able
to extract here and we have this file
here so what I want to do is actually
open up this area in a terminal which is
nice in the context menu if I
right-click I can open in terminal and
this is really hard to read by default I
I usually use terminator I'm just gonna
go to edit preferences and hopefully I
can make this readable
and change some of the colors I don't
want to transparent background and I
would like the font a little bit bigger
so that you can read it scrolling
compatibility
custom font and I want to change the
font size 18 okay and that's really big
but oh well so we're in here if i type
LS that short for list we have a thing
called vmware install dot PL which is
short for Perl and to run that I want to
use run as a super user pseudo dot slash
which means current directory vmware
install dot PL and you can press enter
or you can do dash D so that you don't
have to go through all the prompts and
just type in the password that you
created if you didn't pass in the dash d
you'll just pretty much press enter and
what this does is it'll let our display
be flexible so that we can stretch it
according to our host machine outer
window size which is really convenient
rather than always having a fixed size
and ok it's done so we shouldn't see
anything happen at first because we have
to log out so menu and they have little
icons here that's shut down here's leave
this session and logout and I may need a
reboot but this should reload the ex
session
and I will go to view Auto sighs make
sure auto fit guest is on and auto fit
window and hopefully it works if I
stretch it you should see some
stretching and if you have some errors
or you don't see this happen you may
have to look on some forums on how to
get it totally right and may differ her
version a little bit or it's sometimes
the past depends on your guest operating
system so if I make this bigger I have a
virtual machine here of course you can
use a lot lower end Linux distribution
just depends on your preference that
uses much less memory it's faster but I
do like it to develop software and I can
close this panel here and even make it
bigger okay
so what we have down here is our menu
and it looks a lot like Windows doesn't
it it's very nice you can search for
something say Firefox and you'll notice
these are some shortcuts here as well
and I'll just click Firefox and one of
the first things you may want to do is
download Chrome
I'm liking Opera quite a bit I'm gonna
download this well that's not good oh I
went to a site it's no good and using
Yahoo search here which probably isn't
the best download for Linux and I prefer
to save the file and then I'll also get
Chrome
I don't trust these ads on Yahoo Chrome
for desktop download Chrome and we
always want a dot DB file Debian Ubuntu
that's what most the most popular
systems are based on rpm Fedora open
SUSE that would also apply to Red Hat
and cent OS so I'll go ahead and
download that as well and one thing I
like to do since I've always used
Windows is when I click menu I go into
my system settings and I go to keyboard
and then up here shortcuts and I believe
it's launchers in this example launch
terminal okay by default this is ctrl
alt T so if I press that I get my
terminal which is something you'll
always be using one of the great
benefits of Linux is how beautiful our
terminal is and I believe Mac OS X also
has something similar but usually the
home folder looks like they already
assigned it to super e and that's what I
wanted cuz that's the same as Windows
I'll press super e and let me undo my
screen a little bit because I get kind
of sore eyes so it's a little bit
brighter and if I go to the Downloads
folder this by default should use the G
Debbie package manager if you're using
the default bun too it has its own
software manager which is quite poor
it's by default usually not too great
and we'll type in our super user
password to install software and we can
go ahead and delete the VMware stuff
and I can go ahead and open up or stable
we could only install one thing at a
time much like Windows you may try to
uninstall two things at once but you
have to wait for the Installer to finish
if this pops up it's just going to
install a dependency no should have that
and I can go ahead and close this and
you would really do a lot of what you
normally do in any OS at this point
so you want to update opera together
sure and clothes and installation
complete and I should be able just
delete those now if I go to my menu
I'll have chrome did I say chrome what I
can do is right-click and click Add to
panel add to desktop i will add mine to
my panel you can also add it to your
favorites which will be this bar here or
it really depends but how you have it
set up when you have multiple things set
up so if I add chrome here I can pop it
up there but I also want to add it to
panel so it's down here
and then there was opera add to panel
down at the bottom and how about
favorites okay and we can just kind of
drag these over this UI is very nice
I'll go ahead and close out some of
these and it really looks like any other
operating system here is opera it's a
very nice browser by the way it is using
WebKit or just looks just like Chrome
it's just a lot faster for me just to
show you a quick configuration I'll go
ahead and right-click and you can turn
panel model edit mode on like this and
this will have to do with adding new
items and then you can modify your panel
add applets to the panel and an applet
that I really like is the virtual
desktops so I'm just going to look for
desktops
there should be one if you're used to
Mac OSX there's an expo view you can add
this and you see added these three dots
here when edit mode is on I can drag
this and move it here but it'll probably
snap to somewhere over there but I can
move it around over here wherever you
want to put it if you want it it's very
nice to tweak toggle around and I'm just
looking for one show desktop I believe
that is this is it this icon yeah the
show desktop icon it looks like a folder
in this theme anyways system tray user
applets window list and workspace
switcher I do like this one so I'll go
ahead and add it okay and it adds this
so below I have for virtual workspaces I
can go ahead and close this for now and
I'm gonna turn off edit mode try not to
forget that cuz you might try clicking
things and they don't work you just have
to make sure edit mode is off but for me
I prefer my panel at the top so I'll
modify panel move panel and you just
select you want it on the side I just
like mine at the top right and I'm gonna
go ahead to modify our panel settings
and what they do is they allow you to
always show or hide if you prefer just
like Windows and then here you can do
customize the panel which I like to do
because I like things bigger so you can
make it bigger it's a little easier to
see there you know ahead and close that
so there's my virtual desktops oh I know
he's kind of scared me so you can turn
those noises off under settings you can
press the Windows key to open this and I
believe this one's the settings or the
main control center they call it
and you could just type sou for sound
and sound effects
I just want them all off I'll just type
themes and let's see desktop looks like
a lot of these didn't install
so to install just a theme I can
download the popular one here and maybe
another one and another it's only this
only takes disk space it's only going to
run one at a time obviously and I can go
back to themes and let's see the desktop
theme I now have a few like new minty
and has a little bar on the top there
you may notice slight changes like
here's green input here this isn't a
very big change but you can change your
windows borders as well and there's a
lot better options usually through the
terminal that you can install something
you might just look up on Google same
with the controls if you prefer them
dark hey guys I forgot to mention if
you're interested in sysadmin and
getting really good with Linux I have a
limited course coming out and you can
sign up for the announcement it is only
for a certain amount of people because I
will be offering support and live
streams so it's going to be a private
group to get you launched improve your
career give you a new skill if you want
to get down to business with Linux and
be a boss so check it out and sign up if
you're interested thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
