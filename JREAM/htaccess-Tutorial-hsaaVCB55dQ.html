in this tutorial we're going to take a
look at HT access and that's this little
dot file that goes on a directory for
your website and in Windows you can't
create this file you'd have to upload it
like a blank text file to FTP and rename
it to HT access and then download it and
put it in a folder that's if you're
working on on your hard drive if you're
going to distribute in htaccess file I'd
also recommend creating a copy of it
like that
and putting like a underscore before it
and that way people on Macintosh and
Linux won't have the file hidden because
on those systems a dot file is hidden by
default and if they unzipped your
content and your application relies on
that that'd be a big problem let's get
rid of the index.php page and we get a
forbidden thing if this was just a
directory one two lists we could say
options + indexes ok refresh and we'll
get a nice little index here we could
change the way it's listed by saying
index options and fancy indexing and
that kind of changes it up if you wanted
to leave these settings here and just
turn off the listing you could put a
minus sign instead of the plus boom but
I'm going to turn that back on and
refresh well let's see you can change
the default page as you know index dot
PHP or index dot HTML that would be the
default directory page if you wanted to
change that you could say directory
index and let's say main dot PHP and a
refresh and even though we have an index
file here if there is no main file and
it looks for that otherwise it just
lists this directory so you could rename
this to main dot PHP refresh
and this will be the main page but I
don't really want to do that
it's all very set back to our directory
listing if we wanted to ignore some file
extensions we could say index ignore and
star for wildcard that means anything
dot txt for text files and if you wanted
to add another one we could do star dot
o and here's a text file and icon file i
refresh and now they're hidden I'll go
ahead and erase that another thing you
can do is if you wanted your own file
extensions like let's make one this main
dot PHP file let me add some PHP in here
whoops
and I'll say echo hey it works okay so
that's a PHP file and if I rename that
to let's say main Jesse I'll refresh
this and go to main chassis and it just
shows up as plain text if you wanted a
your own extension to parse what you
could say you have to add type and I had
to look this up application X httpd PHP
and then the file extension name in in
this case is Jesse and this will serve
dot Jesse as a PHP file and it parses it
pretty cool on alright so let's erase
that um if you're thinking about
security and stuff I guess here's a real
good way to start start with the files
tag and let's say let's pick a file how
about a dot txt that's right here and we
don't want anyone to access it or to see
it and we can change the settings to
this file right in this little block I'd
say order allow comma deny and deny from
all one thing you need to know is you
can't have a
space after that comma and I'll hit
refresh and the e-file is gone let's try
to go to it a dot txt and says you don't
have permission and here's what happens
when you put a space after that comma
you get an internal 500 error that means
that dhdx is file is misconfigured so
refresh also you could block out a
handful of files let's say files match
and we'll do the same thing order allow
deny and deny from all and this will be
a little regular expression so put two
quotes and we're going to start with a
period but for the extension but it
needs to be escaped because this is a
character and a regular expression then
we're going to create a group with these
parentheses and let's just say txt or
ICO okay and then we're going to put a
dollar sign here for the end of this
string I'll save that and refresh and
the txt and Ike are hidden let's also
add PHP refresh ooh not good refresh and
I forgot what the name of the text file
was oh there was one called a dot txt
let's try to go that a dot txt and it
won't let you do it
alright and let's get back this umm you
can also change it from listing I might
already brought this up and sorry if I
did you can say index ignore star that's
a wild card this will ignore everything
get rid of everything or you could do
asterisks dot PHP and it won't list the
pH PHP files
let's do star dot txt
now this only changes the listings we
can still go to the e dot txt and you
can see I have some notes here and I
think that might be good for this
tutorial you can add default car set and
you can do like ISO whatever it is I
always use utf-8 and let me create a
well I don't know any other character
sets for a folder listing alright I
think that's good guys and thanks for
