RDS or relational database service and I
started using it and I really like it
it's basically just a relational
database hosted on Amazon servers so
it's like a dedicated sequel server I'm
using it myself and I really like Amazon
services so I'm gonna go down to the
features and they have automatic backups
which is really nice if you've ever had
to restore my sequel or create your own
backup script it's it's a lot of work so
it's nicely do they do this
automatically for you
database snapshots are like automatic
backups but they're just your own manual
snapshot and a bunch of other settings
I'm not gonna get into I'm gonna get to
the pricing the classes we have our
micro small medium and then just super
huge and then I'm I actually bought a
micro because 630 Meg's for memory
that's a lot further the stuff I do I
don't have like any huge sequel stuff
going on so let's go down to the price
and on-demand instances if you don't
know Amazon services yet Honda man
basically means the moment you create it
this is how much you'll be charged per
hour so if I take out my calculator a
micro instance is 25 cents and there's
about 720 hours in a month that would
run you 18 dollars a month for the micro
DB instance and in my opinion that's
kind of high if you factor and you're
also gonna need a web server and you
don't want to be on a shared hosts ever
if you ask me so we'll go down a little
bit more I'm gonna skip this multi AZ
deployment and reserved instances and
this is what I purchased a reserved
instance you'll save a lot of money in
the long run so the micro what you do is
you pay
from on a one-year or a three-year term
and then your hourly fees are less so
for example we had eighteen dollars a
month if we times that by twelve months
that be two hundred sixteen dollars a
year multiply it by three years at six
hundred forty eight dollars and in three
years you can see spending a lot on this
and with this they have different
utilization packages there's a light
there's a medium and there's a heavy and
basically the difference is if you paint
you pay a little bit more upfront for a
cheaper hourly rate and I actually got
the heavy utilization for a three-year
term so if I did the math that's point
oh eight cents an hour times 720 times
twelve and then times three and I have
to add on a hundred dollars for the up
from price plus one hundred so you know
I'm saving a little well over three
hundred dollars if I look at this as a
long-term thing to use and I'll show you
how to deploy these and set these up as
well so that's basically how it works
it's just your upfront fee if you wanted
to do that if not you won't have to I
can't imagine using one for 6,200
upfront that's crazy
must be fraud a huge company so in the
Amazon management console there's so
many tools and it's just so fun to look
at right here RDS if you choose to
purchase a reserved instance it would be
under reserve DB purchase now once I
click this little thing pops up that
says look at their new look and I prefer
their new look way more it's just easier
to use and you see this is a reserve
purchase and when you purchase it it's
like well what do I do with this
what you do is you just create an
instance of the same class which in my
case is a micro and multi AZ weather if
you picked yes or no and I believe
that's it and then you'll be charged the
correct rate so I already have an
instance running right now but I'll go
ahead and launch a new DB instance so I
can give you an example and I'm gonna
choose my sequel and you just choose a
licensed model the price selected by
default depending on what you pick I'll
just pick the latest my sequel and then
you can pick the size in this case mine
was a micro you don't have to do a
reserved instance either this is just
showing you how to deploy multi AZ no
because it costs more and auto my no
minor version upgrade I could leave that
on and I just thrown five gigs here you
could do whatever you want they can go
up to three thousand gigs which is was
about three terabytes that's ridiculous
and for the instance I'll just call this
testing my master username will be user
and user if they let me do that now let
me type something up
okay that'll be my password since
there's just gonna be a test instance
I'll go ahead and hit continue and I
cannot contain the @ sign continue okay
and the database name now you should
know that this isn't just like a
database you only put one database in it
it's like you can put a whole bunch in
so I'll just call this testing you can
change the port if you want availability
zone to this it might matter to you but
it doesn't to me and for a DB security
group that's what you'll probably need
help with and you can set up your backup
and everything I'm just gonna hit
continue because everything looks good
for now
okay so I'm just gonna write down the
database I made and if I go to my
instances this is creating and it might
take like 10 minutes not sure this one
took a while to create but I'm gonna go
to security groups ok now this I'm not
even using this so I'm gonna go ahead
and delete it
delete okay I guess it deleted it it
didn't update it there we go so I'll
create a security group and I'll call
this testing great for YouTube okay and
I'll go ahead and head in here with this
little details page and a CIDR / IP this
gives permission for you to access it
and you have to use this and this is
good because it prevents unauthorized
people from accessing it so in this case
I'll use my IP and the slash 32 all that
means is that it's a host so I'll go
ahead and add now if you're using a
dedicated server or VPS you would also
want to put in all your static I piece
here so that you could access it from
there and I'll get into that so let me
go to my instances this is still
creating I want to be able to change my
security group here right now it's
default but I want to change it to
testing looks like it took me back
select I'm gonna have to wait until it's
created while it's creating let me tell
you a couple of things
tags are pretty cool add tags to your DB
instance to organize and track your
costs I'm pretty sure every Amazon
service has a tag and basically in your
bill you'll see what cost what and it'll
give you a breakdown and you can tag
things how you want so I'll just add
this as
DB YouTube and sometimes the value isn't
required in s3 I believe it is so then
in my bill I'll see how much it costs
this will probably cost like maybe 10
cents to do this whole video so let me
bring up another fact about when you
want to launch this with your web server
you're going to need to open port 3306
TCP incoming and outgoing that's really
important to remember okay because it's
likely that if you're using Plesk or
cpanel it's blocked okay so in plastic I
actually have Plesk installed I'll go
ahead and go there let me break this out
okay PLAs
and let me log in real quick
okay so here's Plesk and you're probably
confused when you look at this if you've
never used Plus but here's modules is
where you would go to and you would go
to your firewall and you would edit your
firewall configuration you would add a
custom rule and you would just call it
like AWS database and this would have to
be three 3:06
and you'd call it AWS and just click Add
they're just TCP and then you would
click OK you would also do the same
thing for the outgoing exact same thing
3 306 because you're reading and writing
to that and there is one other thing you
might encounter if you're not able to
connect on your server and that's called
a config server
I forgot that acronym for config server
or something like that but this might
have to be configured if you want to
open up that port for cPanel I don't use
cPanel because it's so ugly and it looks
like it's from the 90s I actually don't
like using these control panels to be
honest the reason I do use them is
because it just saves a lot of time
nobody has a bunch of time for that so
what I'm gonna do is open up SQL yob ok
let me close this out
so I'll make a new connection no and
I'll call this YouTube AWS okay and
we'll put in the user and the password
okay I'll just save it for now it's not
gonna be localhost they'll provide us
with a host when it's done being created
and the reason I'm using SQL yog rather
than heidi SQL is because heidi SQL
isn't as good at SSH tunneling you have
to install p link and all this other
junk so like I said this can take up to
ten minutes to install so I'm gonna
pause the video until it's done and then
resume alright guys it looks like I
paused the video and it's done now it
took like 30 seconds so what you do is
you have this end point right here copy
the whole thing except for the port
number that comes after the colon and
just paste it in this guy I'll save and
connect and let's see unknown server
host
I get that right
this should be good I'm gonna refresh
the page make sure it is not lying this
is the endpoint which we connect to and
test connection unknown MySQL host
addressed I have to SSH alright this is
embarrassing I forgot to update the
security group so
security groups
I want to hunt intestine
or is an instance actions modify
security group will be testing there we
go and continue modify and it's
available so it's adding testing and
removing the other
horn does that take that's odd
so what I'll do is I'm gonna open up
Ming GW and connect to this see what
happens so I'll say MySQL slash you user
slash P for password slash host and edit
paste that host and the password was
these are one two three four five paste
unknown server interesting
that's very troublesome perhaps it takes
a little bit longer than I suspected
when I first installed this one it went
pretty quick alright guys I'm back took
about an extra five minutes for this to
actually be connectable so sorry it's
quite embarrassing but more so for
Amazon than me yeah so I'm connecting
and it comes with this stuff in here
already you never want to delete your
MySQL table and your information schema
obviously but I'll just right-click and
create a database I'll call this YouTube
create a new database and call it
YouTube rocks and create a table just
call it tests and it's pretty much the
same thing you're used to with MySQL and
all that good stuff okay so I'll go
ahead and close this out I just wanted
to show you guys it working so there she
is I'm gonna actually delete this
instance now because I don't want to
accidentally leave it chill in there I
don't want a final slam snapshot
okay so delete that and let me just say
one more thing if I go to the testing
and I would add my server IPS and all
that if you want to add any IP you can
do just one dot one dot one dot one and
there might be 0.0 also I'm not a
hundred percent certain on that but that
about sums it up so check it out and
it's pretty sweet thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
