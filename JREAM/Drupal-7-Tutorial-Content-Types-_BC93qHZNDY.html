content types and drupal and if you go
down under structure we had this content
types here and you might be thinking
well what is this what this is is when
you're going to create content such as
let's say add content we create a
section for this so there we have
article this is a different kind of
content and beast basic page you might
say well why would I want to do that I
guess we'll go ahead and just make one
so go to structure and content types and
we're going to add a content type so you
can get an idea of what this is and
let's just call this new logos or
something like that and this would be
like a type where we update logos okay
might be a bad example but we'll go with
that and then you can select some of
these options here I don't want to
promote the front page display settings
I don't want to display that comments or
close instead and many settings just to
the main menu good there's no privacy by
role that's just a plug-in I have so
let's go ahead and save content type and
now we have one here called new logos
and if we want to add content we would
have new logos here now it kind of seems
like well what's the point what we can
do is go back to structure and we're
going to edit the content type that we
just made and we're going to go to
manage fields and this is pretty cool
and what the new logo obviously those
require an image so we'll call this logo
i suppose and field will be called field
logo and for the field type this will be
an image and it automatically selects
that for us go ahead and
save and save field settings doesn't
allow us early to change anything there
and it comes up with a new panel with a
bunch of stuff and you could go through
these if you wanted I'm just going to
leave them pretty much the same there's
just a lot of stuff in there it's pretty
cool and customizable all right
additionally let's add one called I
guess short I'll just call it short for
I guess a short description and I'll pop
in text for this one and save and 255
max length is fine and they give us even
more settings a lot of stuff okay so we
have that and now if we go to add
content and I want to create a new logos
area kind of like if this were like a
blog post or something and i'll just
call this fish art blah and on this
content create page you see here's our
forum for the logo field and here's the
form for the short or i guess your
subscription about something if we want
it extra details here we could choose an
image file i'll just upload this
and now it's on the file there and I'll
just provide a menu link for this one
and save okay and it'll show us our new
things so on our content type what we
have is our logo here with this custom
field I know it doesn't look too fancy
and then a extra field down here and if
we go back to content you can see the
type is for new logos now that's
probably not the best example but they
already give you content types that are
pretty good if I want to add content
articles pretty good but if for any
reason you want to do additional stuff
go ahead and check out content types and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
