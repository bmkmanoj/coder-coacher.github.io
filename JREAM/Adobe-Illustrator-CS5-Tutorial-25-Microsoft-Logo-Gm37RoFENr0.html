this tutorial we're gonna try to make
the shape of the Microsoft logo and
first what I'm gonna do is create a
square and the next thing I think what
I'll do is create the gaps in between it
so kind of like this and what we want to
do is have these on the exact center
point and I'm going to create one more
and have this on the exact center point
okay and with these two white things I'm
going to group them like that so that's
one piece now for the white I mean for
the orange thing let's go to effect warp
flag and you probably want it on
horizontal let's see here
yeah actually looks pretty close to it
we got a little problem down here it
appears and up here we can manually edit
that out
I'm not going to try to get it exact but
it also looks like it warps kind of down
here too so okay let's just do this and
for the plus symbol we can just make it
bigger okay
and what I'm going to do is divide it
like this and then I'm going to go to
object expand appearance kay and we have
a kind of a funny-looking thing this
doesn't actually look right so let's try
that once more effect or flag let's see
yeah that actually looks correct like
that so I'm going to go to object expand
and I'm going to make sure I expand this
piece to okay and let's divide those and
there we go
so I'm going to hold control shift and
press G to ungroup it and for the colors
you just grab your little eye pointer
here let's do a little gradient on these
since that's how they look
so I'll click this add a gradient and
for this piece I'll just grab the
furthest right corner I guess I'm gonna
have to do it like this and then the
furthest bottom corner and we can just
drag these down here and here and this
is a linear well it looks kind of radial
so I guess we'll reverse those colors
and yeah that looks pretty close for the
green let's just grab the corner piece
grab that color and the inner piece grab
that color and we'll just apply the same
gradient but with different colors and
let's grab the corner piece there and
the corner piece here and same thing
when we gotta do it one more time and
for the blue piece without a really
light blue there it's almost white and a
really dark blue here okay now time to
fix up the gradient whoops this should
go kind of up here and circle it a
little bigger and for this one it's kind
of up here like that and whoops
okay so the colors aren't really perfect
no big deal we can add a drop shadow to
make the pieces look better but it looks
like they're a little closer together
I'm just going to move these two pixels
together and if I put this over here
and kind of tilt it and you know it
doesn't have to be perfect but that's
pretty close and yeah the circle would
just be a circle little gradient thingy
so I just grabbed the circle tool I send
it to the back and just like we did
before we'll grab the brightest color
and pry the darkest color and we can pop
on a little gradient here and the
direction is kind of like from the
bottom up and it looks like it has a
circle up here which fades so I'll copy
ctrl F and make this white and it's a
little smaller and then we'll do a
gradient fade let's try to we want it
kind of like that let me get the white
in here that's a little bright okay
I'm going to group these with ctrl G pop
this in the middle now I mean if we're
honest this doesn't look exactly like it
but just a little rundown then now you
can go to effect stylize drop shadow and
let's see what that does
I mean you know mess around with it but
I'm not going to put this one up on the
website because it's Microsoft kind of
logo well I think that's enough for this
