CoffeeScript and before you click close
because I know there's a lot of hatred
towards CoffeeScript because it's like
well isn't this a layer on top of
JavaScript in a sense yes but in reality
no because it's compiled down into
native JavaScript okay and to install
this it's very simple you need no j/s if
you're in a Windows environments you can
head over to know Jas and just install
the MSI in windows in Linux it's just a
sudo command and pretty easy so this
isn't really about installing nodejs but
i will show you you can just type node
and that would mean note is installed on
Linux you might have to type well come
on there we go you might have to type
note or no Jas one or the other and it
comes with NPM in that stands for node
package manager node package manager
could be thought of like PHP's composer
it could be thought of like Bauer if
you've ever used that for front-end
management Python pip for package
management and even rubygems and NPM has
a lot of cool packages there's a NPM
browser as well online or you can test
out different packages and have a lot of
fun and the reason I want to talk about
CoffeeScript is because I have a lot of
gripe with JavaScript and I've worked
with a lot of people who do javascript
similar but totally different and you
can mix CoffeeScript with angular if you
are an angular user just so you know but
javascript itself has a lot of flaws and
I've seen them time and time again and
it's it's getting old so a colleague of
mine dan saket jumped in the
CoffeeScript just right away and I was
reviewing some of this code and I just
thought this
is gorgeous it's very clean it looks
like Python and if you've used python
python it's possibly one of the cleanest
languages to read and i'm not saying
that as like PHP's bad but python is
very very nice and elegant the syntax
anyways so CoffeeScript if I wanted to
install this with the node package
manager I haven't installed but I'd say
npm install coffeescript and it says you
misspelled coffeescript but the truth is
it doesn't look like i did so let me do
NPM uninstall CoffeeScript okay now
there's a difference here the dash G
means global so I'll do NPM LS which
stands for the list and it looks like
there are no node packages installed now
i'll type npm LS dash g for global and
look at all this stuff that's installed
ok I'm on Windows and Linux is it's
close to the same but you don't always
want install something globally in this
case CoffeeScript would be just fine so
i'll say npm install globally
CoffeeScript and there it is and I
should be able to do NPM LS global and
in this crazy-looking tree which is
actually fairly organized there should
be a coffee script right here ok and
cordova is just like a kind of a mobile
thing i believe there's so many packages
it's hard to keep up so there it is and
to know that it's working you should be
able to type coffee like this so one
plus one equals two nothing super cool
there the goal of this is so that
you're actually writing JavaScript but
in a cleaner syntax and what happens is
you can use CoffeeScript to compile down
into native JavaScript so you're never
including your coffee script files on
your actual public server people don't
see that they see the JavaScript and
something you might use is gulp j/s or
the built in CoffeeScript compiler and
what you want to do is have a watch mode
on what watch would do is every time you
save your file it compiles like let's
say this assignment well that's not
really different this function here into
this right here okay and some key things
to notices the functions look a lot
different in at first it's like well
what the heck is going on well let's
just dissect it real quick we have
square which is a variable square here
and if I go to the top notice that we
have VAR at the top if you're used to
defining your variables beforehand which
is very good practice in javascript in
coffea automatically handles that and
back to this so we have our square
variable and then this right here in the
parentheses is actually the function
argument X okay so no need to type out
function this arrow is what goes inside
the function right here and this just
does x times X okay so a lot of the
stuff is going to be so beautiful i hope
that i can convince you in a short
amount of time to at least try it out
and check it out it's basically showing
CoffeeScript in the contrast of what
javascript looks like if you really
enjoy writing JavaScript like this
that's no problem I've done it for quite
a long time and I'm really
tired of it and if I didn't mention it
before i'll mention it again that
everybody has a different style and
there's no consistency at least with
CoffeeScript it's readable it makes
sense and there could be a better
opportunity for a standard so i'll
scroll down a little bit you can read
all this if you'd like and this is just
another example of a function using the
square function and these two lines of
code produce these lines of code now
obviously VAR is optional i would
recommend it but in essence it's
producing this it will produce this as
well but it does save time those are
just simple things so if we have a
method like this this is what's
absolutely beautiful you can have
defined variables like in I believe
every single language written except
maybe assembly and stuff like that and
any database stuff you know in
JavaScript that you cannot have a
default value you have to check the
value if it's empty for example if
undefined equals equals equals liquid
then we assign it a default value okay
and I just love this feature it's a game
changer and again this is a function so
this guy here in parentheses is the
function right here and then these
braces right here are what comes after
here and we just tab it over and you see
like I said this is detecting if liquid
is set and then it sets a default value
if you're building a big application you
can imagine doing this all over the
place it becomes pretty irritating and
lastly it returns a value now as I
understand a function always return
something even if you don't define it
I'm not certain on that I'm still
learning coffeescript and I'm absolutely
loving it so
what's cool about this is it has strings
that can insert in the variables so this
number sign in brackets container would
represent container and the same with
liquid rather than having to concatenate
with the plus symbol like that and I
know you can use stuff like templates
and underscore and but this is just so
simple I'll go down and an interesting
thing is objects and arrays it's
basically showing all of this stuff is
this stuff but what's the benefit well
you could think of this as a benefit
maybe not if I look at this bit list
you'll notice there's no commas at the
end and it's easier to read in this one
it has a comma after every single entry
except the last one and then for an
object here then this is optional
because you can still use objects it
says kids brother sister and then that
and everything's set up by tabs and it
just translates into an object like that
very nice it also shows how to use
jQuery with it and honestly I did find
this part a little bit strange you know
class is a reserved word in JavaScript
however coffee knows how to handle it so
interesting room is interestingly enough
the attribute class active knows to put
it in here in a one-liner and even more
interesting this log object class it's
really translates into this this syntax
is a little funny because it's like
where are the parentheses don't know do
not know lexical scoping and variable
safety this just has to do with the
scope of when you're inside a function
and outside of a function as you know
JavaScript
you can pass values into a function from
outside so outer could be inside of
change numbers without even having to
pass into here in PHP that is not
allowed unless you have a statement like
use outer or pass in the variable or its
global and a global as a no no now I'm
getting off topic because this is just
JavaScript so if else condition is very
beautiful I think JavaScript had its if
else are just fine they're pretty pretty
decent in this it does look like Python
besides the else and they don't use
semicolons at the end and then Python
this is called il or a LIF for else if
and these are nice you can do one liners
here and it looks like the ternary here
yes this is more code and I have no
problem with ternary operators I think
this is just for readability splats
absolutely beautiful splats are these
items here with the three dots if you've
ever used pythons and use KW args with a
two asterisks or args one or two
asterisks can't remember off the top of
my head basically what that does is it
lets you insert let's say first second
then any number of other arguments which
is very cool now to look at this and
dissect it it's like wow that's a that's
a lot of stuff that I don't want to go
into because this video will get too
long but splats basically are multiple
arguments to find in one variable just
by using dot dot dot get listing
comprehensions very cool again it's like
Python eat food for food in and then the
array and then they have a bunch of
examples here
and it's pretty self-explanatory once a
monkey with it and especially if you
come from Python it's like the backyard
brain this shows array handling right
here I'll go down a little because the
video is getting along and I know we all
have a short attention span years old
and this is pretty cool that we can
define an object like this in one line
although I personally don't recommend it
because this is actually kind of hard to
read I prefer the multi-line and what
this does it says a for child age that
would be the key being max Ida Tim and
the age ten nine eleven of years old
it's going to say max 10 Ida 9 10 11 so
just this line of code is very nice go
down a little bit more the topic of this
what was the topic it looks like the
while loop I'm going to skip over this
section so we can shorten up some of
this array slicing and splicing with
ranges this is just a just like Python I
keep talking about Python I know it's
getting old so start numbers you want to
get something from here you do not need
to do slice splice or anything you just
do 02 to 32 reverse to and notice that
there are three periods here and then
this one has to period to make a copy
you could just do all of them go down a
little bit yonder you can even replace
the numbers this is really cool so you
take numbers values three through six
which would be 0 1 2 3 so 3 4 5 ok and
you could replace
at with this so these will be removed
and these will be inserted it's
extremely easy down here pretty much the
same old same old just a function with
student an else if statement and it
checks the well this is a different
example here if 24 is greater than 21
done Liz else Ike and here's again the
ternary which I have no problem with
then let's go down the try-catch is
pretty nice operators and elias's this
is one good thing to read in the
CoffeeScript they use is isn't not and
or and for true they have yes no or
sorry true yes on and then false is
false no off the if or sorry this can be
attributed with the at symbol or this
and some of the math functions here are
pretty nice and I'm assuming there's a
lot more I'm not a coffeescript master
there's a lot of features in here I
don't think I can cover at all because
once a video becomes 20 minutes it's
quite boring so again the goal of this
is not to rewrite JavaScript and use
coffee script because you won't want to
use a compiler in real time on your
website if one even exist say coffee
compiler Jas and then it compiles all
your coffee script into JavaScript that
would be slow and a terrible idea rather
you have a watch application going on it
could be the CoffeeScript itself
possibly a ruby gem or even gulp j/s
which is another node module that
a lot more setup but it's amazing and
really mmm you're just every time you
save it compiles down to JavaScript yet
you're looking at your coffee code so
you're typing very clean organized code
which compiles down to the sloppy
JavaScript you could imagine it like a C
compiler except you don't have to build
constantly it automatically builds and
you don't look at the output of the c
compiler say you make a dynamic link
library I mean that's a either binary
code hex code I don't know so check out
CoffeeScript don't be a hater guys it's
a it's very promising thanks for
