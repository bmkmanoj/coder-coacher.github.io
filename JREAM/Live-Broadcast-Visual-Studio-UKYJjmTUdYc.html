studio and this is a Google+ Hangout so
this is live and there might be gaps of
silence and stuff like that while we get
things together so just bear with me
what I'm gonna try to do at the moment
is get on YouTube so that I can see
people's comments if people start
joining and I'd like to do a quick intro
into visual studio I've had the
opportunity to learn a lot of this at
work from a nice gentleman named Sam
Horton very smart guy
and I really like it I use it for the
c-sharp language the c-sharp language
can tie into what's called the mono
framework and you can use it for
different operating systems to run
applications while you use gtk for that
I believe but you'd also use mono for
mobile devices so this is Visual Studio
2008 you can get the Express Edition
absolutely free so let me go ahead and
try to find the length for the comments
if anyone decides to hang out here you
sent me a link okay Gmail okay keep
using Google Chrome okay
so can I see comments on here will they
show up okay what I'm gonna do first is
create a console application and I'm
gonna go through this with you to try to
help you understand I'm just going to
create a new project and let me just
mention this I have my dark theme
enabled in Visual Studio
because I find it easier to read for me
to change that you can go to your tools
options and you can change it to light
or dark and here's the light version I'm
not sure what's gonna be easier to read
on the screen well I see your comment
Sophia so I'll try this for a moment
what I'll first do is create a new
project under visual C sharp I'm gonna
go to a console application and the
location you want to store your projects
it could really be anywhere I always
like to put my stuff in my workspace
folder I just put mine in C Drive
workspace the only downside to visual
studio is that you can't use it on an
Apple or Linux unless you're running a
virtual machine and this is the best IDE
I've ever used and c-sharp is one of the
most attractive languages I have ever
used so in my C Drive workspaces want
where I want to store it and I have this
button check that says create a
directory for a solution so I'm just
going to create a console application
I'm just going to call this learning 101
however I don't want to put digits in my
name space because it's actually going
to be your namespace so I'll just call
it learning console and Kyllo link I see
in the chat room okay so what we have is
this big open window and we're gonna go
over it let me first increase the font
size so go to my options fonts and
colors and I'm just gonna increase the
size to let's say 12 that looks a little
more readable
hopefully I don't want people to feel
like they have to go fullscreen just to
look at what we're doing let me make it
a little bit bigger so how about 14 okay
so we have our just our basic c-sharp
console application and I'll start at
the top up at the top these are things
you'll find in Python as well they're
using libraries and system is a common
library
you also notice that is using collection
dot generic and system dot link system
dot texts and you might ask yourself if
we're using system why are we using
these subcategories and the reason is
you don't have to type as much to use
those for example I could type system
and notice as I type it brings up what I
want to do and you see how this
automatically hints namespace system
sorry yeah it's hard to read
is it hard to read on your screen okay
I'm gonna make the font size a little
bigger it seems like it's doing kind of
low quality let's see how that font size
works at 17 are you able to make your
screen a little bigger if you click not
the full screen but the large player no
not full screen out of the large one I
think it's difficult because I'm
recording full screen here okay is it
kinda blurry okay the video quality is
kind of low okay I'm not sure at the
moment how to improve that I'll just
make this a little bit bigger okay so
back where we were with the namespace of
system after the period when you type a
period you get a drop-down list of
things
and there's a lot of stuff in the system
so if I go to collections and notice
this one up here has generic I can type
dot generic dot and then I can get
dictionaries hash sets those are kind of
like a raise or hash arrays or whatever
you call them create lists and stuff
you're gonna want to keep generic there
because there's a lot of things in here
you'll use but like I was saying the
reason for this is because I can now
just type lists like this if I if I were
to create a new list the syntax here is
not correct just so you know I'm just
describing it to you so I mean if you
were gonna make stuff like this that
list you see how much you have to type
so this is basically a shortcut so we
have access to just the the thing here
string and don't worry about what a list
is right now okay so that's kind of the
summary of what we did for using I'll
just comment that summary for what using
does one thing that might throw you off
later on is that using is also used
within your methods for different things
but don't worry about that now I don't
want to get too ahead of myself so
whenever we create a project we have our
own namespace if you're familiar with
PHP namespaces are defined at the top of
the file and they don't wrap things like
this does see how this namespace wraps
this whole piece here we're probably
used to seeing it like this and this is
our whole class but in c-sharp we have
namespaces so that if I'm in another
file I can say using learning console
and then the class name program like
that but we're just sticking with one
file
now next we have our class which is just
called program by default and this right
here it's actually similar to Java where
it has a static main constructor
basically this is the entry point that's
going to happen no matter what you do in
a console so the main is where all the
money happens you can make other classes
and things if you want static means it
doesn't have to be a class doesn't have
to be instantiated call this method if
you're familiar to PHP normally you'd
have to do new learning console program
like that but from whatever's going on
in the back of the system it allows you
to say learning console program however
their static methods are called you
don't have to instantiate it with a new
thing and that's all that does so that's
what static means void is actually the
return value and c-sharp is a strictly
typed language so you always have to
tell your methods what it's going to
return void means it's not going to
return anything so if I were to make a
new function I'll say public int age
okay and once I type this I get an error
here and I can hover over it and you
probably can't see it very well but it
says not all code paths return a value
and if I were to do return hello it's
still going to give an error because
we're telling you it has to be an
integer in order to do that if I say one
there's no red underline under and
there's no error with that set I'll also
bring this up if you're in a method and
you have a condition like this if one is
greater than ten else
let me scroll down so we had an if
statement I'll just say return one and I
don't do anything here the problem is
this code is unreachable because one is
not greater than ten and also it says
not all code paths return a value so
whenever you give a type of method that
the type it's going to return
you always have to provide it a way to
return it in every scenario so in this
case you would be forced to return
something here this isn't the way you
have to do it you could get rid of this
else statement like this because if this
returns something it won't get to this
point but I digress
yet the quality this video I'm not sure
what's going on you guys let me try
something in Google Hangouts in the
screenshare learning code visual studio
I'm gonna focus that only on the visual
studio window and just give it a moment
okay and I'll shrink it down a little
bit okay how about if I shrink it down
nope well just give it a moment it's a
little slow through the thing is it less
blur okay I hope that helps so back to
where we work we know what our return
value does so let's just mark down what
we went over static is called in the
system without being instantiated okay
and just if anyone happens to stumble on
here we're playing with c-sharp in
Visual Studio 2012 I will say that you
can use Visual Studio
2010 the Express Edition and you'll be
just fine so don't worry about getting
the latest greatest okay so we know what
a static does we understand the return
value let's just say return values for
methods are required because c-sharp is
a strictly typed language and PHP is a
loosely typed language okay and this
right here main you shouldn't change
this just this method alone because this
is the entry point to the console like I
said before and right here the arguments
are as if you want to run the command
through a console and provide arguments
right now we're not going to touch any
of that the first thing we're going to
do is learn to write to the console and
we're going to compile our application
and run it okay and to do that I can say
console and I have my little helper here
that you'll learn to log this is why I
love Visual Studio I was hit enter and
then period and they give you a whole
bunch of other options we want to write
a line here this right line and inside
of here we're gonna write something one
thing you should know is you can't use
single quotes you have to use double
quotes so I'll say how old are you okay
now this is going to give us an error
but I just want to demonstrate kind of
some of the console stuff up at the top
you'll see something called start you
can also just go to debug start
debugging in your hotkey is f5 ok so I'm
just going to press f5 and I don't know
if that window appeared because I'm only
focused on Visual Studio that's one of
the problems well the the console
appeared and then it disappeared so what
I would do is console
read line start and now I'm into bug
mode and I'm just gonna wait a moment
for the video on YouTube to catch up
okay I'm glad it looks better you guys
I'm not able to show you the console
window because Google Hangouts is only
focused on the visual studio that's kind
of annoying so I'm just gonna try to
resize it once more let me see what some
of my options are with the screen share
so I got the Google Hangouts the desktop
desktop I wish there was a way to select
like a small portion of this because
this desktop is actually a pretty big
resolution but I usually record at mm-hm
you know we want to see what we're doing
is we go that's the problem I'm gonna
try to share this selected window again
you guys and we'll just see how it goes
yep that's exactly right tad Tabish whew
her red line that's what I wanted to
demonstrate are you guys able to see
this let me ask my wife did you take a
look at it is that hard to read now a
lot harder did the quality go down what
if I make it fullscreen is it still kind
of blurry wonder why it's a little
irritating because there's more than
just the system is it like really crappy
yeah that I'm looking at that doesn't
look very good let me uh
like what's cameraman oops did that flip
the screen upside down it's all black
this all right well it'll refresh what I
have here guys in Google Chrome probably
what the problem is man that's a bummer
I really want to explain this because
it's really fun
okay I'm gonna slide this screen that
was trying to use a digital camera and I
don't have one of those let's see if
anyone said anything okay just wait for
a moment to move over why is this so
blurry
isn't it blurred I'm gonna make the fine
even bigger so tools options 22 I'll
make it even bigger
24
hopefully that is readable it's pretty
big on my screen 24 okay well sorry for
the trouble guys hopefully this works
now I'm gonna press f5 and if you see at
the bottom of my screen you'll see a
thing that says ready down here in red
and it's just basically in debug mode
and I opened the console and it just
says how old are you and that's how we
write to the console I'll press a key
and hit enter and it'll close what I
want to get into is talking about types
though and types have to do with in PHP
for example you're used to saying item
equals array but this would be lowercase
you're probably used to item equals this
in 5.4 and c-sharp you actually have to
tell what's going to be inside an array
so I could say something like an array
of integers with the square brackets and
then I give my variable name now let's
call this numbers okay so it's a little
bit different the way you type it let me
hover over this you probably can't see
it too well but I got a green underline
on my screen and that says numbers is
declared but never used I like the quote
that a visual studio does this I could
do string and just call that data and if
I want to populate stuff you can also do
it this way int numbers 2 equals
squiggly brackets I'll say 1 a bunch of
numbers right now the thing is here is
unlike languages like PHP and Python
you're not using square brackets trees
in the french braces and the same would
happen with string data to equals i
hello
that and you'll notice like I said
before if you use the single quotes you
get an error it thinks it's a character
literal so you always want to use double
quotes for Strings
there's also something called lists hash
tables a lot of other stuff they have
the typical loops you'd be familiar with
so here's a for int I equals 0 I is less
than data - and data - is reference
highlights of for us is referencing this
here dot length and notice when it has a
little screw by it in this drop down
like a wrench
it means it's a property and not a
method so you would not put you don't
put those little parentheses around it
and I'll just say I plus plus and this
is how we can do a loop and what I'll do
is I'll just do a consult dot write line
and what I want to put in here is data
- I okay I'll save this or run it it
says hi hello how are you and that's
just a very simple you look okay loop
and some simple types we covered and
you're probably thinking well this is
kind of boring it takes a bit of work to
get used to this because Visual Studio
has a ton of features it's it's pretty
overwhelming to be honest now in your
menu up here you can right click the
name of your application and you've got
all these options here and what you want
to do is sometimes clean it up and then
build it and when you build it it
creates an executable so I'm going to
open
folder I went to to workspace learning
console and the SLN is the solution file
and this is what opens your your all
your data you wrote inside Visual Studio
and then your folder has all your stuff
and your programs CS file short for
c-sharp and I'm gonna go to the object
folder debug folder and here I have
learning console dot exe this is now a
legitimate executable file so you can
make very easy console applications like
that
you can connect to databases
it looks like the bin folder also has
some stuff I'm not sure what vs host
means so double-click this guy and it's
the same thing because we did a build
I believe it published it to a non
temporary directory so that's just a
basic loop they also have the while loop
they have the for each loop let's do a
for each for each I'll just say string G
as data 2 and string G
oops in sorry
so data to remember it's just our
strings up throw a couple more in here
life and air so we can look through this
and we can say consoled dot write line
and this will be G because G would
represent this one this one this one
this one I'm sure a lot of you guys are
familiar with how to loop and stuff but
it helps to get used to the basics in a
new language so here we go hello hi life
air hello how are you okay so I'm gonna
just erase this stuff we learned a
couple of loops and it's a couple simple
types what I want to do is get the
results of hello how old are you so I'm
just gonna say string input equals
console dot read line console dot read
line and I'll say console dot write line
of input I want to read what they wrote
in back to them and I'll say hello input
and to concatenate you use plus like you
do in most languages in PHP you use the
period which is really bad in my
opinions both will use a plus here and
I'll go ahead and run this hello how old
are you ah restaurant question Jessie
and it says hello Jessie so we're
building an executable that can run on
Windows and actually do stuff obviously
this is the most simple stuff we can do
I'll say hello what's your name
okay and if we wanted a control
statement I'll try this if input equals
Jessie
console dot write line you are writing
me okay you know how about an else
statement else let's do it else if
actually else if input equals Sophia
console dot and by the way I'm typing
this out Visual Studio I'm just so not
used to just being able to hit enter an
up and down to do the work for me
I just type right just hit enter that's
one thing that I gotta get used to and
I'll say you are sitting next to the
author of this video so just for fun
I'll run this with a if statement
I'll press how about Sophia you are
sitting next to the author hello Sophia
press f5 again to run it I'll say Jessie
and you are writing me hello Jessie very
cool and getting used to like all the
types in visual studios a lot of fun let
me show you one that I had trouble with
it's called a list list and remember if
when I type list look at the text there
let me type it again list and it says
class system collections generic list
and the T in there just stands for type
and you see how we're using system
collections generic again that's so that
we don't have to type this to get our
list we use using at the top so that we
don't have to be ridiculous
so list requires a subtype and this
one's a little strange sorry this one's
a little strange you're not used to
typing it you use these little brackets
like an HTML and usually I go back and I
press the bracket until something
appears in T it stands for type and what
kind of things do we want in the list
I'll have a strength
okay so let's train and then we'll give
a variable name I'll just call it names
equals new list string and in the
brackets there so you can see why this
looks a little confusing and hard to get
used to we have to tell the type of
items or a subtype inside of the list we
give it a variable and then we actually
have to construct the list so it looks
like you know we're typing a lot of
stuff
but a list can be useful I can say names
dot add and let's do chest we there in
the room
names dot add Tabish for her and there's
a couple other people in here let's do
one more
names dot add Michael ser and the Mac
and eyes okay and now we have a list
which really is similar to an array in
this case and when we could just loop it
again for each names whoops let's give a
variable for each string end in names
console dot write line and so let me get
rid of a couple of these how about let's
get rid of like hey what's your name we
don't care and let's see what happens
I'll have f5 and run it and here we have
chef squeeze Tabish for her micro ser
micro s air the Mac and Hans I'm not
sure where you guys get your names the
Mac and oz is easy to read some of these
other ones are hard to read it's all
good and that's just like basic stuff
man I'm not an expert in c-sharp I was
learning the MVC 3 from a guy at work
and he's taught me a lot but I wanted to
go into the console because this is
where we really start basic
so or in our class program and I want to
create another class so down here at the
bottom I can say class something like
this and this is perfectly valid having
a class program and class something and
we're in the namespace learning console
okay and in here I'll create a method
I'll say public int age and to put an
argument inside of an age we only want
integer so I'll say int a and when you
see this red line again it just means I
haven't returned a valuable variable so
I'll say return a and actually satisfies
because a has to be that and to use that
I can say something dot oops I have to
instantiate it and one weird thing is
you have to say something something
equals new something okay because it's a
typed language it needs to know what
everything is and that's part of the
reason c-sharp is so fast it's typed and
when it's a typed language making errors
is a lot less is a lot more difficult
because the IDE is going to tell you
what you're doing wrong so something
something equals new something reading
that looks a little crazy we're used to
just being like this something equals
new something but it's just a thing we
have to get used to so I'll say
something dot and it has a CH oh let me
remind you about that again do you see
the little square here it's not the
wrench like we had before that means
it's a method meaning we have to do the
parentheses okay I'll just say five okay
and what I want to do is write the data
in here so I'll say console.writeline
something okay and let's run that see
what happens
you guys probably can't see my console
very well but it says five and that's
just a simple way to use a class what I
can also do is create a new class if I
look at my program CS I want to create a
completely new class so I'll right-click
my project learning console I'll go to
add class I'm just going to add a
default class there's a lot of stuff in
here and it's intimidating and to be
frank I don't know what all of it does
but I'll just call this basic class
Jesse okay so on the side here we have
program in our way up Jesse and you see
the namespace in the class I just
created is called learning console the
namespace and program is also learning
console so your entire project saves the
same namespace so we just have different
classes within it and this comes to
organization on how you want to do it
too
I'm so I have class Jesse and to do a
constructor in a regular class you
actually do public Jesse okay and this
is how we construct it so I'll say
return
I am constructed some of this might seem
foreign tea and stuff if you're not used
to object-oriented programming but it's
good to always exercise the brain by
hover over return it says hey this
doesn't tell me I'm returning anything
so the problem with the Constructors you
can't return anything because internally
you're returning the actual object
itself so really this will just be used
for setters and stuff so if I were to
say string age whoops this should be an
int age I could pass in age here then I
could say this age equals H
okay and then I'll make another method
I'll say public int get age and I'll
return this age okay and one thing
you'll notice that I didn't bring up is
that c-sharp uses upper camel case it
starts everything with a capital letter
and it doesn't use underscores it's just
kind of like that as far as method
arguments and little variables I like
them all lowercase and underscore I
don't know the perfect standard question
why c-sharp language and suddenly -
system programming from web programming
well this is just an introduction to
c-sharp and some of the ways it's typed
if you know some of the ways it works
just the basics you can use it in a web
program with asp.net and that's actually
built into here if I were to go to file
new project web and I've been using the
MVC 3 web platform application sorry and
this is a it's a pretty good MVC it's a
little more difficult than your standard
PHP MVC's because everything's typed and
you know it's a new language you got to
get used to but it's pretty sweet and I
thought it'd be a good idea to just do a
warm-up intro into c-sharp itself I
don't plan to do system programming
videos you know specifically console
applications because that's only windows
specific and I think it's more
beneficial to make applications for all
operating systems or all mobile or all
web in my opinion the future of
programming is really web based not just
one OS base that's my opinion but I
didn't want to ignore Visual Studio
because it's quite a masterpiece and
there's a lot of sites that actually run
Visual Studio stackoverflow that's a big
one
the whole stack exchange I'm sure a lot
of you guys have been there in the
programming place ask a lot of questions
there but it's definitely you know just
to learn a new language you got to start
with the basics
in Visual Studio is very intimidating I
had a guy go through with me and he was
explaining stuff and you know I just
started getting comfortable with it so
let me go back to where I was I have a
method to get the age I have the
constructor the constructor must always
match the name of the class and it can
have no return value okay so now here
I'm in the namespace learning console so
my Jessie class should be available so
I'll just say Jessie J equals new Jessie
and it wants me to give me an H I'll say
28 and I'll say J dot and scroll down
get H okay and I'll cut this guy out
malas console.writeline them console dot
write line J dot get H + f5 to run it
and I have 28 up there and 5 so we get
used to a little bit of I don't know the
language pretty much were you getting a
c-sharp MVC it's a lot more difficult
and if you know some of the basics and
how some of this stuff works it'll make
your life a lot easier
I'm gonna go ahead and get rid of my
list in these classes here and explore a
couple things with you if I go to SQL
note that's not what I'm looking for
window there's a SQL manager on here
build let me find it
well where is that server Explorer there
it is so it comes with Microsoft SQL I'm
not sure which version and here's my
servers and all that stuff
where's my data connections I thought I
had a my sequel connection already let's
see that again view there it is SQL
object Explorer sorry wrong one and we
have our local databases here and just
built right into it I can just pop this
guy open go to my databases system
databases and I created some here how
let's go to c-sharp manager and my
tables and it always it's always
prefixed with DB oh and I can
right-click this and go to view designer
and this is how you create a table it's
a little weird to do it you can also
download Visual Studio or sorry visual
SQL management studio which is basically
this in a separate application there's
also an a/v cap that makes it a little
nicer to work with this so I want to
create a new table I'll just right-click
tables and do add new table and this is
an interesting thing that it would be
important to know if you decide to get
into ms SQL I'm just gonna call this
groups so I'm just gonna have a title
and the data type you see there's an end
char we want a NV char we don't want to
ensure an varchar' so that you won't
have white space on the end so if I may
this 255 length and I put in something
like ten characters it'll only be ten
characters long when you fetch it
whereas just a regular char value you'll
have 255 characters and only a couple of
them will be whatever you type in there
so there's not gonna be any white space
and here's one thing that actually kind
of bugs me
I default they uppercase this text here
and I tell you I don't like naming my
tables just ID I like to name it the
table name so it would be group ID in
all lowercase because if you have two
tables let's say you have a user table
in a group table and their primary keys
are ID and you have to do a joint on
them you're going to get an ambiguous
problem because then you're gonna have
to a Lea some and it's just more work
than you need to do so one thing is even
though this is the primary key it's not
Auto incremented and this really
frustrated me I can click this column
and then down here they call it an
identity specification and you say is
identity and I'll say true and now it'll
increment every time you add to it okay
and then what I want to do is click this
update button if you're in Visual Studio
2010 you might just click the Save
button and it pairs an update script and
you just do update database and here it
is here it looks like it didn't get the
right name because I didn't name it
right so I'll just right-click and
rename and I'll call this group I have
to close this window here before I
rename it and here update database
there we go group in my opinion this
feels I don't know it just doesn't feel
that good compared to like navigate or
Heidi SQL it's just so much easier to
use the other ones so I'm not sure what
Microsoft's thinking is on this like -
let's see if I want to look at the data
I go to view data and if I want to edit
data it looks like they combined these
so I can do this now test let's make
sure I auto increment school test -
that's just a simple introduction to the
little server manager I'll click the pin
there so I can have it on the left
but I'm not gonna get into that before
this video gets too long that was pretty
much what I wanted to introduce just
some basics to visual c-sharp
the last thing I want to show you is if
you make an error on purpose or an
accident I'll just do this and then I'll
hit f5 to try to render it it says there
were build errors would you like to
continue and run the last successful
build I always say no because I don't
want to run what I'm working on
so I'll click don't show again and say
no and then down at the bottom it tells
us the exact error we have and this
thing is accurate man obviously this is
an obvious error but it really helps you
out in your life so then I'll hit f5
again and then it works let me make sure
I save that there are also plugins for
PHP in here it actually cost $100 and I
would prefer to use NetBeans just
because it's free and it's easy to use
so feel free to just download Visual
Studio I would highly recommend using
c-sharp rather than visual basic C sharp
in dotnet are extremely powerful
libraries and I've only touched the
surface of it there's a lot of stuff in
here like Windows Store I'm never going
to use cloud you know I'm never going to
use that in Azur but the dotnet very
good to use I've only done three I don't
know the difference with four and I know
master two by any means I've recently
been learning how to do it so I'd like
to share my knowledge with the world but
this pays good money if you decide to
get a career in dotnet just so you know
all this other stuff like Windows Phone
I'd never mess with that I don't even
have a Windows Phone Silverlight you
know in my opinion silver lights as good
as dead but I could be wrong you know
flash in my opinion is way better they
have other languages you see I have
visual basic in here but again I highly
recommend not using visual basic you
also have visual C++ and this is a lower
level language than visual c-sharp lower
level meaning you have to do a lot more
stuff manually and it requires a lot
more skill in memory management and it
works across all operating systems I
believe I could be wrong in c-sharp is
Windows specific tied into the dotnet
framework let me just mention this
there's something called ironpython I
don't know how many of you guys are
interested in Python but this actually
ties into the dotnet framework in python
as you know is compatible with any
operating system python is amazing and
it's quick and it has some it ties into
a lot of C based libraries and makes it
available through Python so to utilize
the dotnet framework and ironpython in
different OSS that's pretty amazing
that's really amazing there's also a
monodevelop
and this basically allows you to create
stuff in c-sharp and distribute among
different platforms Linux Mac OS X I
apologize if you can't read that and
lastly there was one called
mono gain mono game that CodePlex now
this is ridiculously awesome you can
make phones for mobile sorry games for
no mobile these are actual games in the
iOS store I believe the graphics need
some work but uh you can actually make
games and she sharp and run I'm there I
downloaded this but if you do download
this you're going to need the X n a
library and that is actually the Xbox
library and I haven't played with this
yet but you can actually create
games through this if you wanted to
create an Xbox game and c-sharp
I'm not kidding it's really cool
there is also one other thing if I can
remember off the top of my head
it wasn't the mono game oh yeah it's
unity3d
this is pretty popular unity3d
is pretty impressive because you wrote
you can write in JavaScript also in
unity but a c-sharp also c-sharp is just
the professionals language it's once you
start playing with it you're going to
start to appreciate its beauty even
though it has a really hard learning
curve if you compare it to like PHP
unity 3d can create 3d or 2d games and
it creates it for mobile devices at the
web if you have a unity player and a lot
of stuff
so with c-sharp you're not just limited
to Microsoft applications you can create
web applications you can create mobile
and cross-platform things so I'm pretty
sold on this language and you know
trying to learn it a lot more I know a
lot of people don't like Microsoft and
they might be using a Mac but it's a
very nice language so before we go let
me just give you one last tidbit about
the C languages okay there is C and this
is super low level if you program and C
you're gonna have to pretty much be in a
black screen counsel kind of thinking
all the time there is C++ which is a
step above C with objects yet it's still
very low level and you have to do a lot
of memory management okay and there are
c-sharp this is an MS language and it
works cross-platform I should mention
that that's very important to a lot of
people in c-sharp
it has a auto memory management for you
for the most part
are kind of like the garbage collection
in Java and then there's also um
objective-c and this is an OSX language
and they use this for the iPhone the
iPad and stuff and I got a couple kinds
of work that are trying to learn this
and the language sadly is actually
extremely bad they're using stuff from
an operating system called next step
which Steve Jobs supposedly created when
he was fired from Apple and he came back
to and I guess he brought a lot of code
from next step so on Objective C you'll
see a lot of stuff like NS you know name
space this long method name a lot of
square brackets it doesn't feel like a C
language it's really odd you know I'm
not trying to hate on Apple but this is
this is a tough language if you want to
get into that
my advice is C sharp or some kind of
language that you find an application
that works with every OS but I think
that'll wrap it up guys I just wanted to
do another Google on-air video and I
appreciate the questions and I hope
anyone watching my to learn a couple
things so it's time to sign off and
thanks for watching everybody see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
