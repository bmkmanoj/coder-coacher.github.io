gonna look at jQuery UI progress bar and
this tutorial is not going to be that
fantastic but I'm gonna give you an idea
of what we can do and we're gonna make a
password strength checker and I'm gonna
do it kind of the easy way so the first
thing is if you don't have this setup I
have a website template that you can
drop into your localhost on your hard
drive and that'll be getting you set up
quick and I just cleared everything out
here so I just have this so the first
thing we're gonna do is if you are using
the template I made it has everything we
need I'm gonna open up custom j/s which
is located under public je s and custom
je s and then I'm gonna go to my index
file which was index dot PHP and I just
cleared everything out of here right
inside the content and that's this page
right here so the first thing we're
gonna do is make a div and I'm gonna say
div id equals progress bar okay and in
custody let me just go up here if you
didn't see any of my previous tutorials
I'm already including all the style
sheets and jQuery UI and all that stuff
this just saves time if you want to
practice so we have a progress bar and
to get this on here it's very easy it
shows you if you click view source right
here they just did something like that
so we'll go ahead and type that in our
CSS ID of progress bar I prefer
camelcase for nearly everything like
that
and lips will do dot progress bar and if
I go back here I'll refresh and we have
this big old bar and in their example
they show that you can pass in an object
you have to look at these squiggly
brackets here and just a reminder it's
the more you reminded the better VAR a z
equals those little brackets and that
would be an object right here but I've
talked about that a lot
so we passing an object right here and a
parameter would be value of 50 now go
ahead and refresh oh what I do no
semicolon sorry about that let me move
this over a little bit so we can have
these on both screens okay refresh
oops I didn't save it that's
embarrassing there we go and it's a
little too big for my liking so I'm just
gonna shrink the div just inline CSS and
say style equals width of 200 pixels
okay
and refresh and now we have this bar at
50% and it's not that cool
it was just chilling here so what we're
gonna do is make this actually handle a
password strength kind of thing so I'm
gonna make an input let's say input type
equals text ID equals password and I'll
just say password and do a br so I'll
refresh and we have a password box and
when they type in here it's going to
change this bar so to do that we first
have to bind the password and I'll say
ID of password dot key up function
and I'll say alert one just make sure
it's working so tight tight looks good
and what I'm gonna do is get the length
of the password so I'm gonna make a
variable called Len equals this dot Val
dot length and I'm also going to
console.log this so I because those
alerts are really annoying if you don't
know this yet you can do console dot log
Len okay and I'm going to press ctrl
shift I inside Chrome or that would be
under this little wrench tools and
developer tools you can see the hot keys
ctrl shift I
oops it opened up way to the side I'll
just pop it back down here and we want
to get to our console which is this
little icon here or I believe there's a
thing where you could just look at the
console entirely there we go and refresh
so every time we type in here we'll get
the length of how how long this thing is
and what we're going to do is make this
length change this bar and it's not too
difficult I'm gonna do a very cheesy and
easy formula I'll say far total equals
null and I'm going to say total equals
Len times 10
and what I'm gonna do is make a function
for the progress bar so I'm gonna say
function bar update
or that doesn't have there we go and tab
that over and inside a bar update this
is gonna be a value I'll call this total
then we change that so every time we
call this we're going to call the bar
update function I'll say bar update of
total so what's happening is we're
getting the length and then the total is
the length so let's say 5 times 10 would
be 50 and if it's 50 it's going to put
50 into the bar update thing and the
value is gonna be 50 so it's going to be
50 and refresh so 8 every time we do
this at other times 10 so 7 this would
be 70 percent and if you go over it it's
okay because this bar doesn't go too big
it's limited but you know you might want
to limit it just for future reference if
you want it so that's an easy way to
just make a little length checker on
your password thing if you wanted to get
more advanced you'd have to do some
regular expressions and I'll show you
that real quick in JavaScript to do a
regular expression first create a
variable I'll call this reg x equals and
this has no quotes you have to remember
that it's always inside of two slashes I
can't go over too much regular
expression with you I'm not that good at
it to be honest and it you know it takes
a dedicated tutorial for it
so a through Z a through Z okay
basically this says if anything matches
a through Z a through Z good and we have
to apply this to the
data in here and what I want to do is
get the data so I'll save our data
equals this dot Val okay and since I'm
getting the value twice I could just say
data dot length there because this would
really replace that data value and then
to test this I'm gonna do a console dot
log and I'm going to do oh let's see
projects dot okay regex
dot test and we're gonna test it against
data okay and this bar is not gonna
update we broke it for right now
I'm kind turtle is not defined oh sorry
let me comment that out refresh so true
this means it's matching a through Z and
all that stuff
let's do zero through nine as well well
that's not supposed to match because a
through Z what about zero four through
nine refresh there we go false false
true okay like I said I'm not very good
with regular expressions but what you
could do is do a series of these and say
alright this one has this many capital
letters in lowercase and it's this long
so the bar should be a 50% or 80% and
you know whatever that's about it guys
sorry for the kind of boring tutorial I
couldn't think of anything better to do
with the bar update I'll just go ahead
and fix this real quick refresh and
there's our nice little working bar
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
