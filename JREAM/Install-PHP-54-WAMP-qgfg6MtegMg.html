install PHP 5.4 on wamp and what you
would do you would go to windows PHP net
download and get the thread-safe
zip file i've already downloaded that
and i couldn't get this to work on my
64-bit lamp I'm not sure why so I just
redownload it the 32-bit one and
reinstalled from there so once you have
the files you need I'll go ahead to my
downloads folder and let me start up
lamp okay
so here it is up in the corner and this
is a clean fresh install with all the
default options and I have five point
three point one there so what I'm going
to do is open this guy up I'll open
another window and I'll go to C Drive
lamp bin that short for binary the PHP
folder and right in here is where I want
to put my stuff so I'm going to make a
new folder call it PHP 5.4 point O and
what's cool about lamp is that you can
host multiple versions of Apache and PHP
and it will just appear on the list so
I'll take all my zip up files and dump
those in there and we're not done yet
while that copies I'll go back to the
PHP folder and in my previous copy PHP
5.3 point one and go ahead and close
that I'll double click into here scroll
all the way to the bottom and I got a
lamp server configuration file and if I
were to open this it just tells where to
load Apache modules and you don't really
need to worry about this because by
default right now it's good and if you
were to look at the lamp or sorry Apache
version we're using two point two so it
that so just copy this guy into the 5.4
directory there is and lastly we take
the php.ini and I'll just rename this
one to PHP for Apache dot ini exactly
like that and you can double check you
out right by going to the previous one
and you'll see that they have that in
there as well so what we have to do is
we actually have to close out lamp
server and then reopen it okay click
this guy in PHP version now we have 5.4
in here I'll click that and cross our
fingers it turned green if yours doesn't
turn green you you should really just
try the 32 bit lamp and a fresh install
so back up in my lamp directory
ww let me open up a browser window and
let me drag this over here and if i go
to localhost here it is 5.4 and that's
it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
