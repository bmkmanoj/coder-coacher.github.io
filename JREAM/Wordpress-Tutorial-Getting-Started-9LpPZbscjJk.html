a quick run-through of WordPress and
getting started with it and this is a
blog or website platform to make your
life a little easier so I'm in
wordpress.org there is a.com but you're
going to want to go to org and go ahead
and download the package otherwise your
web host possibly has WordPress a
installer for you and that can be easier
so I'm going to do this on my localhost
first I'm going to create a database and
just call a wordpress and leave it empty
and the files we downloaded here I've
already gone ahead and dragged these in
a folder and mines and workspace
WordPress so I can go over to here
workspace WordPress and you have to have
a virtual host running to do this but
I'm not going to go into that so I'll
first create a configuration file and
pop in my database info my username is
root no password and that looks good and
run the install I'm just going to call
mine test everything's just going to be
test ok and install WordPress ok
it's going to take us to the login
screen and test test let's login
and we log in the control panel might
look a little overwhelming there's a lot
of stuff here I personally am NOT a fan
of this little WordPress blog here
I just minimize most of this stuff and
you know you can move your dashboard
around if you'd like the place I find
myself in the most is under post you can
click this little arrow next to it and
it has posts and there's also pages okay
now
pages are different than posts and I'll
show you I'm going to right click the
link up here open in a new tab and
here's our website right now it's pretty
plain and boring basically this hello
world here this is a post like a blog
where you know they're updated a lot a
page is something that's more permanent
and I guess they gave us a sample page
here nothing too fancy and it's quite
easy to use you can just add a new page
and let's say about this page is about
us and they've made it really easy for
you to work in you know make things bold
make bullet lists and you can upload
pictures and do all that kind of stuff
I'll pop one in here go to desktop and I
had a turtle okay and now I have a
turtle I can go down here and do insert
into post and now I have a little turtle
here now if you're a little more
advanced you could also do HTML and do
it by hand and what you're going to want
to do is you could either save the draft
or publish I'm going to publish it
because I want mine to be live okay and
I can go back to my page and refresh and
I have an about here but this is a post
I wanted this to be a page so my mistake
this would be a blog post right here
where people can comment on it and do
all that kind of stuff we'll go ahead
and make a page now so I'm going to add
a new page
and this will be called about once again
and you'll see the difference I'll go
ahead and publish that and refresh and
this gives us a link up at the top for
about meaning this is more of a
permanent thing your posts on the side
like if you get about 10 or 20 of them
they'll start being categorized into
archives meaning they are constantly
changing so you can manage your comments
appearances and plugins your plugins
you're probably going to want to get a
few of these the appearance has to do
with themes and there's just tons of
themes let's go ahead and check one out
I'm going to go to google.com and I'll
just type in WordPress theme and
wordpress.org has a plenty of them so
let's see I'll just download this
adventure journal and go over here and
to install a theme it's quite easy open
up the little zip file and in your
wordpress directory go to WordPress
content themes and just drag the folder
into here
and that's done and I can just refresh
this page and I have an available theme
right here you can preview it or just
activate it I'm going to go ahead and
activate it and if I go here I can
refresh and now I have all my same
content with a different theme pretty
nice
they do things differently so it might
mess up your layout or you might just
want to make your own theme you can go
to this layout right here and sometimes
they have different options
this one does that's pretty cool an
editor if you're more advanced this you
can edit your CSS in my opinion this is
quite sloppy most of them kind of are I
don't like the way they name things but
you know you can edit the PHP files if
you know PHP and how things are laid out
and plug in some of these that you're
going to want to get on wordpress.org
let's see extend plugins you're probably
going to want to get something like SEO
for search engine optimization and to
use these it's kind of the same as a
theme you can just go ahead and download
it and once that's downloaded in a
similar directory WB content plugins you
can just click this
and drag this into their clothes and now
we can go to plugins and we have SEO
ultimate we can activate this and SEO if
you don't know what that means that
means search engine optimization this
one looks a little big for my liking and
sometimes they add a little panel down
here depending on the plugin like if I
activate it Ekans Matt it won't put one
on the side so go into SEO oh boy yeah
there's a lot of stuff in here this is a
little bit big of a plugin users you can
have several admins and editors on a
page right now we just have the test
account say I wanted to add a new user
I'll just call them test2 and password
I'll just say test test and his role we
can make them an admin editor bla bla
bla all this stuff and I'll just make
them an editor and you know they have
different roles like you can't delete
stuff and all that stuff so it's a
pretty basic thing there's a lot of
tweaks you can do there's an automatic
upgrade feature one thing you want to
look at is right under settings your
permalinks these can be helpful you see
how your URL says P equals one two three
it's probably a lot better to have
something with the name in it like
sample post that would actually be
instead of page ID up there let's go
ahead and save changes and I'll go to
about and you see my URL up here is
slash about rather than question P
equals something
and there's a lot of settings let's say
somebody commented on a post I could go
to but I'm not a big fan of this theme
actually well you can manage your
comments under here you can unapproved
elite Marcus spam if you plan on doing
comments a lot i really suggest using
the Equis mmit plugin or a kismet under
plugins plugins and this one and you
have to get a key from their website
it's free unless you have a commercial
site and this actually works quite well
and that's a basic overview of WordPress
and I hope this helped thanks for
