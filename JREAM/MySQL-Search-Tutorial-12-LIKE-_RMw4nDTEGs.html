we're going to look at searching and I
have my learnings table from our
previous tutorials and I'm going to
search in the post okay so if I go to
the post table and I look at the data
you see I have all these titles here and
we're going to make a query to search
for let's say the item and it's really
quite easy so I'll do use learning and
I'll select all from posts and now we do
where and now it's our condition what do
we want to search I want to search where
the title right here all these rows so
I'll do where title like and that's a
keyword and then I want to do the title
like let's say item and I'll execute and
I get one and if you go to data you see
we have one thing called item and
there's characters so that we can grab
these with more characters if we wanted
to select item 2 3 4 we could do item
and % and this means it will match 0 or
more characters and I'll execute this
and here's one that matches 0 it matches
idem so this percent could mean 0 or
it'll match 2 3 4
it could also match you know item 4 5 6
item with a lot of letters after it
additionally we could put a percent
before it and execute it we get the same
thing we could do erase the I so it's
just TEM execute and we'll get the same
thing
there's also another character it's the
underscore which means match one
character so I did item underscore
and execute we get these with one
character after item so the item with
the letter next to it won't match or
sorry the item that stands alone won't
match if we did two underscores nothing
will match I'm going to go into the data
and I think I'll just right-click and
insert a row and I'll say test item dog
and
did that go in okay so I just have
another role here called test item dog
okay so I'll execute this and let's get
rid of this and put a percent there
that's acute it's not matching the test
item dog because we have the word test
before item so we would have to put a
percent for item so percent item execute
and there's test item dog alternatively
you could just type in test and do item
like that it really depends how you'd
like to do it and let's see what happens
with an underscore nothing and here's
one with a four underscores if you need
to be precise and that is because after
item there's a space and that counts as
a character and do gee there's three and
test item doc so that's pretty easy you
can use your normal selects like you
always would and that's a basic overview
of searching in MySQL thanks for
