tutorial how to create a minecraft
server using Windows 7 and the first
thing you'll do is hit up minecraft net
and over here on the right you're going
to download and you don't want just the
regular minecraft go to the bottom and
crab minecraft server exe save that and
I'll go to the folder and I have a
minecraft server and it's tempting to
open it right away but i wont to do that
i'd first create a folder the folder
i'll just call this minecraft server and
pop this in there and I'm going to move
mine to the desktop the reason is is
because this generates some files so
when this folder I'll just double click
this we run it and there's the files
back there I can go ahead and close it
and what you have to do is go to server
properties ok and name your world if
you'd like I might just call my Jesse
your server IP and in order to get other
people to connect to your server you
have to do something called port
forwarding and that's opening up a port
on your IP address and then the server
port number you could change it if you
want I'll leave it to default I have a
picture here I'm not actually going to
go into my modem but something like this
you would go to applications in gaming
and port range forward and for the
application you just put in the name
minecraft and to start you would put in
the port number and the port number is
in this case 25 565 I just put that
number in the start and end so that
there's only one point number two work
set that to TCP and your IP address if
you need to find that out this is your
local IP
address open windows run and type CMD
and then do IP config and at the top
ipv4 192 168 1 dot 105 so just like in
this picture except to be 192 168 1 105
make sure to enable that and save it if
you're using a modem and not a router
you can do the same thing and look for
your IP address and basically what you
do is type that into your web browser up
here 192 and usually it'll give you
permission but I'm on kind of a stingy
network right now and you'd be able to
access that screen and enable that after
you do that you'll type in your IP 192
168 1 05 or whatever it was save and
close all that out and then what you do
you just open up minecraft connect to
your server with that IP and port and
your friends would connect to your
actual IP that you're on right now and
you can look up that at something like
whoops what's my IP and pretty easy
