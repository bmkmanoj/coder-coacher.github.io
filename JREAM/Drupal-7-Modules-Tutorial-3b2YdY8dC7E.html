you some modules to get with Drupal on a
clean installation because it's kind of
a bear system to get started with and
without beating around the bush let's
just go to Drupal calm
go to the project modules and what
you're going to want to get our a couple
of these I will say views you will
probably end up using this at some point
but I want to get it for right now
because it's kind of complex first one
you're gonna want to get is token and
when you click this link make sure you
go down and grab the version for seven
point X if there's a recommended release
get that so grab token grab path auto
and let's see Google Analytics a lot of
people like this one if you need that
and grab capita for preventing spam bots
because you will get spammed
with most websites the last thing you'll
want to get is a
what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor so
I'm just gonna search the modules for
that and what I want is this one it says
f-ck editor but it's now called CK
editor and this one's a little bit
different how you install it first I'm
gonna hold ctrl and click on the CK
editor link and I'm going to just do the
free download and download the zip okay
and I'll go ahead and extract this to my
desktop
it's a pretty big file and I'll move
these other ones I downloaded here so
that you can see them so we have
ckeditor I'm just gonna put a one before
this because we're gonna do something
with this and close this now I go to the
Drupal modules and go to ckeditor module
and they'll scroll all the way to the
bottom and get the seven-point X version
I'll just grab the zip okay and this is
a like a plugin for Drupal but we're
using the actual CK editor and I'm just
going to drag this here and you can see
the reason we renamed that folders
because there would be a conflict of
names so others open up this wrapper
file and I'll go to the CK editor folder
and that has a note that says copy here
so I'll open up the file we renamed grab
all this drag it in boom done and we can
go ahead and delete this so let's
install some of these plugins I'm gonna
go to my Drupal folder go to sites all
modules and I'm just going to grab all
these pop them in boom and then on your
Drupal site you go to modules and I can
click this to shrink it down and the
first thing we need to turn on is token
path Auto requires token I'll explain
what these do also and I'll turn these
to on my Google Analytics looks like an
outdated one I downloaded the wrong one
no big deal and I'll save
so we're going through this pretty quick
and nobody's gonna take things too slow
and we also need to enable path auto and
then save once more don't forget that
part
and what we're gonna do is add some
content go to add content this is your
shortcuts bar by the way this little
great thing and if I wanted to add
modules to my favorite area I'd hit that
little plus sign that I just clicked and
it shows up right here if I wanted to
remove it I can click this little minus
sign but no big deal
I'll just go to add content and I'm
gonna make a basic page and I'll call
this test and here's our
what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor
it's very nice-looking hello world I'll
actually call this hello world and you
can use this just like a text editor and
everything so that's pretty nice
I'll go down and I'm gonna provide a
menu link so that it shows up in my menu
and the path auto that we downloaded
here's the URL path settings and
normally what we have to do is type in a
URL Elias by hand every time so I would
have to type in a hello - world for the
URL so I'll go ahead and save this and
show you what I mean and you see it says
workspace Drupal slash hello world or
rather hello world normally it's
something like node one that's usually
what the URLs are like but we want path
auto to automatically generate a URL
friendly URL let me go back to that one
second and go to a basic page and I'm
going to go to the URL path settings and
here says URL alias patterns you can
click that and usually when you fresh
install this is content slash node title
if you don't want content before just go
ahead and erase that because your URLs
might look a little ugly
and I'm gonna close this okay and I
think that's a good introduction for a
couple of plugins you need just to get
started with a basic page I will say
this your home page if you're wondering
how to put content on here you can go to
add new content and I'm just going to do
a basic page and say my site and I like
food and I'm gonna I'm not going to
provide a menu link and I'm going to go
to publishing options I'm going to
promote this to the front page and save
and on the home page right here it says
my site I like food
one more thing you see how hello world
is before home what I would do is a find
content or you could just click this
content tab if you don't have these
shortcuts here and I'll edit hello world
and I'm going to change the weight of
the link so I can scroll down and the
weight I'm gonna make it heavier so that
it appears after a lot of things and go
ahead and close that and there you have
it
alright guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
