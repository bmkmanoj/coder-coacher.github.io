one day left on my trial here but I have
Photoshop coming in the mail and the
Camtasia Studio I'm probably gonna have
to pick up a copy of that shortly but
for this tutorial we're just gonna make
a ribbon and I'm just gonna make a
little shape there and then I'm going to
make another shape on a new layer okay
the size I don't really care about I'm
just going to cut this out so that it
has those little oops
let me redo that got a little triangle
piece there okay
and for this ribbon piece I want to bend
it so you know they're kind of Kirby so
I probably go to distort wave let's see
what this gives us looks like
something's locking up here okay and
that looks a little too crazy one
generator and we're on a long wave
wavelength not sure how well you can see
that over there I'm just kind of looking
for the right wave to have okay I think
that'll be good and let's see what
amplitude does okay yeah I don't really
want to mess with that so I'll hit okay
and we have a little curvy thing here in
my opinion this is just better to do in
Adobe Illustrator but I'll try to make
it in here and I'm just going to cut
this edge here and about half way
through you see right here I'm going to
just delete this side and then I'm going
to select this
well press V and then hold alt and drag
it over then edit transform flip
horizontally and deselect so now we have
this little curvy piece
and this little ribbon I guess will do
the same thing with will go to distort
wave elders hit okay and that's good
enough so I think this will look better
on the other side so I'll just flip that
around okay now for the magic to happen
just go to blending options and let's
add a gradient overlay and really what
you want to pick is something that kind
of looks good on here I think that looks
kind of cool screen a little
transparency if you want to change the
direction I guess do whatever you want I
kind of liked it at 90 okay oh it's good
and I'll just copy this layer style and
I'll paste it onto this one and I'm
going to move this layer below here and
this is gonna have to be the correct
size so you know it's a little smaller a
ribbon s okay that looks good and then
with this overlapping here there's going
to be a little bit of a shadow so well
we could do an inner shadow if we want I
might just make a new shape if I do
let's see inner shadow and I want it
coming from this direction it might not
turn out how I want though see I want it
kind of a shade over okay that's good
add some transparency it's not going to
be perfect hey but we'll work with what
we got and I'll just hold all flip that
over there edit transform flip
horizontally and now we have this side
over here but you can see the shadings
on the wrong side so I'll go to blending
options inner shadow I'm going to take
off global light so that it doesn't
affect this one over here and we want
this coming from this direction
I'll just come move it right there okay
and let me shrink these down so we have
this copy here right the reason we do
the little gradient overlay is because
what if we want to change the color real
quick
you just hit control you and you can
adjust the hue saturation I kind of like
that color so I'm just making it one one
one then I go to these two I'd say one
one one and the last one it just makes
everything blend nice when you have a
overlay like that and I guess um let's
see trying to select all these okay when
you're hovering over this layer hold
ctrl and you'll see your cursor had that
little dotted outline and then over this
one hold shift and ctrl and then hold
shift and control for this one and then
I'm going to make a new layer on the
bottom I'm just going to paint it white
so that there's something there and then
I'm going to go to blending options
let's see a drop shadow I kind of like
thick outlines I think it looked kind of
cool so I could just do something like
this well that actually looks pretty bad
inside center I think Center okay yeah
I'm going to use center because if you
look on the outside we get this little
white dotted edge because there's a
little bit of white on the edge I'm just
going to pick Center and the thing
that's good and there you have it
there's your ribbon thanks for watching
little door tutorial alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
