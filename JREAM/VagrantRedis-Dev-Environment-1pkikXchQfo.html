Redis inside a windows those binaries
kind of stink in there was crashing I
just looked up a vagrant box for Redis I
have a video to get started on a vagrant
you need a virtual box this guy and
vagrant and what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to clone this repository just
by looking up vagrant rattus and let's
see how it works so here's the clone URL
and I'll open up my little terminal
clear it I'm going to see dry playground
and I'll do a git clone boom and I'm
going to go into that directory and i'm
going to move everything down and remove
directory fig regret asst pry has some
get stuff in there let me make sure get
ignored get attributes ok alright so
let's see i'll say vagrant up and this
handles a precise 64 box if you've used
vapor before it's likely you've used it
it's an Ubuntu 64-bit server all right
so it looks like this installed pretty
quick i'm going to vagrant SSH and I'm
gonna sudo apt-get install H top I
always use that guy so I'll say H top /
Redis and there's write us at the bottom
so that's working control
see the cancel out just want to try to
write a CLI okay so that's listening
here set name Jessie get name okay
there's Jesse now what I'm going to try
to do is connect with a the desktop
application so let me go to my desktop
and there's a Redis desktop manager that
looks kind of nice I'll make a new one
I'll just call this playground and 127
001 and let's try it see if this even
connects db1 yep and now this is just a
visual guy here so what I could do with
an actual Redis client if I still have
the old file that I looked at if I could
open something up here workspace Redis
and let me close out a few files add too
much open ok so let's ok so in the
previous video we already did all this
and since I don't have it running at all
on my windows box it is running in the
background I can also close this if I
wanted to boom let's see range dada five
thousand records so I need to make sure
i have locally xam TP running since
that's what I use start start I don't
need my sequel running but i'll run it
anyways and in my console let's make a
new tab and I'll go to Redis PHP test
and look at that getting set
five thousand values if I hold the ctrl
button it seems to go a little faster
think the output sometimes takes a
little bit of time so with this desktop
guy I should be able to have more
records if there's a refresh button at
five no playground reload alright so we
have two records in here here we go
users and we have a huge table of five
thousand records there's 500 and
hopefully we have more Oh at the bottom
here we have pages pages a bunch of
pages oh man 10 pages 500 each stud
equals five thousand cool so this is a
cool little thing it's open source and
free it's called Redis desktop manager
download it if you want and now you can
play the reddest more stable instead of
on that those joke of a windows binary
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
