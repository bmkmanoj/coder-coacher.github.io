we're going to do chained methods and a
chain method will look like this we
first create our object and we can say
cupcake um not let's say 10 and frosting
is chocolate and sprinkles is 200 okay
and print our cupcakes okay and training
is just like this you can put it on one
line or two you can do it like that I
prefer it on several lines because it's
easier to use so we have our cupcake
class here I'm just going to do a public
cupcake equals array and then let's
create a public function called frosting
and that takes a string and we'll say
this cupcake frosting equals string and
we're going to do public function what
is it nuts and sprinkles nuts int and
we'll say this cupcake nuts equals int
int and we'll do one for the sprinkles
okay so now if we refresh this we'll get
an error okay class cupcake not found
I'll just require cupcake dot PHP we
should still get an error and that is
because we need to return the object
every time we pass a method so that it
knows what it's working with so we just
do return this and each function and you
got to remember you can only return one
item per function and when we do return
this once we run the nuts to ten then
this object here becomes the cupcake
object again because we're returning the
object once we call frosting
once again we return the object which is
the cupcake and that's how it works to
chain it together and let's see
undefined variable cupcakes
let's do print our cupcakes a cupcake
okay and there we have it we can apply
all this on one call if we want and
that's a value chain methods thanks for
