and this story we're going to look at
function arguments we've made a function
before with the keyword def and let's
name it just stuff okay and I'll just
press f5 and run this and type stuff and
there's function that does absolutely
nothing basically an argument is
something that goes in between the
parenthesis right here you see the comma
the comma separates the argument so this
would be three arguments and if you look
at our function up here it doesn't
accept any argument so you'd have to put
a placeholder variable in here so I
could just say a and I'll say print a f5
and I'll say stuff and it gives us an
error because you must have this value
assigned to something so i'll say stuff
yes and then it works now if you want it
to work where you could have a default
value I could say how about stuff is
garage okay and I'll hit f5 to reload
this and I'll say stuff and it gives us
garage and that's kind of like a thing
to fall back on if is a default value I
could say stuff and I could change it to
say let's say floor and it'll change it
to floor you can have multiple values
with a comma say a B and C and current
be and print see ya and I'll reload this
and say stuff as who that won't work but
I do stuff one that won't work because I
have to have all three defined so I'll
say stuff one two three and this just
puts one where the a is to where the B
is and three where the sea is now what
if you wanted to you didn't know how
many arguments you wanted to accept now
what you would use is a asterisks you
could say the star a
and you'll notice that star a it accepts
a lot of them and this will give us a
tuple I haven't talked about these yet
but what you want to do is a loop
probably so say for I in a print a and
we'll just print these owls a soft one
two three and that actually didn't do
exactly what we wanted but okay we just
won't who have you could have this but
this has to be the last argument in the
list if you have one because let's say
we have one called name and we have a k
so we'll print name and a I'll reload
this and I'll say stuff Jessie and it
gives us Jessie and then nothing if I
say stuff Jessie one two three four five
then it works fine but if you had the a
before name like this that's not going
to work because it's going to say
alright when do I when do I pick up the
name because this has sex any number of
arguments you could put as many as you
want it doesn't know one death do name
so make sure you put the asterisks one
behind it like this and there's also one
for two stars and this is afford it
azari dictionaries which I didn't even
talk about yet but a dictionary is kind
of like an associative array if you come
from other languages it's let's say
array key equals value in Python it's
like key value and dictionary would be
key value and you could separate these
as key to value 2 i'll probably have to
explain those better but if it reads it
based on this key
which is an associative array rather
than an index or integer value so don't
worry about that too much I just wanted
to make this tutorial so you understood
how these little things get passed into
functions I will also mention that
there's something called return okay so
let's say we have name and we do return
name plus ah hey okay and we run this
and we say stuff Jessie and really
nothing's going to happen and return
just returns the value rather than print
it I know it's showing it down here but
really what happens is you would say
print stuff Jessie and it would print it
out okay and that's pretty good for now
and by the way functions can only have
one return you can't return different
things so if I said return name and I
run this let's say stuff Jessie it stops
at this first one that just ends the
function you can also do return false or
its capital letter in Python and that's
that's just a trick to end a function
okay alright thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
