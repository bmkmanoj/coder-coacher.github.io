this tutorial I'm going to show you some
very basics of mod rewrite I am NOT an
expert with this I just do a little bit
to get around if you go to the site
point forums in the Apache area this guy
helps me out a lot
he is a very smart guy and I hope he
never sees this video because he'll put
me to shame
but I'll try to help you guys out with
some basics and you have to have mod
rewrite on obviously and the way you
enable that is under your HTTP d dot
config file and what you do is you just
find rewrite and you just want to make
sure this is being loaded this is
usually on on a lot of shared hosts so I
won't worry about that and if this has a
pound sign in front of it you would just
erase it and save the file and probably
reboot your Apache anyways let's get to
the rewrite so what I'm working with is
a folder here I have my HT access an
index file and another file and the
other file all this does is go to
another file ok nothing fancy and then
the HT access let's have some fun so the
first thing we have to do is say rewrite
engine on like that ok that means it's
on now in some examples you'll see um if
rewrite dot so something like this I
sorry I don't know the perfect syntax I
was told not to do that because it
wastes time having a patchy check that
for every single request ok so just have
it on and we're going to assume that
everything's good ok the next thing we
do is we create a rewrite condition ok
this isn't the rule this is the
condition so we'll say rewrite Co nd as
and condition and then a % in brackets
que request file name and
not D okay now let me explain what this
means this is saying the requests that
we get from this URL up here if the
request is a directory that exists then
we're not going to rewrite anything so
basically if I had this folder here I
said new folder and it was called test
and if I went to Jessie slash tasks like
that then it would not rewrite according
to the rules that we're going to give it
below okay and the same thing is going
to happen with dash F but this is for a
file okay so if we had a file let's say
other and we went to other dot PHP since
this exists it's not going to apply the
rules to that as well and for the last
one we'll do L for symbolic link okay I
don't really think I should attempt to
explain that I'll just embarrass myself
okay so we have all these and right now
it's not going to do anything and now we
create the rewrite rule okay so you type
re-write rule okay now we have to give
something to rewrite and we're going to
use a little regular expression and I'm
going to do a up arrow a group and then
the end of it okay so this looks a
little confusing I can't remember off
the top of my head I think the caret
means anything so anything before dot
star okay and what we're going to
rewrite is index dot PHP question mark
and we're going to pass a variable in
here that we can get with PHP I'll say
URL equals dollar one okay and we're
also going to put some square brackets
here and say Q s a comma L and you're
like what the heck is this
that qsa means query string append and
yeah whatever and L means it's going to
test it as like a path name or something
whatever is so embarrassing
anyway so we have this okay so let's go
to index.php that's our default page kay
and if we type slash test okay that goes
to the test folder let's get rid of the
directory kay and let's refresh and now
it goes to the index file so that's why
we have the directory thing on okay if
you want to do that next let's do let's
just do Jessie slash why why why why
okay and we're still at the index file
and if I type slash eight eight eight
eight or still here
so what we can do is let's open up
index.php and as you see in this HT
access index dot PHP it gives us this
get URL and a URL variable so what we
can say is um get URL and obviously
you're going to have to do a check like
if exists and let's do echo get your own
let's also echo HR or for horizontal
rule and save and refresh and you can
see it'll give us these parameters what
you also could do is say um explode of
get URL let's call this URL equals
explode get URL and let's explode it by
forward slashes now let's do print our
URL okay let's see what we get and now
we have an array of data so like if you
were making a way to organize everything
you could have a page handler like this
and this is a very simple example of one
where
like in a model-view-controller I guess
you could even do this could be the
controller and here's a function and
here's a parameter to the function what
I mean is this on function of you know
you'd call it URL 0 and then URL 1 and
you could pass custom functions that's
just a really sloppy example but I feel
like I'm ranting a little bit and this
is very simple mod rewrite I hope that
helped and I hope it's not too confusing
if it is I apologize but thanks for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
