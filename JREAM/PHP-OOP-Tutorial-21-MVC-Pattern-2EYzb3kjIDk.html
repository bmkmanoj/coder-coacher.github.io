I'll quickly try to explain MVC pattern
and you've probably heard of all these
frameworks Zen Symphony cake
this isn't about frameworks though so
let's just ignore that now there's a
argument from what I see on ways to go
about doing the MVC I guess it became
popular because a Ruby on Rails but I
don't use Ruby so I don't know much
about that so we have a model view in a
controller okay and this is just a
beautiful way to organize a large
application in my opinion you don't need
an MVC pattern uh for just small small
beans so what you have you have a
bootstrap Kay and bootstrap kind of ties
all these together and the bootstrap
gets uh in PHP terms I don't know how
other applications work but like in a
web browser you go to my site comm slash
controller a function value okay and
basically uh it loads a controller so
you hit up this URL and we're going to
load the controller and the controller
what that does it actually loads the
model I'll explain what each of these do
in a second okay and then the data from
the model it goes back to the controller
and the controller then goes back to the
bootstrap and I want to I want to
separate all there I'll just put it like
that okay and then the view then it
renders the view so basically the
controller um it could go back to the
strap well let me not get into that
right now um the model what this does is
it um is business logic business logic
and what's that database uh formatting
stuff creating or I could just say you
know crud create edit rename delete
whatever you want basically everything
that does stuff okay
this is where the money happens in your
application to controller basically what
this does is just a connection between
uh getting actual data based on this URL
and then passing it into the display for
the user and the view um that could be a
template um HTML Javascript CSS all that
stuff and let me type out what the
controller does the controller connects
model and view base on URL okay now just
to bring it up I've seen people say well
you should be able to grab call things
from the model from the view I guess
it's a matter of preference if you make
your own MVC or if you know you use one
that allows you to do that but for this
example and for myself I kind of prefer
it this way um okay so let's say they
load the controller and the controller
is obviously a PHP class and it would
have methods in it so it would load the
controller the method here and then the
value and if it actually had to do
something significant you'd pray call a
method inside a model model would do
whatever it needs to do like update a
database record and have the results
send it back to the controller
and then the controller would either go
back to the bootstrap and send it to the
view or it could just say controller to
view I'm not sure if there's a really a
solid standard I see a lot of different
ways of it being done anyways you say
well this is pretty confusing let me
open this up a second so I've got this
built here right basically I have a
library and in here I have a bootstrap
controller model and view and in these
folders I just have little libraries and
stuff but then your actual application
is where you have controllers like let's
say dashboard and you extend your base
controller most of the time because your
base controller will have methods to
collect let's say an array of page data
which you're going to pass on to the
view and you don't want to have to
redefine all this stuff you know so you
kind of want to extend stuff it was it
this is kind of a lot to take in and try
to explain I think in so short a time
and the model here is kind of like the
business data so hopefully you're not
too confused it might just help if you
played with a code ignitor this is the
easiest one to practice with a while ago
I found it a little tricky to get
started with just the whole idea of MVC
but if you do pick it up it's uh it's
really it's really good uh it just keeps
you really organized and it helps you
prioritize things so hopefully this
thing confuse you
much and sorry that my wording is a very
fancy alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
