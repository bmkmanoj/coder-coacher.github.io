we're going to just make a very simple
sample site with a couple of things we
learned so start out with an index page
and let's just pretend this is a regular
pay HTML page so here's our index page
and let's say we have a header and
footer and then this is will be the
content so we can just get rid of this
up here okay and let's copy all this and
make a new page will call this page two
and do it once more and just do a page
three okay and and if we go to the site
we have this page to page three and what
we want to do is make things reusable so
I would let's say there's header text
here and footer text sometimes there's a
copyright down here
and it looked kinda like that there's no
CSS so it's kind of plain so since we're
using all these on every page where we
should we're better off doing it include
like so cut this and paste it into a new
file and just call it header dot PHP and
do the same with the footer now what you
do is a PHP require once and will
require that file and the same for the
footer and if you refresh it you'll see
it's on all the pages so if you wanted
to change a footer you could do this to
every single page easy peasy now what
happens if you want to let's say include
some functions I just make a new file
and call it functions that PHP and then
just require this in each page
and we can create a function let's just
say the copyright and instead of putting
it here we just pop it in the footer so
the footer text and okay there we go on
every page it will appear and you can
use functions like so it is going to
save you a lot of time rather than
updating everything one by one if you
really want it you could also do put the
content chunk inside of the header
assuming that your site's laid out like
this you could put it here and then get
rid of these and then get rid of this
and then inside of your footer you would
have the ending do now you say oh well
what's the point of that all because
later on if you decide to add more
things you could just change the name of
this or what if you added a rapper and
you could contain it on every single
page very easily no matter how many
pages you have as long as they have this
layout um usually these pages would be
dynamic if they were coming from like a
database or a file just for example PHP
echo contents there's nothing in it
but you can see over time your pages
will get really simplified and cleaned
out so that's a good idea to do if you
lay out your sites and hopefully that's
a good starter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
