you a cool application I found to sync
here IDE settings be it sublime text or
IntelliJ and I have phpstorm IntelliJ
PyCharm six of them going on and sublime
text Visual Studio code and what happens
is you're always importing settings and
I know you can use things like export to
gist files or use something built-in but
this one actually seems a million times
better using Google Drive so it took me
forever to get this how I wanted with
tons of settings and debugging and
validation this happens to be phpstorm
so what you have to do is download two
packages the first one would be the
visual c++ redistributable all the way
back from 2005 and these come from
Microsoft but I'll provide these in the
description and then a program called
link shell extension so I downloaded the
64 bit I'm on 64-bit Windows and after
you install the link shell extension
you'll have to probably reboot but the
way this works is I'm gonna do one so I
have my user folder open my guys name is
in oh and I want to make a backup of
PyCharm
all the settings and it's the config
folder so over here is my Google Drive
I'll go to pycharm and it's empty and
I'm just going to right click this and
cut or ctrl X and paste and what I do is
just double check it's in there okay and
that's all going to sync but this is a
lot more configuration than just the jar
files that even keep your executable
settings if you customize Java settings
all that good stuff so I right click
this once its installed and there's
thing called
pick link source and I'll just click
that and it looks like it did nothing go
back to where this is right click drop
as a junction and that'll sync up in
everything and and I really like my
sublime text as well if I go to
preferences color scheme I'm using boxy
it's my favorite and this is the newest
material theme EP with customizations up
the wazoo don't know what's up with this
icon here
that's one bug but I can live with it
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
