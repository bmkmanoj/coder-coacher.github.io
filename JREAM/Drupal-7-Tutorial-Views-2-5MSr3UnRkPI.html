to use views in Drupal 7 and this is
kind of complex so I'll try to go to
understandable rate i'm going to assume
you already have views installed in your
modules for drupal 7 i will mention this
does require chaos tools right here so
you'll have to install that before you
install views and i'll just shrink all
these down okay and I have my views
enabled so we're going to make a blog
listing kind of like wordpress how it
lists out blogs and what I'll do is
first go to content and if i go to add
content we're to have something here
called an article and it says use
articles for time sensitive content like
news press release or blog posts and
that's what I'm going to use just for my
blog posts and to do this we first
should create a structure and we're
going to create a view okay and don't
get scared by all this stuff in here
just go ahead and go to add new view and
let's call this blog there we go and the
view type will just be node and next
and this next part is probably very
intimidating basically what we have here
is a bunch of options and this builds a
query from your database and it groups
things together and it's a little point
and click with this to try to make it
easier but there's a lot to understand
I'll go through a very briefly we have
we want to select things our only
articles so we're going to do a filter
so i'll create though click the plus by
the filter and when you click that it
looks like it did nothing and you just
got to scroll down and i'm going to go
to node which is a default content type
and i want to filter them by if it's
published and if it's a certain type
remember we looked at the content types
so i'll go ahead and click Add oh and we
want to make sure yes that it's
published then wait for this and the
type I want it to be one of the article
remember the content types once again
and update for the Rose style I'm going
to click this and select node update
and something like this use pager this
is this will show like 10 listings per
page I forgot to change one setting down
here the build mode will be a teaser
kind of like it shows a portion of your
articles and I believe that's good for
now but right now it's not going to do
anything because we have to actually
create a page so first let me go ahead
and save this overall thin ok now it's
saved and what we're going to do is add
a display and there's a few of these
we're just going to do a page and add
display ok and if you see something in
at alexs that just means it's derived
from the default settings so if you let
if you had a page that shows listings
than a block like on a side bar that
shows listings it would all fall back on
default settings that aren't changed
which is pretty cool and what we're
going to do for the page is first change
the path and I'm going to make mine blog
just like that and update and on my menu
I want it to appear in the menu how
about a normal menu entry and i'll call
this blog the navigation is not where I
want in the main menu right at the top
and the way I'll just say like 15 if
it's this is just the position of where
it appears the heavier it is the more to
the right it goes ok additionally we
could do some sort criteria where if we
wanted to list it by the publish date if
I click the plus there and I went back
down here to node and we can sort it by
the post date
ad and you can say how you want to sort
ascending descending I'll just update
and override so this looks like a kind
of confusing thing here with all these
settings but if the morning monkey with
it the easier gets if you scroll down
you see this query that it creates for
us too so I'm going to go ahead and
click Save to save the overall settings
and what I'm going to do is go to my
page / blog and it's working and here's
the item up here at the top what we need
to do next is create some content add
content and we're going to create an
article remember we're listing this blog
area with articles and all those call my
test pop that in there
I don't want a menu link because it is
going to be listed under the blog for
the URL path settings this is kind of
important i'm using path auto which you
should probably be using audit if you're
not right now and if you go to URL alias
patterns I've already changed this but
by default this is blank pattern for all
article paths and what we want is that
if we click a page inside of the blog we
want the URL to go to blog / than than
the page name so you should put blog and
then these square brackets that say no
title additionally you might have the
word content on this path here you'll
want to get rid of that also this was
easier to read and looks better so i'll
save that it appears we have to create
the content / so i'll go ahead and go to
add content i just want to make sure the
URL was correct and article and i'll
call this test and really it's pretty
much good from there I'm going to do one
more page so that we can see what's
going on so add content once more
article i'll call this test 2 and save
ok so I met my blog i'll hit refresh and
here i have test and test two it looks
like I probably want to change the order
of the way this list so so let me go
ahead and go to structure views and i'm
going to edit the blog
and the page and we wanted sorting the
sort criteria I wanted to list
descending so i'll update that and save
that
and I'm going to go to my blog page and
there we go the newest ones at the top
additionally if I click this link notice
how we r / blog when we do the path auto
it goes to test two and it looks a lot
better know what I mean if you can also
list your things in the sidebar by
creating a block I'll go ahead and do
that real quick under the view I'll go
to block add display and all this is
pretty good i like that for the let's
see theme expose Edmund and let me save
it first so that I can hopefully get a
preview down there
so I'm going to click preview and here's
what we get we'll get this and I only
want the titles to show so what we're
going to do is change the row style from
node which is like a full page two
fields and if you think of like a
database we can select only certain
portions of the content and we can go
ahead and just update that and you
should get an error that says there we
go it says using fields but something's
up so we go to this little fields box
here click the plus sign and what do we
want I pretty much just want a title so
I'll click this group and go to node and
title anything else mmm not that I know
so I'll just click Add and a pretty big
list is going to pop up after you add
this and this is a label that will
appear before you usually probably just
want to leave this empty and you could
probably unchecked Colin after label and
most of that's probably pretty good just
see how it looks I'll update and we can
go ahead and here's our preview down
here that looks good I'll save and in
order to get this blot to display where
we want it we would go to structure
blocks
let's scroll down to where is it looks
like I missed something let's go back to
the views real quick structure views
and blog edit okay we got a block in
there and a page so this should be
appearing in there I don't know what I
did wrong well let's see block we have
black one display status
yeah it appears it should display so
I'll go back to structure block I might
have forgotten to give it a title
correctly blog block sorry this was in
there from earlier so what you're going
to have down here is something called
blog block and you can pop this into a
flock somewhere and I'll put it in the
sidebar second and save or just about
done so i'll go ahead and hit refresh
and here it is on our block here we can
jump to articles real quick on our blog
from this block or on the blog page we
can get a listing of 10 of these at a
time I'd actually have to adjust this to
show the teasers again for the page
sorry about that but this tutorial is
getting quite long I hope this was a
help thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
