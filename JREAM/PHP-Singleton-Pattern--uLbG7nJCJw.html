gonna be a short video on what a
singleton pattern is and how to use it
in this example we're going to just do a
database object nothing fancy or
anything just give you an idea and a
singleton pattern is good for using the
same set of methods and functions over
and over throughout a system or
application and that would be really
useful if we need to do a lot of MySQL
functions and we need the connection so
I'll start by writing a little PHP
document and then I'll make the class
and since it's a singleton pattern we're
going to do a private constructor
just so that we know it gets created
let's do an echo okay and if we do try
to create the object it's not going to
work because it's private
so we need to create a static function
and we'll create it from the static
function within the scope let's do a
public static function Connect if let's
say if something then we'll create the
object okay
let's create a variable up here that'll
be a static one so if it's not set self
connection we're going to make that self
connection create the object and then
we'll just return it okay and to do this
we'd actually do it like this instead of
just creating a new database we do DB
equals database which is the name of the
class colon colon and the static
function which is connected their
connection created okay and then you go
through let's say public static function
query
and this would just be something like a
MySQL query or actually you put the SQL
in there and what this does is let's say
we do db2 equals
database Connect we're supposed to see
two of those but it knows that this
connection is already created so it
limits you to a single connection and
that's where a singleton can come in
handy and I think it takes a little
while to get used to these static
functions it's really difficult to
verbally talk about it now all right
