com running and loaded and what I got on
here are my premium streaming courses
these are big courses so if you want to
learn something in depth check it out
I'll just hit the products area here and
you'll see i have basics codeigniter
Python JavaScript and Falcon at the
moment got a couple other ones in the
mix the content for these range from say
two to five hours if I just click this
guy here you can create an account dream
or just login through Facebook and you
get unlimited streaming all the source
code through get and I take you
step-by-step through the series and if I
just scroll down a little bit you'll see
this series has a lot of stuff to it we
get a little wild so go back to the top
and you create an account and once
you're logged in you'd have a dashboard
like this here's the course that I
purchased and inside of here what I have
are the great out courses i completed so
I could just click this guy here and
here's my streaming video I'll just have
play in this week and I'm going to pause
it because I don't want to hear my own
voice and then just a little resizer and
light toddler it doesn't fit too well on
the my recording screen when I make it
large but anyways I hit complete and go
to front end set up and you can go
through these videos and build out the
code with me and get really good let me
go back to the course and i'll scroll
down a little ways and here we have a
little progress bar how far along you
are in the course and you can get all
the source code andriy media bitbucket
or you can ask questions if you're stuck
there's just a couple other things like
support if you're having problems with
your video or anything and my account so
if you're interested in some premium
full courses rather than hit or miss
here in their courses
I spent a lot of time recording these so
hopefully some enthusiasts or developers
would like to help out another developer
and we'll be in a cool Club you guys so
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
