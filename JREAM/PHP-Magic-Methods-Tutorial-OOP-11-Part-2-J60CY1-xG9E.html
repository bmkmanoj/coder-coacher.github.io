this will be magic methods part 2 and
we've already gone over a construct I'll
just review that for you just say
function construct and say echo 1 let's
say echo I don't create it and if I
haven't mentioned this before if you
don't put public before a function it's
automatically assumed public so let's
just make a variable and say test equals
new test and let's see that outputs item
created there's also one called
function destruct and this is called
when your object is destroyed or unused
and let's say item erased or destroyed
and if you refresh you'll see that also
and that is because when the PHP is done
running the page it tosses out the item
so you know if you wanted to do it
earlier on and you add you could just
say unset test and you get the same
thing um there is also one called two
string and this one is useful at times
let's say function two strength and you
have to return a string so let's say um
and just put a string in here this
happens okay and we'll say echo test now
normally you can't echo an object less
you have to string in there and that
I'll know what to put out if you're
going to do something with it if we
remove this and try to echo test we get
a fatal error
you can't convert an object into a
string so that's what two string does
there's also one called clone function
clone
and um you know you could this is when
you use the clone thing let me try to
explain it let's just say echo one clone
is when you say test 2 equals clone um
test and refresh okay it got cloned
basically um if you said a test 2 equals
test you would be actually using the
exact same resource as this in memory
and it's not a real clone so what this
does is it clones the object state and
gives you a brand new one to work with
if you ever need to make a new object
and when you clone um you can say
whenever clone is called
do something you could have this log
into a file you know you could do a file
write data was passed I'll just do echo
and if we clone data was passed pretty
cool and I guess I'll just do one more
this one's called invoke and just do
function invoke and what this does is um
it gets called when you try to run an
object as a function so just say you
can't do that man and how does that work
that'd be like if you want test one and
just put bars and if we do that you
can't do that man so you know if someone
made an accident there I've never used
that for anything but uh there's a
couple magic methods and good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
