cool feature in adobe photoshop called
puppet warp and it's under the Edit menu
and right about here and if you click
this and you have a background you're
first going to have to get rid of your
background so let's do that real quick
and delete looks like i deleted his
little hands there i want to pop those
back on and delete okay and go back to
edit puppet warp and now we have a mesh
all over the guy you can change the
density of it and it'll change the grid
and the quality of it i just like to
leave it at normal and then you have
this little pin tak what you do is you
click where you want his joints to be
movable and the puppets really simple so
we'll just have four points there and if
you want to move when you just click the
point and you drag it and it kind of
moves with it you can hide the mesh so
you can see how it looks and you can
make them look pretty funny you can also
rotate his things you have to hold down
the Alt key and this little circle
appears and just hover around somewhere
and then click and drag now let's see
what we can do here oh man you could
make a funny animation out of this
that's pretty funny let's drag that down
maybe let's see how good it looks if we
move his hand up that's but that's
that's not too bad actually looks like
it kind of distorts it a little bit what
if we went to more points let's try
moving it up wow that is amazing how
good that stretches
you can just basically make this puppet
behave like an actual puppet so let's
show the mesh once more and okay this
just makes it fatter I think I'll bet go
back down to two points well that's fine
and apply the warp and now we have a
warped picture I'm just going to oops i
opened up mini bridge here i'm going to
make the canvas size twice as wide so
i'll just say 850 and slide that over
and here's the original you can almost
pose this as if you had it in your hand
that's pretty cool you don't only have
to use this with puppets either you
could use this with a real person so
real quick let's just attempt to do that
I'll make a new image and paste a
picture of this man who is very fit and
I'm just going to erase the green screen
or the plus tool I'm brushes a little
tiny okay and i will delete better get
that part delete and let's try that out
edit puppet warp and i'll just click a
joint here here here and just a couple
more joints and let's hide the mesh and
let's just try dragging that it looks
like it will let you stretch it far how
about we rotate it let's click this and
rotate looks like his hips aren't
staying in place let me create a pin
down here see if that makes a difference
there we go so you can lock it in place
like that it's kind of a tough one to do
because he's not straight up and down
I'm gonna undo those I guess I'm having
trouble doing that whoa all right well
you guys get the idea thanks for
