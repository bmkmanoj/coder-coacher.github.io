welcome back this is tutorial 4 and
we're going to cover here are key and
grouping now I changed a couple of
things so that it fits on my screen
better the page one last thing I'll do
is make the header a little smaller okay
the first thing we're going to cover is
here our key and here our key is on the
way things are nested alright for
example you see this head tag within the
head tag is a link tag and to write that
you go head link because link is a child
of head and for the body tag I know this
is an all tabbed out correctly because
it would just take up too much space
horizontally but this body tag starts
here and ends here and children of the
body would be wrapper div content evader
div and and if you want to go even
further
you'd say body header or sorry body
content h1 and you do a hierarchy tag
like that why is that useful well let me
show you why let's say we have an h1 tag
here and it says hello welcome to the
site now generally it's not a good idea
to have two h1 tags on a page so let's
just have these h2 tags alright this is
an h2 tag and this is an h2 tag and if
we go down and define H to let's say
font size and we'll do 20 pixels and
let's say background is a purple okay
now this applies to every h2 tag
the reason hierarchy is good is rather
than having to define a class for this
such as content h2 what you can do is
just call it out this way
so this is in the content and h2 so you
could say content h2 background read and
refresh and now we can change that and
basically we're trying to keep all the
control possible within this stylesheet
you don't have to say body content
because body is a given for the most
part of the document object
thingamajigger and you can go a couple
of levels down also like if we had
another div in here or how about let's
see span let's say we had a pre inside
here and this is pre formatted text okay
so we have content pre you could say
content free of background gray and
refresh now pre formatted text if you
don't know what that does it just makes
it so it appears exactly as it's written
in the page so if I hit enter twice it
will space it down two lines okay so
that's here our key might take a little
practice to get used to very important
and also important for JavaScript if you
ever get into that now we're going to
cover grouping grouping we can say
rather than saying if we have a heading
one and if it was the exact same as
heading to see how we're wasting time
defining both of these let's put a h1 in
here
this is a h1 tag so we refresh this h1
h2 they're both the same so why waste
that you could say h1 h2 now you use a
comma there and refresh and see it's
sharing the same values now what if you
wanted your h1 font size to be bigger
but both of them to have the same
background color then you just declare
the new h1 setting after the grouped
settings so say font size equals 25
pixels and there it is this one's bigger
now so you're basically overriding the
group tag and you know you don't want to
make your CSS too complicated but this
is very clean-looking right here also I
didn't mention before to comment in CSS
you just do slash that's a forward slash
asterisk asterisk forward slash and you
type anything you want between these
lines and sometimes it's good to comment
your CSS such as a structure then we get
a little ways down I'd call this text
you know you could make it pretty if you
want with little underlines I'll just
leave it plain like that for now and
hopefully that gives you a good idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
