says five viewers at the top I can't
tell where they are you okay can you
hear me oh ok I don't know if anyone can

google hangouts if how i can chat with
you who are in the youtube channel um i

chat on the side I was hoping people
would show up here and I could chat to
everybody and they could join me but
that's not working well share share
what's that knew about and share what
they live sure there's a lot of us hang
out do you think I don't know if people

well I guess I can hear me is anyone
saying anything let me open firefox do I
have another YouTube account yes I do I
think I do let me login over here sign
in I need my phone for two step
verification I don't know it's in the
room okay I want to know what people are
interested in I've been working in
dotnet recently visual c sharp it work i
have uh I have the visual studio but
i've been working in c-sharp and it's a
it's an extremely complicated language
at least to start learning because
there's so many ways to do one thing I
think PHP is a lot easier but I'm liking
dotnet I don't like this
dietary software that's my only gripe
with it otherwise it's a very nice
language let me try login here 754 44
okay how you appear yeah yeah yeah let's
see you do not bother well I don't even
know what I'm going to be talking about
there's only seven people watching well
if I can't engage with the users there's
no reason so i'm at user dream design on
a different account how come I don't see
the chat it's love how do i chant with
people hmm you want me to say this like
how you go 70 go get on google chat go
down there is this it where's the people
chatting idea ok they appears comments
well then what does author withheld me
oh that's cool see don't make tutorials
in 480p I try not to usually I use them
microsoft expression encoder screen
capture and the resolution i do is a
fixed size of 1280 by 720 and i always
try to do things in this fixed size
because it keeps the youtube videos
proportion very well one newcomer update
automatically this is windows 8 uh what
i did recently i just downloaded
this thing is called pico and it gave me
a start menu because windows 8 without
the start menu is terrible I would be
how do I get I don't even know how to
get the start menu back the original one
this will overrides it let me see if I
could disable it it's called pokey so
right here it's free oops let me close
this it's pretty sweet though cater
windows 8 for windows XP and seven it's
not as cool but it just looks like this
compared to like you get this sidebar
here um well here's the stark screen
yeah this is windows 8 you're used to
seeing whoops i click the way i'm trying
to get to the right window there we go
how do i get there okay here-here's the
regular windows it is the window showing
up on the screen yes okay and i found
this kinda kinda useless i download a
plugin where I could switch these tiles
and make a picture but imagine having to
go to this every time just to open a
program near tidy SQL it's just
ridiculous look at this calculator this
is the worst thing 59 / 8 I mean I don't
know who would really use this may be on
a small tablet but how do I get out of
here so to get out of this stuff see
this little hand at the top of the
screen um it looks like my windows
lagging my thoughts on Windows 8 um I
like Windows 8 in the fact that it's
really fast what I don't like is the
this entire interface here I think it's
really useless and I think it's a really
bad idea but it is a lot faster I am
using a solid state hard drive I picked
one up for like really cheap and that
could be a
out of the reason why it goes really
fast too but just to open up a program
I'll shoot it's really quick if I close
netbeans out and I open it back up it's
usually a beast to open oh it's going
kind of slow now but there it is would I
recommend buying windows 8 no I wouldn't
um I think windows 8 shots yeah it's not
that good like the colors of things like
if you didn't see my start menu it's
transparent this dark gray the arrow
theme that windows seven had was a lot
nicer I prefer that way more let me
throw this away and let's go back to
that thing here like they have these
widgets and I understand this is for
phone and stuff this was like a little
game someone made where you solve
puzzles but I got far enough where I
have to buy it five bucks on a ripoff
okay um so they have this bar which is
really confusing you go to the top left
and there's like your desktop view the
bottom left is your start view so it's
kind of like yeah desktop start and then
if you go to the top and then slide down
you get like a menu bar so if i go to my
start over here and i do that again sad
these two windows open so i can actually
drag my desktop and it's supposed to a
snap whoops how about gears yeah i can
snap my desktop so it is pretty fluid
but the problem is they didn't really um
they didn't give you a halfway point
like who's going to use 140 or screen
isn't that crazy like I really can't
make use of this but
does run pretty good let's see you can
get the start menu back you just go to
classics shell I saw 107 but consuming
pre-work Classic Shell you do have that
option to use classic shell right now I
downloaded pokey I was using a start
aight i just uninstalled it because I
thought this was really nice this side
beast of a start menu here sublime text
2 never became a big fan of it yeah
windows 8 supposed to be going up and
price after july what month is it
january thirtieth the version i got i
got a pre-order so it was a fifty
dollars i had ten dollar discount and
it's the parole version which is going
to go up to two hundred dollars i
wouldn't pay two hundred dollars for
this because i use it exactly as i use
windows 7 i've used the touch screens at
the store but i've never had one they
seem like they be cool I won't lie this
was a touchscreen it's pretty sweet but
this area where the touchscreen is not
cool it's kind of useless so those
windows 8 tablets I don't know everyone
at work they use Apple so I'm kind of
the odd man out set for one guy actually
this is Windows a Microsoft c-sharp
express this is free you can actually
make c-sharp applications on here which
is pretty cool I thought this had a not
a console application but a Windows
application is a windows form yeah you
can make windows GUI applications with
this express version obviously you're
going to have to know c-sharp a visual
basic
I want I want right in visual basic I
with arm C sharp but C sharp is it's a
pretty difficult learning curve i just
started learning it and i'm using it for
a dotnet project you can get a visual
web developer I thought this was free
sign into Microsoft let me um one thing
I did like about Microsoft is that I
installed windows 8 on another computer
and it saved all my settings and
everything I wanted what is this they
basically want you to fill out a survey
for a license key there we go copy that
guy a lot of the windows tools they're
very cool for development if you like
Windows but they what does that mean I
thought this product was free okay there
we go whoops get my window back where'd
my dad go did I leave the channel I saw
people chatting so yeah I use win8 on pc
i don't use metro on my desktop yeah
that's that's what it seems like
everybody's doing metro is just not good
for a desktop man I just that's what I
do too hopefully so far I'm really
liking this I just go to all apps i
click star go to my favorites and I got
you know my little icon here looks like
you can make more pages whoa never know
about that that's cool but obviously
nobody in the right mind would want to
use it on an explorer
it's not a good program so with visual
web developer 2010 Express to do a a
c-sharp project I've been doing it in
the MVC web application and thing things
get pretty complicated in here I'll just
hit OK and I want to make an Internet
application let's see I just want
connect in connectivity between my
windows devices like how I phone can be
used for a neat things on Mac and such
um I don't know much about the iphones
and how they connect to the max what if
they do that's cool I have an Android I
like a lot let's see so I doubt anyone's
interested in this stuff bothers quickly
run through it if you are going to do a
MVC asp.net you'd want to do in c-sharp
and put the razor rendering engine I'll
just run through this real quick and
again I'm just trying this live hangout
you can't hear me Google do that and
it's awful I can hear you what did you
say ok visual studio is a very
intimidating program looks like I have
this in visual basic because this is not
um this is not C sharp new project I
want C sharp web there we go internet
application with razor and so basically
what you got is all your stuff you need
in here the guy work was showing me the
Sam and it's basically here's your
controllers your models and your views
if you've watched any of the videos on
the channel there's all these MVC
tutorials this is a lot harder though
because
um you have to typecast everything it's
something called a list so I want to
make a list I'd say um I first have to
tell my variable what it is so it's a
list then the type and if i want it all
strings on a list it looks like that
it's really weird then the variable name
would be lets say items equals list
string like that whoops you see how it
has red underlines that's nice it will
correct everything you do so if I did
something like this public void test
that would mean it's going to return
nothing but if I did public int test
it's going to give me an error if I
hover over this not all cold paths
return a value so if I did return one it
fixes it um yeah hey spar thur I have no
idea what this is about either I was
just trying out the google hangouts see
if anyone wanna it sometime do like some
life help or questions or something I'm
not really sure I'm new to it I finally
figured out how to see what you guys
were typing in the YouTube channel
thanks to my precious precious wife calm
down am I am i yelling too low hey this
doesn't look right what's this error
here equals list string what the heck
was that what is this I don't want that
okay but the real visual studio is a lot
better than the basic version the
express version but uh it's a lot of
work man you can't run this on a Mac or
Linux that's one down side and running a
windows server is a
price here but if career wise I think
that dotnet pays pretty big money man
let's see will you do a new create your
own MVC video people seem to like that
one I'm not sure why I think you guys
just like being able to make your own
stuff let's see library project let me
see real quick where it last left off I
think that one wasn't on github and that
was in the lab um no I was under open
source I want to redo this site make it
easier to use let me see part 10 so
where we left off with this bad boy I'm
not going to get into a right now I just
want to see um where it stands we see
next logon I don't even remember logging
for this was a headman admin so I'll
open up that project in netbeans is she
like the wandering precious our lord of
the Rhenus um yeah I tried Komodo at it
um it's a good editor one of my bosses
actually uses it I've used it a little
bit but I'm so used to the hotkeys and
netbeans I'm practically married to it
that's why I love it as far as the MVC
where we last left off I don't know if
it was like consider it would let me put
it this way um this wasn't supposed to
be an all-in-one like
your hand through it was to give you the
general idea so that you could expand on
your knowledge of it but if people keep
wanting more of it I guess I'll make it
and try to make it better there's
definitely a lot of improvements that I
could make on it it's pretty basic right
now I prefer things to be simple like
that I was recently using the zend
framework and for YouTube API so other
users can upload to a generic youtube
account through a brain fart I forgot
anyways there's a lot of work to use
zend framework freshest I i if I don't
know like the best place to get feedback
from people because I go to my YouTube
account and i get so many emails and I
reply to them and then it's like they're
not in your contacts so I just wasted
all this time writing an email out oh no
man it's so annoying so I made some web
forms but those don't seem to be the hot
topic I think these are pretty small 29
members I'm not sure the best way to do
it so I was going to try out this google
chat thanks see if this was something
people like to engage in but uh so don't
know so perhaps at some point I should
plan or get some feedback somehow or a
pole or something of what people want to
see because i don't like just making
crap some that will help you in your
programming journey three laughing at me
no oh man so let's look at what kind of
applications i have a lot of stuff man
python
actually the project I was working on
actually I actually started using code
igniter a lot because it work we use it
and it's just really easy to use you
should write a chat room or just get
people to email you ah email hmm a lot
of people spam that already good yeah
yeah looks like there's only one guy in
the show man sparse Arthur hey let's see
what time your channel sparkler looks
like a final fantasy figure hmm looks
like a fan of the darks man been
watching Mike Tyson and MMA and stuff
and that stuff is crazy okay so back to
what I was saying um I was making a
project here I'm having a hard time
finding time to work on stuff so i got
my project right here and i use twitter
bootstrap i think it's pretty and right
now it's pretty plain and basically what
someone could do is they could create a
user and give them a role i guess we'll
be a default I and it looks like i have
a bug because i just changed all the
forms to twitter booster have but you
can create groups let's see if I broke
this one too oh man that's embarrassing
yep I call this title it's okay you
haven't advertised it lord of the rings
online if you do tutorial slide and that
way we learn together um I'm not sure if
more people are subscribed here that are
interested in programming or graphics
I'm not a fantastic graphic artist
but I know how to use the tools a little
bit so that's really where it becomes
who wants what I know people I've heard
a lot of feedback from the MVC that's
gotten a lot of feedback I was starting
a new code igniter series and it doesn't
seem like a ton of people are crazy
about that so I'm not exactly sure what
the majority of people are looking for
is that only the MVC series is that only
PHP JavaScript or graphic art that's my
trouble just went to starbucks bought my
wife a new computer chair because hers
was a fifteen dollars from target and it
was like sitting on a brick it was like
sitting on a brick now she's all happy
um so code igniter is what I'm writing
my new project and it's very simple this
is one reason i enjoy code igniters
because you know you make a class you
extend the controller and they have
everything built in that makes it really
easy to use python no starbucks doesn't
sell chairs other chairs aren't very
comfortable anyways oh i see you're on
the YouTube the I'm in Google+ there
should be I have no idea how this works
it's pretty impressive that Google did
this let me pop out this window so I
would think that it will show here if i
refresh the page so start a hangout it
looks like i have this going it's hey
look who else is a are these live Oh on
air Jason Benitez Google+ week
I don't know what any of that is yeah
I'm not sure this will need the most
popular thing to do the google live
journey through the JavaScript MVC
jungle there's a ton of JavaScript MVC's
and I have no interest in pennies I
don't think at the moment I don't think
there are worth while but I could be
proven wrong very shortly there's just
too much there's I think it's called
arch j/s it's called google j/s
framework angularjs um I only write a
little bit about it so sorry I don't
know much about it but there's a lot of
sites that look really pretty and you
think well I should use this because
google made it but you know Google made
the goal language google go and i don't
know how well that did I don't know
anyone to has learned it it looks kind
of dated then now there's Google dart
dart looks a little bit better because
there's actually a real dart page tart
looks better because it compiles
JavaScript it compiles to JavaScript so
it's actually something usable in its
object oriented so it looked pretty cool
I just don't like to learn something
that doesn't seem to pick up otherwise
it feels like it's a complete waste of
time because you know we all gotta earn
our bread in life what's the point of
learning something no one's gonna hire
you for I've got to make bread somehow
man well I guess I'll just try out let's
hang out guys um I don't want to be rude
and cut you off or anything you know
it's hard to talk to everyone to
so I'm probably going to close this off
and if anyone has any suggestions i know
it's only 14 people here maybe two that
we're listening including myself you can
send me a email i guess if you want or
if you have something cool you're doing
you know cuz it ain't all about me man i
just like talking about this technology
and coding it's really fun you know send
an email or google message i checked my
google emails maybe twice or three times
a week they're usually most of my
youtube messages are about people who
want help with their homework oh yeah
you think you have learned darks man but
anyways guys make sure you use github if
you're not on github you're out of date
man use get home I think that I'll wrap
up this video it's a 9 p.m. on a friday
and i'm recording on google+ it's a sad
day i should i should be doing something
more fun than this right now but i guess
i'll catch you all later if you have any
suggestions just send it to my inbox and
i'll read it I read everything I didn't
always reply to it because I'm not your
contacts okay someone close this don't
be offended because I'm ending the
broadcast now I'm not trying to be rude
I'm gonna close them out thanks for
watching though guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
