gonna look at jQuery UI and the dialogue
and if you look up jQuery UI dialog you
get this and I'm going to go through it
and explain why you might want to use it
and how to change some of the settings
that's not terribly difficult the first
thing I did was you can go to my site if
you'd like and go to open-source and
download website template 0.2 and I have
everything included you'll have to drop
this in a directory that runs PHP so if
you're in lamp you might have it under C
Drive lamp
ww and you should be able to do that and
what I have is this I just cleared
everything out and up in my folder it's
just called site template I have this I
open up my index file which is where
we'll be working and I opened up public
J s custom J s so let's go ahead and do
that custom J s I got it right here and
basically this is a document on ready
the shorthand version and I'll go back
to the site template open index.php and
we have all our includes setups so that
I don't waste all your time so I can go
ahead and close that and what we want to
do is um first show you a regular
confirmation in JavaScript you can say
confirm and let's just say mommy
I saved and I'll refresh and we get this
and this looks different on different
browsers this alert box on the Mac OS X
I believe it comes in from the top and
if you want a custom UI dialog we would
use jQuery UI to make that a lot easier
and what we first do is we have to make
something inside the box so let's make a
div down here I'm going to call this div
Ideas box okay and whatever we put in
here is going to show up in our dialog
I'll say hey mommy do you want milk okay
and for the jQuery I'll say ID of box
dot dialog and refresh and it says hey
mommy do you want milk and we have the
same thing basically we had here what
I'm going to do is go through some of
these options and they're pretty cool
what you can do let me shrink some of
these down on this list there's just a
ton of stuff and to do options it's very
very easy we have to pass an object in
here and remember in JavaScript and the
object is just these curly brackets and
objects have parameters like name Jessie
and the end with commas dog yes that's
an object and basically we're passing
something like this into the dialogue so
I'll just paste that in here now
obviously these don't really apply to
the dialogue so we'll go ahead and make
one and you could go through here
manually and look through these options
if you want I'll just do a couple that I
find useful they show you how to do it
it's terribly simple so how about title
and I'll say mommy milk
we can set the width and I'll just say
500 don't put px after it this isn't CSS
height of let's say 200 and remember
always end it with a comma and one thing
you're going to have to remember is if I
just stopped with it like this your last
item should not have a comma because
it'll cause problems in Internet
Explorer that's one you got to remember
so I'll refresh and says hey mommy do
you want milk and here's the title up
here now our regular confirm had two
buttons and what we're going to do is
create buttons now this one's a little
more tricky I believe this is under oh
it's right under buttons and it says
buttons array and an array in JavaScript
has the square brackets
so remember var array equals one two
three so that we can have multiple
buttons and we're going to apply that
same principle to the buttons so first
we give it a property called buttons and
then we create an array and inside this
array it's an array of objects that's
where it gets a little confusing okay so
we have our array and now we have
objects separated by commas
I'm only going to have two buttons so
I'm going to do it like that
and for the button text of the first one
I'll say text equals okay whoops wrong
quote for the second one I'll say text
equals nay save and refresh and I have
okay and nay they don't do anything at
the moment and what you can do is click
so that when this button is clicked we
create a function and try to keep your
brackets tabbed over because this could
get very confusing if these are on the
same line
merci and I'll say alert you said okay
and for this one we want to close the
box
so as I click function and we do this
dot dialogue close and this refers to
the object we're in which is this
dialogue so refresh and it looks like I
made an error I'm not supposed to where
did I make my error
let me see function this dialogue dot
close what has happened aha I see I
forgot a comma here
so sorry about that refresh and here it
is okay you said okay nay and it closes
it what else we can do are some more
preferences like let's say modal is true
and a modal window you know what this is
once i refresh it you see this
background here it makes sense look
pretty sweet nay another property we
could do resize let's resize the bulb is
false refresh and now they can't resize
it with that little icon down in the
corner we can also turn draggable off so
draggable will be false and now they
can't really get out of here they're
forced to either say nay closed or press
ok
there's callback events in here events
and things like drag start when they
focus are open I'm just going to do one
so that you can see what it does if I
did drag start we do a function don't
forget your comma and in the function we
have to pass the event and the UI so
I'll say alert you are dragging me and
there's the obviously obvious problem we
have draggable false so we have to
disable that refresh and I dragged you
are dragging me there we go and I'm not
sure what that could be used for but
whatever so what if we want this to only
come up like say if someone were to
login if this were to be a login form
what we could do is just do an input
type equals text I'm just going to
make this real short let's submit just a
regular input form in HTML and name pass
and submit a mine you want to log in so
if we were to do a log in form like this
and refresh my heights a little low
sorry I'll fix that we could have it so
this is a log in form but we'd want to
log in button to click and I'll show you
how to do that first of all I'm going to
change the height one second height will
be I guess 500 and let's make a link a
hrf goes to nowhere ID equals log in
will say log in okay and we have to bind
an event to the login ID so I'm going to
say ID of login dot click function okay
and just to test it let's just say alert
one and I'm actually going to cut all
this because this is going to get in the
way ctrl X or edit cut so that we can
reuse it refresh and login it says one
okay and rather than alert one we can
paste all our stuff in here and you see
these tabs are unequal I'm going to
select all this and tab it over just
once more this tabs are very important
so I'll refresh login and it gives me
this okay now the problem you might see
if i refresh this is still here and what
you want to do with that is for the box
we could do style equals display:none
refresh login and there it is and you
could have a specialized login box
alright guys thanks for watching if you
found this useful give me a thumbs up
and I'll feel really special just
kidding bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
