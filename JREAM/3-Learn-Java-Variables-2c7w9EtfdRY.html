and in this tutorial I'm going to
explain variables in the java
programming language I've made a class
and I just called it VARs and I've saved
the class as vars Java so we have our
standard opening statement that is the
public static void main just type that
out and to define a variable it's really
quite easy in most languages let me show
you you would usually type something
like this VAR a equals 20 and another
language you might say dollar b equals
fish and in another language you might
even say um tackle equals 500 very
simple and to the point but in java it's
a statically typed language which means
you have to define what your variables
are before you make them in in these
examples fish that's a string which is a
line of text 520 those are both integers
so first let's make an integer variable
we write the word int and the name and
i'm going to call this one num and we
give it a number value so i'll say 50
end it with a semicolon and i will know
that if you put these quotes around it
it's no longer a number it's a string a
string of texts with the text value of
50 in it so you don't want the quotes if
you're doing it integer let's do another
one called a double and this is for a
decimal place I'll say double and I'll
just call this dbl equals on 50 point 21
I'll tab these over so they're a little
easier to read okay there's also boolean
values and boolean means true or false
so you can write boolean and I'll just
call that bln
and this could be true or false okay so
what I'm going to do is output some of
these let's also do the string before we
do that string actually has to be typed
with a capital letter because of string
it's an object that has a lot of
manipulation things attached to it so
string and i'll call this str my name is
Jesse okay so here's some primitive
values of primitive variable types and
integer double boolean and string okay
and let's print these out i'm going to
say system dot out dot print line and
i'm going to copy paste this four times
and to print the value of a variable we
just type in the variable name in the
first case it's numb the next case it's
double boolean and strength okay so i
already have shell open my command
prompt and i'm already in my working
directory so what i'm going to do is
compile this Java Sea warszawa we
compiled it and now let's run it java
farce and you can see we can output all
these different values pretty cool i
will say this right now we only have
this one function here if we were to
make another one these variables would
not be available inside the other
functions because this is what you call
a local scope in other words in between
these little brackets even though
they're in the same class we have the
virus class but these are inside the
main function or method you can't use
these if you had another one if we had
something like public
static void talk you couldn't grab one
of the values by saying let's say bln
because this is only available within
these brackets here however in
object-oriented programming you use
something called this which means the
instance of the variable class I
actually shouldn't get into that because
that might be a little too confusing up
front all right so there's how we make a
couple variables and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
