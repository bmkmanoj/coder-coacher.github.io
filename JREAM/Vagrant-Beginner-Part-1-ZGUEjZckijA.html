talk about vagrant and why it's awesome
because you can have a development
environment that is identical to your
live environment locally and you can
share it among all your development so
thank you a Shi Corp for making this and
thank you Matt fabu for showing me it
and if you're wondering who Matt
fabulous if I can pronounce his name
right here he is right here and this is
his Twitter if you'd like to follow him
you might have to pause the video it's a
little hard to spell he's French and
French people are pretty smart man so
follow Matt and what I'm going to do in
this video is just get you started with
vagrant I'm not going to get into puppet
because I'm not good enough at it yet
I'm still playing with it and I'll
describe what puppet is probably at some
point so vagrant to get started you just
download it right and get version 1.3
point 5 and you download it for whatever
your system you have I have mine
installed once it's done installing
really it seems like nothing happened
but you now have a command line option
okay so feel free to download and
install it there's no need for me to do
this step again and what we're going to
do is head up in a terminal I'm using oh
I don't know what it is get so I'm in C
Drive workspace it doesn't matter where
you put this I'm just going to make that
directory
called vagrant and then I'm going to go
inside a vagrant and you don't have to
call your folder vagrant I'm just
calling it this for this example the
next thing you're going to need to do is
vagrant in it so vagrant in it alright
and it creates a vagrant file so if I
list I have a vagrant file and before
you even can use vagrant you need
VirtualBox by Oracle and it's free if
you've used parallels you'll know what
it is it's this handy little guy here
make sure you get a copy of that it's
free makes you very happy okay
and once you have vagrant and VirtualBox
installed what we need is a Linux
environment to install and just so
happens there's vagrant box ES and this
site has a bunch of vagrant boxes they
show you how to install it it looks like
I did my in it without a title I'll fix
that in a moment and I'm just going to
pick a package of one that I prefer I
highlighted on this page but since I
highlighted it again I don't have it so
Debian wheezy amd64 minimal install plus
puppet that's what I want
I like Debian I will say you probably
want puppet installed on your virtual
machine because it's a provisioner that
will install a bunch of software so you
don't have to redo it by hand and if you
and your buddies or coworkers are
working on something and you all use
vagrant you're going to have a better
life so without further ado I'm going to
go ahead and copy this link okay
and let's go back to our guy here let me
do Vega
grin in it and what was the name of this
file it was called Weezy 64 okay so
whatever you get just do it in it and
I'll call it Weezy 64 let me remove the
vagrant file and do that again okay so
there's a regular file and they give us
instructions right up at the top on how
to get this going we add a box of the
title in the URL so oops I'll say
vagrant box add Weezy 64 and then the
URL I'll paste that bad boy in and this
is downloading a Linux distribution that
will tie in to everything this may take
a little bit it looks like I'm in five
and a half minutes I don't have super
fast internet but almost two Meg's a
second that's not bad so what I'll do is
I'll pause the video and I'll unpause it
when it's done all right guys we have
Weezy installed so let's go ahead and
check out what this vagrant file has in
it I'll open up this sublime text
and I think this is it I happen to have
it chilling here all right so if you did
an init vagrant in it it'll say bass if
you didn't provide a name you just
rename that to whatever your packages
and here I have the VirtualBox URL you
probably want to include this if you run
pass it along as a box okay and what we
can do is create a forwarded port for
mapping and all that stuff basically
what you want to do is just uncomment
this and hopefully you're not using port
8080 and I will say if you don't have
syntax highlighting just make sure the
syntax is in Ruby so I'd go to view
syntax rule and you'll be able to read
it okay so keep in mind this is vagrant
to API version so if you look at Doc's
make sure you're not looking at version
1 because the commands have changed from
what I've noticed okay
and what we want to do for this is
pretty much build a development machine
so we needed accessible on our host
machine and I'm going to change this to
dot eleven because I'm using dot ten and
let me explain this to you inside of
this guy the VirtualBox
when we run vagrant it's going to create
it inside of here and you'll see it in
this machine inside of here is the guest
machine okay
the host machine is Windows or OS X or
whatever you're using your host machine
is the machine you're on so if you get
those terms straight when you read
documentation it's a lot easier to
follow okay
so with all this good stuff going on I'm
just going to ctrl s to save the file I
believe I just covered pretty much the
basics to get our rolling and what I'm
going to do in here is now say vagrant
up hopefully I didn't damage anything
but it's just basically booting up the
virtual machine and I'm going to pause
the video once again it takes about a
minute I don't want to waste a minute of
your time
all right guys I'm up and running and
basically it gives us a little bit of
info maybe a warning then the shared
folders which I'll tell you about so to
get into the virtual box we can SSH into
it but let me show you this up here you
see now we have this guy running in the
virtual thing now you don't need
VirtualBox manager open to actually run
it just so you know I only have this
open just so you can see it so I'll
close this up and let's get into it
vagrant SSH and I'm not doing anything
puppet based like I said right now but
you now have a system that you can
access and to prove it to you
on your host machine we're going to set
up a patch sheet so let me first do a
sudo apt-get update so all my goodies
will be safe and sound now at the moment
this is just regular Linux this is a
vagrant or just using Linux but with
vagrant does is it ties your host
machine to your guest machine with the
same development environment that you
can share among your peers ok so I got
all that stuff and I'm just gonna do a
sudo apt-get install apache2
and I guess PHP 5 dev ok yes just
standard stuff to install all this good
stuff no big deal
okay now that was boring to watch and
point being is that with puppet you
don't have to sit there and watch it
so Apache we got the little green okay
so it's up and since it's up we should
be able to access this IP which we have
set in our vagrant file so I'll copy the
URL here and I'll paste it here and
here's the default Apache welcome page
and let's open up kit again so if I go
to CD VAR w W I'm just going to remove
index and then I'm going to Nano index
dot PHP I'm not elite enough to use vim
I'll just echo out a PHP info shoot
I got a sudo it that's annoying okay and
I'll refresh the page and here it is and
now it's a totally separate environment
that we can use through our host machine
pretty cool and as far as the vagrant
folder I can go to CD slash vagrant list
out the contents and we have our vagrant
file in there so if I were to say make
there wwa I have that directory there
and under my favorite folder I have a WW
folder there as well and what does this
mean it means that we can change we can
create a virtual host and Apache or
whatever nginx and point it to this WW
folder and do that so why don't we go
ahead and try it for the heck of it CD
etc' Apache - and let's see sites
available and what's in here
let's nano default and what we're going
to do is make sure we do sudo nano
default otherwise we can't save it so
I'll change this to vagrant ww
favorite ww and that looks like it so
control X and yes and I'm going to do a
service Apache to restart Apache to
service restart that's weird
I don't have all those beautiful hotkeys
I used to so sudo et Cie and knit dot d
Apache to restart okay so it restarted
and let me refresh the page there's
nothing in here
so on my machine here I'll just make a
new file blah dot txt I'll just I typed
in test on another screen there's blah
txt but now we have this guide showing
here in a virtual machine that basically
does all the work for us instead of
having to use something else so that's
kind of the basics of it if there's
enough interest I'll go on and make sure
I master some of the puppet scripting so
that I can show you more because this is
just an intern entrance and thanks a lot
for watching you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
