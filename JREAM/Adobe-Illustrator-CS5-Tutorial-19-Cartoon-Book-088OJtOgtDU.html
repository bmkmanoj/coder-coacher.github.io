we're going to make a like a book or DVD
kind of case thing I'm starting out with
the perspective grid right here and you
can kind of mess with these little dials
to get it to the size you want what I'm
gonna do is make this side a lot smaller
so it's in that perspective and the book
right here is gonna be a lot longer
that's a little too long so I don't like
the angle this is on it needs to be a
little different and I'm not certain how
to adjust that very well anyways let's
just make a square on the grid okay
there's our square there and how about
one for wrong side this side okay and
that's probably all we'll need of the
grid that's a pretty lousy looking shape
so what I'm gonna do is hide the grid
view perspective grid hide grid there we
go so we got this funky-looking shape
and i'm gonna grab these two points here
and I'm just gonna shift click to move
it down I'd say about there looks good
and yeah about there so now we got the
shape of a little box here and I'm just
gonna make it I guess this will be a
book do a gradient on it
red book okay and click I to get the
eyedropper tool then hold ctrl and click
make sure you have this box selected
okay and let's just fix the gradient on
these so if the lights coming from on to
the front cover that'll be the brightest
I kind of like it with the the bright
color at the top a little more okay and
then this will be darker I don't get
that okay that's good enough I'm going
to take off these borders so it doesn't
look so funny and I guess let's add a
little edge borders along here I'm just
gonna do it the way off the top of my
head that I'm comfortable with I'm just
going to hold alt and drag this down
actually I'll grab both of these and
drag them down and then I'll grab both
of those and drag them up and I'll grab
the pathfinder I think that shift now I
forgot the hot key window Pathfinder and
subtract and subtract okay and I'll do
the same thing for the top and subtract
subtract and I'm gonna make these a gold
color so I'll pop that in there pop that
in there and darken that up and I'll do
the same thing for these cool and I'll
just drag that there and I'll drag that
there okay um
it looks like this would kind of bubble
out a little bit if unless you wanted a
perfect square so I'm going to do a warp
on that
the Bulge Oh better put these back to
the zero okay yeah I kind of like it
like that
so I'll just delete that whoops object
expand I'll delete these things up here
and I think I'll do the same thing for
this just to make it a little more
interesting okay so this will be our
book expand appearance and once more
I'll just do this again drag these up
whoops
subtract subtract I'm not going to worry
about those lines I don't want to waste
too much of your time and subtract
subtract and this will be gold like we
had before I'll just drop this orangish
color on here and I'll slide that one
down actually the darker color should be
the one on the left okay there we go and
we'll just move these up and we'll move
these down and that is actually kind of
neat looking that would put a little
title on it
let's just say my book and this has to
be on the angle that this is that
perspective
so I'd proudly first pick a better font
than this what's something interesting
yes I'll just a gesture actually since
I'm gonna distribute this file I'm just
gonna do Times New Roman okay and let's
make that a little bigger and I'm going
to do abjectly expand and we have these
little dials here once again and what
we're going to want to do is transform
it whoops get used to the wrong hotkeys
of the free transform tool so what am i
doing it's not let me select the the way
I want to do it so I guess I'll just do
a warp an arc yes we could do it like
that my book and you see if you played
around with that a little better if I
show up correctly
oh wow this already got seven minutes
long all right I'll save this file and
upload it for you thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
