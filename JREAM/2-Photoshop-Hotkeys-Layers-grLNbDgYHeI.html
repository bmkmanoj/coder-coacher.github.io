what we'll be doing but I'll just create
a new document and I guess we'll get
used to some hotkeys hold ctrl alt and
press 0 on your number pad and you'll go
to a hundred percent and if you hold alt
and use your scroll wheel you can zoom
in and out you'll probably use that a
lot but I get you sir that ctrl alt 0
because you'll want to move around zoom
in zoom out and just go back to the
normal view once again the spacebar
holding that down gives you this hand
pan across stuff then like the M button
is the marquee you can hover over these
to see the hotkeys there's M and I think
that's V so let's create a new layer
make a box and you see I'm still in the
box like tool just get used to hitting
the letter V and that pops here and I'll
make a new layer and just hit em for
Marquis and let's move this over here
and notice when I have this selected it
doesn't do anything
even if I'm on this layer to move
something you have to use this little
arrow tool and if I select it here it's
going to actually move part of this box
very cool and then get used to the short
shortcut ctrl D to deselect and that's
up here you can see these des electives
ctrl D and that's when you'll probably
use a lot so back to em and then there's
the Paint Bucket
that one's a G we have the Paint Bucket
there and if you hold shift and press G
you get to the gradient shift + G
toggles the two here so you could just
go like that title back to that
basically if you're starting out it's
good to make a habit of hotkeys even
though they're a little bit frustrating
at first it's just a real good idea okay
so I think that's just some basic
hotkeys that'll be important to you and
then let's get familiar with the layer
panel real quick layers it's just you
know like a cake you're putting things
on top of things
this is like one of the most important
things so let's pretend that's a cake we
make a new layer and let's pick a color
and this will be some frosting make
another layer and this one let's just
make some sprinkles okay and I'm going
to hold a V or press the V and then hold
alt okay and if you move your mouse you
get these little double pointers and
this means you're going to copy the
object okay but you can see it made a
new layer if we kept doing this
we'd have all these layers of these
little dots and that's kind of useless
and a bad idea unless you put it in a
folder I guess you could you know make a
folder pop it in there then you could
put all your little dots in there but
for this what I'm going to do is select
all hold alt and drag and this will keep
it all in the same layer and you know no
need to abuse the layers alright so as
you can see let's say we want to hide
the toppings or want to hide the
frosting and then you can work on
whatever layer you want at once if you
need to realign the little lines there
just use your arrow keys and you can
also rename your layers to frosting
what's this called flower toppings
now don't worry you're not going to be
making stuff this ugly I hope it's just
to get familiar with it and the layers
they have a lot of
to it for example up here opacity and
you can just drag this to the side and
let me move it a little and that changes
the transparency of it
there's also layer styles like this I'm
not gonna go through those I don't think
that's just a lot of monkeying around
and seeing stuff you like it can do a
lot of cool things though and then
lastly there's the blending options
you'll probably use these a lot they're
really cool because they apply to
everything within the layer so right
click the layer you want to go to and do
blending options and now we get all
these kind of styles we can do we kind
of drop shadows and notice it's below
the red piece right there okay I'll just
make something real silly add an inner
glow you know you just got play around
with this stuff I don't think I need to
go into all kinds of detail with it so
we got that then you can copy the layer
style right click it and you can't see
it on my screen but it says copy layer
style and then right click another layer
and click paste layer style and whoops
we can do that too that one also and you
can hide these layer styles when they're
good well if you follow it along you
probably created something as ugly as
this but we'll do some cooler stuff and
a little bit I hope thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
