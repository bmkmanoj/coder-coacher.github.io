little tutorial about PayPal ipn instant
payment notification and you should
already know what that is if you're
watching this tutorial so I have a file
here called PayPal dot PHP just in a
test folder and here's how it works
a user buy something from your buy
button that's step one
and our Buy button is we go to the
merchant services and we can create say
a Buy Now button and what you put in
here is really up to you what really
matters is step three down here right
here the custom URL after they check out
and on step two the Buy button is
configured with a URL for PayPal to go
to when it's complete and when PayPal
completes a transaction it's sending all
these invisible posts that we can't see
okay and the page that we put in here it
has to be a real website it can't be
like local like your localhost it'll go
to say this page with the code that's
going to ask PayPal if the payment was
good or whatever right here at queries
PayPal to see if the result was good and
if it was good we're going to update
some kind of record now you might have
say a user logged in and you're keeping
track of him with a session variable and
you can update his account to say he
paid on this day or that day so it's up
to you how you are going to update
records I'm just going to do it a very
basic way for right now and down here I
have the URLs once for the official
PayPal section the others for the
sandbox and you're going to want to sign
up for a sandbox account at developer
PayPal com
and that's where we can test it out
without spending real money okay so
without further ado I'm actually going
to put this in a class and you might say
why well because later I think I want to
improve on it so I'll make a new file
compact class PayPal ipn and we'll start
with a public function construct let me
save this as PayPal ipn and I'm actually
going to rename this page to index real
quick that has to be a dot PHP file
rename that to index okay okay so good
and I'll create a private method and say
let's call it run
this is where we'll call PayPal and set
up an option maybe so for the options
we're going to be able to switch between
the sandbox and the actual server so
let's copy these URLs and paste them
here and I'll call this variable mode
and we should always comment our goods
and RAM string mode and we would say
live or sandbox
okay and by default we're going to put
it to live because you're probably going
to only use sandbox a couple times and I
will do a little if statement if mode
equals live this URL equals a real
paypal address else this URL equals that
okay and that'll be the URL that we're
going to run our curl request with and
I'm going to do a private URL and bar
string URL okay
and if you've looked at the paypal
sample code it it's pretty old-school
looking and we're going to do a little
differently a little better and use curl
so what we need to do is set up curl
instance and I will call CH variable for
curl handle and I'll say equals curl in
it and I like to do curl close CH so
that I don't forget to close it and curl
execute our thingymajig I'll call this
result and in here is we're going to put
the goods curl set up or right and we
have to pass in the curl handle and
create an array okay and inside the
array we are going to pass just a couple
things
curl option URL curl out return transfer
make sure you got that spelled right
because if you look at mine I got curl
top
see that whoopsie-daisy and we're going
to do post and post fields okay and I'll
explain these in a moment and for the
URL it's going to use the URL one or the
other
so we'll just pass in this URL return
transfer yes because we want to see the
results post yes and post fields this
will be I guess let's call it post
fields okay and that looks okay so far
so an instance of this we would go to
this actual page and delete it and I'll
say require a pal IP n dot PHP now I'll
say new paypal IP n and remember in our
construct we had a mode parameter and i
want to do the sandbox and if you don't
pass anything it will default to the
live URL and i don't want to do that so
so far so good
what we need to do is get the invisible
values that paypal passes and to do this
we're going to do a for each loop on the
post so for each post as key value
and post fields dot equals let me just
explain what we're doing here we're
basically posting to say let's say this
URL and actually have to copy something
over real quick
and it's this okay let me do post fields
equals notify validate so really this is
the first part of it and it's going to
be kind of like this and then we're
going to do parami Quilly and per m2
equals value to this is what the for
each loop is doing it's going to build
up what the user let me take a step back
a second the guy buy something paypal
goes to our page with data that it posts
and that data we're going to gather it
all up and then post back to paypal to
see what the status was on okay hope
that's not too confusing and I'll do
ampersand key equals value oops I need a
dollar symbol here and just to be safe
we might want to URL encode this so dot
URL pull value okay
so post fields I can echo this out for
actually it's not going to be anything
right now so I'm going to need to echo
it so I'm going to go to my test page I
rename that to index and it looks like
nothing really happened because oh I
didn't I call the result echo result
hopefully that works
nope curl setup array curl in it and it
was this PayPal ipn construct mode live
we didn't even run it PayPal
run okay so we constructed it and now
we're going to run it
let's hit refresh oops that shouldn't be
private public function we're on there
we go
refresh and we should be getting
something back but we're getting nothing
back okay guys sorry I had to pause the
video what is happening is a little
strange I just echoed out a curl error
here and if i refresh I get in a SSL
issue so we need to pass in a little
parameter right up here and we'll do a
curl option SSL verify here and set that
to false and let me go ahead and refresh
again and we get invalid good that's
what we want so we have that all set up
now what we want to do is actually test
this out and to test it we have to be on
an actual site so let me open up my
windows folder that has this real quick
over here ok so I have these two files
and I got to open my FTP
and here it is I'm already connected and
what I'm going to do is just drop these
files in and I can minimize minimize and
let me go to dream comm slash test slash
I think that was called index.php okay
and here's the page on the live site so
now we go to the sandbox and I'll go to
the test tools and instant payment
notification simulator and I want to
pass it to that URL and transaction type
we can just pick a set one of these
they're fake and web except what you're
going to want to do is also check out
each X because you don't want to give
someone access if they give an a check
because those can take say a week or two
to actually clear and they can cancel
them and get free access and all that
stuff so send and it says IP and
successfully sent but how do we know
anything actually really happened what
I'm going to do in this case is just
create a file down here and keep in mind
this class is really dirty and not
totally put together right now so what I
want to do is let's say F open result
dot txt and I want to write to it and
I'm going to do F right of
fh4 file handler and what I want to
write inside the file is the result and
I want to see the post fields to make
sure it's doing something okay and
depending on the server you're on you
might have to make this file folder
writable so I'll do 777 and refresh
their paypal ipn and minimize okay so
I'll try to run that ipn thing again
send IP and successfully sent and in our
folder let's check I'll refresh and I
got no file created maybe I forgot to
forgot to close the file oh I'm working
on this locally this is an update on my
server let me open this file I'm just
going to close that now and do file
handle equals F open result dot txt
right the reason I'm doing this is
because I don't want to connect to a
database and set all that up right now
this is just to see what's going on and
I'll do F right to the file handle and I
want to write the result
and the post fields make sure
something's going and I can't forget to
close up okay save yes and go back here
send IP n it says it's sent so refresh
and here's my result file I can view
this and it says invalid that's bad and
it gives us all the information that
happened with the guy so let me make
sure I'm sending one that is good so I
want to do a web a SEP yes confirmed
verified this should be good but I'm
having a problem if you let it
discard open reload and valid again I
wonder if my post fields are legitimate
these are my post fields here so CMD
notify validate see this looks like a
correct URL so far the URL encoding is
working as you can see these percent
symbols and plus symbols so let me pause
the video once more and give it a run
through with my eyeballs
okay well I'm pretty foolish I'm trying
to run this on the live server when I
needed to be running this on the sandbox
that's how it goes a program you make a
lot of mistakes okay send IP n okay and
let's look at the result you edit
and reload and verified looks good so
this would what we would check for is if
we get this verified value back in the
result let's say you send something like
a a check pending let's see what that
tells our server okay and now you add it
and it says verified so you're going to
want to kind of dig into this and see if
this each check is if it's cleared
because you don't want to get someone
access if it's not cleared not going to
get all into that now but hopefully this
gave you a basic starting point what you
would actually do is create your PayPal
button and pop in that URL those same
when we were pasting in here and once
they buy we send them back to our page
here and we probably update a database
or something so down here instead of
writing to a file you do something like
if Brazil equals verified this DB insert
you know you died in certain to the
database or something else do something
else but I'll put this kind of the
paypal IPM template up on my site in the
open source section and you can download
it and mess with it and I hope this was
a help for you thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
