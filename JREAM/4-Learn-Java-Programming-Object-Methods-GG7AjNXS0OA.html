tutorial I'm going to talk about objects
a little more and these primitive types
okay now you'll notice we have a capital
S 4 string the type is a string and this
always has to be capital because the
string is always an object now in these
cases you see int double and boolean our
lower case and these are not objects and
if you most of the time you have to pass
an object into a function to do
something and um to do that make an
integer and object you would do integer
and for W do a capital D and for
bullying a capital B let me go ahead and
compile that Java VARs oh I'm not
outputting anything but anyways the
difference between those is that an
object is kind of like a class itself
and you can use more functions built in
on it so with the string and we have a
string object here called str I can do
STR dot and then a method that's built
into the string object so i could say
substring and substring as a function
and we put little functions in these
parentheses and I want to get the
substring from position 0 2 position for
ok first I want to output this so I'm
going to do a system dot out dot print
line
and I can just copy this and put it in
here and you'll also notice that system
is also its own object its capital and
yeah yeah so I'll compile this and we
have a error string dot substring sorry
sub string I mean I'm used to PHP so
I'll recompile that and Java vars and
you see that although our string says my
name is Jessie the substring says get it
from place 02 place for and then a
string the first character is 0 and then
1 2 for the space 3 4 name and four for
the eighth what this does is it gets 0
and it stops on for so really what this
is getting a zero one two three and when
it sees for it stops right before that
that's what substring does let's do
another system dot out dot print line
I'll make a couple of these so we can
type them in so now the integer is an
object it doesn't have a whole lot of
built-in functions that I found but
let's go ahead and do num dot double
value and a double is one with a decimal
place like this so we're grabbing this
int integer of numb and the double value
so let's recompile and run it and you
see it adds a point zero to the end
because that's the double value of 50 if
I change this back to int and I tried to
do that I'll compile it will get an
error because it's not a object
so there's a difference between these
integer with the string there's also one
for length that you could do who could
save STR and by the way so you don't get
confused perhaps i'll name this to my
str so it's my string and dot length and
don't forget your little brackets
because we're calling a method inside of
this string object and go ahead and
compile and run it and it's 16
characters long all the way from start
to end and these are just some basic
methods but they can be useful let's do
a upper case I'll say my Stern dot to
upper case and by the way you'll notice
that things are camelcase you starting
method out with a lowercase letter and
if there's an additional word it starts
with a capital letter that's Javas cold
convention and it is very pretty and
I'll also do to uppercase my string dot
to sorry lowercase and go ahead and
compile and go ahead and run and you see
it takes our original string here my
name is Jesse this made it all uppercase
and then it made it all lowercase so
nothing too fancy they have some other
nice built-in once one is called replace
so system dot out dot print line and
i'll say my string dot replace okay
first i'm going to close the brackets to
the system out and for the replace
function we can replace letters so in my
string i have e a lot and i'm going to
replace e
with how about X so we can see it and
notice I put a comma for my second
parameter they have documentation on
this stuff but basically the first one
is saying what are we looking for the
second one is saying we're going to
replace every one of these we find with
X so I'm going to compile and run and in
this line you see it replaces e inside
of all of their and that's pretty cool
there is also a replace all which looks
like this all and I can't remember but I
think there's a replace first let's go
ahead and try that Travis see and whoops
there run it and you see if we use
replace first it only replaces the first
example of it and am ii but then it
doesn't replace the rest so these are
just some built-in functions and sorry
methods you can look up one more for the
string we can do system dot out dot
print line and we're going to see my
string dot starts with and let's do my
starts with my and let's go ahead and
compile this beauty and run it and it's
false now why would this be false it
does start with my but the letters
lowercase and that's actually a
different character so if we start with
M my capital letters we would have a
true and run it and we get true down
here now sometimes what you might want
to do is cast it to lowercase first so
that the string is lower case and then
do the starts with okay well that's a
good start for now before this video
gets too long thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
