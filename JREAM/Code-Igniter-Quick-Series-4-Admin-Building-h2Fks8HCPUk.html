part four of the codeigniter series and
what we're gonna do is make a good I
login if you were called lastly we had a
guy we created in our admin panel so I
go to my users I have tested test comm
and a password so first of all let's go
to our admin controller and our user
model okay and back in our admin
controller what we're doing is create
doing a post of email but what we want
to use is coded nighters built in one
which is automatically loaded this input
post and the reason to use this is
because it well for one it looks more
stylish than this buffer to it prevents
oh I forget CSRF or some kind of hacking
thing it's a little protection method so
and here I'll just say email I'll make
another one and say password and I guess
I'll assign these variables
okay to delete the user ID we won't
touch that one yet so we're basically
doing the same thing what we want to do
actually is encrypt this it's the
easiest way to do that would maybe be to
shall want it or something
but we can leave that up to this class
here so I'll say sha-1 and sha-1 if I'm
correct it's 40 in length so I guess
we'll just see what happens when we
create one tells us to another email
submit and might have been an error
nope there it is so I'll copy this and I
had 64 bits length so let's see how long
this is let me open notepad to see the
length and down here it's 40 so that
it's correct cool so I'm just gonna
change my database table to 40 in light
save okay also for security measure so
this doesn't get dictionary attacks
we're gonna want to salt it we could
really put this in a number of places
such as the config mmm but I don't
really want to do that so to salt it I
would make a constant I'll just copy a
chunk of text here
hmm I was gonna name this application
Constance and we'll say define hashkee
and you can put in anything here you
want it's just a salty password
so I'll just say fisherman pants with
that and then we'll just append that to
here with hash key okay so let's see if
it works I'll refresh that post and
there we go it's just the same password
but you see it's different so that's why
I just salts it makes it more confusing
just make sure you never change your
hash key once you start saving users so
that is working nicely let's go ahead to
the delete user so one thing we're gonna
need to do is get the user so say public
function get and they could optionally
pass in a user ID and will default
assign it to null so if user ID is null
fetch all else fetch one and to do this
we'll do this DB get where the table
name will be user and we want to get
user ID equals user ID okay so that will
whoops this is for fetching one of them
sorry and for fetching all them will say
this DB get user and we have to do
this TV result and I'm going to print
are this because I might have it wrong
so we have a getter and in the admin
page for the index I'm just going to
call this load model user model and this
user model yet so let's see what that
gives us go back refresh undefined thing
driver result I believe I have to assign
a variable to this sorry about that so
I'll say queered
and query and then query results so we
should be able to get something from
that there we go
that gives us a chunk of data so instead
I will just return query result and
since we have this here I'm gonna do a
dot comment and what did that return
let's see that returned an array of STD
classes so the return type is really an
array and for this
it can be integer void where get one or
many users okay so with our little get
will quickly so I better double-click my
window assign that to the view so admin
and we will say users equals blah blah
blah users and users so we're assigning
users the users value to the view with
the data it coming from the model so
I'll go down to my admin view I'm gonna
do a little loop for each users as key
value echo value user ID just make sure
that works refresh and it's a std class
so I have to do arrows instead whoopsie
daisies save and refresh and there we go
so briefly I will just make a little
table for this so I'll say table and
let's do it this way the in line for
each and now I'll say TR for table whirl
and TD for table divider cut that little
chunk of guy out and let's see hopefully
that looks a little better refresh one
two three okay
and what else do we have in our table we
have an email I suppose I'll list out an
email email and this will be options for
now we'll just have delete I'll make
that an anchor tag and I guess we could
use it a heading so tea head th I'll
just say ID email options and while
we're at it let's just throw a tea body
around here to be correct and will
refresh and see how that looks okay cool
that'll stop this video for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
