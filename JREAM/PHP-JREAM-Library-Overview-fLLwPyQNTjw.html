library for calming PHP tasks over many
months and if you'd like to use it feel
free you can go to my github / dream and
it's called library this is meant to be
super super simple and very minimal it
has a Model View controller setup in it
and for this class I use little parts of
it once in a while but I don't believe
any framework is a one-size-fits-all
that would be an anti-pattern of the
golden bullet which is bad so it's
always good to try different things and
I prefer this for smaller applications I
think like codeigniter is a good
framework it has a lot of settings but I
often don't need a solution that big
however i'm going to show you how to set
up an MVC in my library so what I'll do
is I'll go to my tags and I'll just
download the latest okay
and oops I better reopen that and I have
this funny file here and what I'm going
to do is make a new project in my
localhost directory I happen to call my
workspace and I'm just going to call it
sample and inside of here you see I have
my stuff all I really need is the dream
folder so i'll create a new folder i'm
going to call it lib let's say I have
other libraries I want to place in here
then I could just put them in that
folder okay next I'm going to be using
NetBeans because I like it a lot to
create a new project and it's a PHP
application with existing source next
and just locate your folder if you are
using NetBeans and this supports version
5.3 and above so here's my source files
what I'm going to do is create an index
file
so what we have to do or what we should
do is require the autoloader because
that'll make our life super easy so if
you look in the lib dream folder here's
the auto load file so I'll just require
lip dream autoload PHP ounce a new dream
auto loan and I have to pick the
director I want to autoload and you
could use this for other directories if
you want it like if you had a zend
framework directory but I want to use
this for just the join files if I happen
to use them so i will say lip dream
where they have a slash here or not it
doesn't matter and next we're going to
create the bootstrap for the MVC so i'll
say bootstrap equals new dream nvc
bootstrap ok and bootstrap and then ok
so what we have to do here is actually
load some settings from the bootstrap
but it's meant to be super light and
simple so what I'll do is a little dis
guy up and go to work space sample and
it says you must run set path route so
let's do that i'll say bootstrap set
path route and most the time i can just
do get current working directory
sometimes if you're on a live site you
might have to add a slash like that
and I should show you this inside the
MVC folder the bootstrap I have all this
stuff copied here with some options so
by default on our controllers folder is
just called controller models is called
model and views is called view basically
nothing's plural so controller models of
you and if you don't like it that way
you could always say bootstrap set path
controller and you can call it anything
you want really control control if you
wanted to call it that but I'm not going
to do that stuff so with this what I
also want to do the last step is set a
default controller so boot strap set a
little would that say upset controller
default and all those combine index so
basically your homepage you load
basically this page this would be the
default controller and it's looking for
the index so to do this it's really
simple i could probably swing down a lot
of the stuff and just create a new
folder I'll model a new folder called
you a new folder called controller ok
and I'll create a new file and
controller called index
so I'll say class index extends dream
MVC controller and we just do a public
function construct the reason I do this
is because in my opinion I prefer not to
abstract a framework so much that it
feels foreign I like it to feel like
we're actually writing true object
oriented code because I've used some
things than it feels kind of like it's
from outer space and it's not really
getting you comfortable with the
language that's my opinion so our main
page would be public function index so
index would be it might look a little
confusing because we have the name index
here twice let me just echo two and show
you I'll make another function real
quick i'll call this one about so here
i'll refresh and it echoes out too
because the default controller when
there's nothing loaded it loads the
index one which we defined right here
and the index function or method is what
gets called if you don't supply method
so by default if I say index dot PHP /
index this loads the index controller
let's call the index method it's still
the same thing but I could change the
method to about and oops I forgot to put
the URI equals index about and I guess
that brings to mind let's do the HT
access so you could do it a slow way
like this with the URI equals whatever
your controller is I'll make a HT Access
file so we can rewrite this stuff
I'll say rewrite actually I have this
right inside they'll read me so if you
kept the readme or not don't know but
it's right down here you could just copy
all this junk paste it in here and my
rewrite base since I'm in a virtual or
sorry a subfolder see I'm in sample I'm
going to make my rewrite base start at
sample so that basically my urls will be
like brewer rewritten as if it was just
that's the home folder so i'll say
sample and let's cross our fingers and
hope it works so we should be able to go
to index about yep and if i just go to
index and just loads that so that's
pretty easy um you can also pass
variables in here like say anything and
other
and I'll just echo out anything and
other so what would that would be is I
do my things a little different I just
prefer this way because it's super easy
so the arguments actually go in the URL
so i could say index about dog fishface
and here we have it's the about method
inside the index controller and it's
passing these two arguments and it's
pretty sweet if you ask me because it's
easy peasy japanesey so what I'll do is
make a couple of use so you have a real
life example I'll make a header and i'll
make a footer and i'll make a mmm a
folder i'll dedicate this to the index
section and you can lay out views
however you really want make one for
about and another one for index in here
i'll say index page and here i'll say
about page in the footer i'll just do
footer save the footer
and in the header I'll just say doctype
HTML and I'm just gonna skip the head
for now okay and I'll go ahead and
refresh that actually wouldn't do
anything because we didn't assign the
views in the controller so in my index
I'll just say this view render and I
want to render three things and it
renders in the order you specify omen
and this will be index index and I guess
we'll do the same thing for this now
with this one we have arguments in it so
we're going to have a little fun with
that one shortly so let me first refresh
the index and here's the index page with
the footer we had nothing in the header
so it's just including those files you
could include a public folder if you
wanted to have like public and then your
CSS in here your javascript in here it's
up to you how you like to do things the
goal of this is to give the author a lot
of freedom so how about this what if we
want to assign variables to the view you
can do that you can just pass in an
array down here and I'll say anything
let me rename this just I'm just going
to call this art one in this r2 and it
might be easier just to predefine an
array called data so i'll say data
equals alright and an associative array
would be the most elegant solution in my
opinion i'll call it our one
okay so now let me put a header tag in
here and inside the index or the about
page I'm going to print our of this and
we can see what we have so I'll refresh
and let me go to the about page and
you'll see here we have r1 and r2 inside
the view so I could really just say this
r1 and the start to
our HUMINT okay so there we go and it's
super simple if you did decide to you
say the database class like in the
models if I were to have a new model for
a user so you would do it like this you
do it user underscore model it needs to
keep that underscore name convention
because if you have a controller called
user it would conflict with the user
model and I didn't want to enforce too
many namespaces in this thing so that's
the reason for that so say class user
model extends a dream MVC model and you
do a public function construct and
parent construct and in here you could
really do whatever you want but that's
how you do a model I'll just make
something that says do something
now just I go out the function name so
let's say I'm in the index here and I
want to load a model I can just say this
loan model of user model and i'll just
call it model equals this load model and
i'll do model do something and let's see
if it actually works okay user model
model looks like i don't include that
because it knows to suffix it with model
so load model of user just like that
refresh and it does do something so
obviously in your models is where you
load your database code if you want you
could also make use of the database
however you want to do that you don't
have to use my database it's just
whatever you please so here's my
database class and i already have some
stuff set up on how you could use it so
i'll just be like copying this and let's
just put it right at the top
and we got some little stars there let
me get rid of those guys
okay and I don't have a database chillin
but if I did this would work better so
there's my database guy and your way of
implementing this is however you're
going to do a database is up to you you
could create your own custom model and
extend that model what I mean is this
I'll just make one called custom let me
call it base model and this is just an
example class base model extends okay
and I'll say public function construct
parent and strut and inside of here I
could say this DB equals I can actually
take this out I could do it like so i
instantiate the DB inside of a base
model and you'd actually have to
manually include the base model actually
maybe not because the note the
autoloader is not loading the model
classes I haven't figured in a way how I
best like to do early and then if you
were to do it this way with your user
model you could just extend the base
model like that and then you would
always have this DB functions available
otherwise you could just do it with a
registry pattern which is already there
for you if you choose to use it um so if
i had my DB here i'm just going to make
a variable so i'll say DB equals 500
right just pretend that's a database
connection and i'll say dream registry
set DB DB and inside the user model i
could just say this DB equals dream
registry get beat and then i could be
like this DV I'll just echo it out so I
went a little faster i think call to
undefined method room registry set so
let me just double check my registry
class Oh like why ever fetch well it
looks like i called this the wrong thing
i got changed this to fetch in this to
set so there's a bug and i will have
that updated right before
I publish this video let me get rid of
base model sorry about that boom boom
and there's 500 so really it just gives
you a lot of freedom I don't think this
is anything super amazing but you know
it saves you time and messing with other
things helps you learn stuff I never
wanted to make an all-in-one solution I
like to tie little things together
sometimes but hopefully if any of you do
choose to use it have fun with it and
you know make your own versions of it
however you choose thanks watching
