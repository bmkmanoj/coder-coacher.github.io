and this is going to be a cinema 4d
video for absolute beginners but you
open it and it's like crap another 3d
program rest assured this is the easiest
program to use compared to blender 3d
studio max maya and in my opinion I'm
starting to fall in love with it we have
a relationship so my goal here is to
make this as easy as possible for you so
let's get started number one we have to
know how to move around okay that's the
first thing you want to know because you
hold down your mouse and it does nothing
you hold down your right mouse it does
nothing so what we want to do is the
numbers 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 they're right next to
each other hold down the number 1 and it
looks like it does nothing keep holding
it down and just drag your mouse and
this is how we pan you know okay so
number 1 to pan number 2 is to zoom in
and out or some call it dolly I don't
know the terminology I am NOT a
professional 3d artist I would never get
paid to do it because I'm not that good
and then number 3 is to rotate I'll add
that you can also use alt to rotate okay
so we had that and then it's like okay
we're in the perspective view we could
probably look at all these menus and
figure out like okay I want to look at
the view the camera yeah I want to look
at the left side the right side or the
parallel parallel well I haven't used
that one before go back to perspective
that scares me
f1 through f5 those hotkeys are your
best friends also so the night cool you
got 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so let's learn perspective
look at the top right that's where you
are f2 is top f3 is right f4 is front
and f5 is the lover of your life
don't you like that now in order to
toggle it's even easier if you're using
a mouse I hope so otherwise it's like
really hard to use in 3d just click your
middle mouse button hope your mouse has
that if it's one of them ones that are
touch
I don't know use f5 I know a lot of
laptops or keyboards and stuff sometimes
don't come with those or it's like a
function key you got to hold down to
actually do it incredibly annoying the
other option is way up here in the
corner that's almost impossible to see
there is this little tiny box click it
it brings you to all four views so if I
only wanted the top view I would click
this into focus go back here and click
this ok then they have other buttons
here this is the same thing this is it's
in black so it's impossible to see our
is to rotate this funny thing is to
scale now I always interchange scale and
transform I shouldn't and that really
had to do with the hotkey ok so I'm just
going to go over to the perspective view
because it makes us feel like we're in
3d we are and I don't want to jump
around the menu too much but we need
something to work with so I'm going to
break it down for you we're just going
to create a cube this guy here just
click them ok alright so he's selected
I'll just click nowhere to deselect all
of these tools here they're separated by
gaps this is for object arranging I
guess I'd say move scale scales kind of
manipulating rotate and then this mouse
which is the hotkeys 9 but I like to
press space ok then you got this menu
here it's like always changing and it
seems like duplicates this thing here is
a drop-down of your history if you hold
it down and you might be saying well mr.
dream how do I know
what is what like what can I drop down
just look really closely and squint your
eyes and there's a little tiny black
arrow okay anytime you see that you can
hold it down okay so let's get these
hotkeys down it's ERT right they put
everything in order it's beautiful
and we can only really take use or make
advantage get a benefit by having an
object selected so the move is selected
by default with the letter e now notice
down here in this panel on the right
these are attributes attributes okay and
these are attributes at the moment for
the Move tool because that's what we
just selected and I'm just going to
press the letter R notice it goes to
rotate T goes to scale I'm always
calling transform because they use the
letter T okay so ERT ERT I like mine on
e most of the time and now we'll go back
to here our viewport make sure this is
selected and make sure is pressed or you
can just press this and of course we
have our X's however you say that plural
E or plural I don't even speak English
correctly so if you don't need to know
anything always look in the bottom left
for what axis is what it's colorized X
being red Y being green Z being blue and
that is true for every view did I commit
a crime or just make a run so you just
drag this up and you see it's a decimal
point to the third decimal and sometimes
we don't like that
and right here wherever undo redo
buttons always use your hotkeys control
Z or control Y to redo so here's one
thing that's important you can hold
shift to snap two decimal places of 10
so I'm going to hold shift okay now
watch it's selected all those now it's
going to move in
all directions okay I don't want that I
just want them it's it's just not what I
want so first click and hold then hold
shift sorry I hit the button kind of
hard okay and if you look at the numbers
when you drag they're in increments of
10 and you can get it like perfect okay
so it's above the this grid at the
bottom in this grid is where a floor
would be placed by default and then the
scale tool or will go in order of this
menu not the hotkeys but it would be the
letter T this just scales it okay you
can even select the box not just the
anchor points problem is likewise is
scaling only this way you can even hold
shift well let me first click hold shift
and drag in it does the same thing okay
so shift is kind of your snap tool you
can't do that unless this object is
editable or if I click the cube itself
and this is selected let's go down to
the attributes panel on the bottom right
what we have are the properties besides
X Y Z and the segments and I'll talk
about those in a moment so the size in
this case let's just say 300 okay that's
a way to get it to size without making
it an editable object now when I get
into editable what I mean is you can
manipulate all the vertices and segments
and everything so if we look at this box
here we're going to add segments okay so
I'm going to add five segments okay to
each one of these just for the heck of
it and it looks like it did absolutely
nothing so we need to in this view go to
the display and right now it's not
shading but we need the lines to appear
see these segments with these segments
whatever number you have
it'll make it easier to edit once you
get into tools like this mm-hmm
and also the more segments vertices and
everything your project has the larger
to comes the longer takes surrender and
animations take long to render so let's
go to the rotate tool I'm just going to
press R and I'll hold or I'll click hold
shift and I'll just rotate it to 90
degrees all right so we know how to move
around and let's repeat that let's hold
three and drag three or alt three is to
rotate mm-hmm lost my voice a little bit
I apologize and just to repeat two is to
zoom or dolly you can do the same with
your mouse wheel one to pan master one
two and three master ERT because you're
going to use these all the time and then
this guy you can press the number nine
which is way over across the keyboard I
don't like that or space so if I had
rectangle selected and then I click let
him and press space it'll go to whatever
set in here so that's kind of nice hmm
it won't always jump back to live
selection and we'll just create another
cube so I can show you the selection
tool drag them out and here I'll do a
rectangle and this just lets you select
two and of course if I went to the Move
tool I can move them both at once okay
and we covered the rotate and then this
guy again is he's just a history of what
you've been using I will say that the
panel on your very top right this is one
of your buddies this is your objects
panels what objects are in your world so
you can click him click in because
sometimes you'll have things so close
together so I can't select this and you
can hold ctrl to select different items
if you use Windows
control click so you don't select you
know the whole list or if you wanted if
I had like a whole bunch of items you
can hold shift and you know do the same
thing select a different tool to do
whatever you want boy mm-hmm
sorry and I'll go over this in a moment
one moment please I need a drink of
water okay green tea is good enough we
look over here each panel we have
segments okay just look for the gap I
may repeat myself but when you're new
repeating yourself is wonderful because
you get it down you have gaps and these
all serve different purposes think of
this as is you know I already said an
object modifier mover coordinator this
is really for your quarter init system
if you don't know what coordinates are
think of it like the position of pixels
or the position of things so you can
lock the x-axis
this coordinate system if I have an
object selected and I change this to the
world view notice it changes okay it'll
change where you're moving your
coordinates and where they're located
according to the world rather than
relative to this object just leave it on
the object for now so you don't go crazy
next is a segment
or a group of render options very easy
this is a preview okay just a quick
preview this is a pop-out picture viewer
and it has a drop-down I'll just click
it pops out and it is at this you would
actually do a real rendering if you're
doing a picture mmm stereoscopic image
whoo so if I drop down and render to
picture view you know it brings up the
same window and notice it has a bunch of
these and look at a resolution of 800 by
600 that's terrible
down here you can add to a queue we're
not going to cover rendering so fret not
and this guy's your options here you can
select your output I looks like it has
no presets there or a there we go web
add some presets here a lot of them film
and video because you can make a lot of
animations 1280 1920 by 1200 I select
something big if you're going to render
an image it'll take longer but who cares
okay now that does not affect your three
workspace this affects your final output
okay so this is amount look it's a lot
bigger okay at 100% so that's one thing
to keep in mind um here's your objects
panel and you can hold down to click
because it has the black arrow and it
has a whole bunch and you can hover over
this dotted bar and pop it out you can
customize the UI and incredible amount
of ways but keep in mind if you do it's
not going to save it once you reboot it
you have to save it I'm not teaching how
to customize your UI right now I'm just
kind of showing you the features now
these you can just right click and go to
icon size large icons
oops and you can also right-click and go
to rows columns and I'll just select one
so we've got this big old list of them
you say well this sucks I can't see them
all and yeah that's true but with this
little little dotted bar I'm going to
drag it over not so it covers the
timeline at the bottom but let me move
it out to the left a little so it goes
here okay and this would be good if
you're like new and you just want to
quick grab shapes and you can always on
snap it by holding ctrl and then
dragging out like ah sorry I said that
wrong ctrl-click is to close it but you
don't have to control click to open it
right you have to right click and then
go to undock okay so you can you can
dock anything and add tabs and it's this
software simple and it does a lot so
here is a line tool or a freehand tool
yes there's text which will not render
by default so I can't see this okay I'm
going to press the letter O I still
can't see it but Oh we'll focus your
object right into your face so I'll just
hold the letter 3 the letter 3 I need a
better education right so that's hard to
hard to see what would I do in this
situation
well I press f5 so I have all views and
I'd probably select my move tool and a
little red guy here I'm just going to
move them over right and then I can go
back here now keep in mind middle mouse
click works also so here the only reason
I'm doing different variations is so
that you kind of are like oh you can do
it that way or this way so if I rendered
it it would not appear you'd have to add
in effect to it not an effect like a
modifier thingy this is for subdivision
surfaces smooth and stuff file extruding
this is an array an array you can think
of a list of items and programming
that's what it is
but the way I think of it is it would be
an instance like you could repeat a
square like a cube you could repeat it
say 30 times without making 30 actual
cubes wonderful
this is like an effects panel this one's
really cool so with regular objects you
can do a lot of stuff it'd be a lot of
going through each tool I will show you
how to use one how about - I'll just do
twist and I'll do Bend okay and let's go
over to our objects and we have twist
and Bend okay these two guys and what
cube is this him I'll select him so ctrl
click click but I want to I don't want
him to be selected so I'll just control
click him too
and you want to drag these and it'll
show a down arrow and he goes under them
okay so the first thing to do is it's
like this is totally out of place so
just say scroll down or let me pan the
camera down to this attributes and the
objects I will fit to parent and then go
to twist and I'll fit to parent now
nothing's going to happen yet until we
modify it so the twist is simply an
angle once we look at the object here
the angle you can hover over this tiny
little arrow and just drag it up okay
a little too far I'll say just like 70
or something pretty close you can also
just type in the number 70 click away or
hit enter next we'll go to the bend tool
okay let me hold the number three and
just rotate so you can see a little
better and the bend tool has a few more
options so if I change the angle to like
let's say 50 degrees and then the
strength this is really going to be
better to drag right so we can bend
something this won't render the best
because it probably doesn't have many
um-hmm or these called edges many edges
the more edges you have the smoother you
can get something so like if I did this
this I can add segments if I can were to
click the cube or select it in the view
the object I can press five five five
and let me undo that this one I had one
one okay now look closely I'm going to
change this to 5 okay and then hit tab
see how it smooths out I change it to 15
let's change all these to 15 just to be
nuts
okay you're always going to get smoother
looks with more of that but also a
higher price and rendering whoops
so I'll click my little render buddy and
it's smoother than it would would be
without it
alright and then we looked at this so
let's go to this guy this is the floor
again it has a drop down for sky
environment whole bunch of things I'm
just going to add a floor and that goes
to the bottom now if I render this
you're not going to see anything okay
don't worry about that we will get to
that okay and if you wanted to rename
stuff you know you can double click here
I'll call it ground
all right so we covered all of these you
do have the option of right-clicking up
here going to show text and that takes
up a lot of real estate up there you
also have the option of show text below
to save real estate and then you could
drag it over there and then you have a
little more flexibility that'd be good
if you need practice to remember what's
what so let me go to show and I'm just
going to turn off the text because after
you you use this for 15 minutes it kind
of you don't really need to mess with it
okay so we messed with the top bar okay
we've messed with the viewports okay and
it's important that you know we can
change all these viewports with the
display if you like shading okay a
couple of them are different this won't
show the ground because it's facing that
way and then this one shouldn't either
okay so I'll just hold one to move it
and remember if I wanted to get to this
guy and look at them real close or if I
let's say I'm over here I'll press o now
I don't see the lines here let me check
my display I have line selected so let
me try a different one well I haven't
run into that before but I'm not going
to fret at the moment I will fret later
for a very long time what we're going to
do now is check out the what do you call
it
since we're messing with shapes and
stuff let's check out the panel here
okay so this will make your life easier
to begin show text I don't like to put
it under the text because it takes up
too much vertical real estate and these
tools you'll be able to customize like
objects really nicely so we'll start out
with a few so I'm going to click this
square with just a
couple of edges and press Oh so it's in
view and we can't modify the points
unless it's editable so let's let me
change this to that guy let me control D
make sure I deselect everything and he
wants oh it's already selected so just
make sure you select it I just did in
the objects list and we have to make
editable there's a big fat button here
you can press the letter C you can
right-click it if I could actually let
me do I always have that one open wonder
why that's saying ground so I get the
only thing I can focus on all right
whatever click cube and then make
editable okay and now we have all these
highlighted things so what I'll do is
cover a few important things one is this
button here you have two modes one is
the model mode which is to manipulate
all this stuff and then one is the
object mode an object mode is so you can
select full objects this will probably
trick you up at some point you're going
to why can't I select anything because
when you have a deter Ballabh jecht and
you're in model mode you try to select
this well I can't show the example but
trust me remember this okay anytime you
need to switch back to object mode so
then we have a texture thing a workplane
thing I don't care about talking about
these guys are where you're going to you
could make full custom things with these
so let's just check them out first I'll
click points and you all know what
points are or vertices okay they're
these little dots if I hold shift I can
select multiples now in this case it'd
be better
to select the face or the polygon so let
me select how about the top left one
I'll zoom out with my mouse wheel and
you know you can drag it out okay this
is very basic stuff drag let's drag him
up alright so you can play with that hey
I don't like how this looks
it looks like quick shading lines
Constitution the ground is uh throwing
me off we'll fix that in a moment
so if we go to edges this selects these
lines here like this okay so you know
I'll choose the rotate tool just for
giggles like that okay and you just
click in an empty area to deselect and
the polygon tool which is really cool
you can select faces of it so you can
also let's scale a hold shift okay well
let me do these two and from here I want
to do the z-axis so I see it here but I
see it here too so I'll click hold shift
and see you could make these smaller I
guess or I mean you could do a lot of
things really I'll just move it for now
trying to keep it pretty simple or it's
the green guy areas this view looks like
it makes no sense to me but I'll just
whoops all right I'll just toss them out
so that's kind of a basic for that if we
jump down I'm going to skip this enable
snap they have a lot of snap options but
I'll just enable the default snap so if
I select points and just click him up
here I'll go back down to the right view
and just drag
what the heck he's supposed to snap how
dare he all right let me try edges there
okay you see it says cube vertex snap I
believe this is relative to the object
and they had something to think about
I'd have to dig into it more I am NOT a
master at this okay so we covered like
kind of the messing around here after a
little bit always look for a little
black arrow drop down and then um what
we need to do is a cover the textures
pretty easy you can double click which I
prefer you can go to create new material
I'll just double click OK you can
double-click the name now let's call it
one two three and you can actually
adjust all the settings on the right in
your attributes bar but I'd recommend
just double clicking the little picture
so I'm just going to change the color to
like a little darker oh by the way if
yours is not how you want it you can
change the way it is like hue/saturation
and all that value I think for vibrance
I prefer RGB myself and then there's all
these things that you can select like
let's just say reflection and then we
have all this stuff here and you know
like I'll drag the brightness down okay
so that we can see our red and it's a
little reflective you know you can
change all this stuff and there is no ok
button and a lot of these there's no ok
button and if you look at your editor
you'll see all the color change to apply
this we want to apply this to the ground
one thing I'm just weird but if we go
back to our objects I want my ground at
the very bottom I can't say it's going
to matter a whole lot but it just makes
sense to me so zooming out
we can take our texture and drag it to
the ground and it appears right there to
get rid of it you could just click this
and press delete or you can go to any
viewport and drag it on an object okay
and well that's a little easier to see
it's a bright pink their display shade
contrast shading lines that one's going
to drive me nuts
and then texts you know you just press
the Delete key delete or am I
maybe it's thinks I'm trying to edit it
oh let me show you if we're in edit mode
or in model mode see object okay now let
me select text delete I couldn't delete
my text because I was in model mode see
that that can trick you up you could
even make a drop out like this gosh that
looks crazy dragged down a little bit
you'd be able to customize this I mean
you can add these like to your top bar
too or you can you could even make these
like say object and model and then have
a spacer there's a lot of options for
you so that's how we create a texture we
can control hold ctrl and drag to
duplicate you can control C control V
that's if we wanted similar textures and
you can always edit it do whatever you
want so that saves time this bar here
don't worry about right now and the play
button and everything this is not the
main editor for animation don't worry
it's a lot cooler so we've covered this
Left bar I'm going to go ahead and
change the let's turn off the text here
okay
and that means lips I could shrink this
down a little bit have a little more
real estate making sure everything is
okay and I've covered enough for just
the beginner stuff I think that's good
notice anytime you see lines like this
okay like these dots you can drag it and
you can move it yeah might mess up your
layout see I can move this over here you
can create your own panels which would
be kind of a video in itself doing that
made this panel get all big so if I were
to close this don't save and reopen it
or almost done seems like she wants to
take a moment look fullscreen okay so
just briefly see it resets all our
panels because we never saved them and
our layout always begins with startup
the once we were to change that all
right I hope this has helped you begin
to get the gist of cinema 4d thank you
