while since we've done illustrator so
let's make a strawberry and get some
practice and I'm going to start off with
a circle so from the shapes menu I can
hold the button down pop out the menu
like so and that's how I have it up here
and here's my circle I'm just going to
hold shift and drag cool and with my
white arrow I'm just going to click an
empty space so nothing selected and I'm
going to drag a box around this guy I'm
going to hold shift and press down and
that just moves the end down a little
more I'm going to do the same thing at
the top because the strawberries a
little fatter on the top I'm not going
to try to make this perfect or anything
and look exactly like a strawberry but
it'll be it'll be close you'll be able
to tell it's a strawberry it also have
has leaves on the top there's many ways
to go about that maybe we'll just
pentool it up okay so I'll just click a
point here and then below I'm going to
hold it down and say let go and I'm
going to click the point again okay so
that rid of a anchor line I'm going to
hold shift and click there oops it
didn't look like I clicked it there okay
so I can unclick that unclick and now we
have half a leaf so what we're going to
do is mirror this guy over see the
little rotate tool you can hold this
down and go to the reflect and where
this little out this little blue looking
thing is just click him on the edge
there so it's chillin there and then
hold the Alt key and then hold shift and
it'll snap cool and now we have the
start of a leaf now what I'm going to do
is select both of these with the black
arrow and press ctrl G to group or you
could right-click and do group okay
so now if I move this it's going to move
both of them they're separate objects
but they're just in a group if I wanted
to edit one of them I would double click
it to go into the group and you can see
the top it says hey we're in a group and
then if I want to move it I put what I
don't so let me make sure I go all the
way back so our strawberry will be
chilling here I'm going to alt drag here
and flip him here just kind of move them
around this is just to get an idea of
the placement of this stuff so I'm also
going to reflect this group here with
this leaf so with that same reflect tool
and I'm going to put it at the bottom
right here of this leaf psyllids even
like that
and then I think it's going to need a
shadow kind of where the leaves indent
into the strawberry so with this circle
I'm going to find that point right there
see right here and I'm just going to fry
like that okay and I need to send this
to the back arrange send to back that's
a little bit too far if you get stuck
you could always select this guy and
send him to the back as well okay and
the strawberry has a funny little dots
on it it looked like I don't know
circles almost kind of like that I don't
think I'm going to go too crazy with
them but will do them because that's
what strawberries have so we have the
basic structure of the strawberry I
think I'm going to also make a circle
right here because strawberries
sometimes dip in right there and what
this is these circles here are going to
be shading okay so let's get busy
we know how it wants to look so let's
double click the leaf and I'm going to
first of all get rid of the strokes
okay so I got a green leaf here to make
it a little funnier let's do a gradient
so I'll select the gradient tool drag
one here and I'll drag a darker green
here and I'll just drag from the top to
the bottom and with this guy by the way
I select you can slide the black arrow
and click and I'm going to press I and
click him now we're going to change the
gradient around just in the opposite
direction and it looks kind of
interesting I think it was kind of corny
I think I'll do it about half way how
about there it doesn't look terrible and
I want to make sure these guys are lined
up so I'm going to zoom in and get this
little point here and touch just let
them kiss it looks like there's a little
gap between them in that weird but it's
there there isn't I don't understand
okay
okay so that leaf to make the least a
little prettier what we could do is bust
out our pen tool and this isn't really
realistic if I make it glossy so maybe
I'll add some shading so I'll just make
a point there and I'm going to hold the
mouse down and drag up
click and I'm going to drag a line to
the edge here and to there okay and what
we're going to do is do a transparency
option I'm not sure what's going to look
the best something really soft
color that looks really bad if I make it
white I just did a white the whole
thing's white now so the transparency of
soft light okay that won't look too bad
but it does look bad so I'm just going
to warp it effect warp arc preview and
we can get some crazy shape out of this
okay
and I could just throw them down there I
guess make them a little bigger there we
go so pretty much I just made a line
across here and what I want to do is
expand the object go to object expand
appearance so that's the actual size of
it this goes outside of the box though
so if you're exporting this with a
transparent background or looking back a
way around that is we could select both
of these I'll hit ctrl C ctrl F now
there's a copy of that in front of it if
I use shift in the arrow keys and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to join
these together boom expand another one
object okay then with that selected I'm
going to hold shift and select this guy
with the pathfinder what one is it
intersect no nope subtract
it's the opposite of that one
so I want to - the front so I guess the
one in front I'm not sure which ones in
front I think he is saw that looking to
front that did not work when you never
know what to do you can always divide it
I'll just divide it this guy right here
now I'll get my white arrow tool delete
delete and delete okay now I have this
perfect little shape and we can throw on
some transparency and maybe some kind of
soft light it's not the coolest looking
thing but we tried so back to the main
we can go ahead and use the black arrow
and drop these leaves and I'm going to
alt drag this guy over and I'm going to
shift drag them like that kind of line
them up there zoom in and line up these
anchor points
there she goes I think we're gonna make
this back leaf a little bit bigger just
because we're crazy like that maybe tilt
it to the side a little bit this
strawberry might just have two leaves
and again I want to line these up just
because I'm weird with that okay now for
the strawberry let's make this guy the
red color he is I think that we're just
going to use this straight up a room
look in color it doesn't really
complement this greeny earth tone so
what I'm going to do is maybe freshen it
up a little that looks more orangish
whoops not crap this looks like an apple
oh well so then these guys are going to
turn into shades so what I'm going to
flip these around get rid of this stroke
and we can throw on a soft light okay
and we're going to make this whole
strawberry grade in now here's one thing
to notice when you're drawing something
you see how these leaves have no stroke
yet this strawberry itself has a stroke
it does not work well together so you
should either go stroke elasaur stroke
in my opinion unless you are outlining
the whole thing in this case I'm not
going to use a stroke and we're going to
bust out a gradient
so I'll go degree and got that guy here
and boy I think I'll go with black okay
so I'm going to ctrl alt and use the
mouse wheel to scroll out and with the
little gradient tool here see if we
can't drag them down I think we need a
radial gradient let's go to radial and I
want most of the light to be right in
the middle the black is kind of dark so
she's tough to deal with I think that's
good that's a pretty big looking
gradient okay and obviously these shades
are a little bit too aggressive so I
could lighten up on the transparency
this actually really does look like an
apple so the little seeds in there
they're like this kind of yellowish
color if they're healthy I don't know so
that is ugly yo Todd and we want to make
this look like it's indented so this I
just don't like the shape of it I think
I'm going to zoom in and just use the
white arrow tool and shape it just a
little bit so it's like the Apple I hurt
to a strawberry just a little bit okay
that just feels more right and I mean
you could go out of your way and tilt
these a little bit if you are really
picky but it's just a strawberry picture
so they have like quite a hundred of
these on it so what I'll do is object
what is the command edit object
transform
range
move
let's see horizontal 20 PT 0 I'll say 10
so I'm going to space it out like this
I'll hit copy whoops
copy and now that I did that I'll just
press control D a couple of times and
that's not too bad okay
is that a good space I think so so I
just select all these guys I'm just
going to ctrl to to lock this strawberry
layer select those and alt drag them
looks like the way God made strawberries
was kind of crazy looking so
we're basically going to repeat this
pattern over the whole strawberry I know
there's a better way to do this do you
know what it is okay
okay and it looks like we could be
missing a few pieces just throwing on a
bunch of little dots maybe one more
we're here I mean this doesn't have to
be perfect because if you are actually
going to use a strawberry it'd be
probably down a little so what I'll do
is I'm going to lock these leaves and
this thing here and that background so
I'll press control two so now if I
select everything looks what I do there
I select everything I'm only selecting
these little strawberries the little
seeds and let's see what happens if we
do a soft light boom and that's a
funny-looking thing maybe just some
transparency
it looks like strawberry but it looks a
little sick it does not look healthy
so
I'm going to create a layer mask I guess
I'll press ctrl alt to get this guy here
copy ctrl F now we have a guy chilling
here and I want to grab that I'm going
to relock this layer and select all
these guys looks like I have that circle
I don't want them just circle I don't
want and drag them over here so I'll
group those guys together so now they're
all in a group and I'll select this and
make clipping mask that is totally wrong
I need to send this guy to the front
make clipping mask there we go and now
they'll all be inside of there
and we want to make sure we line these
up right to there and this guy needs to
move a couple layers down so I'll press
ctrl in the right bracket that is ctrl +
that
I don't know what is on a Macintosh
computer I'm not sophisticated enough I
can't afford one anyways
perhaps we could this shade looks
terrible it just looks wrong hey we
could make it a little shadow okay
so here I'll send this to the back boom
whoops so this guy's going to be we
could even make it look like his hover
not gonna get there so the dots do not
look correct because they should be
getting darker along the edges so what
I'm going to do is actually do my own
little shape I'll just start randomly up
here
to pen tool and although
like that
and I'll just try to get the curve here
close enough
feeling a little lazy okay so we got
that and I think I want it a little bit
on this side too
boom
and
boom I'm getting really lazy I'll just
make the shape like that okay so what
we'll do is we'll Pathfinder join those
up expand it if you have to and again
we're going to control all two to unlock
and I'll select this guy here I'll
select this guy and I'm going to alt
drag oops
alt drag those two over and I want to
create a layer mask let's see what we
can create with these two sorry clipping
mask and that looks right okay so I can
delete that right there I can drag this
over here and move them over it goes
over and I'm going to move him a couple
layers back with the control bracket
that little guy here and then let's
throw on some transparency
okay
and if i zoom out now you can see some
of the dots are a little more faded you
could do that a couple more times to
make it look more faded now if I shrink
the little guy down I look a lot more
quality well I'm not very pleased with
the dots but it's pretty decent hope you
had fun watching this it was fun talking
about it
keep practicing there'll be a million
times better than me and a couple days
