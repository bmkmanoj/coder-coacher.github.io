simple Factory and this is not
considered a pattern but it does have
some sisters the factoring method
pattern and the abstract factory pattern
but by learning this will have a little
head start because it's very easy and a
factory what that is is like creating
things
that's what factories do so a simple
Factory has to do with creating objects
and for this example I'll provide a car
store and in the car store we're going
to be able to buy a car and when we buy
a car it's going to create the car
object now these objects obviously are
very plain and don't do anything to keep
the example simple so if I went to my
car store I create a new car store okay
and I buy a car you might have something
like a switch statement and let's go
back to index you see how I'm doing by
car jeep by car dodge in a switch
statement it's switching the brand and
then it's instantiating the type of
object that it is a good principle and
opie is we want to encapsulate what
varies and what that means is that this
stuff right here is probably going to
change and we want to encapsulate this
which means just to put it in its own
object and I've already done that so
I'll go ahead and delete that and I put
this in the car factory here
so now car factory is basically all is
concerned about is creating objects and
the reason for this is because in the
car store if what we want to do is close
objects for modification but leave them
open for extension so then this car
store for the most part could be left
alone if we just load up the car factory
in here and if someone wanted to add new
cars they would add them in this car
factory folder here and they would open
the car factory
and just add a little thing into the
switch rather than always having to go
down to a low-level object and mess
around and it could be potentially
hazardous so we create an object here
let me save these and uncomment this and
let's just see how this runs oh let me
show you that like the cars what I did
was I just did a construct so it tells
us the class we created in this case it
would be Dodge so I'll go ahead and
refresh and it's you've created a jeep
you've created a Dodge
so we're basically delegating the
responsibility over to car factory on
how these are created and it's a smart
way to do all that stuff I just can't
even remember if I said this but
basically what we did was we
encapsulated what very meaning the car
factory changes so we put that in its
own object I think I did bring that up
alright and that that's basically it you
