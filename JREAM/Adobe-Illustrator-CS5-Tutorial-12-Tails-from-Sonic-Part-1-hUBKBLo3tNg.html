going to try to quickly draw tales from
Sonic and Tails and I'm going to start
out with a well rounded rectangle for
his nose okay and his nose is kind of
like a triangle so I'm just gonna move
whoops
try to move these together and I guess
I'll remove these anchor points okay so
this will be his nose and then he has
like a white little face piece and I
guess it's kind of like goes down then
it comes back up and he's got some
little hair pieces here whoops I don't
wanna and then it looks like his mouth
kind of goes down like this
so I'll close that shape and I'm going
to flip it around with the mirror tool
okay
send it to the back group okay now his
nose is black so there we have that I'll
shrink this down now I got some space to
work in his eyes are pretty big and
round I'll use the rounded rectangle I
think because they're funny shape and
these go down kind of like that
yeah that'll be good enough send these
to the back boom and he's got little
round eyes I'm gonna use this again
actually because his eyes are pretty
funny let me send that behind the little
nose piece and I guess I'll copy paste
on front and this will be a white piece
back here it'll be a green piece
it's got like some bright little eyes
and I'll copy and paste this once more
and this piece will be black and pop it
behind there okay
and I'm gonna group this and flip it
around okay and then his head let's see
his head is a little bit different shape
it looks like it's it's kind of round
but not a whole lot so I'll just make a
circle there and see if I can stretch
these how I like them his head kind of
goes out on the edges cool and his his
color is orange it's like a kind of a
light orange or yellow color and then
he's got some really big ears so make
those big
and just send those behind his head
I think his ear still could be bigger
but we'll keep going and then some white
inner pieces okay and what else does he
have he's got some bangs so I'll just
make him red for right now looks like
his bangs kind of fall over his head and
then he's got a kind of a another spike
okay he has three spikes it's been a
long time since I've drawn them it's a
lot harder to draw on the computer I
think then he's got a little smiley I'll
make that black and flip it around this
should be about one and okay so these
are like more like a oranges color
well they should match his head all
right let me get to the gradients now
I'm gonna remove the stroke on this eye
piece okay now to the gradients let's do
the orangish color and I'll do it again
but make it darker yeah that's a little
too dark I think more yellow okay and
Azir will do the same thing we're going
to do linear for this one I guess I'll
pop it
yeah I like it behind it better and I'll
just group these together well let me
make a shade real quick it looks like he
has a little bit of shading on the
inside of his ear now I'm not using
masks because this way it's just really
quick and easy to do and before I have
some shading at the top of the zere here
you can perfect your lines if you'd like
oops I messed that one up
well who cares and then I'd group these
together and flip it around his head
still looks a little bit fat
so one try shrinking these a little bit
more okay and there's a little beard
thingy I'm going to make the border to
this the color that's not as intense
I guess gray and make his mouth a little
happier and it looks like he has some
lines above his eyes so make those black
I'll delete this side and then redo it
and his nose is usually a little shinier
and I guess just to make it a little
different than our last tutorial I'm
gonna grab all this put it up here
flatten it expand it and make the line
the kind of the same color as this and
I'll move it down here again send it to
the back and add a stroke there we go
that's pretty good for a little tails
