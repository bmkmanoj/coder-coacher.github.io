through expression engine briefly and
this is a content management system
based off of code igniter and it's by
Ellis Labs I picked up a copy and I put
it on my hard drive and I already
installed it and what we have is just a
login area and I want to cover a couple
terms that are really confusing because
it's a little bit different I will say
that this is a pretty sweet system if
you want to build something big and if
you publish a lot of content or have
multiple users publishing content so to
start out I'm going to hide this sidebar
here what we have you probably would
want to first create some content I'm
going to click this link and this is my
site right now it just is nothing you
might go to content publish and it says
there are no channels so what we're
going to do is make a channel okay
and what a channel is is it is a it
holds content kind of like a little
container so I might have a channel for
a blog
and I don't need to do anything in here
I'll submit and I might have one for
like let's just say in my main site
submit okay and what I'm allowed to do
is create content for a blog and site
now and you'll see I can only insert a
title here so what you can do in
expression engine is customize your
fields here and do quite a bit of things
so first we're going to go create a
template and to do so I would go to
design template template manager and I
want to create a new group okay and I
want my group to apply to certain areas
of the site so my site would have a
certain template and this right here
says make index template your site's
homepage we want that because this will
be our main site okay
and I'm also going to create one more
called blog
and submit and they always come with an
index file and you can't delete those
ones see the little red star there that
means this is going to be our main page
so I might go into index and just for
fun I'll add h1 okay and I will update
and finish so if I go here and refresh
you can see this is my main page what I
want to do is change some global
template preferences you can have a four
or four URL which would be good
I like strict URLs on well I guess we
don't need to update much of that I
might have been looking for something
else so what we have to do our create
fields again going back to publish and I
want to publish something for my site I
have to create fields for it to do so
I'd go to admin channels and I would
select well I guess I got to go to admin
channel fields I thought I could get
there from here and I'm going to create
fields and I want to call this site
because these are going to be fields for
my site so I'm going to copy and paste
this
so you can see what I'm doing okay so if
I go to site what I'm doing is creating
fields for this publish area down here
so I might go over here create one more
group and call it blog submit and I want
to create little fields inside each
category so for the site I want to
create a new channel field let's say a
file so that we could upload files let's
call that file not required not
searchable and you could prevent certain
things submit okay so we have a file
field I'm going to create another one
called
body and this will be the main content
of our page going to require and make it
searchable because in the future you
might want it to be and down in the
field options we can make the text area
pie a lot bigger and show formatting
buttons
I'll choose a couple of these file
choosers pretty cool because you can
select images that are already on your
server so I save those and I'm just
going to skip the blog for now and go to
admin channel administration and
channels okay and here's our site if I
go over here and refresh my site
nothing's changed because I have to
assign those group fields to this
channel fields so I would assign the
channel field group of site okay so you
remember we made a file and a text area
it's all safe and now refresh and over
here I have my title I can add a file
now my screens not really very big
because I have this thing stretch but
you can upload files in there and here's
our body and down here we can use our
little file manager to select files on
the server so I can go ahead and submit
that and go back to CP home and let's
open the web site over here and nothing
here is showing up the reason is we need
to customize the site template
and to do so I'll go to design templates
and template manager and here's my index
page what I would want to do is use some
expression engine code to let's say
create a list of pages there's there's a
learning curve and I'm not very good at
it yet because I just purchased this but
what you have are called tags and they
have three parameters so X for
expression engine channel and I want the
entry sports entries and the channel I
want to use is going to be site okay and
I will end it
okay and I'll just put that there so
I'll update that and go here and refresh
and we have the work text so what I want
to do is get the content out of that
channel to do so we use variables and if
we go to the edit area you can see the
title of this is text so I can do title
now I'm going to change the actual title
of this page how about I'll create a new
one let me just do that publish to the
site and I'll say life is long and
testing this okay and I'll just publish
that and I'll go ahead and update this
so I should be able to get life is long
and text I could do a line break
actually what else we can do are add a
little a couple of things in there
there's a lot of options say order by
date limit equals one so if I limited
one we'd only see one so life is long I
don't want to do that now this would
more fall into the category of a blog
with a list of entries we could
pop in the body update refresh and
here's the body I could make this
actually look a little better h2h - and
here's the body and I'll do a HR and it
looks a little bit like smarty template
engine doesn't it if you've used that so
here's a list and that would actually be
more appropriate for our news page but
it's it's a good little start so
basically in your templates whoops
you can separate designs by far one of
the interesting things is you can
actually save these templates to files
and work on the files and upload them to
your server let me go back to edit
preferences that's not what I'm looking
at here it is global template
preferences you can put select a folder
on your server or hard drive and allow
templates to be saved so let me open up
my Windows Explorer one moment and head
over to expression engine so I'm over
here and I'm just doing this on my hard
drive if I created a new folder called
templates
okay I'll go in here copy and paste it
in there update and now my templates
will be saved to files and sync up with
the database now i refresh there's
nothing in there so what I have to do is
like let's say I edit the index file I
have to check this off save template
it's a file let me go back and also do
it for the blog save template as a file
and in my templates folder you see
something called default site what's
cool about this is there's also
something for managing multiple sites so
you could have templates for a bunch of
sites and manage it all from expression
engine in here you see we have site
group it saves the template oops I want
to edit that let me go back edit with
notepad plus plus
we drag this over and basically we could
edit in here and say dogface and over
here refresh and it updates pretty sweet
so they give you that option so that's a
quick start on using expression engine
you got to get used to the names of
these pretty much think of a channel as
a container that holds categorized data
found like if I'm watching the news it's
about the news and I'm watching sports
it's about the sports but it's for your
content templates are just the design
and with a template you put in variables
and tags to make it do a lot of custom
things now I haven't covered statuses I
don't think I want to because I'm I'm
really not that good at this but I
wanted to do a short video because I was
pretty excited about trying this out and
thanks for watching and I hope this
helped you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
