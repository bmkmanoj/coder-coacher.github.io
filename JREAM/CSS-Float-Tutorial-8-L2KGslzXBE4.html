tutorial we're going to go over the
float and in the last tutorial we
learned about the box model and that
kind of falls under this category so if
you still have your box here just leave
it how it is and we're going to create a
new div to wrap it in so div ID equals
wrap and then end the div okay i'm going
to tab this over so that you can tell
it's a different divider sorry that you
can tell that it's nested okay and i'm
going to rename this to write and i'm
going to make another one and call it
left and then in your CSS file let's
call this right and let's call the other
one left and then let's make a rap div
and further rapper we just want a
certain width I'll say 600 pixels okay
let's give the wrap a border so we know
what we're working with a border is one
pixel solid green okay so we've got to
give boxes and one thing to notice is
that when you float a box level element
and again a box element um it's just let
me one thing to know is that when you're
going to flow a box level element you
need to give it a width otherwise it'll
just take up the whole row or possibly
overlap and look really ugly so let's
take the left one and let's do float
left and just for fun let's see what
this does and there it is
the box appears to just kind of be
chilling here but the width the two of
these combined is too wide so let's just
make this with let's say a hundred and
this one will be 300 still and now it's
floating side by side now you'll notice
the container for the wrapper
everything's kind of flooding out of it
and usually you don't want that so what
we're going to do is let me let's give
this a background and if this had a
background and we wanted the background
of stretch as far as the content goes we
use something called overflow inside a
wrap so go overflow auto and that will
tell this box oh shoot that actually
stretch because there's a height on the
box let's not give the left box of
height and there we go it overflows now
how about this right box you can see
it's kind of under there and most of the
time you don't want that so how about
we'll give that a margin left of 100
pixels and I'm doing 100 pixels because
the left one is 100 pixels wide and look
at that we have it side-by-side let's
create a a right third column how about
so let's call this one div ID equals
Center and just I suppose pop some text
in there I usually need to see what it
looks like before I can tell what's
going on so I'm just going to give this
a border 1px solid orange and we have
this a little divider there so I think
my best option
will be to float this container to the
right so basically this center one is
gonna just be standing there and it's
going to kind of i'll try to just
demonstrate um so I'm going to do center
leave that as it is and for the right
I'm going to do float right and make
sure that this has a width I'm going to
make the width 100 pixels now and get
rid of the height ok so that's floating
on the right we'll get this covered how
it's over in the wrong area right there
so what we want to do is give the center
column a width and let's say wit he goes
250 pixels and margin left is 100 pixels
ok looks like and be a little wider how
about another 100 so 200 whoops that was
the margin with this 350 there we go
that's good enough and how about this
right here now when you're floating to
the right you have to put the item
before I the item it's going to float
past so we'll take this down here and
we'll put it before the Center div and
there we go it's right up there and now
you have a nice little layout and a
general idea on how to flow items good
luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
