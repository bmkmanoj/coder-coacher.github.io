that I'll probably ever have
I'll tell some funny stories and
memories because they're pretty I think
they're pretty hilarious I won't be able
to mention every story but uh this is
only one place I'll mention but I'm not
going to name any one's real names or
the company name if you know me you know
what I'm talking about but regardless it
might be kind of funny so one guy was
probably the funniest guy I've ever
worked with
his name was shot for short he had this
crazy laugh and every time he would
laugh I just couldn't help but I would
burst out laughing but that guy was a
prankster all he did was prank and for
example he would do stuff like alright I
don't know how all the Mac's work and
everything but a couple people there
used Apple computers but they had though
the wireless mouse that always had a
problem syncing with the Mac but he
would take a mouse and switch it was the
one else's computer so then this would
be like my mouse isn't working but it
would be moving on the other person's
screen and then other times he would
just take up the pepper so it was so
funny
he just dude little things like that and
I joined along with them I started a
thing about pretty much the head honcho
not the boss but I like the main
developer behind it all and his name was
Matt and I basically
I try to get a feel for a person you
know like kind of joke with this person
you know what's there what's there bye
and I think I nailed it you know you
don't want to put with this person you
don't want to put them down but you want
to joke in a way that they're not like
offended like they think it's funny but
he's more of a guy that laughs on the
inside I think rather than outwardly but
when I met him you know I was kind of
figuring out what he's like so then I
figured it out I bought him a mug with a
picture of his face and it said baller
status on it because you know he's like
a baller you know that's not that funny
but we busted that guy's balls so much
about just made-up stuff hi oh man you
make so much money oh you're gonna be
driving a Ferrari the way we put it was
a lot funnier I can't remember at all
cuz this was years ago but like I hate
toilet paper from the top of the ceiling
or someone's computer one time I was in
the bathroom and there's this Polish
polish guy that worked there and he's
very serious I like the guy but into a
lot of the conspiracy stuff and the
bathroom had this gap in the door when
you closed it cuz I was sitting on the
toilet one of those times and these
bathrooms were not pretty
this was before they upgraded their
office and you know walking by he's like
peeking in the door I'm just like what
the heck is he doing and then I see his
hands go up above the seat
he's jumping peeking in okay and I'm
just like this is really uncomfortable
and to top it off when he leaves he
turns up to the lights well this is what
you get when you work with a bunch of
guys so there was this other guy
his name was Nikhil and we didn't know
at the time he might have a health issue
so it was funny at the time because we
didn't really think of that but he fell
asleep a lot and we just thought he was
always tired all the time so one time
after lunch I think Dan was there at
that time to cook we closed all the
curtains slowly so it was dim in there
and he weren't been an office like on a
diagonal that was in another room and we
made sure to close his curtains too and
we slowly kind of we slowly raised the
volume of this lullaby music and she
fell asleep and there was a continual
thing after I mean poor guy fell asleep
a lot and one time he was on a smoke
break this fellow and me and shot we
flipped his desk upside he was so mad he
was like a really serious guy and that's
why it was so funny so he came in and he
was like if you don't flip my desk back
over I'm leaving right now
and the funny part is he didn't even
have a car because he was from another
country we're thinking oh good boy and
so we flip this desk over you know we're
not that big a jerk so it was just to
try to be funny we didn't think you get
that mad as they okay man
so you know I kind of started the whole
Matt joke thing and that kind of stirred
up and boy I made the right choice there
because Dan came along I don't know two
years ago something like that
and he quickly caught on to the game and
he started a website he he's a dedicated
guy he starts a website it was called
like mat facts dot-com or something
now it's down now because you know we
don't want to be jerks it was just like
a temporary thing to be funny and we
made up the most ridiculous facts about
Matt for example if I can remember one
something about why his face there is
only like a million dollar bill but it
has Matt's face on just really stupid
stuff and Dan had a whiteboard and every
day every day he'd come in he would
write down a new fact about Matt and it
was just totally made up yeah that was
hilarious you just walked by and read
the whiteboard is like what's a wild
Matt would wander and I wonder what's on
the whiteboard cuz he was you know a
very serious guy and then he Dan had a
putting green in his office is he it was
just a little putting green something to
do I don't know how much it used it
though I remember I fell asleep under my
desk twice and I think I was caught both
times
now I didn't fall asleep just to fall
asleep I was really tired but there was
the the second time I fell asleep the
CEO actually walked and he said Jesse
everyone's gone he's I was I oh crap
and he's like yeah I heard you snoring
so yes I went under my desk and fell
asleep twice no I didn't get fired from
that they're a laid-back company and you
know it should it's just human nature
there are a lot of hilarious times so we
had you know the conspiracy theorists
polish guy who would
about Obama a lot and he he was so funny
because he was so serious and I like
that guy just as a person he is really
he's interesting you know I think I
liked everyone I work with really
there's some people you get a vibe for
you know like okay don't joke with this
person but at that company that was I
don't think ever the case I mean I could
say whatever I wanted and not get in
trouble like my jokes were ridiculous I
made
I told stories about how people are
stealing my pajamas they're stealing my
avocados and I saw my neighborhood I
just came up with the most ridiculous
stuff for a while I had people believing
that I collected trench hooks I said
yeah I have a couple of tranches at home
and I breed them for a while some people
believe me I think the first time I met
Dan I did this on purpose but I was
pretending to work on something and I
had my butt crack except the first thing
he saw and even met me who is my but
cannot face the boss boy what a
character
he's like a grown-up kid and he bought
three or four video cards to mine
bitcoins or feather coins or whatever
was popular and these video cards right
eight or nine hundred dollars at the
time and they ended up just sitting in a
crate reduced and then if you bought a
punching machine and we use that
you know like an arcade punching machine
that was when they upgraded the office
the upgraded office was night and day
because the first office man the
bathrooms were terrible they were
actually outside and you had to use a
key to open them and sometimes because
your key and there was a time where they
were doing maintenance on the bathroom
we just got back from lunch okay there
were four bathrooms two upstairs to
downstairs male and female and every
bathroom was blocked and people had to
be sold I don't know if somebody peed in
the bushes or not but there was talk
about possibly doing it another employee
Nick but no for a few years now smart
guy and that dude was hilarious I wasn't
there for this part because I didn't
always go to lunch or stuff like that
because the lunches would sometimes take
a really long time just people talking
and weird weird for me that kind of
makes me tired and I'd rather rather do
work I'm weird like that but Nick got a
cup of Starbucks and I don't know if it
was one of those frappuccinos or it was
a price seven dollar drink so he's
getting out of his color while he
arrives with her and he drops it and you
know it spills everywhere we didn't see
it because everyone else was inside the
office and all you could hear outside
was like the loudest curse thing I've
ever heard in my life well first let's
copy man we were just like peeking out
the windows like what happened they
sounded like there was gonna be a bruja
I don't know it sounded like something
was going down with
Coffee man there's so many funny stories
at that place it was a blast
I would say the work I won't talk about
my frustrations there or really anything
you know I don't no point in that but
you know every job has its frustrations
well I would say the work difficulty was
maybe seven out of ten the frustration
was a 10 out of 10 I won't say why but
the culture was so good
then it lowered all of these by at least
two or three or four points because of
the culture you just felt welcomed
another fellow John who got me lessons
and vaping he was a funny guy I can't
remember a lot of his jokes but he was
just pleasant to crack those little
snickerdoodle jokes with another woman I
won't mention her name because it's very
uncommon she was sometimes get upset
about like the dishes they just sing it
was just funny because you know it would
no guy ever care but she she didn't like
that but she was also a really nice
woman and there are a couple of people
came in and out one guy he basically
came in wrote two lines of code and then
just kind of vanished and we didn't hear
from him for like two weeks and I guess
he was in a car accident and we're like
oh crap and he's okay you know he's fine
but you know he had some serious neck
problems or something but poor guy and
the weird thing is we didn't hear from
him and we didn't know if he was still
working there and later we found out he
got hooked on the painkillers so we're
just like man we suck at hiring some
people there are a couple of other
people who came in and just really just
did absolutely nothing our boss is way
too nice man he would he would do
everything he could to try to get them
motivated and give him another chance
and another chance and I think after the
years he realized yeah people are
probably taking advantage of me which
they were and I didn't like that because
I really liked the boss he was just such
a nice guy when I say nice guy I mean
probably one of the nicest bosses if not
the nicest boss I've ever had he was a
bit kooky but he was he cares about his
employees like I have not seen yeah I
miss that guy
is really cool but yeah you know the
company we worked on this massively
large project and you know things sadly
didn't go to plan you know we around
them time in two months three of us
departed and you know me and one guy had
an option to stay but I said you know he
gave us some options because he's just
too generous of a guy I said you know
I'd rather keep your respect and just
depart now and not feel like I'm here to
collect a paycheck because I don't feel
like there's just enough work and in who
knows I don't know a month or two I
don't know how long I would last there
same with the other guy it just didn't
feel like something was right so you
know it happens it's part of life the
boss said no cruel intentions or any
thing I don't think he wanted to break
apart the team he's just you know you
gotta do what you got to do to save the
company mm-hmm and it did come to that
point unfortunately I would say that the
Matt guy when we would go out to eat he
would uh he was single at the time and I
would basically always encourage him to
get their number one time we were out to
eat and sometimes this was after Shaw
went away and Cha was like basically my
sidekick - laughs hysterically I felt
like that dude was so funny man that guy
was funny so since he wasn't there I
kind of had to try to stir things up a
little bit make it interesting because
some of the guys you know they didn't
they were funny but I like to do a
little bit more stuff that makes people
uncomfortable and funny like we had a
waitress once she was Chinese or
something I said
I'll have a coke and a kiss I didn't
really want a kiss I was just trying to
be funny you know lose a big deal she's
like oh no I'm married I said oh oh like
I really cared but uh I think she took
me serious because you know the culture
difference she didn't understand that
they they paid well they treated me
really well it was it was a hard it was
a lot of work a lot of heart especially
the first year I think I had to work on
something that was really complicated
and I didn't know the full details of it
and I kind of built it as I was given
and strong
actions and boy that was before they had
all these convenient JavaScript
frameworks and stuff but I did the best
I could and it turned out pretty good
I'm no Matt but I do what I can with
what I have you know I'm not the best of
everything
and I'd say it was a job that was
definitely worthwhile and one that I'll
be able to tell stories of just like I
am now you know there's a lot more funny
stories that are kind of inside jokes
but sha well the the lady who worked up
front for some reason came over with it
was like a circle thing where you dip
your finger in it kind of like puts a
little bit of wax on your finger and you
can turn a page with it
she gave it to Matt for some reason like
I've never even seen Matt with a
magazine but she feared Matt would want
me and sha had a field day with this man
because you don't matter where I saw my
hug you know Matt's a ball already so
fancy and we made at that time you know
was probably like 45 minutes of non-stop
hilarity between me and shot we were
laughing so hard we were crying my my
gut was in pain that was one of the
hardest laughs I've ever had but Matt I
mean we're making jokes like a probably
wears a glove and it has like a little
cutout on the finger so I could just dip
it in and turn the pages because he's
such a fancy boy it's really one of them
times where you have to be there and the
funny thing is the worse there were some
other people in some other office that
were never there they were doing
something like putting furniture
together and they're hearing me and Shah
laughed like crazy baboons like god
stops
I have no idea what they thought they
thought either this place is crazy or
this place is really fun to work and I
thought it was a little bit of both it
was great so it's sad to see it go
I left one of one of the jobs that it
had a really good culture to move to
this company that I'm speaking of but
the culture here was so laid-back and
that helps so much because some of us
don't work well under stress I don't
know anyone that works that well under
stress maybe some people do I don't know
yeah they probably do but me no I worked
terrible under stress they all missed
the place and it may be the last
full-time job that I ever have because
I've learned a lot and really at the end
of the day it's nice to make a lot of
money but it's not really what I seek
anymore because with that good pay I've
been able to do things - how do I say it
without sounding I've been able to help
certain things okay
and also I've been able to spoil myself
you know my family said he's the guy who
needs nothing and sadly that has been
true and I actually have had so much
more than I've ever needed that I still
have stuff that I could I don't know
what to do with you know it's like a lot
of little stuff a couple of big things
it's it's ridiculous and the sad part is
with all that money
never brought me any happiness
you don't like to buy something I want
it just didn't matter anymore
I can't believe it like it was like okay
this is the American dream you know make
a lot of money you got it up it up I
like to have fun and when I'm able to
capture those moments and remember them
and life is really about well a lot of
things but I think part of life is about
making good memories of people and also
doing what you love and getting better
at it
I'll miss those days so like I said
possibly the last full-time job I'll
work I won't say why but that group of
people man I don't know how it happened
it was just dynamic
I've never experienced that before ever
since I've worked
everyone had like a very unique
personality that it all tied together
one guy Court he got us addicted to this
movie called the room if you've never
heard of though room you look it up it's
like a cult classic of the worst movie
ever made and he kept talking about all
the time he made we use slack to
communicate sometimes and he made his
profile picture a picture of the main
actor who's Tommy yzo I don't know how
to say his name the weirdest looking
person in the world with long black hair
and I ordered the book called the
disaster artist cuz I was like what is
the story behind this movie I had it
somewhere laying around but that was
probably the funniest book I've ever
read because it's also true
besides that we all had a time in the
office on a Friday without watched the
movie the room so you got a bunch of
guys watching the worst movie ever made
I'd say that was a memory I'll never
forget it was so dang funny like we
couldn't believe how bad it was watching
it alone would be kind of weird but when
you watch it with people it is so funny
like it just in the movie makes no sense
and we would come and we would come into
work and just like use lines from the
movie like have a water bottle I did not
hit her
I did not what a great story mark by the
way how's your sex life but because that
they say this stuff like spontaneously
in the movie and it's like what and
you'd really have to see the movie to
get it because you'll just be like this
makes no sense so I'm really thankful
that I had that job and I don't know
what I'll do from here on out like I
said I'm
more than I ever need it more than I
didn't want they had a TV sitting there
I don't even use I got a monitor there I
don't use you know all these electronics
I don't use in the closet
I'm not really a PAC riot either a lot
of little things little electronics to
it it's not like I've never spent like a
thousand dollars on a television I don't
like to waste money like that but like a
pair of Michael Jordan shoes I don't
wear just stupid stuff that it's like
this doesn't make life better at all why
no what makes life good is enjoying your
purpose and doing what you love in in a
natural sense without talking about like
anything spiritual that's what makes
life a lot of fun and yeah I we did so
much crazy stuff I wore a pimp outfit
once just some white chinos some white
shoes I got like don't know $25 off
Amazon you know I'm not gonna buy like a
real fancy pair and I bought two pinky
rings and then some weird glasses and I
just pretended to be a pimp for a day
and they just thought it was really
weird I think yeah I'll end there
because I've had other jobs where pretty
much I've done ridiculous things and I
don't even know why they don't fire me I
like it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
