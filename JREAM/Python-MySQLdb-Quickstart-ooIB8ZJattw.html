going to get MySQL inside of Python and
I'm going to do this on Windows and it's
a little tricky but I found it an easy
way to do it if you're on Linux or say
SSH you would just do yum install of my
SQL DB that Python you'd have to do a
command like that and you would had to
sit installed on your Linux if you are
using the other one be like apt-get or
something like that so basically I found
this site here code good comm archives
slash four and they have an executable
that you can install which is fantastic
I'm using Python 2.7 on my windows so I
believe they have a link to that right
here and I'm actually on 64-bit so I
installed my 64-bit one get whatever one
you want and once you install that
you're good to go now I have a lamp W a
MP installed and I use that for PHP and
it comes with MySQL and I just have PHP
myadmin salt so it makes it a little
convenient to work with a MySQL I'm
going to create a database and just call
it Python I'm going to create a new
table and I'll call this text with three
fields
and I'll just call this one ID title and
text and the last two will just be VAR
characters okay give those all a length
and I'll increment the ID and make that
primary safe okay so now we have a nice
little thing here and what I'm going to
do is actually insert something into
here
okay just some random text because we're
going to do a select with a Python so
make sure I got that in there all good
and I've made a SQL dot py file and now
for the fun part which is pretty easy my
SQL DB and we're just going to make a
variable and I'm going to call it DB
equals my SQL DB connect okay and we got
to pass in our parameters for our
connection and the connection we do host
user pass WD and DB so my host is
localhost my user will be root I have no
password and the DB we just made
remember what's called Python okay and
I'm going to open up Windows PowerShell
if you you can use regular shell if
you'd like
okay and I'm going to list my directory
and I want to go to desktop since that's
where I saved my file it's right here
SQL py and I can just run Python SQL py
and I have a problem right here with my
import it's because you see I have this
space here oops
let's try that again I just press up and
enter and host equals localhost do I
have the wrong tab amount
oops I don't want these squiggly
brackets I'm so used to JavaScript okay
and we get no error so what we're going
to do is we're going to wrap this in a
try-catch statement so that if we don't
have a database we have a nice clean
error so we're going to try that and
I'll just to accept exception as E and
we'll do a system exit
can't get into the database okay and
make sure that all works okay and let's
try changing the database and it's just
exit we can't get into the database
looks like I have to import this
try that once more there we go nice and
clean so what we're going to do is
select from the database and to do that
we can say cursor equals DB cursor
I'm going to make this a little taller
and we're going to do cursor execute and
inside the query we're going to say
select all from what was it called the
called it text okay from text
and if you run it shouldn't do anything
because we have to fetch it still and
I'll do curser dot fetch all and these
will be my results so I could say result
equals cursor fetch all and I could say
print result
I'll run that and I have my records
there but what I want to do is I want to
loop through them so I'm going to say if
for assault meaning if we have one I
want to loop through them so I'll just
say for Z in result I'm going to say
print of
there's a z1 plus
see to see what we get there
looks right invalid syntax Z oops I
forgot the plus symbol
okay boom boom and here we have life
death let me put a colon here so it's
easier to tell okay my name is Bob my
name is Rob and as you can see in here
get the title and the text so not too
bad just for fun I'm going to do an
insert so I'm going to do it right here
I'll say curse third execute oops
insert into was it text and what was
there there was a title text values
and the values we'll just say then for
title and sally was here better double
quote these boom-boom-boom-boom
I'm going to assume you're already
familiar with SQL so you probably are
familiar with these insert statements
and now we have this here you could say
Tom Peggy okay and I'll comment this out
okay and now we have all these in our
database and that reflects here as well
so that's a basic start I got with my
SQL DB I hope this helps and what you
could do is make a wrapper for this say
in a class to make inserting and
fetching easier but that's all for now
