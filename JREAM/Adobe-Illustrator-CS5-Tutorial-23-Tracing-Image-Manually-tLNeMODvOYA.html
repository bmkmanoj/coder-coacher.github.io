gonna try to show you a little bit of
drawing on top of an image we're not
going to use live trace because it just
doesn't turn out as good in my opinion
so I just pasted an image in here and
you can do that with file place to place
a file or you could just paste it in
here so the first thing I'll do is press
ctrl - and that locks it okay and then
really what you do is you'd start
drawing all the shapes here what I
probably start with this is a little
mustache and since you know it's gonna
be under the nose this curve here and
stuff doesn't matter and you could just
continue it up here but that looks like
it's gonna be a long way to do it you
could try to build it based off shapes
like this let's make them read so we can
see them and okay and I'll make this
little transparent and it looks like
we're gonna have to cut a little curve
out of there and his mustache is a
little thinner so kind of like that you
know you could connect all these if you
want it and I'd probably draw this last
curve just by hand whoops
whoopsie daisies okay and get that
little mustache piece there okay so what
do we do now we take all these and we
group them together our union and then
I'll make it a little more transparent
so we can see his nose
let's see it snows here okay there's his
nose and you can see with all this junk
there doesn't matter because this nose
is going to go over it
then how about some eyes I'd use maybe
around the rectangle and it's pretty
close
that's some transparency it looks like
it goes down a little more yeah kind of
like that and you could hit eye and get
his actual nose color and then his
actual mustache color this would go
behind the nose and this would be white
and to get his eyes um it's just kind of
like drawing with a bunch of circles huh
black make it a little transparent and
white and white this one's a lighter
white and then I guess blue there's just
a real quick and fast way to do it I'd
recommend doing it slower and a little
more careful but we're on a time crunch
and for the little eye outline I'm gonna
do let me add that to the swatch grab
that and I color okay let's just change
the transparency of all these so you can
see what we're working with we're just
slowly building the character up oops
you could draw something this way like
let's say you drew it on paper and you
want to trace them up and hit ctrl alt
two to unlock the layer you can look at
these options I don't
like them because even though it looks
cool it's just not very original I have
the computer do all the work for you and
yeah you know the goal of Illustrator is
kind of to be creative and make your own
stuff so I think that will cover it
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
