tic-tac-toe tutorial part 2 one thing
we're going to do is just clean up some
of this code with this finding thing we
can just move this down get rid of that
and set a while finding we'll just do
true and to break out of the loop like
in the past tutorials we'll just use the
keyword break now let's give an overview
of what's really going on in your okay
we're importing random and we discussed
that we have a board right here if you
wanted to short shorten this up you
could say range 0 to 8 or it might be 0
to 9 something like that but for now I'm
going to leave it like this so it's
clear we can tell what we're doing show
this just shows us the board and where
its position is you don't want to put
board inside the loop because if it was
inside here every time they looped
around it would reset all the values in
it the game runs in this while loop okay
this is the main game the only thing
stopping the game is the input so you
need something that doesn't cause this
loop to just keep repeating itself so
when you do raw input this pauses the
loop we take the input make sure it's an
integer and we check the position on the
board and we put a letter in the board
if it's not taken and then we create a
new loop for the computer and what this
says is it creates a random number from
0 to 8 and it says if this spots not
taken by a o
or an X then let's add it otherwise it
just goes back here creates a new number
goes back until it can get a spot and if
once it finds a spot and creates the
item we break out of the loop now here's
one thing you have to realize when we
break we're only breaking out of this
loop we're still in this big loop but
this is like a sub loop that we're
breaking out of ok so what we want to do
now is check
for a winner okay and when we check for
a winner we're going to want to do that
after we input an X so check we're gonna
check here and the second place is after
let's see process false boarding so
we're going to check right here after
the computer insert something and to
check we're going to have to create a
little function this is going to be a
pretty sloppy function and I'm not sure
if it's you're really going to like it
too much but I just kind of rough this
together so let's do a function of check
line of character spot one spot to spot
three and we're going to say if board
spot one equals character and board spot
two equals character and board spot
three equals character we'll say return
true and make sure your true is a
capital T basically what this is going
to say is if we did check line it wanted
to check X in position zero three six
would say zero three six and this would
return true so would say if check line
zero three six equals true then X would
win but we want to automate all of this
so that we're not going to have to do
this for every one manually see zero
three six ones because that's a straight
line up and down one four seven two five
eight and they go left and right and
diagonal so what we're going to do is
create a another function called def
check off and for care short for
character we're going to say if check
line of character zero one two that's
winning spot hmm which goes across and
you can just see obviously three four
five six seven eight we need to do all
these we're going to say true and
there's going to be quite a few of these
and
might I don't know if it's totally
correct you can toy around with it I
just went through all these let's say
one four seven two five and eight and
let's see let's do a group of three more
so six seven eight I believe there's
eight positions you can win that and
let's just say six seven eight three
four five if you don't understand what
I'm doing
I guess just rewind the video I'm just
saying zero one two wins three four five
one six seven eight wins if they're all
X's or OS two five eight one five four
and so on and then there's two more for
the diagonal let's say two four six and
zero four eight so that's kind of scary
let me press f5 make sure I have no
errors line 44 I don't have any lines in
here unfortunately line numbers let me
just pause the video a second okay
that's that's just taking the input
value here it's blank and it gives us an
error
I'm not going to monkey with that for
this tutorial so let's do our checking
so we're going to say let's see in this
spot we're going to say if check all of
X equals true print X wins and then
we're going to break and break is going
to break us out of this whole loop so
the game ends and we're going to do the
same thing for o right down here we're
just going to paste this in now make
sure you tab it over Python is a picky
about that when I say o and o wins and
when we check all basically calls this
function and it's checking oh so it's
going
say check line Oh and all these yada
yada yada and let's say three looks like
something went wrong one moment please
okay silly me I have to tab this over
once more my mistake okay let's try that
once more
two and six well we're supposed to get a
winner in that spot well I hope you can
understand the logic of this I probably
have my check all here in correct spot
one spot two and spot three equals care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
