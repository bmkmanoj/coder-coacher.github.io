you how to install a PPTP service to
connect to so you have a static IP it's
basically a virtual private network the
reason you would want this is if you
work remotely and you have connections
to someone else's Amazon services with
security policies or they don't provide
you with that it's good because you
won't have to keep changing your IP in
security policies and wherever else you
might need to so there's two ways to do
it actually three you can call your ISP
and pay about $10 a month with bright
house in Florida anyways or you can
install Open VPN where you set it up on
your local and host and then you get
certificates build a bunch of those and
connect through a client Open VPN you
can download on windows or it's probably
built into Mac and I know it's built
into Linux for the most part on a bun to
14 a bun to 12 and what we're gonna do
instead is use PPTP cuz it's simple and
it's really really basic to install
because this stuff can get kind of hairy
so what you need is a VPS like you could
use Linode that's why I prefer there's
digitalocean if you prefer them that's
fine it doesn't matter to me you just
want something that's cheap has a decent
amount of expert or transfer two
terabytes will probably be enough cuz
I'll only use it when I'm working and
then the location you want the one
that's nearest to you probably the
reason I go with Linode is because
they're really fast and they treat me
like like the king okay I'm not gonna
compare hosts but pick what you like so
I just made this guy him and then I have
my dashboard and I've been messing
around here trying to shorten this video
so I'll go to rebuild and I'm just going
to create a debian box
and I don't need all that space towards
the OS I'll just do ten thousand
megabytes and you got to make a password
and rebuild it
hopefully I typed my password right mmm
don't want to save okay so then once
that's done I'm just gonna click boot
and down here it's just creating a disk
creating the file system and it's going
to boot it so I just have to wait a few
moments because obviously I can't login
if it's not turned on or doesn't exist
and what I'll be using is the get
terminal you see welcome to get one
eight one two preview because you can
type SSH in here and it's a little more
Linux like while you're using a Windows
you can use putty as well too if you
prefer that
okay so system boot okay so I'm just
gonna go to remote access it looks like
it's running and I'm just gonna click
this list so that I can okay so I can
see what's happening because sometimes
if you do stuff too quickly oh why can't
I connect so I'll log in as root and the
password I made and I always like to do
a root so I can just do a epic cat
update
and then after that I always do apt-get
upgrade to upgrade any packages and I
know that's gonna pop up I'll just hit Q
cuz yeah I read it
I really didn't read it but that's okay
so while that guys running let me copy
him
copy mm-hmm this guy so I'm just gonna
wait for him to finish so that I can
actually log in through here oh shoot I
messed up my known host cuz I've been
playing around with this a little bit
let me just edit it real quick this is
my local computer so see users Jessie
that guy there we had the fingerprint
all right type in my little password
okay so now that that's done I can do
apt-get install PPT PD it's usually
called PPTP but D is for a daemon and
I'll just say yes enter ok so we have
our daemon running and what we want to
do is make the IP for our box be able to
assign an IP within the box so we need
to edit the config so I'll use nano cuz
it's easy and we'll edit this file ET
CPP TPD kampf and I'll just press the
page down
okay so you can just uncomment these
lines I'm gonna uncomment these two
bottom ones because you see the local IP
is arranged anyways just do that it's
gonna take too long to go into
explaining everything not that I know
everything anyways and then what we do
is we create a user that will login with
it doesn't use certificates so nano
slash oops let me check my notes okay
PPP chap secrets okay so this is where
we put in our stuff for authentication
and I'm just going to make a client name
let's just call him Jesse and the server
will be PPT PD
that's the what's going to use in the
secret that'll be the password I'll just
call it cat okay cat five you would want
a better path sort and then for the IP
address just put an asterisk for any and
you could create a bunch of other
clients like John PP TPD give them a
password okay so control X and save okay
so we have our our chap secrets and we
need to enable the IP forwarding for IP
four so that we can tunnel through it so
if you type system CTL help
well that's a lot of stuff okay that's
too much all right I'll just go to the
port forwarding part so this just shows
all the stuff going in oh that's a lot
of stuff see ipv6 I'm not concerned
about its ipv4 and we edit that in the
Nano et Cie sis sis CTL dot Kampf okay
and I'll hit page down there it is net
ipv4 forward so boom because we're gonna
be sending packets through this bad boy
I'll just hey control X yes and save and
then we have to add some IP tables which
I copy paste it because I'm really bad
at IP tables I'm too lazy to figure them
out so I'll hazel boom and I'll paste
these in maybe a gist so that you can
copy them and here okay so you obviously
can't read that probably so I'll just
edit paste okay I'll grab this guy if
you get this wrong you're screwed so
I'll say edit paste again okay
I'll say IP tables - L sorry it's plural
okay and you see you should have that
big ol crazy-looking line and what I
like to do is install iptables gosh I
forgot the name sudo at cash Search
iptables
persistent that's it so right there
that's what I want
so sudo apt hi I'm always typing sudo
because I think I'm in a bun too and I'm
never really the root user so I can just
say apt-get install iptables persistent
boom it says save current ipv4 rules -
yes and notice it saves them up there
and et Cie IP tables rules and they'll
be loaded automatically when the system
reboots and there's a manual page where
you can resave them just look up IP
tables persistent it's a pretty sweet
package okay so we're going to need to
but there's one more thing that I read
because I had a bit of trouble building
this and we're almost done I have a
couple of notes open he is just so oh
it's the PPP file so I'm gonna nano the
PPT PD options all right
and you could only see the file name at
the top in case you don't know and
believe this is at the bottom nope there
it is MSDN s so I'm just gonna delete
these okay it says if PPT I'm so bad at
repeating this these letters sorry
alright allow PPT blah blah blah for two
DNS servers or something and one guy
suggested throwing this on the Google
client so that it works with iPads and
other devices I'm not using it for that
but if you are he said do 8 8 8 8 and 8
8 8
oops for four those are Google's DNS so
I'll control X yes and I'll say reboot
all right so now in Windows I'm gonna
open up this PC here and I want to go to
control panels a little nicer and I'm
out of windows 8 in this case I'll go to
network and Internet and network sharing
Center and scroll down a little ways and
you'll see set up a new connection or
network and you want to set up a dial-up
or VPN connection to your workplace and
I'll hit next I created one already for
my real one
so no create a new connection next and
we're not using a real a phone number
we're using a VPN like that guy and then
we can enter you can enter the ipv6
address if you wanted to use those but
I'm just going to use the caller for
YouTube and all we have to put in is our
IP address here which was mine was
don't worry I'll delete this box so this
IP won't be available for you tricksters
and create alright so I got this guy mmm
I can't really move the box on Windows
but you can probably see it at the edge
of the screen if you are on Windows
ain't you double click your connection
you'll have VPN connections so Network
an Internet
connect to a network well in Windows 8
this doesn't I mean in Windows 7 it
probably opens a new tab where you can
see a bunch of other connections but
there's a VPN thing here all right here
we go so I'll click the Internet in my
taskbar right and here's for you - boom
I'll click him and click connect and ask
for the username that we put in the chat
file so remember I did Jesse and then it
was cat 5 and let's connect oh shoot you
can't see it at the top either man
alright well once I can I move this well
it's recording well that's cool let me
shrink a few things down
and so here's for YouTube it says
connected okay so I'll just go to Google
and say what's my IP you can spell it
wrong too and this number is the same
number as your box see 2 3 2 9 1 9 2 3 8
all right and then you can just run
speed test if you're using Linux when
you connect to a PPT server you want to
check off the advanced security options
okay and that forces it to use the chap
the MS or chap server some Ubuntu
network I want to show you a picture
here it is in this picture you want to
use use point-to-point encryption and
then just leave it to all available
otherwise it's not going to connect with
PAP and chap because we're using a
mschap alright hopefully that helps and
then you now have a static IP so as long
as you don't destroy your server thanks
