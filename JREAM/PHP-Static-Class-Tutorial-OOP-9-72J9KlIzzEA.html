tutorial we're going to cover static
classes and as you remember regular
classes you assign them a variable and
you say new class and that's called
instantiating ins and I can't spell it
okay static classes you don't do that
you just say class name and then two
colons and then the method and so let's
create a new static class and I'm just
going to save this as talk dot class dot
PHP now I'll call this class talk and um
what we do is I include require once
first for fire once uh talk last PHP and
to let me fix the coloring I'll just do
a static function so public static
function hi
don't say echo hi and will say public
static function by and we'll say echo by
now you have to have this static keyword
in order to call this method and so we'd
say use the exact class name so remember
the class names talk to say talk : : hi
and refresh and it outputs that talk : :
bye
and there it is there's a static class
you just use them almost like you would
a regular
PHP function but you want to be careful
with these and not overuse them because
later on
these can be called from anywhere you
want to know where things are being
called from and what's called a stack
trace when you have let's say object one
object to object three and if if object
three was nested in two and two is nests
in one and if you get an error in object
to a stack trace will tell you where it
came from and those are usually called
exceptions and if you use a static class
you can't trace the exception because
it's not part of the stack trace it's
just like a dynamic object called from a
place that's not really extending or
popped in there all right an example of
a static class could be like a registry
pattern um not sure of any others off
the top of my head but that's pretty
much it
