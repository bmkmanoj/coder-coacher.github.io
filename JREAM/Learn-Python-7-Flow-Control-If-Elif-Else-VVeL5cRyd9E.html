we're going to look at flow controls and
what is a flow control that's some kind
of like conditional statements if
something is this then do something and
to explain this better let's go to file
new window and I'll just resize this so
that it fits on the screen a little bit
better okay so let's start out with an
if statement we'd say if something
equals equals this okay now before we go
into this let's just make a list because
we did that before let's say users
equals Bob Keenan and Betty so we have
this little users list here so if what
what do we want to see if it's true or
not so let's say if users 0 equals
equals Bob then we'll say print true
okay let me save this and I'm just going
to save this as test book dot py now one
thing to notice is equal sign is for
assignment ok and equal equal is for
comparison so if you did if users equals
Bob you can't do this because this is
first trying to say users equals Bob you
have to say if users equals equals Bob
ok then we'll print true save that I
just press ctrl s then we run and we get
true ok and if that's false rather than
saying if users is not Bob then do this
we can just say else which will cover us
for every other condition so else print
false ok and save that and press f5 we
still get true if you wanted to get
false you could just put in a different
value because user 0 is Bob evaluates
this it says all right this isn't true
so let's go to else
and I'll just run that and we get false
additionally there's an else--if
statement and that looks like a LIF in
most other languages it's else--if and
python is short like Elif so we type
Elif now this also needs an argument you
can't just do it like else else is like
the guy to fall back on so else if what
let's say else if users 0 equals Kenan
let's do number 1 so if this is false
then we're gonna see if this is true and
if this is not true then we're just
gonna say false okay then we'll say
print Kenan is there and I'll just press
f5 and it says Kenan is there now let's
get rid of the else if I'm not going to
go too much into that one if what if we
wanted to do more comparisons in the
first line we could do there's a couple
words one is called and another is
called or and there's also one called
is not and that's kind of similar to not
equal they're not the same thing one has
to do with identity of an object the
other has to do with the value however
if we want to compare a string like this
we could just say if users equals 0 and
users 1 is not Bobby
ok is not well run that and we get true
and why is that we're basically saying
if you didn't put this on one line it
looked kind of like this ok
so users as Bob and user 1 it's not
Bobby
ok but you could do or also
with a hand statement this has to be
true and this has to be true in order
for the if statement to print out
whatever you want with an or statement
like this only one of them has to be
true okay so if user zero is Bob and
users one is Bobby I run that it's still
true because this one is true okay there
there's also one called XOR and that one
would make where one has to be true the
other false yada yada I don't worry
about that right now hmm
okay so how about another thing we could
do we could check the length of a string
so let's say we're gonna do a function
like we've covered a little bit before
let's say if one of user 0 equals 3 okay
we'll say 3 we'll say LF land users 0
equals equals 4 then we'll say print 4
okay I'll save that press f5 and it's 3
long so what happens is it's kind of
like compiling all this at once step one
it gets user 0 it says ok user 0 is BA
then saying okay you're getting the
length of Bob that equals 3 okay and
then we're saying basically it's saying
if 3 is equal to 3 then do this if it's
not then we're gonna say do the same
thing and we're going to say if 3 is
equal to 4 then print 4 and lastly if
none of this is true just say false okay
and this is this is pretty basic stuff
if you understand how this works it
works like this and a lot of software I
think that's good for now so practice
like you're little if Elif and else
statements a little bit I should note
that you can do more Elif statements
we say users zero equals five and we can
say print five there can only be one if
statement just remember that one if
statement and one else statement
now the else statement is optional so
you can get rid of this sometimes you
want it's like a fallback like I said
before so it's up to you alright guys
