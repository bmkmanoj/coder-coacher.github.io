we're going to continue on we just
polished off the admin area a little bit
we're going to polish off the user
dashboard area so what we have is a
login form and if i go to my database my
user table and look at the data I have a
user called test to test calm and what I
did was I just created a new one in my
admin panel called 101.com I just use
the password one so go ahead and create
a user in your admin panel so that you
have the correct password you can login
here so i can say 101.com and one and
it's supposedly supposed to log man what
we want to do is have a dashboard page
now if you look at the admin panel right
here the class name is admin and our
main landing page is called dashboard
and we're going to have a conflict
because we have a class called dashboard
and if we make a controller called
dashboard it's going to go to the
constructor so we're going to have to
call the landing page for the dashboard
something different like home so I'm
just going to say public function home
and we're going to display a view in
here those copy some of this untap some
of that i'm going to call this home
instead and i'm going to look for if i'm
using the dashboard page so i'm not so
i'll call this home okay and for our
login we're checking if there is a login
success we have one problem with this
segmented array so i'll go ahead and go
to my admin panel it looks like we can
delete this stuff here and we can pretty
much just copy most of this I know this
is code duplication and we'd probably
want to extract it into a different
class that handles like if the user is
logged in but let's keep it simple for
now by the way my last video cut off
because of my microphone if you didn't
get the last part I also check if the
user is an admin if they're not in admin
then they can't log into the admin panel
and all I did down here was is when they
do log in under the log and function I
set is admin is one now we'll be setting
real user IDs and all that eventually so
let me go back to where I was I'm just
going to copy all this in the
constructor I'm going to paste it here
and we just have to change a couple
things get rid of these is admin and
here we're going to redirect to
dashboard login okay because we forgot
these submit handler so it's not
actually checking if we're logging in so
let's try it again so i'll try 101.com
and we do the login data here so that
passes and much like the admin
controller we're just going to do a
redirect for the login and I can copy
this stuff so i'll just copy this here
and pace that guy there and we don't
care if they're in admin so we can get
rid of that and we have to change this
if they successfully login to dashboard
/ home remember we just created a little
thingy for that otherwise just go to
dashboard / logon and on this homepage I
don't think we have anything really it's
just that you're logged in I might have
added this off of the video and just put
in some text here so you might have to
do that for your dashboard page which we
were named to home so i'll try that
again and login beautiful let's also
create a log out so I'll go to my
include files in the dashboard and we'll
do a link for a site URL I'm also going
to do some for these two since we're
going to use site URL for everything
might as well put these on separate
lines so it's less confusing dashboard
will be whoops dash board / home and log
out will be / log out and for now and
I'll just make the link i'll call it
account okay so we need to make two
methods in the controller for account
and log out so let's copy this hold ctrl
shift and press the down arrow twice
i'll call this account i'll call this
log out
and for the logout remember we do this
cest session sess destroy and redirect
to the site URL of dashboard logon and
for the account we're just going to make
an account view I'll just copy my home
one rename it account open our up and
I'll say I account and I'll be empty
okay so let's just check to make sure
those links look good dashboard there my
account shows my account and logging out
beautiful to stay consistent before I
close off this video I just want to go
to the admin panel and instead of taking
them to the dashboard I want to call it
home so that it is consistent with what
we did on the public facing side so I'm
just going to find all occurrences of
dashboard I like to do this so I don't
miss it so I'm calling at home see and
then I can do it one by one to make sure
i'm replacing the right thing sometimes
I don't do a full find/replace because
it will replace it places I don't want
so in the admin we're going to rename
this to home the admin homes homepage so
admin home and this will actually load
the view admin home so it's consistent
and we don't get confused so I just want
to test that briefly and I'll try admin
admin admin and it looks like it works
good thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
