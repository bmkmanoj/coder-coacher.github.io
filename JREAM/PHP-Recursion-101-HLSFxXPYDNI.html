about recursion in looping I've been
thinking about it a lot lately and it's
a it's a harder topic than a lot of
people think in my opinion or it's just
very hard for me I've never met anyone
that thought recursion was easy looping
is easy but recursion depending on the
complexity of what you're going through
is complicated so on my screen what I
have is a dump
repository this is just a private
repository where I just changed the CSS
a little using a normalized CSS I
thought I had skeleton in there I guess
not and I just made the background a
little more readable and that tossed in
a couple of functions like dump just
simple stuff I was working on some other
stuff that's not ready but to start we
would start with an array that I wrote
beforehand to save time so here's a list
of operating systems if you haven't
heard of them the bottom for our Linux
and then I listed some CPUs by category
you could really call this the iSeries
but I'll just list the I three five and
seven MD I just list FX and Opteron
Opteron I actually used the FX I really
like it and it's more affordable I'm
gonna get off topic alright so I printed
out these two arrays and you guys all
know you know you can do for each OS as
key value and
eko value because we know that they are
all values they're not a race right so
what if we did this with CPU though let
me echo a br here you guys priority know
the answer this but yeah array to string
conversion we can't do that because
these are array values these are arrays
so this is not really a value it's a key
Intel is a key the values are nested
inside so the first way we can loop is
just check if it's an array so if is
array CPU sorry value this would be
really stupid but you could do another
for each in here but the purpose of
recursion is one not to repeat your code
and to make stuff efficient of the
unknown because in reality if we had a
data set like this we won't know how
deep it goes so we can't predefined a
long list of infinite for each is so
we're gonna make a function so this
let's just call this function CPU one
and we'll call it data for the loop okay
and I'm gonna move all this stuff into
here
all right so instead of CPU will just
use data okay what do we have going on
here so I prefer my stuff a little bit
easier to read so I can see the
underlines or I can press ctrl M to jump
back and forth and sublime text isn't
that nice all right so is it is not a as
we if is array value I'll take these off
and forgot I had them on I I'm obsessed
with these yellow glasses that tint the
screen they really help my eyes a lot
because I'm in a computer all the time
it's ridiculous so if the value is an
array we're going to recall the same
method so CPU one and I'm gonna pass
value now let's stop here and talk if
you don't understand recursion okay
let's just say recursion 101 all right
what's happening here is we're gonna get
an error
so let's first run that well we didn't
even call it so CPU one of CPU okay all
right so we get an error because we have
an array to string conversion because we
need to put a continue here okay refresh
all right
echo HR I don't so what's happening is
data is actually an evolving variable I
wish stores an easy way to explain this
but I'll do my best
we call the function CPU 1 and we pass
in this big chunk of CPU data and we do
our regular loop through it and so it
starts with this chunk for the first for
each and this represents key value so
Intel represents key and this array
represents the value you got right here
so we check is a value in array yes so
then we're gonna recall the same
function which is CPU 1 ok and now this
data here becomes this becomes the data
so now key would actually be you don't
see it but it would be the 0 that's by
default there ok
so it'd be you know 0 1 2 3 and value
would be this string right and what this
does is it says is array nope
so let's echo out the value all right so
pretty pretty easy peasy we could even
add let's just say I'll pretend to know
something ok so let's say I know some I
7 models here so I don't let's just call
it - desktop version and mobile version
I guess right and I'll refresh so it
knew to go in there it's like it's
intelligent because once it gets to i7
again it checks is this an array yup and
then it loops through these once it's
done the recursion goes back to the
level below it which was the this whole
array
so it's kind of like going down into
levels and then once it's done that goes
back and that goes back goes down so
that's how recursion works and that's
how we have all these so we could
actually have an echo key value and that
looks great all a bunch of zeros and
ones wasn't what I was expecting I
thought whatever who cares all right so
all right so that's a more devious
example obviously this would be terribly
easy to os's so I'll just delete that
while CPUs can get interesting
so that's recursion 101 let's make
another one okay I'll just duplicate the
code and okay I'm gonna replace CPU one
with CPU two these are just function
names doesn't mean anything okay
so this will be saved output now when
you have a string like this it doesn't
do us much good if we're just echoing it
out of a method because most methods
don't echo stuff out so one thing we can
do is there's two ways to go about this
and I'll show you both ways that I know
of I'll say output equals just an array
and let me cut this guy and put them up
here
and then this will be CPU to one way is
to pass a reference value and that's
with and output so how does this work
it's kind of cool
output is really this guy so he's
outside of the function scope but he's
being referenced out there so what we
can say is output equals value okay and
then what we need to do is that when we
recurse into another level of arrays
they have to pass output okay and since
we have this reference guy going on we
need to print our output and we refresh
that and I forgot to pass out put in the
call you have to have a variable here
because it's a reference to a variable
so now we have a flat array of what is
this multi-dimensional array maybe this
example isn't the most useful but I'm
trying to give you some ideas about this
so I'll just duplicate this again
let me put save output 1 and this will
be save output 2 we're gonna get the
same results in a different way though
so instead of passing a reference
variable we're gonna just clear up those
and we'll just say output equals CPU -
ok so the end of this we're going to
return output and we're gonna do static
I'll put equals array ok and brief fresh
okay so we'll get the same value so
static is unchanging within the method
skull sorry my voice so that's another
nice way to do it so that's pretty cool
I'll go ahead and save this i'll
prettify this and then link in our gist
so that you can copy all the code I can
get rid of these os's here
because they keep saying undefined right
there okay now the other one is SPL
which is standard PHP library that has a
lot of iterators but not many examples
there's regular iterators and iteration
is like your for each you know iterate
one iterate two and then there's
recursive iterators and recursive
iteration is what we're doing here while
we're going okay this level this level
this level is calling itself that's what
the recursion is so I think
like I really know what I'm doing I'm
not even really a programmer I just hire
people overseas and they just do all the
work for me and I pretend I actually
know what I'm doing all right you know I
don't want to talk about this
