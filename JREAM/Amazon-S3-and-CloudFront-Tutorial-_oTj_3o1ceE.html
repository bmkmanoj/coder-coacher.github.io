dream calm in this tutorial I'm going to
go over amazon s3 and cloud front
briefly amazon s3 is a simple storage
service that's really cheap it's 15
cents per gigabyte of storage and
bandwidth uh I think that might be down
here guess not um bandwidth is like
let's see well I guess it's free for
right now and requests are pretty cheap
i spend about under two dollars a month
for about a couple of gigabytes of
storage and a couple of gigabytes of
bandwidth i haven't kept track of it
because it's so cheap often it's under a
dollar and i have my sights
automatically backed up so amazon s3
sign up for that they only charge you
for what you use then you create these
little buckets and everything's private
unless you make it public for example
these mp3's they're already public and
you can do let's just say properties and
it will give you the URL over here and
you can play your audio or any file you
want the reason for cloud front is to
distribute things in other areas for
faster connections so if you imagine if
you're in the USA in your server was in
Los Angeles over where this L is if
someone load your site from Europe or
Russia it's a long ways away and the
connection will be a lot slower than if
you were in the u.s. so basically what
cloud front does is it kind of puts your
stuff among a bunch of servers and
wherever they're located cloud front
will say hey this is the closest server
let's distribute
it with this server and it's a lot
faster and to use cloud front you just
sign up for that and you had this little
thing right here this little control
panel is really nice and what you do is
you create a distribution you select the
bucket you want to use and I just do
downloading right now I don't know how
to do the streaming yet um 4°c names
you can put in your domain or subdomain
like static tallassee com if you want
your content to connect to your site now
you're going to have to change something
in your hosting control panel if you do
this it's very easy so I already created
one of these buckets it's right here are
not a bucket a distribution and you'll
get this crazy-long domain name like
this you can serve your files from this
domain name G it will load it but if you
want a pretty URL you go into your
account Center right now I'm using media
temple grid and you edit your DNS zone
file and it's really easy you just
create a cname and you put in that long
URL from the cloud front and then you
type in the domain name that you want it
to be so for this one I did static dot
la sede and in this you also want your
cname here to match what you're putting
in DC name so after you do that you
would hit save right down there you can
do this on other web host I just really
like media temple and you can do a data
glossy calm and there we have it you
could do BG this will load the
background and it's really fast it's
really cheap uh so if you ever get web
hosting where you don't have a lot of
bandwidth or space amazon web services
is a really good idea and i would
recommend using it
hopefully this helped you everything to
configure your server is pretty much
built into a control panel now as you
can see this little area here everything
you need and if you need to connect to
other software such as a cloudberry lab
cloudberry explorer sard something like
this it's pretty easy you just file
amazoness through accounts make a new
account and just make a name give your
access key and secret key are in your
Amazon a area where it would be oh let's
see under account right there and it'd
be under security credentials easy peasy
alright I hope that helps and good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
