comm and in this tutorial we're going to
make a tic-tac-toe game in Python and
kind of gather up some of the things
we've learned and this will kind of make
it more exciting and easier to learn now
i with this game up fairly fast so the
logic probably isn't perfect but it'll
give you an idea first thing we got to
do is start out with a tic-tac-toe board
and it has nine squares total and we're
going to give these little placeholders
digits so it will be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
and here's how we'll do it we'll say
board equals and use the square brackets
for a list
we'll say 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ok and let's
just say the game board and I'll run
this and type board and we just have a
list now you could say range of 40
equals range like 0 comma 8 but I'm just
going to do it this way so it's easy to
tell what we're doing and then we're
going to make a function called show and
this is going to format our board so
it's easy to see so first thing I'm
gonna say board 0 we're going to print
these let's say print board 0 comma and
we're going to make a little pipe ok
comma n board 1 comma another pipe comma
and board 2 is just to show the
appearance a little bit and board
presence and then we're going to print
the bars across basically what we're
doing is printing the board for
tic-tac-toe I'll just make 8 dashes okay
and then we have to change these numbers
in here so 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ok
I'll hit f5 and let's do
show and there we have the board that
looks like a tic-tac-toe board
I guess I'll add another dash here maybe
two more so that it looks like a real
board okay there's our tic-tac-toe board
and the numbers are what we're going to
type in to place our X and a spot so the
first thing we're going to do is make a
loop a while loop while true and true is
always true so this will keep running
and then we're going to take the user
input so say input equals rot input
select a spot okay and we always want
the input to be an integer so we can
cast that to integer so let's say int
input so basically if they type a letter
it'll be cast into an integer and it
might not match but whatever so let's
see where we are right now okay save
your project and the source and let's
type a number okay it doesn't do
anything yet it just lets us continually
type input and that's what we want so
the first thing is we're going to say
we're going to say if board input oops
it's not equal to X and board input is
not equal to O that will assign board
input equals x I'll explain this in just
a moment and we'll do else on print this
spot is taken okay so let's run that and
hit enter to get this line up at four
four okay so spots are being taken up
and what what is this really doing it's
saying when I type the number two it's
going to grab this item right here
see it says board and then the input
that they type in so it's really going
to say board
- so bored 0 1 2 is right here and
saying if that is not equal to X and it
is not equal to O then we're going to
let this turn into X like that and it'll
be easier to see what we're doing if we
can print the board every time we do
something so let's say show and we'll
use this show function all right so
let's say 3 and you see the X is there
let's say for the X is there and 5 and
we have a row of X's okay the next thing
we want to do is allow the computer to
put something in after we put something
in and we want this to be random so what
we're going to do is we're going to
import the random module so the very top
just say import random okay
go back to your while loop this will be
our main game right here and inside the
if statement we want the computer to put
a character in a random spot after we
successfully input one of our own so
what we're going to set we're going to
say is uh random flips random dot seed
and this just gives a random it's a
little random generator and we'll say
random dot R and int it's going to pick
a random integer from 0 to 8 and we're
going to call this how about opponent
okay so we're generating a random number
for the little enemy to put it on the
board so let's say um if board opponent
is not equal to O and board opponent
it's not equal to X
then we can assign that board of
opponents um equals oh okay and the
problem we're going to have here is
let's run it and we're going to say for
you see we got four right here and it
gave us a spot there now let's say six
okay gave us a spot there seven and it
looks like it's missing a spot you see
there's supposed to be three oh that's a
zero so don't get confused and the
reason is this generated a random number
and it was one of these okes and we need
it so that it generates a number of
something that is not taken so this
really needs to be in a loop so we're
going to make something called finding
equals true so finding is just looking
for an available spot and we're going to
say while finding and we're going to tab
these over and this one also and what if
they're able to pick a spot we're going
to say finding equals false or we could
just yeah I think that'll be fine and
save that press f5 let's try again three
one eight just do a couple tests and
make sure I'll do a part two to this
video so that we can finish this game
off all right thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
