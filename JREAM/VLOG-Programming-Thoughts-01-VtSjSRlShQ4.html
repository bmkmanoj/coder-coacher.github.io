of a discussion rather than a tutorial
where I share with you what I think a
really good or great programmer is just
the quick background is you know I've
been uploading these videos for a while
a lot of which are pretty outdated now
because technology moves forward fast
and I've been writing code i'm not
saying i wrote it well since i was about
12 and i'm over 30 now so with all that
said here's some tips I can give you
number one is you have to love what you
do this might get a little too
philosophical or motivational speech
like sounding but I'm just going to be
royal to you if you don't love what you
do there's no point in doing it since
you're going to live one life you have
to find something you're passionate
about now am i passionate about sitting
behind a desk the majority of the day
and writing code no am i passionate
about writing good code it various hours
of the day when i get creativity yes and
it's hard to have the best of both
worlds so you got to love what you do
that's all there is to it how do you
know if you love programming well the
first signs that you love learning I
know a lot of people love learning but
you love learning about this specific
topic and another sign is that you go to
bed with a problem in your head whether
you're a beginner or you're really
advanced and you sleep and you think
about it or you nap and you know it's
just kind of the back your mind and that
just kind of shows that you enjoy
solving puzzles so that's it that's a
good sign that you should stay a
programmer
if you absolutely if you get exhausted
all the time and it's not fun yes
there's times it's frustrating but you
shouldn't be getting like oh I hate this
all the time and since I said that I
should bring up developer burnout
developer burnouts basically when you
feel like you've done so much and it's
just not worth it anymore program has
lost its joy and you would rather just
go shovel dirt for a while and as crazy
as it sounds is you should go shovel
dirt for a while but not quit your job
if that's what you're doing it's really
good to get your mind off of these
screens and then just get your mind on
something else I can't tell you how
important it is to have a hobby and as
developers will have strengths and
weaknesses I think I know my weaknesses
one is that and I'm not trying to sound
like I'm bragging this is actually a
flaw of mine is that I'm too focused and
i overthink everything so what will
happen is what could normally be a easy
solution to a problem is I'll overthink
well what if this happens and then a
chain reaction and I end up spending a
lot of time thinking it's more complex
than it has to be when it doesn't have
to be and that also reflects in my code
because you know my code gets more
complex the more complex i envision it
which is a poor quality that i'm still
trying to get better at you know the
saying keep it super simple it's easier
said than done
it's really easier said than done when
you're doing simple projects when you
get into large projects with just a
whole bunch going on keeping it simple
can get very difficult but I think you
know the best practice to take is always
function serve one purpose and one
purpose alone and you connect those
functions just like in a class or just
function functional programming i sorry
not functional programming like closure
procedural programming so what happens
for burnout is can be stressed too if
you work a place with a lot of deadlines
for me I don't work well under deadlines
what I mean is like very strict
deadlines and you don't you don't feel
the creativity to kind of express
yourself in code or anything if you feel
like you can kind of express yourself in
code that's really good but the best
thing I've learned is that you should
always talk to be connected with someone
or hopefully work with someone who's
smarter than you you'll learn a lot from
them and say you're working with someone
and you do code reviews you look through
their code you're basically studying
what they do and it makes sense or at
least you have to kind of make sense of
it that is if they're good because you
can call anyone a good programmer it
doesn't mean they are I think the best
programmers are the ones that know how
to take the super complex or just the
complex and break it down into a human
readable format and with you know fewer
lines of code I mean the ultimate job of
a programmer is to write code first for
humans so that other humans can
understand it and obviously to get the
job done I've worked on a lot of
projects where
is like the person programs for
themselves they program in their own way
so that it's very difficult to follow
what they're doing and that mostly has
to do with organization and/or like why
did they do this that's beside the point
of getting into why this person use this
framework or why'd they put this in here
but it's more about organizing their
code and what goes where and know how to
properly utilize a language so if you
have let's say senior developer you know
these are just titles but a senior
developer would be someone with a lot of
experience in their field or language
and then a mid-level with you know I
think of mid levels maybe like four or
five years in the language wait what my
view is this a senior programmer should
be able to write code that's readable to
a mid-level developer and if you were to
take it where you're mid-level
developers kind of the highest guy yeah
he's called a senior which nobody would
really know he should be able to write
code it's easy for kind of a guy that's
been doing it for two years three years
and this makes it easier to work with a
team too because a lot of the advanced
developers and I've tried my hardest to
stay out of this habit and I'm not
saying I'm some advanced developer but
it's you're so used to doing the same
thing over and over that you just are
like well I'm just going to do the
quickest way to do this and the problem
with that is that you know you can have
a line of code like this long say 70
characters long and it's a ternary
operator inside of a ternary operator or
something crazy in it when you look at
code you should be able to look at it
and say okay okay okay
I understand what it's doing within a
second or two when you look at code and
you know you're just figuring out what
are they doing and you jump back and
forth to me that's bad code but that can
also depend on the complexity of the
application so some tips that I have and
this is going to sound really silly if
you don't follow my little facebook
groups sometimes I posts in there but
there's two types of thinking I was
learning about learning and I watched a
couple videos about that and one was
there's two forms of thought that's
diffuse thinking and there's focus
thinking so focus thinking is when I am
locked in the zone and I'm just thinking
hard you know where does this go you
know things are buzzing like having a
bunch of caffeine and just going at it
and I'll show you what diffuse thinking
is this would be my example of diffuse
thinking now I am NOT a drummer first
and foremost I am NOT a drummer at all
but I bought this drummer pad it was
about thirty dollars okay it has a side
here side here anyone familiar with that
and I have two drumsticks so what I need
to think out a problem rather than just
spinning my chair I kind of want to get
good at something on the side for fun to
feel like you know hey maybe I'm
progressing at something so you know
I'll just I'll just do this whoops you
know i'm not i'm not a good drummer but
it's fun to play around with it and i'll
do that for up to a half hour it may
seem like a waste of time but if you
just do something passively like that
that kind of requires muscle memory or
something other than your brain thinking
so hard I find it really helpful
doesn't mean I come up with like the
best idea each time or ever really but
it regenerates me that's called diffuse
thinking where you're not your mind's
not buzzing rather it's kind of going
ping pong and you're just kind of
passively thinking about whatever while
you just hit on some kind of pad but
this isn't about a little drum pad if
you thinking could be something as
simple as swinging your keys around and
it doesn't look like you're working so
if you're in a workplace obviously
depending on how strict they are they
might think all this guy's not working
but I disagree because sometimes having
your head down at your desk or wherever
you work that doesn't mean you're
working I don't think we should fake it
but you know if that's how your company
culture is real strict and you know
dress casually or dress professionally
and always look busy I think that's
completely wrong I don't think you
should always look busy because busyness
does not mean you're being productive
and programming is a lot in the head
you're getting paid to think about what
you are trained about
yeah looking looking busy as stupid but
it make it makes the employer feel like
oh I'm not just paying this guy for
nothing so obviously if you were to get
away with that you'd have to have a
level of trust and okay this is how this
guy works if you're someone that can
just you don't need to fuse thinking I
don't think that's possible I think
everybody does some just downtime during
the day maybe just listen to some
classical music and don't even think
about cold at all sometimes answers will
come to you and sometimes overnight and
it's always good to keep learning new
skills to what i mean by new skills is
i'm not i'm not a flavor of the week guy
that likes to learn every new framework
especially the javascript there's always
something new Under the Sun and I'm
tired of it to be honest I'm really
tired of it not a big fan of JavaScript
but uh ECMO six looks promising anyways
you got to keep improving your skills
though so like what I would suggest is
let's say PHP 7 which is coming out at
the time of recording this had just had
a recent get tagged but it's not an
official release of version 7.9 a
release candidate my advice would be to
get good at the new features in the
language and with any language say
Python the problem python is there's
version 2 and 3 I think once you get
comfortable in two it'd be cool to jump
into three as well and also another
place to explore is Google go I find
that pretty interesting but it also
depends on what you enjoy doing now if
you enjoy mobile devices that one's
tricky because just like how JavaScript
is you know a flavor of the week
framework we have titanium studio no Jas
with boy express no that's not it I
can't remember anymore it's just so many
add-ons if I go into front-end
development it's changed like insanely
in the past four years for example you
have task runners which do a lot of work
for you so I mean there's sass which is
like CSS it's very easy to learn and
it's a lot better but with all that
there's things like gulp grunt for node
J s Bauer is a dependency manager PHP
has a dependency manager called composer
Python has one called pip but you know
those are easy the back end ones but the
front end ones I mean you really can do
a lot nodejs does front end and back end
but it really has a lot of lot of
dependencies if you ever install I don't
know say five packages you'll notice
that it's really installing a lot if you
want to build a real task runner that is
but it is worth it for sure now
depending on where you work some some
places are really like okay let's just
get this done and get it working or
you're working on legacy software where
you don't have the opportunity to do
things like unit testing but I like
taking things slow and getting it right
rather than just rushing through it and
getting errors and that's harder to do
with big complex application sadly
so what makes a great programmer I think
number one is they have a passion to do
it why because if somebody loves
programming you don't really have to
push them to learn something new and
they want to talk about it or learn
about it and they find it interesting
and they'll discover new little trends
or fun stuff to talk about another is a
i would even throw devops into here
because if you program at some point
you're going to have to get in some sort
of DevOps at least you should the
easiest would be digital ocean and
learning how to use a linux box
something more advanced would be amazon
web services and then even more advanced
would be if you had a large server as
automatically provision in clouds sorry
automatically provisioning instances say
ec2 instances based on the usage so i
just answered the phone recording of
video a
so I just hung up because someone called
me and I tried to swipe the other way
but if they're gonna call back this
video didn't go how I wanted totally now
bummer and I'm not gonna edit that out
it's kind of funny I just hung up it's
uh oh my gosh it's midnight already what
I want to do is I want to wake up and be
excited to work and feel like I'm
getting somewhere and sometimes task
managers help with that and sometimes
they can feel like a burden one of the
most important things in programming I
think I say everything is important what
I mean is I think it's important not one
of the most important but is a
recognition I think that's an important
thing from somebody because it's
rewarding when the do you think the NBA
NBA would be that much fun if all the
players played and there was nobody in
the state heels i I don't I don't think
so i think that's kind of a driving
factor for NBA players or any sport and
i'm not saying you need to have fans but
you need a group a team that it also
says yeah all right let's do this some
team play and I don't feel like I really
got my my whole point across but uh I
just want to put a video up and do
something different and kind of talk
about something else there's more to
life than just programming you know you
got to have fun if you're like me you
can end up getting a bit cooped up and
sometimes a little obsessed over
learning and
you gotta say okay put your head in the
water pull it out shake it off and say
when's lunch that's what you gotta do we
all need a break sometimes you know
there's a lot of frameworks to and just
just learn what you want I'd suggest
learning something that has a good
community for sure my favorite framework
is a pie tin Python it's Django now I'm
no master at it but I love it I find it
the most probably my favorite to use but
there's a lot of good there's a lot of
good other frameworks you know Falcon
laurelville for PHP anyways zend is evil
and symphony is over I don't know if
it's popular really much just the
components it's too heavy and I don't
like it either you basically need to
cash everything in order to get it to
work and adjust your file system and I
didn't have much fun not working with
symphony can pee labs and plugins and
all this garbage you know I don't want
to be a puzzle solver that just what
sword a cable operator and that's what
scares me about the way programming is
going because we have so many git
repositories and trends happening that
it's like well I can develop this for
you when this and what really is going
to happen is they're just going to pull
in a bunch of repositories to just do
all the work for you but good that those
repositories might have unit testing to
prove their stable but uh it just takes
the joy out of actually figuring things
out for yourself things have changed a
lot I think github is great and saves a
lot of time with all the plugins of the
jQuery plugins and
stuff like that like select two is a
really cool one for drop-down boxes we
use that where I work but on the other
hand I just feel like you want to get
your hands dirty sometimes not just work
off of plug on it off of plugins and
make those work in a system you know
just like hello can i connect your call
okay okay you're just click your
connecting the wires I kind of want to
be the one that builds the back of that
thing that connects the wires you know
what I mean and to me that's what a
programmer is a programmer is somebody
that wants to know how things work not
somebody that wants to just plug things
together that would be more of a
developer okay well and you can be a
programmer and a developer but I think
there has to be a point where you say
you know which one outweighs the other
which one do I prefer for me its
programming years may be different
hopefully some of what I said makes
sense i know this video's hit in 23
minutes and you guys haven't seen me for
a while i'm not even sure if anyone will
make it to this point of the video so if
you did i will give you an update you
may be asking what happened with your
face well I've been growing a beard just
it's fun it represents a time in my life
and if I do look skinnier I've been
dieting for three months I don't know if
I look skinnier on the camera or not so
I'm down some white even though this is
really about programming and you say
well what's up with this shirt here I
wanted to look like a lumberjack on the
on this video any other news is that i
got the nexus 6p because i had a plus
one plus one the first version yeah it
which has three mics by the way
and it just stopped working i don't know
if it's hardware or software but uh let
me grab this guy over here so here's a
the nexus 6p it's in a case right now
and it's just a beautiful phone so if
it's off oops there's you know the
circle button your skull push it like
this and then it turns on and unlocks it
which is cool I guess that's it guys
I've kind of run out of a lot of I've
just been tired you know we all get
tired and I think I'll watch some boxing
in NBA videos just relax
don't don't give up on your dreams guys
you know there's a guy named les brown
his actual name is Leslie brown but if
you look on youtube for like Les Brown
motivation he'll get you pumped up sorry
about that playing with the drumsticks
he'll get you pumped up all right god
bless you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
