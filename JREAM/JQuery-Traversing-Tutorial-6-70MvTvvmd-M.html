this tutorial we're going to do some
traversing and basically what this means
as I understand is traveling through
elements and to get started just start
with your little document and we'll make
some HTML oops I'm just going to make a
header and unordered list and then just
duplicate these a couple times and I'm
just going to duplicate this once more
so we have a couple things to work on
and if you refresh your page you just
have a bunch of elements like this now
to the fun stuff let's start our script
tags and then let's do our document
ready ok now let's start with a couple
functions I guess the first thing we can
do is each and it'll select each element
inside a ul so let's do you l dot each
and it won't do anything unless we
define something in here so let's make a
function in here oops and um we want to
affect every little element in store
ever UL so let's do this dot CSS
background and let's say red so refresh
and it makes all the unordered list
blocks red I'm going to actually do UL
li so that it does it for every list
item it'll probably look exactly the
same except for the little bullet there
um
and this is a pretty cool because let's
say you wanted to know what number
you're on like this would be 0 1 2 and
you just put the letter I in here and or
it could be any variable and you could
do um let's say this dot append e and
this will put the number after it so
these are 0 1 2 3 4 and so on so you
know what element you're working on and
you wonder well why is that useful well
it kind of just depends on what you're
trying to do let's say you wanted the
background to happen for every single
one except for number two you'd say if E
is not equal to two then we'll give it a
background and refresh and it skips item
number two and basically it's just
manipulating elements to do what we want
there's quite a few other ones that are
better than just doing that you could
say this dot equals 2 dot let's say CSS
background is green and that did not
work this ull i equals 2 i'll do Li ok
so then 2 is green and it doesn't have
to be in this block here either accept
that or just kind of counting things out
within their soil if Li equals 2 it will
still work outside of that little block
um what if you have like a bold tag in
here you could say
li dot has be for the bold tag and let's
just say CSS background is blue and the
reason I'm doing CSS for this chain
method is so that we can see the changes
very obviously okay so this has a bold
tag so it makes it blue and you can do
let's say li da last to select the last
list item and we can say dot CSS
font-weight bolder and the last item on
the list becomes bold now if you wanted
it to happen to each list item you'd
have to add UL before this so forever UL
the last one well I guess that didn't
work UL li last I guess I'm wrong about
that but a traversing it's pretty useful
there's a lot more you can do I just got
to play with it for a little while
alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
