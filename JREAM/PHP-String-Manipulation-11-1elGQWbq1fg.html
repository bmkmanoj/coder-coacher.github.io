dream.com in this tutorial we'll go over
some string manipulation and a string is
a line of text as you know a good thing
to do is get familiar with the PHP
manual now there are just tons and tons
of functions but there's a lot of them
that you're gonna be reusing a lot
throughout your lifetime of doing PHP
and you know it's not really necessary
to beat yourself up over it and try to
remember everything you'll find that
there's a lot that you use over and over
like meta phone I don't even know what
that is I have never used it and
Levenstein I don't know what that means
either so you know don't panic over how
many functions there are but uh for some
string manipulation I might the PHP
manual and I'll go through a couple of
these I'll start with string replace and
when you go to this page you get a
description now it's a good idea to know
what this stuff means right here because
then you'll be able to quickly scan
through it and I'll try to explain that
as easy as possible basically you have a
function okay this is the function it's
in bold and these are parameters between
the Brak the parentheses that you can
use and mix means it can be integer
integer boolean stuff like that
sometimes it'll say int that means it
needs to be an integer there it is right
there but so you start out with your
search and what you want to replace it
with and what the subject is so we do
something like this
we're going to search for line and we're
going to replace line with something and
what are what is the subject the subject
is the black of text we want to replace
so let's just call this subject equals
line of text okay and this will replace
line with something like so so it's
pretty easy to use
you could even place variables in there
say a equals line B equals blah and you
could replace this if it finds the
variable a which is lying inside of the
subject replace it with B blah that
might be a little confusing let's look
for another thing that we'll use time to
time
string length that just gives you the
length of a string pretty simple
echo string length subject and I don't
know that's like 12 hours right string
in a lot of these you'll see like extra
R or an eye for the most part STR stands
for string like so the are often stands
for reverse except in this condition and
the I usually stands for insensitive as
in case insensitive there's a lot of
functions that are just really easy to
use right out of the box like string to
lower subject let me just type something
here
this text is capitalized and that lowers
it and you can do string to upper now
obviously you can do a lot of this with
CSS but in some cases when you're
passing data it's easiest to work with
lower case data so you know you'll want
to use those time to time a string
position string compare there's one
called string string and this one you
kind of use a lot and you start with the
haystack and the needle and it looks for
the needle inside the haystack kind of
like the subject and then what we're
searching for so string string what's
the haystack this is the haystack and
then we're looking for let's say
haystack whoops and there we have
haystack and it returns also the period
what if we do is it should return this
portion of the string there it is I'm
actually not sure why I got the word is
twice anyways no big deal you get the
idea
HTML special cares and entities you'll
use time to time HTML entities and
special characters are pretty similar
really I guess it's just up to you to
play around with a lot of these trims a
good one for example if we have a line
of text with a bunch of spaces
or let's say someone inputted a password
and it was like this and I had a
password with a space at the end you
could just do trim password and that
will trim white space on the left and
right you can do our trim to get whoops
that was a bad word you can you know
just do that there's also something
called print F which is print format
this has a lot of things in it I don't
find myself using it much because I kind
of prefer to use a template engine to
format my text and just plain HTML but
so string manipulation you know you'll
find places when you need to mess with
things it's kind of a real quick and
plain tutorial hope it gives you a
little idea how to mess with strings I
think in our next tutorial we'll try to
make something so that you feel like
you're not just learning functions only
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
