we're going to learn the switch
statement and the ternary operator if
you remember an if statement is like
this if 10 is greater than one echo true
else echo false and by the way when you
just do true and false these return
boolean values so we should get a 1 okay
anyways a ternary operator is a lot the
same you start out with a variable so
let's just say H equals okay and this is
the thing that evaluates so evaluates ?
if that's true or if it's false so that
might look a little confusing if I put
that in my if statement we could put
evaluates here's the true and here's the
false okay it looks just like this so we
would do it kind of like this let's say
if 10 is greater than one ? say true
else false and this is something that
you should probably note down you don't
need to really memorize it right now off
the bat
but it'd be good to take a note and
remember it for later because you're
going to find it pretty convenient so if
we echo age we should get true there we
go that's pretty easy now I know the
question mark in the colon seemed a
little confusing like sometimes when i
first tried to remember it i'd always
get the colon and ? mixed up just
remember like in the urls like we do a
request it always first starts with a
question mark and further variables are
done with the and signed like that sorry
for the typos so you know this isn't
something you really need to be too
worried about a memorizing but just jot
it down the switch statement is similar
to an if statement if something let's
just say if 10 is greater than one echo
true okay now switch statement looks
like this switch like that a lot like an
if statement inside the switch thing is
the thing that we're going to run
comparisons on so you do let's just say
age make a variable age equals 10 and
this has a bunch of cases so you do case
10 and you can do the result here like
echo 10 you can do case 12 echo 12 case
dog echo dog and for example if we run
this we get whoops we get
10 12 and dog and that is probably
because we didn't break it and so it
goes is case 10 true is case 12 true is
case dog true here's what happens if we
break it on 12 sorry it'll stop there so
you want to break these break so we're
switching 10 really um this shouldn't be
giving us 12 I'm not exactly sure why it
did that there we go i guess you have to
put those you have to put the values in
quotes for this so sorry for the
confusion now if we don't break it
unlike an if statement if something
matches like if h equals 10 echo 10
elsif age equals E or let's just say if
else of 10 equals 10 echo yeah you see
will get 10 but once one if item happens
it stops the rest of the results so no
else if is applied with a switch
statement you can do more things if you
want e you just remove the break
statement like so so let's say if case
10 okay you could do something like that
if probably allows the example but
there's also a default value so let's
say you have case equals 15 we're not
going to get anything back
and then there's a default which is if
none of the cases are true usually you
put that at the end and you'll get the
default value so why would you use a
switch instead of an if statement in my
opinion it's a lot cleaner it's a little
more flexible and most of the time when
I do switch statements I actually have a
break after every case most of the time
sometimes you don't depending on what
you're trying to do but just getting
familiar with some of these concepts
will kind of refresh your memory later
when you're programming and I hope that
helps good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
