hey guys what's up I'm going to show you
how to install Zen framework in Windows
using a lamp and here's my WAMP up here
so what I did was I first went to
downloads latest release and I got the
minimal package and that has everything
I need so I have it right here unzipped
and inside of it I have a library that's
most of what we'll be using all this
crap and the bin and the zfb 80 file so
I'm going to open up my Windows Explorer
and go to F Drive lamp and this is where
I want to put my Zen framework I'm going
to put mine in bin PHP right here I
don't know why it might doesn't matter
to me and I'll make a new folder and
call this Zend framework and go in here
and open this folder up I'm just going
to put all this stuff in here okay and I
can go ahead and delete this
so what we have to do is make our PHP
include path always know where sign
framework is that way we only need one
copy on our entire workstation so I'll
go to pH php.ini and ctrl F to find and
I'm going to look for include path okay
there it is right here and I'll delete
this and I'm going to do get the address
up here copy and paste
I might actually have to include
/library
I think so I'll do /library I'm not
certain about that actually at the
moment close that and what we want to do
is make it so these end we can use this
from the command line right here so I'm
going to right click my computer and go
to properties and advanced system
settings
and go to your advance tab right up at
the top and we're going to edit an
environment variable and down on this
little box under path I'm going to edit
and I want to get this address right
here I'll go to the end of this
semicolon and paste cool okay okay okay
and to test it out I'm going to open up
Windows PowerShell and just type in the
word or letter ZF and that means it
knows it's there so I'll leave that open
at the moment what we got to do is
configure Apache so that it knows how to
run a thing so I'm going to create a new
Zen framework project I'll just go to CD
so I'm an F Drive and I'll go to my
workspace and I'll do a ZF create
project I'll call this Zen D
and if you have PHP you install you
won't get that message so I can go down
to work space is ND and we have all this
stuff in here and pretty good public is
the folder in which will display the
front of your website so this is the
only thing the website will be able to
access all these things over here this
can't be accessed from a browser okay so
it makes it more secure and to do this
we are going to edit our Apache HTTP D
config and we're just going to make a
virtual host and I already have some of
these typed out basically it looks like
HTML tabs virtual host and one two seven
is how I like to do it okay like that
now if you don't have any entries like
this in here make sure up at the top you
have this name virtual host above your
listings and I'm going to make my
document route will be this directory
document roots okay and don't get your
drive letters confused make sure you
have the exact correct path and I'm
going to call my server name is n D and
now we're going to specify the directory
and I'm just going to paste that same
thing in there and and that and I'm just
going to copy all this stuff here you
can pause the video and write all this
out and I think that'll be good and I'll
save close okay the last step windows
folder this parts a little confusing if
you've never done it I'm going to go to
system 32 drivers et Cie and the hosts
file
and I'll just open this up with notepad
and we're going to bind these nd virtual
hosts to this so Zen D save and close
and lastly I'm going to restart all
services and up here let's go to Zen D
right here and here we have it welcome
to Zen frame or fisher's your projects
main page and that's pretty much it
where my F Drive workspace is nd the
library here is empty but it's really
using the included files from our PHP
include path there are a little bit
different configurations you can do but
this is just a quick start to get going
and thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
