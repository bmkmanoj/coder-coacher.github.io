so let's first do use learning and let's
insert some data let's say int whoops
insert into post let me make sure that's
the right name post okay
and I'm going to do title and content
and assign user okay values we did these
in the last tutorial so we're just gonna
put it in a bunch of data item blah blah
and I'll say one okay and I'm just gonna
copy paste this a couple times call this
item two three and let's do four execute
okay and in our post if we go to the
data we have these here now select I
select and this is where all the power
is well a lot of power so back to used
learning and a select statement we start
with the word select and this one's may
be a little tricky kay so first we have
to do select something from a place and
that's the minimum you have to do for
select so first let's select something
let's select ID from what was it post
there we go and let's hit play okay
and we can see down here we got all the
IDS from posts what if I wanted to get
the title select title from posts give
us something Tyler everyone that's cool
and we can bundle these together if we
just wanted the ID in the title you just
use a comma easy peasy
and you could also do content as well
and we have these that are returned if
you wanted to use an asterisk you could
most people say you shouldn't do this
for various reasons and that will grab
all these now you see where it says
assigned user we have one that says to
what if we wanted to select the field
the fields that were assigned to use are
to only that's where the cool stuff
comes in I'm gonna just leave this
asterisks here which is select all for
now and I'm going to say where where
what the way I like to type them is like
this hit a tab a tab space over so we
want to select all from posts where
assign user equals to like that and
execute and there we have it let's get
rid of the where statement so we can
play around a little bit more
let's select from posts where title
equals
item and we'll get one okay and will do
and assign user equals two okay and if
we hit play it's not going to give us it
because there is a field with the title
called item and there is a field with a
user assigned to however both of these
have to be true in order to return a row
if I wanted to return the rows that have
this or this then I would use the or
statement I'll say play so now we have
the assigned user here on this condition
it's selecting it and up here or the
title is item on that condition it's
selecting it I'll show you a couple more
let's get rid of this where statement
and back to this and I'll just hit play
there's a couple other ones you can do
limit and how many do we want if we're
select them all let's say limit for
execute in a limit for pretty cool you
can do order by and you type order by
what do we want to order it by let's
order by the title and this will order
alphabetically whoops
order by has to go above limit execute
and we're ordering it by the title let's
order it by the ID okay one two three
four let's do it descending play and you
can do it in reverse order so we're
limited to four and we're selecting them
that way I think it'll be a few
tutorials until we understand a lot of
how select works but this is a good
start and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
