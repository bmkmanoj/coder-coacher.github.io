story we're gonna look at these little
graphs and charts and stuff just a
couple of them mostly just these bar
ones because that's those are the ones
we can play with so I'm just gonna drag
a square here and it gives me this thing
like a excel file and just put in some
numbers and these will be the sizes of
your little things then you can just
close that I'm going to make one more
and just do a bar graph and to do three
3 four 4 five 5 just make some random
numbers up and you'll notice that if you
double click this you can't get inside
of it because it's a graph object and
they're dynamic meaning you can
right-click it and go to data and you
can add more stuff like that and you
probably want to keep it that way
but you also don't want it to look so
plain so what you do is you'd make an
object I select this gradient a little
earlier and I have the light color at
the top here and what you do is you go
to object graph design and just click
new design I'm going to rename mine to
fire and click OK and I'm gonna do it on
this graph down here I'm gonna right
click this graph and go to column I'm
gonna select fire and click OK and you
see ads these the design we had there
and that's pretty cool now how about if
we had something like this what's pretty
cool about this and actually kind of
trick is you can use different things
than just a color what if we had an
object where we had a star at the top
like so and then we had a bar let's make
a bar real quick like so send that to
the back and I'm going to get rid of the
stroke on
okay and I'll group this together I'm
going to go to object graphs design and
click new and just so I know what it is
I'm gonna say star and if we go to here
we go to column and select star and
click OK and you can do that and you're
probably thinking well this looks really
stupid because the stars keep getting
messed up what you have to do is create
a guide so the illustrator knows where
you want to stretch it it's just
assuming you want to stretch the whole
thing if you go back to column they have
a couple of settings here uniformly
scale the repeating and you can click OK
oops and this one looks good but it
makes it fatter just like if you held
shift and made it bigger like this if
you only want it to scale up and down in
retains position make a little line
where you want to scale it I want to do
it on this red part here and that I'm
going to go to view guides make guide or
ctrl + v and that makes this little line
there and then select this and press
ctrl G to group it again so that should
be one object and then what you do is go
back to object graph design and make a
new one I'm gonna rename this to star -
okay okay and back to this grid let's
see back to column and let's select star
- if you click OK
it doesn't do anything yet but you see
these lines here that's where it's
supposed to scale and what we're going
to do is change a setting in here and
select sliding we want to slide and
there we have it
it stretches based on these red lines so
if that's pretty cool I'm not sure when
or if you'll need grids but it's just
kind of a fun little thing to know how
to do if you ever do
there's also pie charts and you can't
use column
or a pie chart let's say twenty-two and
couple numbers in here okay so I got a
pie chart here and I can go to column
star okay
and it doesn't look like it does
anything I haven't really monkeyed with
these at all I kind of prefer to make
them by hand if I have to make one
anyways thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
