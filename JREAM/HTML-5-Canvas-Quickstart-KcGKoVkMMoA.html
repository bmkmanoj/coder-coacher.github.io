to show you a little bit about html5
canvas and what I have here is just a
html5 document declaration and I have a
canvas here and I give it the idea of
draw and that's so we can grab it
through JavaScript I'm using prototype
in here you could use jQuery if you want
it or none no framework at all I'm only
using that just to use the selector and
I have a custom JavaScript file which
I'll be typing my code in the way I have
a black border around my canvas because
you won't have that unless you define it
in your CSS as I did order 1 pixel black
solid and I just helped you know it's
there so the first thing we have to do
is assign a variable to the canvas well
we don't necessarily have to I could
just go var context equals draw dot get
context 2d and what we do is I want to
move my cursor let's say 50 pixels over
and 50 pixels down we do contexts top
move to 5050 okay and we're going to
draw a line now I'll draw it about over
to here where my mouse is so I'm gonna
say context top line to that's about 450
X and about 70 Y basically that took it
from point 50 50 and it's going over to
450 on X and then down to 70 on Y and I
have to call stroke context stroke
refresh and we have a beautiful line
so the line and other things have a lot
of sentence we can add in there let's
say we want to add the line width equals
12 it's kind of pop in context and if I
want to change the color I could say
contacts dot stroke style equals red
save that refresh oops I typed this
wrong line width
it's camel case sensitive and that's
just a basic line you know nothing too
fancy if we wanted to draw something
else let's say a circle I could say
context arc and I want this one to start
I'm gonna say about 200 by 250 okay and
the radius I'll say 50 that's about the
size we're gonna use I don't exactly
remember what this argument is sorry and
now we do the math stuff I'll say 2
times math pie and then I'll do the
context stroke and refresh and we have a
line attached to it and I didn't want
that so I have to clear the new path and
say context dot begin path refresh there
we go
and we could change our settings you see
it inherits the stroke style we set up
here because you know it's just like all
one page I'll say context the stroke
style equal blue and we can do a fill
context that fill style equals green and
if I save it here it's not gonna fill
because you see when we set a stroke
style we still have to call stroke so I
except to say context fill refresh boom
there's our green circle now a good idea
to know all these little commands here
would look to to do would be to look for
a canvas cheat sheet just look for
something like that on Google and print
it up and that'll tell you all these
little things I'm typing in now the
magic happens in JavaScript where we can
do loops and everything and make things
appear how we want so let me show you an
example I'm gonna do a for loop I'll say
var I equals 0 I is less than 20 hi plus
a plus this is just a basic for loop and
I'm gonna do a new context begin path
and I'm going to draw a line what I want
to do is put my cursor I guess at the
corner so I'll say context stop move to
0 0
context line width equals one I guess
and context stroke style equals black
and context stop stroke
now I didn't move my line yet so let me
do that context line - I'll say 200 over
and pen down so refresh now this
obviously didn't do a lot what we're
going to do is change the variable in
the loop so it draws downward so I have
to change the Y value and that would be
this one so I'll say 10 plus I let's see
how that looks
refresh that looks kind of funny I want
to do 10 plus I times 2 refresh
not too bad what about it for there we
go we can space it out a little more and
I mean this isn't like that amazing but
you could do some pretty cool stuff
let's try adding some text
let's do context
fill text and we type in our text here
I'll say hey mommy and our XY
coordinates I'll say 300 over and 150
down and refresh and it says hey mommy
and it's just inheriting whatever we did
we could change the stuff in here like
context that font equals 15 pixels Arial
refresh and we can change our font there
I'm going to change the color I'll say
context up stroke style actually that's
the fill style for the font L style
equals purple
contact stop Phil refresh hey mommy
I'm not sure if we need this dot fill
here or not let's see I guess not it's
like popped in through here okay
also what we're going to do is a little
linear gradient and to do that we can
change the fill style and let's say fill
style I'm going to say var of great grad
for gradient context dot great linear is
it L 1 year gradient and the point I
want to start it and the point I want to
end with I think this is XY 2 X Y I'm
not sure if it's based on the shape or
the whole canvas I'll just try 0 0 to
500 500 or we had a 500 300 and we'll do
grad add color stop and this will be the
first color I'll say red the second
color will be
purple and fill style instead of just
this color I'll do cred refresh and that
looks like it's pretty red there what if
I did
250 it's getting a little closer
okay I'm not sure about where this
positioning works exactly sorry about
that
but uh I can almost see it yeah 350 to
200 see a great in there maybe if I do a
different color I'll do black to purple
there we go
you can see a little bit of a gradient
there why would you want to do this I
don't know exactly but maybe eventually
I'll show you how to build a little
movable thing in here you can also put
images in here which is pretty nice
this would be a great place to make a
game in JavaScript inside a canvas so I
think that about sums it up thanks for
watching guys and give me a thumbs up if
you liked it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
