stuff I don't want to see and it just
distracts me and I want to hide it now
one way to do it my brother showed me is
I can hover over a video and click this
little drop down and say not interested
tell us why and I'm not interested in
Justin Bieber VEVO so submit so then it
would kind of change but all this stuff
still shows up the easiest solution i
found is to download tamper monkey as a
Chrome extension so let's just say this
guy here the little stable one and we
can go to view details if you want to
know more about it in the chrome store
it's rated extremely high probably one
of the highest okay add the extension ok
so it's there and it'll open this window
once and it tries to scare you with this
so I wouldn't install somebody else's
scripts it's pretty easy to use if you
know how to write a little bit of code
so i want to hide pretty much everything
so this is a blank page so what i would
do for the common user let's right click
and go to inspect ok so it opens up this
and then you got this crazy-looking box
down here but i'm going to click this
select an element on the left your bar
might show up on the top left so it
might be docked to the side over here
it's really the same thing you can dock
it to the bottom so i'm just going to
select like this and if you look at the
bottom here there's a little feed and it
looks like we have this guy that will
not
change you see this section lists
probably really hard to see on your
screen but I think I can zoom in the
font ok 1939 57 that looks like it's
likely to change so I would just go up
the tree lips to feed ok so what I want
to hide is the div ID of feed and I can
test that out by just going to the
console and we're going to do some ECMO
5 JavaScript so document dot get element
by ID enter and I'll just put in fee
make sure you don't put in the hashtag
it's not like jQuery like that and then
style dot display equals none ok so that
hides it all but I want to make it
permanent so I'll press up and i'll copy
what i just wrote hiding something is
not malicious all right so i'll click
tamper monkey and i will add a new
script and here I'll just paste that in
and I will press save and then it says
no user script and it knows to do it on
youtube so if i go to youtube and
refresh the page i can close this box it
just takes a second and then it hides it
because it's JavaScript it waits for the
Dom to be loaded but that's cool and you
could probably use that to hide jump
from other sites now that you know you
might use adblock plus or go sory for
privacy stuff ghoster is pretty cool but
sometimes it can disable certain things
but it's good if you like to not be
tracked
everywhere you browse and if you're
wondering this is last pass this guy
here is honey that finds coupons and
then sumo me is if you're a developer
just some other stuff but that does it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
