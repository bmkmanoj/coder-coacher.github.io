if statement and setting some variables
what I'm going to do now are called
loops and right here a loop is something
that repeats itself this is like in
every programming language and it
shouldn't be anything new so the first
one will do is a for loop okay you
remember our if statement in the last
tutorial we did it kind of like this if
whatever is in these parentheses is true
then we're going to execute this code
and the for loop is just like that so
for what first we're going to set a
value i'll say i equals 1 and a
semicolon and I is less than 10 and I
post increment okay and I'll explain
this so we're starting with a value
where i is equal to 1 and when I is less
than 10 we're going to go through this
loop and then we're going to increment
it ok so I can do let's say document dot
write I and refresh and we get one
through nine let me concoct innate this
with a line break and there's one
through nine you can also these are just
math operators there's a ton of these
you know less than greater than equals
i'm going to do less than or equal to
and one through ten not too tricky now
in a loop you can do more than just one
thing we can do anything these little
brackets here so what if i wanted to
only display numbers that are even okay
to do that i would use something called
modulus so I'd say if
and I prefer to write out my structure
syntax before I do the little formula so
if what if I modulus 2 equals 0 I'll
explain this and we get 2 4 6 8 10 and
you might think what does that mean the
way that works is it's pretty simple
let's pick a number 88 / 2 equals 4 well
modulus what that does is it grabs the
decimal and so if I did let's say seven
divided by 2 equals 3.5 it's grabbing
this digit here after the decimal so
it's five so a 7/2 is the modulus is
five and that does not equal zero but if
we grab a even number let's say six
divided by two it gives us three and as
you know a whole number has a decimal
point two zero and that's how that works
there's also a while loops and we can
just do while and as long as the
condition in here is true we'll do it so
I'll say while x is what is less than
let's say 10 again I will do document
dot write x concoct innate BR
and a problem we're going to have here
is that a while loop can be a little
more dangerous because it could never
end I'll refresh this and I guess the
browser won't let me abuse it but what
we want to do is end this loop so i'm
going to say x + + refresh while x is
less than 10 oh we didn't even set x x
equals 0 refresh okay so x is at zero
right here and while x is less than 10
we're going to write out the number and
every time it goes through the loop we
increment it once if we get rid of this
it's going to go on forever so you see
on my browsers crashing better refresh
oh boy it did not like this okay okay so
we have a couple loops here there's also
another way to do the for loop if you're
familiar with PHP it's for a raise it
looks like that but it's just the for
loop and I'm not going to do that now
because arrays are another topic and I
think this is a good start with loops
your are going to use loops like let's
say if you have to select ten elements
you could do document get element by ID
and something like that just for a quick
example and alright guys thanks for
