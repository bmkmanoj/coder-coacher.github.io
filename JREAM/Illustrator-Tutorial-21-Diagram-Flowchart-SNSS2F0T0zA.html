tutorial we're going to make a diagram
so let's just make a square I have a
stroke of 3 on here I'll just put it
down to 1 so you have your square right
and when you make a diagram you want
your text to be in the middle so what
you're going to want to do is draw a
square inside here now you see how I
have the square dotted outline you want
to make sure you have that because if
you have the circle here you're going to
end up drawing on that path there so
make sure you have that square then just
put some text in there and then let's
resize it to this box size and the way I
got this in the center was I went to
character and I just added this little
shifting thing here and try to get that
centered and then just make sure your
paragraph here centered okay so let's
just call this some page for example and
I'll select this and I hit ctrl g + ctrl
G is group right there so now if I drag
this I move it all and let's hold alt so
and drag this so we'll get a copy of it
and let's make a line okay and then for
the border I'm going to do it black then
go up to stroke and for the arrowheads
at the end we want this on the right
side I'm just going to pick arrow number
7 and you can change the scale whatever
size you want I kind of like mine about
that size and okay and then just double
click oh you could just choose the text
tool and change this and let's call this
HTML and then I'm just going to select
these two and alt drag again
and then I'm going to flip this arrow
sideways and then we can put it down
like that whoops
and I'll call this one CSS and I'll do
one more
whoops this will just do it this way
images okay so you could make a nice
little chart by doing this and it's
pretty easy in Adobe Illustrator alright
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
