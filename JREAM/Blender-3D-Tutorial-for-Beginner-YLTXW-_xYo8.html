neighbors this will be a tutorial on
getting started with blender 2.5 for
beginners and it's free it's written in
Python so when you first open this it's
really confusing how you move around and
what you're doing so I'm gonna go really
slow through this on purpose to start
out let's use the mouse you can hold
down your scroll button and then you can
rotate in 3d space you can zoom in and
out obviously and you can also hold
shift and press the mouse wheel down to
pan so those you'll need to get used to
I'm gonna put a link with some of the
common hotkeys in the description that
you should practice so when working in
3d we need a bunch of different views so
we can do stuff the best and right now
we're in user perspective if you look up
here and what we want to do is let's say
we wanted to go to the top view what we
would do is on your keyboard your numpad
you have you know seven eight nine four
five six all those numbers think of it
in terms of a shape the number seven
would be top so I'll press seven and I
get a top perspective view okay the
number one is the front and the number
three is the right
okay so it's kind of like an l-shape
seven one and three just to flip through
those views real quick
the other numbers four six eight and two
those are kind of like arrow keys your
keyboard might have them written on it
but at any time you press those you'll
see your thing just kind of rotate
around numbers eight four six and two
and if you want to get back to a certain
view you press like let's say seven to
go to the top okay so one of the
confusing things is weren't perspective
motor right now so let me go to let's
say the front and you see this is
supposed to be flat but there's a
difference between a perspective and
what they call ortho view so in
perspective let's say I move this we
really want this to be a flat face we
would change the whore thumb mode by
pressing the number five okay and now
we're in the front ortho mode and
basically what that means is this let me
go - I guess front perspective let me
rotate around you see my camera up here
in the corner let me go over here a
little bit okay a perspective view has
this point it starts at and when you
look things kind of expand in the
distance if i zoom out you see this
point here is bigger because it's closer
to us but way back here everything gets
smaller that's a perspective and that's
how we see things in reality ortho view
is still 3d however everything is the
same size because it's I guess you could
use this kind of thinking of age'
empire's game by Microsoft
so use v to toggle between those that's
the money so 7 v just make sure it says
ortho because that's usually what you
want to work in and now for some fun
stuff what we're gonna do is delete this
object and you see it has arrows by it
that just means it's selected right now
so if I drag this arrow it'll move let
me just make sure you're on the same
page with me let's press the number 7
and make sure you've pressed 5 so that
top ortho is there I'm just gonna zoom
in with my mouse wheel then we're gonna
hold shift mouse wheel and move up ok
and what we're gonna do is rotate this
cube so I'm gonna press the letter G or
sorry this is to move it and I press the
letter G and now I have it just hanging
out with me I can just click and drop it
G and it'll move not too hard I'm gonna
make another item and this is an
important hotkey it's to create it's a
create menu now you can go up here and
press add and add anything here you want
but it's better to get used to the
hotkeys so press shift a and now we have
it here and I'm just gonna make another
cube ok and since that's not where I
want it I'm gonna press G
move it here and we're gonna use another
tool called rotate and that's the letter
R and you just press R and drag around
click and let go
another one is scale so the letter S and
look at that
and you might be saying well this
doesn't scale exactly how I want and I'm
gonna show you how to do that so I'm
gonna press delete and click this to
delete it so let me select this item
oops
so what I'm gonna do is right click
oops this to get it selected and it has
that little border around it so I'm
gonna press the letter S okay and it's
scaling right now and we have a X Y and
a Z access okay if you look at the
bottom right I'm just gonna click down
here right now what we're working on is
the Y in the x-axis and if I want to
scale according to one of these so I can
do is press the letter S it's scaling on
x and y but if I only want to scale on
why I press the letter Y okay so now I
can scale on the y axis and let's say I
press s and X and I can scale on the x
axis
same with rotate if I press R I can
press X and now this will only rotate on
the x axis if I press Y it only does it
on the y axis okay now you can you can
do it on two axes as well and to do so
it's a little confusing but you press
like let's say s for scale and I want to
do it on the both axes of X
and there it goes so that you can do
shift X Y Z or just x y&amp;amp;z okay so I'm
gonna press the number one go to front
ortho well just I guess see what we're
working with move this around and lastly
what we're gonna do is look at the
properties tool so let's create a new
object with shift a and I'm gonna create
a let's see cylinder and I'll move this
up move this over here and we're gonna
press the letter N okay and this opens
up this panel up here and if you want
you can transform things little by
little with these little numpads
values and stuff you could rotate it
manually here I guess you can drag this
if you want
looks a little sensitive and that's just
stuff you can do if you want do it that
way so I'll press n to hide that and
this panel here you're not always gonna
need this open and that's letter T okay
T and G okay so I'm gonna press the HOME
key now and then the number five and now
I'm back in front perspective and I
think that's a decent intro to this in
the description I'll have a link for
some of the hotkeys and just practice
with those and you'll get more
comfortable it's really difficult at
first
thanks for watching and give me a thumbs
up if you think it's halfway decent bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
