a bike-a-thon package he'll make writing
Docs really nice I was introduced by
this by Mathew fabu I'll link you to his
github in the description if you want to
know more about this gentleman so let's
get started you need pip installed every
Python user should know how to do that
I'm in projects I would do pip install
MK Docs I already have it installed no
need to do anything else I'll type MK
Docs
boom help new build serve we want to
make some new ones so MK Doc's new and
I'm gonna call this P OTW for package of
the week okay
and it made a folder so CD into the
folder and LS and I'm gonna sublime this
up so sublime period and run it in the
background so I can still run more
commands and windows so here we have
Doc's and a llamo file just for fun
let's just change this to package of the
week let's make a new markdown file
about okay there we go and let's save
this as about that MD so right now it
doesn't do anything we have a couple of
options I can open up the terminal and I
can say m'kay Doc's
build or it can also do em cats serve
which will run a little mini server at a
URL to immediately preview it and when
it gets updated it will change it so
let's go there okay so here's the about
page and you see about category to
conclusion and it makes a nice little
list on the side so knowing that it's
marked down you can just dump all your
code in here for snippets and stuff I'll
refresh and there's a big code snippet
and this can be used as an actual site
because it renders it down to a site
with pages fonts image guests and
obviously it's using bootstrap
so what more can we do well you see the
site name appears here this is meant to
be simple let's take a look at the yml
file
this stands for Gamal let's do a repo
URL and I'm just gonna list my site boom
like that it rebuilds refresh top right
there's a link all of this is in their
documentation by the way and let's do
some pages let's create another one
let's call this databases because it
gets cooler and I'll just say this has
databases dot markdown I'll refresh and
there's databases about and I can click
this to go to the home page so what more
can we do
it seems like we'd run out of space here
well we can do a drop-down let's do it
let's categorize things let's make a
folder called config devs for developers
so I have a config folder and a dev
folder so inside of devs I'm just gonna
say API keys API - keys stop markdown
let me go here and cancel this out CD in
the docs move databases into devs
how about config alright so go back down
and now let's try running make Doc's
surf and refresh and what you notice is
it has this name space almost PHP like
config databases in order to get this to
behave how we want categorized we
actually have to customize the ammo file
and it's super easy so let's go to MK -
yamo and we start with something called
pages it's plural first let's make sure
we have our home page do not forget this
and next stop markdown will be home and
the next will be the and in between
these guys let's put in the confit and
the devs so how do we get to the config
it's linked from this relative Doc's
folder so it'd be config slash databases
MD and the category is config and you
could call this something else if you
want it this is further display and then
this is the name display okay
so I'll save that and I'll refresh and
you see how a displace config and it
displays databases and it goes to that
markdown file it's beautiful and another
thing we can toss on as a theme there's
a list of a couple of them so I'll just
toss on Yeti refresh and you see we have
a different theme so all this stuff is
pretty easy to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
