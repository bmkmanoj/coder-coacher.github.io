change from J to handlebars I looked at
quite a few rendering engines and it
seems handlebars is probably one of the
preferred ones ejs it doesn't appear to
allow layouts and that's something we
really want you see we have our layout
Jade here it looks pretty weird but the
first thing we'll do is that NPM install
so I totally forgot the package name
that's Express stash handlebars now
remember when we install the software
with the flag option if I type Express -
- help here it is - HBS but I think this
will be good learning just to know how
to do this so inside our app let me just
we have our package JSON just remember
this isn't the lowest level here I'm
gonna remove solo Express because we're
not doing that and I'm gonna CD into app
mm-hmm and I'm gonna do NPM install
Express handlebars - - Save
okay and I want to do cats package Jason
just see what's in there okay that's
Version three and what we have to do is
set this guy up in our app dot J s boy I
have so many sub windows open and what
we do is we'll just do it under here
we'll save our Express HB s equals
require express handlebars like that
okay and now we customize some of this
good stuff so this sets the views
directory that's perfectly fine we can
leave it there and then the engine we're
gonna change
so first we'll say whoops app dot engine
we're gonna call it handlebars and
that's just the name of it nothing more
and we're going to use the variable we
set here which is Express handlebars and
this is a little function with a object
in it and here we can specify some
things so we'll do a default layout
their github says main we can just do a
main for now and then our view engine
has to match whatever we set this s so
the view engine has to be handlebars now
by default the extension name is dot
handlebars but I really don't want to
use that I want the extension name to be
HBS so next name will be dot HBS it's a
lot shorter and easier to read since I'm
in sublime I'll just look for a package
and don't know what that is but I'll
install handlebars okay so we have to
rename these to HBS layout has a
Bergeron name to Maine dot HBS I see it
has a little mustache there that's cool
I'm just gonna quickly do that inside
the views and just rename you can do
this manually but if you're on Linux you
can do it this way j2 h BS of all files
forgot my trailing slash and lists it
out okay so we're gonna have to make a
new folder called layouts and probably
another one called partials okay and we
have to move main HBS into layout so
move main HBS into layouts and then for
partials directories we can we have a
default layout we can say partials Derr
Derr name + view / partials and we
probably also want to toss in a layouts
directory and this is if we have more
than one layout let's say the front-end
has a different layout and a back-end we
can do that too I suppose we might want
to put this
let's just put the views down here not
sure if it's gonna matter a whole lot
but so we have the main layout and our
partials okay
layouts der extension name okay and now
this is a lot different how we do stuff
so for our partials let's just create a
new file and I'll just say this as a
header I'm just going to keep it pretty
raw right now
so this will be header is I'll close him
make a new file I'll just say footer and
footer dot HBS okay and then in our
layouts okay it's a lot different this
would actually be real HTML markup which
I like more and there's probably a
faster way to copy-paste this but let's
do it real quick a variable
okay the the two guys here that's a
variable then link rel I like double
quotes
okay that would close the head body body
and for this we use three brackets and
we call it body mm and this will include
this will include anything from these
files and we don't have to extend it and
we have to close the HTML tag I'm not
sure why it's not Auto completing by the
HBS isn't registered in sublime to know
hey act as HTML so what we can also do
our blocks if you really wanted to you
could do instead of body you could do
block content like this and but I'm
gonna keep the body here for default and
we can include partials right in this
file there's a couple way to include
partials in here which are kind of funny
you can include it from the actual dude
the file here sorry I'm talking about
extending what I mean is in here or
let's go to index.html in here you don't
have to use extends you can actually
define it in here something like main or
if you had a different one you can also
define it in the JavaScript routes which
I'd probably do it that way so what
we'll do is this is the index let's go
ahead and delete the animal and then the
route for the animal because that was
silly and here basically we just have
our
title so h1 title and then P welcome to
title and I'll just delete all this
stuff and here's our main which just
includes our body the first thing we
want to do before we mess with partials
- just make sure it works so I'm in
views I want to do NPM start hopefully
the engines working refresh and it had a
problem looking up the app views so back
to the app J s so the X name is dot HBS
we called it handlebars we might have to
call this HBS as I've seen in some
examples so I'll rerun this refresh no
such directory app views Oh looks like I
might be forgetting a slash here
okay because this has a comma and this
one we're just appending to it so I'll
try again refresh and there we have him
but then if we went to what they have a
user one see it it has the old stuff so
what we want to do is now fix the
partials since this knows where the
partials are I'm gonna assume that this
layout will know to get the header in
the footer so we go like this the braces
and we just say header and here we say
footer okay and we'll reload this guy
refresh and there's the header and the
footer includes beautiful then if we
went to the error page we can get rid of
this we say h1 message
and age to air status and then our pre
tag and we'll say air dot
stack now if this is a bunch of
variables or Jason it might print out
funny but I won't worry about that for
right now
okay so error is done and then dashboard
is just gonna be pretty much the same as
index okay and that will fix that got a
reload this guy so we should be able to
go to dashboard okay welcome to
dashboard good and this way we can use
more stuff that we're used to so I'm
gonna go down here and I just went to
bootstrap cbn.com I'll copy the latest
CSS for bootstrap I guess I'll duplicate
this paste them here and always do the
forward slashes like that okay and go
down here oops we got to reload I'm sure
there's a way to automatically reload on
save like gulp used to do now people use
webpack a lot so you see the font
changed now we're using bootstrap we
could probably just toss in the j/s up
here people like to put it at the footer
down here so I'll just say script SRC
equals slash slash that restart reload
refresh and the j/s loaded I have my
network open you just press control
shift I refresh and make sure that it
loads closest console right there
so there's bootstrap Minjae s it looks
like this has jQuery in it as well since
it relies heavily on it so this video is
getting pretty long will probably style
it up at some point but that's
handlebars and you can scroll through
the github of express handlebars and
they have a lot of stuff caching and a
bunch of things like that so at some
point what I want to do which I could
probably just do before we end this
video is to go to our views and I want
to make adder called dashboard and I
want to move dashboard HPS into
dashboard ok CD into dashboard and move
this I could call it index but if I do
when I look for files and I look for
index it's gonna list to index to HBS's
so sometimes I like to name this as the
same name so our route would change and
routes dashboard to dashboard slash
dashboard there's also the option of I
believe passing a layout and if you had
one called
dashboard you could pass it in there too
or you could have dashboard extend it in
the view it's really up to you how you
like it but we're not there yet
I can go ahead and close some of these
guys out close him and I want to make
sure that this route works so lastly
we'll just do NPM start
and I want to refresh go to dashboard
and there it is all right we're done
with that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
