in this tutorial we're going to do a
little bit of JSON and that stands for
JavaScript object notation if you go to
jason org you'll see kind of how it
looks it might look a little confusing
right now but when we type it out
hopefully it'll make sense with all
these little shapes and stuff okay so
anyways I'm going to be using a database
for one of these examples so what you're
going to want to do is just go to my
site and then go to lab and go to
open-source you don't have to do this
but I'm just gonna in the mysqli class
and I'll just grab this and in my file
I'll just paste it in there and I'm
going to make a new folder and call it
libs
and I'll just call this my sqli dot
class dot PHP okay so we have that and
we have our basic document here with
jQuery included the document dot ready
and below there's not really anything ok
so the first thing we're going to do is
just load the JSON value values but well
let's see let's just first create a div
ID equals content and let's do a dot get
jason okay this is what we're going to
use and we specify the page and let's
just call this load jason dot PHP and
the callback function
and we want to put the JSON data inside
content okay we'll just leave it like
that for now now I'm going to make a new
file and I'm going to call this one load
json dot PHP and in this file we're
going to include libs mysqli dot class
dot PHP and we'll just set up the
configuration array so I'll say config
equals array config if you have a
different way of doing your MySQL or
connection go ahead and do it that way
and see
okay host user past table roots no
password and I'll create a table called
jQuery
and I'll just do DB equals new DB config
and DB query and D me again okay let me
create the table I'm just gonna do it in
PHP myadmin and I'll call it jQuery and
I'll create a table I'll just call it
pages with three fields field one I'll
just make an integer auto increment and
the primary index the second one I'll
call title and the third one I'll call
content and for this just var care 255
and I'll just go with that
sorry I'll save it okay so we have this
structure pretty simple I'm going to
insert just a couple things in it I'll
say Jesse test content Joe test content
okay so we browse and here's what we
have just a simple table I can close
that so we had this now we're going to
say select star from pages and we want
to output DB get I'm going to reload
this file so I can get the colors
working there we go so on index we're
just doing load JSON and let's also do a
little log let's just say div class
equals log and we'll say that log HTML
and just say thing was called just so we
know that it's doing something so
refresh and let's see workspace jQuery
what'd I do wrong here alright so what
we need to do is encode the output as
JSON so JSON encode and let's go to load
Jason dot PHP and this is how it comes
out these square brackets are in our in
an array and this would be the first
item and this would be the second item
in these little squiggly brackets and
then this is like the key the value p
value and it's separated by a comma it
might look a little confusing but I
guess you'll have to play with it so how
do we type this out it's a little tricky
because if you don't get it right in
here it's not even going to show up at
all so what we want to do first is we're
playing with the data JSON object which
is this above so for data we want to
let's just say if we want to write test
content we would say these little
brackets and I'll do a row then I'll do
dot and what do I want
content try to remember that this is
getting the mysqli number rows and the
associative array if you return it as
only an associative array it might be
easier to read okay so I'll go back to
this page there we go test content okay
you could say what or let me add this
data zero dot title and okay and then we
have the Jesse and test content and
that's right here right when the page
loads okay
this tutorial is actually taking a
little longer to explain than I thought
so I'm gonna I think I might stop in
just a second
hopefully that gives you a good idea
alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
