do something a little different and
learn to connect to the Facebook API and
to do so you would go to developers
facebook.com obviously you need an
account and you sign up for a developer
account once that's good it's free by
the way you would go to my apps and
we're going to set up a new app in the
top right and I'm going to call mine
Jesse test agree create app okay and I
have to just type in some CAPTCHA code
note II can't 211 submit and we have a
now this might look a little scary but
don't be scared we really for now to
test it we only need to go to the
website and update the URL here and I'm
going to use a test URL and I'll just
say F banner comm slash test now make
sure you end this with a forward slash
okay and the site domain is just for if
you have subdomains it's always a good
idea to type that in and that's all you
need to do and save it next I'm going to
go over to Google and just do a search
for Facebook PHP SDK and it's the one a
github this is the official PHP SDK so
I'll go ahead and download this download
the zip
and that's good I can open this and what
I want to do is put this in my desktop
I'm just going to make a new folder okay
nothing in it right now and in the PHP
SDK zip file all I want is are these two
files in the source so I'll copy that
over go back now you can look at
examples or example if you want I'm
going to go through it myself to try to
help you know what's going on I'm going
to create a libs folder new folder
called libs elders pop these in there
okay and I'm going to make the index
file new text document will be index dot
PHP okay and remember how we set our URL
if I go to edit settings website mine's
at F banner comm slash test obviously
you have to own the URL you're working
on and I already have an FTP in here in
a test folder and what I'm going to do
is just copy this over I can close that
okay and I'm going to view/edit of
index.php and we'll just start with a
simple thing here HTML HTML
head body body okay and I'll just call
this title is test and what we need to
do is first include the PHP SDK and I
guess I'll just put mine here now
remember I put it in the libs folder so
I'll say include libs Facebook dot PHP
and I guess I could put that on one line
I'll save that and if I were to go to F
banner com slash test I don't have
anything right now
no big deal what we need to do is be
able to allow a user who has a Facebook
account to log in and to do so well I'm
going to stretch this down we first need
to instantiate the Facebook object I'll
say Facebook equals new Facebook now it
doesn't end there so here we go we're
going to put an array in here and it
takes a bunch of values
the first one is app ID now you can see
this in the example file if you want to
just do it that way and copy/paste it
there's the secret
there is cookie I'll say true
now there's other permissions and stuff
you can put in here but I'm just going
to do it this way the simple way and
what we have to do is go to our Facebook
and right here we have our application
ID I can copy this pop it in here and
secret and pop it in here obviously you
don't want to give anyone this
information but I'm just doing this for
an example and I'm going to delete this
afterwards so this creates an instance
of how to handle all the code in the
Facebook API and what we're trying to do
is get a session of the user that's
logged in and this is just like in the
example file I'm just kind of explaining
it as we go we're going to say session
equals Facebook whoops which references
the actual Facebook SDK get session and
we're going to say me equals null and me
is the user that's logged in right now
it doesn't equal anything and or if we
have a session we're going to say if
session this will return true or false
well it'll have something or we'll have
nothing so if there is a session what we
want to do is do a Facebook query okay
Facebook Cleary and we're also going to
do if Emmie equals true and what me
equals that means that null isn't true
obviously but meme would mean that
there's a user that's logged in and we
got some other information if that's not
true we first want to create a log in
URL so if it is true we want log out URL
else if there is no user data they still
have to log in log in URL okay and to
generate these with all our junk up here
to make it nice and easy Facebook to
write in a way to just say Facebook get
log out URL and the log in URL is quite
similar we'll say whoops Facebook get
log in URL now I'm going to go over
something in this in a couple minutes
it's going to make a big difference and
it's pretty important we'll get to that
bill so if there is a session what we're
going to try to do is query Facebook so
I'm going to do a try-catch statement
because the Facebook API throws
exceptions Facebook API exception
remember guys this is in the example
file Facebook provides very similar to
it and I'll just say echo e get message
just a generic Facebook a generic
exception thing so what do I want to try
if we're connected what I want to do is
do a query so say me equals
Facebook API
of /me now this is using the graph okay
I'm going to come back to this basically
you make all your graph calls with API
Facebook and then the pointer API and
the command here I believe that is good
so I'll save that the only thing we're
missing is we need to display the login
and logout URLs and what I'm going to do
is just a text link I'll say oops
if Emmy I'll say echo a hrf equals I'm
going to do the double quote a HRF
equals log out URL and we'll say log out
okay
and we'll do the same for login I'll
call this login URL save and that should
be login okay and I'll save those and
save
so now I'll go back here and refresh and
we have a log in Lincoln what's this do
we click it and it brings us here
someone's talking to me I better close
that and here's our application name
remember we created this and what we
have is access to basic information
Facebook has a way where you can have
more permissions so what we're going to
do is just go to Google and look up
Facebook permissions and I believe it's
this one okay and in order to get more
permissions to do more stuff with the
users profile we have to request the
permissions and let's just pick like two
of them I'll do where's the popular one
publish stream so that we could write to
someone stream and to do that this goes
into the get login URL and I'm going to
pop an array in there and the key is
called Rick or short for require perms
short for permissions a little tricky to
remember and I'm going to pop in publish
stream and these are comma separated
values
I guess re friendless and where was I
right down here and then comma REE
friends list and that should be good
so now save that make sure it goes on my
FTP and up cells over here I'll go back
to my page and refresh and I'll try to
log in again and now I have more
abilities when they want to connect so
that's kind of what the permissions does
and that's how you do it hopefully
that's not terribly difficult to follow
and I will go ahead and allow that and
it takes me back here and you see I have
a logout button that's because I'm
logged in right now so when I'm logged
in it's going to try this API thing and
let me show you what that really is when
it says Facebook API slash ME it's
really the graph API and there's just a
ton of stuff in here and it might scare
you let's see what permissions we ask
for publish stream and read friends list
I guess we could do a post and it gives
you some examples on how to post it's
not terribly difficult let's just go
ahead and do em e so we're to have this
slash Hemi so if I did print array me
okay
I'll save that
yes and refresh and we get all your
information okay now Facebook has a
strict policy on privacy and stuff so
you guys got to read that or you could
get your application disabled and also
don't put the word Facebook in anywhere
of your application title or will they
get automatically disabled and what we
can do our graph calls so we got
published stream and read friends list
if I wanted to publish a comment to my
stream or the currently logged in user
stream okay sorry I had to quickly look
something up I don't remember it off the
top of my head so what we could do is
something like this we're going to do
Facebook API and we're going to do an
API call if you see this slash Emmy how
about we look in post or we could go to
message album boy or something
interesting there's so much stuff on
here you see here we go this endings is
an example see the slash Emmy in the
graph and this API call we're just
typing / Emmy so when they give you a
link like this it's something you can do
the properties it gives you back and
let's see connections a lot of stuff you
can pass and get yadda yadda yadda but
we're going to try to post something so
Facebook API what I'm going to call is
me oops
slash feed and I want to post and what
do I want to post something with the
details and we do an array and say let's
say message hello world and I think
that'll be good I'll go ahead and save
that and yes and I can go back here
refresh and I have no output for whether
it succeeded or not so I can go back to
Facebook and me and look at this hello
world I posted from PHP and there's my
application right there so that's pretty
good and I think that's a decent
introduction to the Facebook API in PHP
basically you're using the graph URLs to
do different things like this or you can
just get data in different ways I will
mention if I didn't already that this
Facebook API is actually going through
OAuth which creates the key and all that
stuff I'm not going to go into OAuth
because that that's a lot more
complicated and this Facebook API made
it very easy for you so that's good
thanks for watching guys
