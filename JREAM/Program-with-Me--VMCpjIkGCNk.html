studios inc it's an awesome place to
work and I'm making this video because
we're looking for more employees because
we're growing and we just need more
talent a lot of people that work there
are very talented so X Studios we're
looking for an in-house guy someone near
Orlando but they will pay a moving
expense of $1,500 so if you're moving
from Michigan to Florida they'll hook
you up with $1,500 to move and if you
look at the site you can see we work
with a lot of big names here we do quite
a bit of stuff so you'll get benefits
there's a pool table in the office you
get your own desk and computer you can
just code away listen to music on your
headphones coffee makers and xbox and
it's in Florida which is like the best
place to live in my opinion so what X
Studios is looking for someone with some
experience already so here's an example
if you're a designer you would be able
to a PSD layouts that look pretty sexy
maybe some illustrator logos possibly an
illustrator mainly photoshop for site
layouts if you're a front-end coder
you'd probably do CSS HTML 5 and
cross-browser compatibility and jQuery
to make it even sexier and if you're a
back-end guy you really what we're
looking for someone good with PHP and if
you know anything above PHP that's a
huge plus the pay is really good and a
lot of benefits and it's just fun work
in there I wouldn't make this video
otherwise I wouldn't make a video for a
place I didn't like work
so what you should do if you are really
interested and you feel like you want a
new opportunity is go to the site
contact prepare your little resume up
and the best thing to do is show some
working examples if you've got artwork
or anything our code samples you know
not like a whole code library or
anything but you know just a roundabout
idea and believe me it would be awesome
to work with me because I cliff bars
every day and I don't drink much coffee
and I won't talk very much what I'm
still cool to work with so this is for
real if you guys are interested just
holler at them send resumes I hate this
guy Jesse told me to contact here just
provide something to look at so they can
get an ID like all this person knows
what they're talking about alright
that's that bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
