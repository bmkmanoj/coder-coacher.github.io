making a wordpress theme so what I have
here on my local host is just WordPress
installed by default and it's just a
default theme I just ruined some sample
data here and to make a theme it's kind
of weird but it's not too bad
so I have NetBeans right here with just
my WordPress installation and you need
to go to WP content and the themes
folder and what we're going to do is
create a new theme so we're going to
create a folder and I'll just call this
magic I can't think of anything else and
the first thing you want to create is a
stylesheet and you call it style dot CSS
and inside the stylesheet
we have to put something at the top in a
comment and that's how WordPress knows
that it's yours it's just like this we
say theme name equals magic theme URI
equals my site calm version 1.0 and you
there's a couple other tags like
licenses and stuff and what I want to do
is just do a body background silver font
16 pixels arial sans-serif just some
basic CSS and accidentally name this CSS
twice so let me rename that okay and
we're going to need a header I'll just
call that header I can get rid of all
this in the headers just we put our
doctype
HTR yeah html5 a couple I had tags and
we're just doing something really basic
to get you going
meta character set utf-8 always in the
title and we're also going to want to
include the stylesheet so link rel
stylesheet' href and I'll get to those
in a moment
so let's just make a div class I'll just
say div id equals container okay and
that will wrap our whole site so next
we're going to make a footer new PHP
class I'll call it footer and this will
be the closing tag for the container I
guess we'll just do a slash HTML / body
we could throw on a footer in here if we
want it copyright never okay so we could
even do this 8y so that will give us the
copyright and we're going to need to
define the container so in style I'll
just say container with equals 800
pixels margin:0 auto to throw it in the
center and background will be white
let's throw on a border radius to make
it look amazing how about 14 pixels and
for the footer I'll just say same thing
here and the background will be black
the color will be white and we'll add
about 20 pixels padding and I guess
we'll add some padding on here too
pixels who cares okay so we have those
notice this doesn't have a pound sign
because it's just a regular footer for
html5 so back to the header we want to
include our WordPress links and for the
hrf we just say blog info stylesheet URL
that will go to the themes stylesheet
URL right there for the title we just
say PHP blog info title like so and
there's a tag for WordPress headers that
you'll probably want to keep in there so
that it works with WordPress settings
and it will be WP head like that umm how
about in the header we'll also add just
the html5 header tag and we'll just put
an h1 for the site title and PHP blog
info and we'll just put the name of the
blog here this could actually go to the
home URL this link here a lot of people
do that
so HRF
and the URL is home URL slash I think
okay so I want to get a couple of things
in here so that we don't have an empty
site so let's go ahead and create a page
new PHP class I'll just call it page
okay
and we'll do PHP get header and this
gets the header file right there
and we'll also do a get footer and most
blogs have a sidebar so let's throw one
of those in sidebar and you know that
obviously means we're gonna have to make
a sidebar file in a moment and we have
to do a loop for the content
so I'll just say div and empty div and
we do a while loop
PHP while something like that and end
while so while a condition such as have
posts it's true we're going to echo out
post data and I'll just say h2 for the
post title and the content um I think
it's called the title
the title like that let me double check
tie it all yep the title okay and then
we have to echo out the content and I'll
just say PHP the content like that and
that should have paragraphs and stuff in
there
and we end our while loop let's create a
sidebar so make a new PHP class called
sidebar I'll say div id equals sidebar I
don't like using the HTML a side but and
in the sidebar will just say sidebar so
if we add a CSS style to this sidebar
let's just give a border one pixel solid
red so we know clearly where it is we'll
float it on the right make the width say
200 pixels so let's go to our WordPress
site and go to WP / admin and whatever
your login credentials are monitors
admin admin since it's a local copy
it'll help to look at what we're doing
and go to themes and mine is not showing
up let me just double check my style.css
file theme name is magic that is weird
so I opened a theme thing right here I
just looked for theme development for
WordPress so I'll copy this boom and up
here oh I'll change this to magic and
I could leave us some of these blank I
don't care about tags or any of this
other stuff let's see if that adds it
refresh not there it looks like because
the following themes are installed by
incomplete must have a stylesheet and a
template so we've got to make a few more
files let's go ahead and do that let's
make an index page new index so we'll do
the same thing as page pretty much and
just paste it in here while we have
posts do a bunch of stuff show the
content and I think that's good let's
see what happens refresh and here is
magic let me activate it now I'll go to
visit the site it's going to look ugly
but we're starting from scratch
boy this is slow this is going to load
well while we're waiting for that to
load we could make a single blog page so
I'll just right-click here new PHP class
I'll say single and single is different
because it's just for only one record
and we'll just include the header and
all that stuff again and I think in here
we want comments so below the while I'll
just say PHP comments template and it
looks like I need to do this okay so
here's the site so far with a beautiful
WordPress template life is long that's a
really long post and it looks really bad
so let me just make sure I got my Styles
right in my container ooh those are all
heading twos that doesn't look right so
let me go to my index page the title and
the content that's odd so I had to look
something up and it looks like they do
something like underscore underscore
I've honestly never seen that before
continue reading that's really weird see
what that does
refresh I might as well clean up some of
this right here I don't think that's
going to fix it so whoops
let me go to my WP admin and post life
is long
it says hey hey but it seems to be keep
it keeps repeating the title so
something's wrong with my loop okay once
again I had to look at WordPress
documentation it's kind of weird you say
the post like that but that doesn't look
right to me
it doesn't look right at all the post
well I might as well try it and there we
go I guess we have to put that in the
post okay
so let's build a navigation menu in the
header I'll just say nav right here nav
that's nav and we're going to use
WordPress is built in PHP menu so when
we add stuff it's dynamic we'll say
WP nav menu okay and let's see if that
does anything refresh and here are my
navigation items um and let's make sure
this home works click I'll go a sample
page let's see if that works
this should be a page oh I bet we have
the post data wrong once again for page
so let me stop we have to do this weird
little thing right here the post so I'll
go to page open that guy up boom we want
this minimal clean and easy to use I
think that
be good sample page there we go now we
have a sample page about page and back
to the home page
okay that's not going to the homepage
you see the URLs not right so there's a
couple of hiccups to fix here and go to
my header it looks like I have to echo
this out
echo home URL refresh and WordPress
there we go and there's my posts now my
sidebar is in the wrong place I don't
like that we're going to add a sidebar
widget too so oh I should say we can
make an array out of this so let's do
the old PHP arrays and I could say menu
will be primary and that should give it
the idea of primary so I'll refresh and
div class menu I guess not folks I guess
it does not like us so they're sad day
WP nav menu primary menu ID that's what
it is menu ID would be primary but we
don't really need an ID because it's
just the nav so who cares about that so
for the nav and the header let's Center
those guys up header nav footer and
container these guys are all going to
share the same width and margin like so
and
I kind of want to change my anchor link
color but why bother this is in a CSS
video it's a wordpress theme in video
and the navigation so I'll say down here
nav ul Li display:inline-block padding:0
10px alai 20 pixels for the anchor tags
there see if that does anything okay but
this is not a an inline block UL let me
see this is a UL li a oh I have to do it
for the Li so I'll take this guy out
say nav ul Li o and refresh and now we
have that so our head is pretty big this
is pretty good sorry pretty big and
there's a lot of styling like to do but
that doesn't matter right now because
we're showing you how to build this
so the sidebar let's throw that in a
proper place currently it's down here
below the footer I don't want it there I
want to here because remember in the
footer that's where the div ends for the
main container okay so I got to swap
those around on a couple pages okay and
do a good page nope okay so remember
page is a single page it's not a post
single is a single post sidebars
obviously your sidebar index is your
index page so let me refresh and see
what we have and there's our nice little
sidebar I actually think I should just
throw it at the top probably make an
inner container here to be a certain
width so inside this container div let's
make another div call it like left or
something I'll say div ID equals left
and the sidebar will put right here okay
same thing get the sidebar it's all work
in progress okay an index page also
needs the same thing okay
so then to the CSS I'll say sidebars
flow right left is flow left and the
width let's just say 600 pixels see what
happens
let's give it a border one pixel solid
cream and refresh okay that's a little
wide so it didn't fit so I'd probably
have to make this a little bit smaller
the left side so say I'll just say 590
obviously you guys can get your CSS
alright like I keep saying over and over
I'm not sure why this top is like that
let's grab a reset file Eric Myers reset
I want version 2.0 2.0 because we want
this to look smooth in a lot of browsers
so I'll just copy this guy and we'll
they have a minified version here we go
that's a lot better
so in our style I'll just do my reset
right there I'll just call this the
structure okay um and we also want HTML
Shiv html5 Shiv let's look for the CDN
here we go and this will make your
Internet Explorer problems go away
pretty well and we want to include this
in our header just say like right up
here so in Internet Explorer it doesn't
look terrible
so I'll refresh again okay so that
resets stuff so it's paddleboat with a
bunch of browsers and for this guy here
I think it needs overflow autumn oops
auto ok yeah so the container needs a
overflow:auto where was I that was the
container
overflow:auto and we got a since we have
this reset we got to define a bunch of
text rules and I'll just say h1 font
size will be twenty six pixels h2 will
be 22 h3 will be 18 quick little quick
little mock-up alright so that looks a
little better we need to make this a
link nope that's the about page we need
to make the posts turn into links so
right here let me get rid of the borders
because they're ugly so boom boom and
down in the index page for the title
I'll say a hrf equals that and for this
we got to do PHP the pom-pom was the the
perma I need code hinting permanent
permalink permalink that's it I think
I don't have the codex memorized I've
just been playing oh look life is long
page seven and for the single post let's
see if I screwed that one up also yep
I need this again sorry guys I'm just
whizzing through it we need that little
the post after the post so refresh and
click and there we go here's all my
content theme without comments
it's deprecated please include comments
looks like we're forced to include
comments so I'll make a new comments
okay sorry I had to pause the video I
had to look up the comment code so here
I'll say div id equals comments and
inside of here will list out our
comments I'll say PHP WP list comments
and then down below div ID equals
comment form
I'm not going to style these I don't
think right now comment form I hope
that's right I'm going to refresh and
there it is very plain kind of dull
looking but it should work let's say hey
and look at their admin says hey
obviously that would need to be styled
and look a little cooler the last thing
I want to talk about our functions file
so let's create a new file and call it
functions and this will give us a the
ability to create widgets so if you go
to your admin area let me hop over there
WP admin and we go to the pages
where is it
oh I think I have to enable in my theme
first create a plugin so let's register
a sidebar we'll just a PHP register
sidebar and in here we pass an array of
settings and the name is what's going to
display let's just say right sidebar now
we can give it an ID if we want I don't
really care okay so lets see if i
refresh this page i should be able to
get there we go widgets appears now cool
so we have a right sidebar let's throw a
calendar in there I'll call it test you
could make more than one sidebar if you
want it let's just say
second right sidebar first right sidebar
refresh and just throw a couple of
things in here how about save save and
refresh it's not showing up because we
have to go to our sidebar and include
that so sidebar PHP and let's say this
will be a h3 how about we'll just leave
a sidebar and let's say PHP dynamic
sidebar and the name
what was it is that really the name that
doesn't seem right one second I think it
needs an ID I'll give an ID to first
right sidebar this one will be second
right sidebar
okay so first right sidebar this will be
second right sidebar let's see what
happens refresh and hello world I don't
think those IDs are correct let me
double over that I need to echo those
dynamics sidebar okay the ID should be
correct I guess register sidebar the ID
we got to do that weird thing I have no
idea what this is it's so weird I think
it's like this
okay refresh please work it doesn't want
to work whoops
umm I guess I'll add a couple more of
them how about description the top bar
I'll just say the second top bar and the
oh oh the for widget will be a div after
widget will be a div and copy those guys
up here okay right sidebar array and
then in our sidebar page where is it
right here
dynamic sidebar seems like that should
work refresh I'm going to add some text
in here I don't know if this is being
cooperative so I want some text hey hey
save
at this point in the video I start to
sweat a little bit so if I expand this
oh I see nothing's getting put in there
I don't know why that should there's
nothing getting saved in here text hey
hey save is that saving is there a Save
button at the bottom how about a search
bar and save is there a Save button or
does it just work like a TX there we go
so it does work lastly we just need that
who posted it and all that stuff and
let's go to index and hmm I guess I'm
like it's just a paragraph tag and we'll
say PHP get author link let me look this
up real quick okay I found it
this looks crazy guys so we have to do
echo get author link false the author
data ID the author data user nice name I
don't like this on all these lines like
that
so this will be the link a HRF equals
this then we end the link and then in
here we put the author's name the author
let's see what happens I'm scared
refresh admin and we click it says you
don't have permission to access this get
author link is deprecated oh man I guess
that means I'm just going to jump into
2012
and there's look at all these files I
like to do it simple too much too much
index let's see what they did
ah entry header that's not it I'll just
search for author link functions
okay comment author link alright guys I
had to look this one up too this codex
has changed so it's get the author link
not all this mumbo-jumbo I'll say bye
get the author link let's see what
happens cross our fingers cross our toes
and it says bye admin but there is no
link that just gives me the author get
the author link oh I have to echo it but
I did PHP echo get the author link well
I don't know what it is you guys right
now I was just digging around but uh
this is just a very bare-bones way to
start a WordPress layout obviously this
isn't styled and I'm not going to bother
with it I'm not a big fan of this codex
a lot of its really inconsistent in my
opinion some things are prefixed with WP
I don't know maybe that means it's more
like a system function that's what I'm
guessing
but our WordPress is a pretty good
platform for blogging and making a
simple website it can do a lot of stuff
so I hope this tutorial helped you guys
