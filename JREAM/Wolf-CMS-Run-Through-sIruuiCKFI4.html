run-through through wolf CMS and this is
a content management system that I
really like to use because it's
lightweight fast simple and powerful
it's exactly what it says it is and it's
very easy to customize things if you are
into going the distance so I downloaded
a copy under the download page and I'm
using version 0 point seven three for
this video tutorial or talk and I've
installed it on my localhost and those
type in admin and paste in the password
I won't be able to cover all the
features of it but I'll just run through
it with you when you login you have a
very simple administration panel and
these are your pages what I did first
was I changed my theme and on the wolf
site you can go to extend and I went to
admin themes and I downloaded this deep
space one I kind of like that one and to
change that i just uploaded it into my
admin themes folder and under the
administration's tab I went to settings
and deep space and one more thing the
default status of a page want to create
one I want it to be published and save
okay and since we're here we have a
bunch of plugins and this is pretty cool
because you can go to the wolf site go
to the plugin repository find a bunch of
plugins drop them in and you're good to
go one that I suggest is called funky
cash i'll just type in the word cash
here and right here this one's a good
cash system because every time you
update a page it'll clear it for you the
AS cash is good but you have to clear it
manually if you update a page and if you
pop that into your plugins folder
through your ftp you just enable it with
a little check box here and it'll
refresh the page for you and sometimes
you get a little tab up here when the
plugins activated other times you might
not depends all the plugins made under
users we have our administrator account
and you can create new users if you want
other people will be able to log in and
edit content a developer or an editor I
just use this for myself so I don't have
additional users and actually you can
change your languages to a bunch of
things then there's a file manager I
really like this one you just can edit
your little folders here very simple
whoops i did something funny create new
directory i'll just call this dog
you can create your directories upload
your files pretty simple themes this is
where they put your CSS generally EP
images themes and what we have here
these three are probably the most
important pages snippets and layouts and
basically what you have is a page right
and allow is the way it appears and that
would have to do with your HTML elements
and CSS so if we go to none it's only
going to echo the content of the page
this just means this page and the
content of the page or if you go to one
like simple you can see we have our
standard HTML code up at the top and it
includes themes from wherever you want
to include them and including snippets
and this is one thing I really like
about snippets is that I'll click this
I'm all in control so it opens a new
window snippets you can create little
blocks and include them in your layout
so I had her that usually never changes
you can include just this block in a
layout by just including this snippet
header right here and under snippets we
just kind of went over that you can
create new snippets if you want with
anything you want in them the pages you
can click let's say home page and you
know your page title sometimes if you
change this it might change the
breadcrumb and that's under metadata
home page so sometimes it will change
that under settings you can change your
layout to whatever you want so i picked
none remember i just showed you in the
layout that that doesn't have any style
definitions and you can change your
login if you need a page to be protected
so let me save this real quick and go to
view site and you see this has no style
sheet according to the layout which
shows but if I go to settings and let's
say simple I'll go ahead and save that
refresh and now we have a simple layout
and under pages you can create a bunch
of children just add the plus icon
create one called test save and close
and now we have a folder here called
test sorry I page and I'll refresh this
and it has tests up here and this is in
the header remember our snippets open
that one more time and basically what
this is saying is the for each loop
inside of the base of home create a link
and if you didn't want that to appear
you could do hidden so I'll click this
and the status will be hidden and I'll
refresh and the test page is gone but we
could also go to test like that the
reason for this ? is because I didn't
enable mod rewrite if you do you can
have pretty looking URLs and I would
probably do that on a live site we can
branch these into other children like
about us i'll call this dog and say dog
save and close and now in the about Us
page I have a page called dog how it
appears this is automatically generated
here but perhaps I could do something
like that about us / dog pretty cool and
i'll create one more just to show you
i'll call this one Pig save them close
and we can reorder our pages very easily
and just drag those up or I could move
this down here however you want to do it
and let's go back to a page and we have
filters we can use there is tiny MCE
available i believe for editing your
content it comes with mark down and
textile filters so if i did something
like h1 tag on this and let's just say
paragraph on that save and continue and
it'll appear like that looks like this
paragraph tag don't work correctly but
now i'm going to go into textile
metadata your slug is the URL which is
right here so imagine you had HT access
on I don't think about us is a good slug
I'd rather do about so i might change
this to about and you can we leave the
rest the same i'll save that and go to
this page oops
like that and basically what you have to
do is just create a layout of your own
and include your CSS files and you'll
have a beautiful easy to use CMS that
you can customize and do quite a bit in
I really like the system it's easy just
to write your own PHP code in here you
can optionally head will add more
content sections here I don't use these
these content parts here but you can if
you like and definitely check it out I
prefer this much more than WordPress too
alright guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
