run through through wolf CMS and this is
a content management system that I
really like to use because it's
lightweight fast simple and powerful
it's exactly what it says it is and it's
very easy to customize things if you are
into going the distance so I downloaded
a copy under the download page and I'm
using version 0.73 for this video
tutorial or talk and I've installed it
on my local host and I'll just type in
admin and paste in the password I won't
be able to cover all the features of it
but I'll just run through it with you
when you log in you have a very simple
administration panel and these are your
pages what I did first was I changed my
theme and on the wolf site you can go to
extend and I went to admin themes and I
downloaded this deep space one I kind of
like that one and to change that I just
uploaded it into my admin themes folder
and under the administration's tab I
went to settings and deep space and one
more thing the default status of a page
want to create when I want it to be
published and save
okay and since we're here we have a
bunch of plugins and this is pretty cool
because you can go to the wolf site go
to the plug-in repository find a bunch
of plugins drop them in and you're good
to go one that I suggest is called funky
cache I'll just type in the word cache
here and right here this one's a good
cache system because every time you
update a page it'll clear it for you the
a s cache is good but you have to clear
it manually if you update a page and if
you pop that into your plugins folder
through your FTP you just enable it with
a little checkbox here and it'll refresh
the page for you and sometimes you get a
little tab up here when the plug-in is
activated other times you might not
depends all the plugins made under users
we have our administrator account and
you can create new users if you want
other people will be able to log in and
edit content a developer or an editor I
just use this for myself so I don't have
additional users and optionally you can
change your languages to a bunch of
things then there's a file manager I
really like this one you just can edit
your little folders here very simple
whoops I did something funny create new
directory I'll just call this dog you
can create your directories upload your
files pretty simple themes this is where
they put your CSS generally images
themes
and what we have here these three are
probably the most important pages
snippets and layouts and basically what
you have is a page right and allow is
the way it appears and that would have
to do with your HTML elements and CSS so
if we go to none it's only going to echo
the content of the page this just means
this page and the content of the page or
if you go to one like simple you can see
we have our standard HTML code up at the
top and it includes themes from wherever
you want to include them and including
snippets and this is one thing I really
like about snippets is that I'll click
this I'm all in control so it opens a
new window snippets you can create
little blocks and include them in your
layout so I had her that usually never
changes you can include just this block
in a layout by just including this
snippet header right here and under
snippets we just kind of want over that
you can create new snippets if you want
with anything you want in them the pages
you can click let's say homepage and you
know your page title sometimes if you
change this it might change the
breadcrumb and that's on their metadata
home page so sometimes it will change
that under settings you can change your
layout to whatever you want so by
picking none remember I just showed you
in the layout that that doesn't have any
style definitions and you can change
your login if you need a page to be
protected so let me save this real quick
and go to view site and you see this has
no style sheet according to the layout
which shows but if I go to settings and
let's say simple I'll go ahead and save
that refresh and now we have a simple
layout and under pages you can create a
bunch of children just add the plus icon
create one called test save them close
and now we have a folder here called
test sorry a page and I'll refresh this
and it has test up here and this is in
the header
remember our snippets open that one more
time and basically what this is saying
is the for each loop inside of the base
of home create a link and if you didn't
want that to appear you could do hidden
so I'll click this and the status will
be hidden and I'll refresh and the test
page is gone but we could also go to
tests like that the reason for this
question mark is because I didn't enable
mod rewrite if you do you can have
pretty looking URLs and I would probably
do that on a live site we can branch
these into other children like about us
I'll call this dog and say dog
save and close and now in the about Us
page I have a page called dog howl it
appears this is an automatically
generated here but perhaps I could do
something like that about us slash dog
pretty cool and I'll create one more
just to show you I'll call this one Pig
save them close and we can reorder our
pages very easily and just drag those up
or I could move this down here however
you want to do it and let's go back to a
page and we have filters we can use
there is tiny MCE available I believe
for editing your content it comes with
markdown and textile filters so if I did
something like h1 tag on this and let's
just say paragraph on that save and
continue and it'll appear like that
looks like this paragraph tag didn't
work correctly but now I'm gonna go into
textile metadata your slug is the URL
which is right here so imagine you had
HT access on I don't think about us is a
good slug I'd rather do about so I might
change this to about and you can read
leave the rest the same I'll save that
and go to this page oops
like that and basically what you have to
do is just create a layout of your own
and include your CSS files and you'll
have a beautiful easy-to-use CMS that
you can customize and do quite a bit and
I really like this system it's easy just
to write your own PHP code in here
you can optionally have more content
sections here I don't use these these
content parts here but you can if you
like and definitely check it out
I prefer this much more than WordPress -
