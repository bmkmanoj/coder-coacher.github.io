you this thing over here i have
rocketdock installed and it's just like
the mac with these little doclets first
thing you need to do is download rocket
dock at rocket com it's free and it's
awesome the next thing you do after you
install it it'll come with some default
icons go to get add-ons and click the
most downloads and you'll see stacks
doclet and go to this one and it's
actually a little tricky to install
because they don't tell you if you've
never installed so you'll download the
file okay I'll just download it here and
when you open it you get a folder and
I'm just going to drop this in my
desktop now I'm going to move this to
the bottom because you'll see if i
change this icon setting to the mode to
fan everything the labels are in the
wrong position so i'm going to move my
whole dock to the bottom just for this
example I like mine on the right
personally so here it is on the bottom
and I click this folder boom and I have
all these little icons for my most
recent downloads and you can open the
folder here if you want so I'm going to
go to my f drive where I have it
installed program files and down to
rocket dock here we go now it's a good
idea to do this ahead of time before you
go into this folder right click it and
go to properties and then go to security
okay now you're in this and then just
click Edit for this group of users and
then go to your username and just check
off a full control and some of these
check boxes will check automatically
click ok and what that'll do is in case
this thing disappears it just gives your
user the correct permissions
next you go into rocket dock and you go
into the doclets folder okay and then
you just drag this into here I've
already done that delete and you'll have
to restart rocketdock so close it open
it up and then you would right click go
to add item and down here you have a
stack doclet okay and it doesn't do
anything at first it's like crap so
right click it and go to icon settings
select the folder you want to use for
this I'll just do wamp for this example
and C Drive and you can change your icon
of course I have a folder i added here
with some icons so i'll just pick this
one and the mode you can select to fan
or grid some people like fan and i'll
click this and it brings up all those
and i'll show you the grid one real
quick icon settings and grid okay and
here's the grid I kind of like the grid
but that's a pretty cool little plugin
and everything's free and you can always
just drag this off and let go to save it
alright guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
