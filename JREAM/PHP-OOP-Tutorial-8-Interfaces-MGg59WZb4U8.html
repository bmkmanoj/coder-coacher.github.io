cover interfaces in the past tutorial we
went over abstract classes and to be
honest I don't use interfaces often and
there's just an idea of how they work
so first let's make a new class and I'm
just going to call my in-class
programming and I'll save that as
programming that class dot PHP then
let's um let's just give it a function
public function I'm just going to do a
construct and okay and let's include
that file and I'm just going to create a
new instance I'm going to say P equals
new programming make sure it works
programming was created good and now
let's create an interface to do an
interface it's not like a class you type
interface and I'm going to call this one
dot syntax and an interface let's just
save it as dot syntax interface PHP it's
a little confusing but hey and then
we'll have to require these before the
class that we're going to pop them into
so dot syntax dot interface dot PHP and
we'll do three more interfaces to give
you an idea
I guess just paste this here and call it
a parse interface BHP
one more let's call this compiled now
you don't have to do all these these are
just for examples and I'll just include
those one what's called parse the other
ones called compiled and an interface
all it does is it defines methods that
must be used except it can't explain how
the class implements that the class just
has to have it so it's a lot like a
template so this program in class is
kind of useless let's make this class
called PHP and we'll make another one
called Java call this Java dot class dot
PHP and if you're getting confused
that's all right just I suppose you
should just watch instead of typing
along and I'm going to make a new folder
and call these interfaces so that it's
not so messy okay just make sure these
are open so back here let's just add
interfaces
okay and I'm going to do a new PHP and a
new Java let's make sure those work
cannot read Eclair dot syntax on line
three let's open up that interface that
syntax and I'm not sure why it's saying
that interface dot syntax oh we forgot
to change these names call this parsed
and this one compile okay there that's
all working so a bit of work to get
going to show this example so we've got
some interfaces in some classes and
let's say the Java class we would do
implements um was a dot syntax and if we
refresh that well we should get an error
um
dot syntax Oh dot syntax has no rules
okay so just do public function um dot
syntax I'm going to put users so that we
don't use it so we want to put some
rules for Java it uses dot syntax so
let's say public function uses dot
syntax and we'll just call this function
this uses dot syntax so now we're forced
to include dot syntax if we did it for
PHP that won't be true compiled and
let's do public function is compiled
and you can implement more classes and
say compiled and that means we need to
include the is compiled so you do public
function is compiled just say echo yes
and this should work now okay so you can
put in a template rules and things for
PHP you'd say implements parsed whoops
and open up parsed and let's say public
function parsed blah okay now we should
get an error here good and go back to
the PHP and we need to make a function
for parse public function parsed now
we're not including the value here so
that we can throw an error okay it must
be exactly the same as in the interface
so see parse has a value here and let's
just do blah and that works good so as
you can see I couldn't think of a great
example to do this with but if you had a
bunch of different languages and objects
for example you could say alright let's
implement the rules they have and there
needs to be a method that tells about
that rule so really uses dot syntax
isn't a very good output let's say yes
it looks like this and is compiled yes
it creates um jar files and if you add
another class that was like let's say
Python
I'll just duplicate this class and call
it python class PHP and Python is dot
syntax I can't even remember if it's
compiled I don't I don't remember okay
who cares we're not talking about pi
anyway so and pythons compiled yes looks
like this object method and for Java you
could just say it looks like this I
don't make those new item I don't know
but if we just implement these rules we
can create a safe structure for a thing
and really you don't need to use
interfaces very much I don't think
new Python server class place I'm not
found for that to require that Python
alright that works well sorry for this
long confusing tutorial I was trying to
give a decent example of what interfaces
do and this isn't a very good example
but it should give you an idea
unlike abstract classes I might have
already said this but you can't do this
public function hey echo one because the
implementation of it is a the class that
implements it so if we had a parse like
from the PHP class in one Sparx it has
to be the implementation defined right
here rather than in here I know you can
do that with abstract classes so this is
quite a bit different and once again you
can implement as many as you want
alright I hope this tutorial helps don't
worry about this if you don't understand
it I just wanted to get this tutorial
out of the way and hopefully we'll do
something a little more interesting and
easier alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
