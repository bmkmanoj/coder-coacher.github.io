we're going to talk about the pen scary
thing is if you ever tried to use it
it just seems really confused and done
it so I'll try to go slow through this
ah pick your little pen tool okay and
we're just going to click a few areas
like this and you always want to close
your shapes see this isn't closed it has
a one two three sorry it has two sides
but you always want to close it wherever
you started it gay now it's closed and
so that we don't mess anything up ink
like this and start creating another one
what you want to do is hold ctrl and
just click and then you're not working
in the pen tool on that so I'll just do
that one more time click click click and
make sure to close it and then just hold
ctrl and click another area you can use
it again and if you don't close it you
might have problems later because let's
add a stroke to it one that maybe we
could see let me change the colors okay
and now we have a missing wall there I
mean unless that's really what you want
you know okay so we know how to make a
basic shape with the pen tool and we
should close the paths now make a dot
instead of just clicking hold the mouse
down and now drag it okay you can hold
shift to make like a better arc so I'll
just do that okay now let's say I want
to make a line straight from this point
to this point whoops
it's curved see that I don't want that
so what you do to get rid of this curve
working here you click this anchor point
and under
the pen tool I'll just pull out this
window it's this little bracket here
called convert anchor point and you
would click that well I guess that
doesn't work um back to the pen tool I
just I guess just click that maybe those
are different yeah I guess I don't
really know what I'm doing all right I
made a straight line like that okay you
know it'll make a straight line off of a
straight Anchor Point whenever it's
curved you'll have these handles see
that I'm pulling them out and let go as
these crazy little handles you just
click the dot once again and it'll get
rid of that handle okay
then you'll want to close I'm going to
hold down here and drag like that so
it's really not too scary uh the plus
tool is if you want to add anchor points
okay so if I add one there and to play
with the little handles there you gotta
use the direct select tool that's the
white thing okay so click this little
path and you can drag up and move the
handles so I guess for practice let's
make a bat okay and I'll show you a kind
of smart way to do it Kay so I'm back
I'm going to start with the top of its
head like this okay all right let me do
this I'm gonna start with it like this
okay and now click down okay so this is
a straight Anchor Point and I'm gonna
stretch it up like this okay
don't get scared just keep going and I
want to create a little one over here
and line it up with this
then close it I guess I don't really
know what a bat looks like but uh they
got little big ears like Batman and I
don't know okay
uh and then just make a little tail like
this
now the reason I'm not closing these is
because I'm gonna merge them all into
one thing okay so I'm just going on
google boom and boom whoops
sometimes you gotta hit expand okay and
then lastly I'm going to do the reflect
tool and boom boom Batman okay it looks
like he's dancing
alright so it's not perfect but uh also
you can remove anchor points with the
minus one if you want I find it a little
more confusing to do things that way
alright thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
