I'm going to talk about a getter and a
setter in PHP my wording I kind of have
trouble with my words and explaining
things so I'll try to explain it the
best I can
here's a class called store and it does
really nothing but hold a couple of
variables or properties these are the
properties we have a name and an ID and
here's a setter it says set name and get
name okay and let's just do that down
here I have store equals new store I do
set name equals 7-eleven and I do get
name ok I'll explain this after I just
show you a sample ok so basically we set
the name with this function and we get
the name with this function why do we do
that
first of all down here where you
instantiate classes and use libraries
this is called the client area and you
want the client area to be restricted
because you don't want to trust user
input and people use in your library so
you have to limit them on what they're
doing second here's our library and
these properties are obviously public so
if I have a new store and I said store
name equals test and let me comment this
out and I'll refresh you see I can set
the name here why is this bad because
here's one example if you ever had to
change this variable of name like is
your the name of the store what if later
on you change it to name item they'd be
setting this name down here and the
variable throughout the library changed
but with a set
name we could change the variable right
down here and the function would stay
the same secondly what if you wanted
only certain values passed in if name
could not be a have any digits K so if
they had tests like this refresh they
can pop that in at will and do anything
so we want to restrict what they can do
and the first thing we have to do is
protect these right protect it you can
also do private we're doing protected
for classes that extend store meaning
that these items can be used by the
subclasses or children private is just
it locks it all in the store class only
anyways I've gone over that a bit so we
have a setter we refresh with those
protected a store name protected name
item we should be getting an error with
with the store name store name oh I
renamed it wrong sorry okay
so have a protected name and it says we
can't access the name good so when we
set the name we don't want any digits in
it so we'll just say something like if
see type L num of name equals true will
die and say you can't do this okay so
refresh sorry I have to get rid of this
item here and we'll use the set name
setter and it says you can't do this it
can't have digits in it so let's say
doggie store refresh and it's good so
with a setter you can really restrict
what you want put in it and you limit
the access to just all your stuff flying
around
even more is if you wanted to track
every time someone set something what if
you had a file logger you could log
actually just ignore I said that I don't
want to get into that trying to keep
this a very simple process K and the get
name you know the variables can change
and you want to keep things consistent
so a getter is good if you're just
monkeying with a bunch of classes all
over the place it's going to be crazy so
let's make a new class okay I'm going to
call this one class branch and we're
going to say extend store if you have
lost me so far I'm sorry it I find it
difficult to try to put this in simple
terms to understand I'm doing my best
though so I'll just say public function
I don't know construct
and our parent has no constructor up
here so we have all these functions
available in this item what you could do
is you could do just a general gather
and say get var and we'll say return
this VAR ok and you would also want to
do a magic function public function get
if it doesn't exist will say echo this
doesn't exist okay so we have a getter
this will return variables that exist
and if they don't exist we're going to
say hey there's a problem here buddy
okay so get name we can just change this
to get and what do we want to get let's
get the name and refresh works good what
if we did name with something funny say
this doesn't exist okay okay so back to
the branch instead of store let's create
a new branch and things since branch
extends store we get all these functions
inside of the branch now since this is a
child class branch you could grab all
these if you wanted and for the branch
we could say this or sorry let's do
protected branch ID and if we had a
branch idk we want that protected we
could also set the branch ID so you
could say branch set those we should set
a global set up here so instead of set
name or undo set name
and value okay and let's just simplify
this we'll say this name whoops
equals value okay so this will set a
variable up here and you could also use
a magic function set
so I'd say set and what I want to set
first let me set the name and I'll say
doggie store then I'm going to say
branch set and I'm going to set the
branch ID
thank you some digits and then I can do
get name get branch ID and let's try to
get one more
EEE refresh and see we can get that and
EEE doesn't exist and just for fun let's
set one that doesn't exist we'll say e
whoops
EEE use four four four and you see we
can set and get stuff and within these
functions we could set some rules so
that the system's not abuse in the
client area I apologize that this
tutorial isn't very clear or if it's a
little rough around the edges I tried to
explain it the best I could in the time
I have if it's too hard let me know and
I can try to simplify these tutorials
and make them a little longer alright
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
