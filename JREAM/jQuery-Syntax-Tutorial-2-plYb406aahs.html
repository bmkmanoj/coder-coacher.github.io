we're going to cover some jQuery syntax
the first thing you're probably want to
probably gonna want to know is the
document dot ready now just to cover
some basics everything starts with a
dollar sign and that means jQuery is
what we're using
and then there's parentheses and this is
what we're selecting ok so this selects
something in your HTML so if we had a
div in here we would type div and that
would select every div on the page even
if we add two of them okay you can also
do it for ID so if this div ID equals
yes you could do yes with you know an ID
starts with a pound sign for a class you
use a period of course you can also do
it like this if you want I kind of
prefer mine that way then the second
parameter is the action and you can
chain things along with the little
period and then the name of the action
and every action has a parenthesis and
this is just a function to do with what
we're selecting so what do we want to do
with the yes div nothing yet
first we want to cover probably the most
important thing and that's the document
ready so like before we say document
that's what we're selecting and the
action is when it's ready then what then
we're going to perform all these actions
on our elements so document dot ready
and then this has those little
parentheses as well and what we want to
do here is put everything between the
document ready
and we want more than one parameter so
we create a function okay this might be
a little confusing at first so it's okay
if you just need to copy paste the
document that ready just make sure you
use it so let's do function with the
little parameters there and then the
little curly brackets now if you're
confused already don't panic because
getting used to the syntax took me quite
a while I'm not sure why I just found it
kind of confusing so you look at this
and there it is just write that out and
I'd move this to the bottom of script
and then all our code is going to go
between here so that when the page is
ready and everything's done loading we
can start using jQuery so let's go back
to our action so this selects the yes
item and then we're going to perform an
action on the item let's do um dot hide
and there's no parameters to put in here
sometimes there are we're just gonna do
hide so we have this here that says yes
hit refresh and now it's hidden pretty
cool and if we uncomment that of course
it will show again and if you know
regular JavaScript you can use a lot of
that already like the math functions and
there's also alert hello and these are
just some basics I think you're gonna
have to type out a couple things a few
hundred times before you get used to the
syntax so back to our div if we just
like div dot height let's put some text
in here and we'll have two divs that are
hidden now so try not to get that
confused if I comment this out we'll
show them again see here they are again
now that's why you got to be careful if
you just type in div if you have a whole
bunch of divs it's going to hide
everything so most of the time you want
to use an ID if you're only changing one
element or a class and you type dot yes
see where it says class and the period
before and then we'd say hide so now
this text yes should hide okay so that's
the basics and we'll have a little more
fun in the next tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
