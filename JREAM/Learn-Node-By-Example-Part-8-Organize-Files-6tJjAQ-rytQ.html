I go down to the node folder basically
our base URL what we can do is just
remove all the node modules so r m dash
RF node modules and we can also remove
the package.json so we should only have
a readme and an app what I'm going to do
is just say Nautilus in this folder if
you're using Windows you can say explore
in that folder and I'm going to take
everything from the app cut it and paste
it here now the app folder is not yet
empty so I'm going to go into there and
move that get ignore one down and remove
the directory of app okay so now all
this changes and this package is
actually the package that we're using
and then our reading and get ignores
here Lonnie's the gauges ignore they
generated another thing would be we
forgot one thing in the routes shoot
sublime text need to reload I hate when
that happens so routes users and just
where it has a login just below it i'll
add log out and it's a get request this
actually isn't going to render anything
to do destroy session redirect user to
login page or homepage ok
and I think that's good to keep this all
in one we could also allow a user to
edit a profile and the question is you
know we want them to be logged in and we
could tie that down to one thing in the
user route so it's cleaner rather than
every like if we were to make another
appt based off this dashboard could have
like / profile and you edit it or users
could just be all in one almost as if
it's all its own module just like it
goes with the users here so for the heck
of it let's just go ahead and do it this
way and save this as a profile that H vs
and really none of this is really going
to apply right now edit the user profile
okay and since it's going to be in users
will just say
profile that's a post and then here it
will be a get and we'll just use
response that render users / profile and
the title will be my profile and i'll
put up to do this will require a user
session so that they can only edit
themselves and to separate some of this
logic it looks really dirty so let's do
this we're just going to put some
demarcate ER in here how about 70 long
so login login and logout all kind of
tie together register register when the
pending and the passwords here okay
and I'll just put profile
passwords confirmation and this will be
register this will be the login / logout
now the users page itself this I think
at some point it will just be a redirect
or maybe something like that we haven't
used any special routes with tags for
IDs or anything but i think this cleans
it up a little bit and might as well do
the same here dashboards copy this whole
block index home page and
users page wow this stuff is taken up a
lot of room here I want to leave it
there just to remember it just looks
really dirty doesn't it next let's just
create a new folder or call it
middleware whoops middle layer and we'll
make a new file in here and I'm just
going to say this as get keep for now
okay because at some point we're going
to use middleware possibly of our own
unless we use a add-on for the user
authentication we'll see and I think
that's good for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
