tutorial we're going to cover some magic
methods inside of objects so let's just
create a class so we can use one and
let's just say public function hello and
we'll have that echo hello and when we
use the class of course we just can say
test equals new test and say test hello
and we have that of course now magic
methods I'm going to go through three of
them the first one is a called get and
there's one parameter that gets passed
in to get and what get does is when you
try to grab a property from the class
this that doesn't exist this will
automatically get called so let go let's
say pram does not exist and let's set a
real property upper here up here and
let's say a public name okay so if I go
down here and I say test name this one
does exist well it's a lowercase and if
i refresh there's no problem and what if
I do test a last name it's not defined
and when we do that it outputs the get
function magic method there's also one
called set and this one takes a name and
value and let's just say at echo you are
going to set a property of name value
and scroll down and let's just say
test age equals 12
okay no age is defined up here and what
happens is you're going to set a
property of age now obviously you could
make these actually do something you
could actually say this name equals
value I'm not sure okay and that should
probably set it there's also one called
call function call um this one takes a
per am and values I'm not sure off the
top of my head if values there can be
more than one value uh but this is four
methods so let's say um echo you are
going to process um let's say per am
value and we'll just say test and now
we're going to do a method and say
something that doesn't exist and refresh
you are going to process something that
doesn't exist and we could also pass a
value in here undefined vit whoops
I mean a value and it looks like this
passes in an array so you could have a
bunch of these and let's say print our
value and if we refresh that yep that
works cool so those are some magic
methods uh you know they have their uses
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
