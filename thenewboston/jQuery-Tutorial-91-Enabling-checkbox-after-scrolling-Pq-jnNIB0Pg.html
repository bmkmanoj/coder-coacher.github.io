another variable here called scroll
underscore height and that's going to
equal text area underscore height and we
want to minus the inner height of this
terms text area so we go ahead and
select no be just be this and then dot
in a height like that so let's just go
ahead and pop the scroll height into
here and just call height and let's go
ahead and refresh and scroll down and
you can see this is 560 so the original
the value that we had minus 560 is going
to equal the the actual height so sorry
no I'm completely wrong I could have
gone and said in a high and echoed out
in a high or put the text inside of here
so we can go ahead and do that now and
that will show you the inner height
which is 164 and now what we've done is
we've subtracted 164 from this original
text area a text area high and then we
have the scroll height which will match
the inside height of the document of
inside height of the text area sorry so
now that we have this accurate value we
can go ahead and perform an if statement
but we first of all need to return the
value let's just return let's just get
rid up back we need to return the value
of where the scroll is at so we can do
this and we can match it to the scroll
height that we retrieved earlier so the
scroll height that we retrieved earlier
is 560 so if we were to return the
scroll height which is as we scroll down
the the point there which where our this
should match v 560 when we get to the
end it's important that when we get to
the end we can match it because that's
why we want to show the check box so
scroll top is going to equal
this dot scroll top and this is a jQuery
function and that's going to return the
current position of the scrollbar so we
can go ahead and say scroll top and
we're going to put that into our
feedback div so now when we scroll down
you can see this value incrementing when
we get to the end I equals 560 so we did
some calculations earlier and got the
actual height of the inside as we
scrolled so the whole scroll area and
now we've returned the same value so we
can match this at the end yeah we can
match this at the end so let's go ahead
and just get rid of this we no longer
now need this div just go and get rid of
that as well and now what we want to do
is perform an if statement to check
whether the scroll top is equal to the
scroll height the acura height value
that we returned for the inside so we
just simply say if a scroll underscore
top is equal to scroll underscore height
we want to disable this disabled
attribute so we want to remove the
attribute completely so all we do is we
say hash agree which remember is our
check box area or our check box element
and we just want to remove an attribute
from that and that attribute is disabled
so now we've relayed each value into
that div and displayed that they match
as we get to the bottom so now as the
scroll top equals the scroll height we
know that we've we've scrolled down
essentially to the bottom of this text
area so now when we refresh and we
scroll down you can see this is still
disabled but when we reach the bottom
the condition of this if statement will
be true and therefore this check box
will be enabled so this is quite a
simple piece of code let's go ahead and
make the height a bit bigger just to see
how this doesn't affect the
functionality so I made the height
slightly bigger but however when we
scroll down we still match it and it
still is available to check so the code
that we've written dynamic
the updates using pretty much these two
variables dual the calculation so
whatever height we have the scroll area
at or the text area ah it will always
return this condition is true because
we're returning the the most accurate
values so this will work obviously
whatever height or whatever width you
have the text area at so quite a useful
tool if you wanted to include something
like this in terms and conditions
obviously you can enable and disable
buttons instead of check out and check
box areas if you wanted this literally
just to be a button you could go ahead
and just replace this here with a button
and then you have a value for your
button so for example continue we'll
just get rid of that for now and it
would work in exactly the same way you
can see that the continue button is
disabled yet when we go all the way down
to the bottom this button is enabled so
quite versatile with different elements
as well obviously the disabled attribute
applies to almost all HTML elements so
quite an easy way to do this the
calculations are slightly complicated
but the overall concept is obviously
quite easy and you could go ahead and
apply this to a text area and obviously
use this in an actual real life
situation which is nice because it's
nice to see something that can actually
be used so that's how we use scroll top
and the scroll height and the inner
height to calculate this and display a
hidden or disabled element</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
