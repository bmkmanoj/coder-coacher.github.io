tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I want to be
giving you a quick overview of what
c-sharp is and I'm going to show you
where and how to download visual C sharp
2010 Express Edition and that's
basically just a program that we're
going to be using to writing our c-sharp
in but before we get into any of that I
just want to let you know that I'm
recording all of these tutorials and
NADP so if you can't see what I'm doing
just go ahead and watch them in full
screen and in 1080p
alright so c-sharp is a programming
language that was built by Microsoft off
the dotnet framework and that means that
you will only be able to run the
applications that you build on Windows
so you won't be able to run them on
either Mac or Linux alright and c-sharp
one of its advantages it's very similar
to other programming languages such as C
C++ PHP and Java so if you ever want to
get into anything more advanced if you
want c-sharp you can go ahead and pick
those languages up pretty easily alright
so now let's download visual on c-sharp
2010 Express Edition so just go ahead
and go on google and type in c-sharp
2010 and then just hit enter and just go
ahead and click this first link right
here it should be Microsoft comm alright
so once it load you should see a page
similar to this one and then just go
ahead and scroll down until you see
visual c-sharp 2010 X for us and then
just go ahead and click that link then
once this page loads just go ahead and
click install now - English and
basically what it's going to do is just
download and install or for you and then
once it does that just go ahead install
visual c-sharp 2010 Express Edition
alright and once it's installed just go
ahead and go to your Start menu and
search for c-sharp 2005 and then it
should say Microsoft Visual C sharp 2010
Express then just go ahead and click
that alright once it loads up it should
see a page similar to this one except
you won't have any projects so every
time you want to make a new project just
go ahead and go up to new project and
once this loads just make sure it's
selected windows forms
application and windows forms
application is basically just an
application you can see so it has like
buttons on in text boxes and all that
stuff and then once you have this
selected just go ahead and give a name
to your application I'm just going to
call it Adams first project but it
doesn't really matter what you call it
at all
and then once you have a name selected
just go ahead and click OK and then once
that load you should see something like
this and this right here is just
basically what your form or your
application is going to look like when
you build it and we're going to get into
building it and designing our
application in the next tutorial but
let's just uh get used to the user
interface of this first so over here is
your tool box and inside of your tool
box are all the controls that can go on
your application such as buttons and
text boxes and all that stuff but we're
going to want to change this up a bit as
you can see there's categories right now
and I just really don't like those so if
you want them you can leave them but I
prefer to just go ahead and minimize all
of these and then you can go up to the
top and just a drop down for all the
controls and I just think that makes it
a lot easier so you have an all in one
spot and yeah here are all the controls
that we can drag onto our application
and also this is on auto hide at the
moment so if you like select it and then
click away you can't see it anymore
and I prefer to dock it so to do that
let's go ahead and grab the top of this
it is click and hold and drag down to
that little thing right there and then
just release it and now it's docked
right there so it won't disappear when
you mouse isn't on it all right and over
here is the solution Explorer and inside
of your solution Explorer it basically
just shows everything you have open in
this program at the moment and right now
as you can see we just have our project
and our form and our form is basically
this right here alright and you're also
going to want to be able to see the
properties for your project or your
application so to do that just go ahead
and right click on your form right here
and click properties and your properties
are everything about your program so it
has like your icon right here what the
cursor will look like the background
color and all that good stuff
but we're going to get into that in the
next tutorial and to switch between your
property than your solution Explorer you
can just go ahead and click solution
Explorer down there now the solution
Explorer appears and you put properties
and how the properties appear for your
program alright so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial in the next tutorial
we're actually going to get into
designing our program and all running
your application alright so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
