continue on with our learning of Linux
and in this video I'm going to show you
how to take the results of a command and
save them to a file so I'm in the
desktop right now and we know the
command LS just lists all the stuff on
the desktop so here are the contents
however what if we want to take this and
save it to a file and it's not only LS
you can do with you know PWD whatever
these commands return sometimes you want
to take the results and stick them
inside a file so we can reuse them later
well I've got a couple options we can
just you know go ahead and copy this
make a file paste it in there and save
it but that's kind of the hard way so
instead I'll show you guys a cool
shortcut so I'm going to type LS and we
already know that this command it
returns all this stuff right here
and if I want to save it to a file just
use the greater than operator and name
your file whatever you want I'm going to
name it bacon so now you see it creates
a file called bacon with the results of
whatever command we typed in pretty
sweet now
something I want to point out is this if
you ever run this command again on the
same file for example a PWD bacon and
you run this any content that was
already in that file it's going to be
overridden so if you thought that is
just going to take the results of this
command now and tack it on to the end of
it you're wrong it takes it in overrides
all the stuff that's already in there so
I'll show you guys if you actually want
to append to the file then what you can
do so let's just go ahead and get the
results of LS back so we got all that
and now we want to run PWD or any
command and tack it on to the end of
this file so what I do is run the PWD
command just like before but instead of
just a single greater than use - greater
than symbols this means don't override
it just get the results of PWD and stick
it on to the end of bacon so hit enter
and check it out
so these are the results of LS which
means list the stuff in my directory and
this was the result of PWD and we didn't
destroy any of our data pretty sweet eh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
