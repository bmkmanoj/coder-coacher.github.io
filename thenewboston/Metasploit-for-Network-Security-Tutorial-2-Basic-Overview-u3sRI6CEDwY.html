Metasploit tool what we need to do is we
need to type service and type postgre
SQL and start so this just starts the
database to store all of the Metasploit
exploits and that way everything runs a
little bit faster and now tool in order
to actually start it type MSF console so
hit enter from here and what this does
is it launches the command line version
of Metasploit so it loads up do to do
and boom look at that pretty much says
welcome to Metasploit and you're going
to get a new little banner or whatever
this little icon is each time and if you
want to get rid of it just like regular
Linux you can type clear and boom local
that so now you can tell by the MSF we
are in Metasploit right now now if you
ever need help with anything if you just
type question mark in hit enter then
it's going to pull up the help menu so
again that's question mark and then you
can scroll and look through all the
commands and you see okay the question
mark that's what we just did back this
moves back and you're going to be seeing
whenever we start looking at some
exploits what that does the command
banner shows you a cool banner so on and
so forth so all of the different
commands you can use in the little
description of each and just to test
that one of those if we type banner and
hit enter then we see that it just gives
us a new banner let's type it again
boom boom hit something wrong there boom
look at that so simple enough we type a
command it does that thing now another
thing that you can do is you can type
show actually let me clear out of this
get some junk off the screen to show
exploits so exploit like I was saying
this is just one of the things that you
can do some pieces of software call them
tools and Metasploit they're just called
exploits so again you can write your own
but Metasploit already comes with a
bunch built-in
now there are a lot of them so that's
why whenever your show exploits it's
going to take a little bit of time to
load you know all of them and also later
on I'm going to be showing you guys how
to filter some of these so let me just
so you guys can see a little bit better
alright hold on
trying to make it so I bumped up my text
so you guys could see a little bit
better on YouTube but uh since you know
it's kind of weird right now but if you
just scroll through these then you're
going to start being able to see all of
these exploits you know there are
different ones for databases and like
FTP and their exploits for Windows but
there's a lot to go through
so I'm too lazy to just read through all
of those and find whatever exploit I'm
looking for so say that I just want to
find an exploit related to MySQL I have
a MySQL database and I want to you know
make sure there aren't any issues with
it so what you can do is you can just
search my SQL or whatever key word
you're looking for now hit enter and
instead of having to read through all of
those exploits and this just gives you
in the results all the exploits related
to my SQL so on the left it gives you
the name of it and on the right it gives
you a little description so let me
scroll down and let me find one all
right so this one looks pretty good
right here right click and copy so this
is auxiliary scanner MySQL MySQL login
and I can see that it's a MySQL login
utility so it sounds like this could be
you know a tool used to find some issues
with the login of MySQL so once you have
that copied if you ever want to get a
little more information about it other
than you know that short little
description on the right you just type
info and paste in the name of the
exploit in hit enter so now we can see
okay it gives you a bunch of information
about the tool there you go there you go
provided by and this is who ever made
and now here's a little more detailed
description so this module queries a
MySQL instance for a specific user name
and password so all right we can use
this to test of course like it said on
my SQL instance now in order to actually
use it then what we need to do is we
need to type the keyword use and then
the name of the exploit so again what
people typically do is they write search
for whatever they're searching for FTP
MySQL whatever they go through the
exploits in read whatever one they want
they get some info about it and if it
looks like something they want to use
then type use then the name of the
exploit and hit enter so now we can see
what's going on is it put us into this
exploit so we are now using the MySQL
login tool or exploit whatever you want
to call it and I'm going to be showing
you guys in details how to use these
tools later on I just want to give you
guys a quick overview right now but the
thing is if you ever want to get back to
where you were like you're like okay
actually I made sure before that my
database was good so I not really
worried about this all you do is you
type the keyword back and it'll put you
back into the normal Metasploit command
line so that's how you find exploits
that's about how you get more
information about them that's how you
use them and let me clear out of here
and in the next video I'm going to be
showing you guys um some other cool
things that you can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
