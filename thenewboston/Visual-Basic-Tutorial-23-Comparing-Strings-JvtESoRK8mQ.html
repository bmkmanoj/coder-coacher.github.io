slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at comparing strings so
let's go ahead and get started we're
going to come down here under our main
sub and we're going to create a couple
variables we're going to start off by
creating a string so we'll just call it
user string as string and we'll set it
equal to nothing and then we'll declare
another string computer string as string
and we'll set that one equal to on live
gamer so now what we're going to do is
we're going to prompt the user to enter
in a string so console dot write line
please
enter a string so then we're just going
to get what they type in
so now that we have what they typed in
we're going to use the string dot
compare function so we're going to
console dot write line and we're just
going to type string dot compare and
we're going to we're going to compare
user string to computer string so that
is our two arguments for our string
compare the first one is the string that
we're going to come that we're going to
compare to the first string so here if
you don't understand what that means
I'll go ahead and show you so then we'll
do console dot read line so now if we
run this you can see that if I type on
live gamer and then add an S it's going
to give me the value of 1 because it is
comparing this string to the second
string now if we replace these and put
it backwards we're going to get the
value of negative one
you can see right there that it gives us
negative one because instead of
comparing the string that they gave us
to the first string we're comparing the
first string to the string that they
gave us so that might be a little
confusing but you can mess around with
that if you want and now we can also
make this case insensitive so even if
they make the whole thing in capital
letters comparing it to this right here
is going to give us a value of zero so
I'll show you how to do this we're just
going to type user string and we're
going to compare that to computer string
and then for our third argument it's got
ignore case as boolean right here and
we're just going to type true so now
they can type it any way they want they
can type it all caps all lowercase they
can switch off between caps and
lowercase whatever they want to do and
it'll still give us a correct value so
if I type if I type it like this it's
going to give us a value of zero because
it compares the case-insensitive and it
just checks to see if these are the same
as on live gamer so that was a pretty
simple tutorial you can use this for a
bunch of different things in your
programs go ahead and play around with
it I get used to it and once you're done
with that go ahead and move on to the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
