your let's see 9th objective-c tutorial
and in this tutorial I'm going to be
talking to you guys about different
types of data that you can store I mean
we already learned how to store integers
which is great and all but we want other
forms of data too and in this store I'm
also going to be talking to you guys
about something called precedents which
is well you'll see you later and the
last thing is about something called
modulus so let's just get right into it
so I already told you guys how to store
an integer variable like ni equals 20
good enough but there are actually other
types of data too for one we need a way
to store numbers with decimal points and
this is called most commonly float so
put f80 now you can store numbers with
decimal points and we'll just name this
variable f and set it equal to like 30
1.37
so int is four whole numbers they can be
positive or negative and floats are for
a number of numbers with decimal points
simple enough but there's one other type
of data that we're not going to be
dealing with a lot but it's pretty much
like a super flow it's like a float that
can hold more data but again like I said
we don't really use it all that often
it's called a double and it actually can
hold twice as many significant digits as
a flow which means if a float can hole
like ten numbers a double can hold 20
numbers that's your real quick out story
on that so a double which name is
variable D what set this equal to
something like 9.32 and in order to
since his double can store huge numbers
I figure it'd be a good time to tell you
guys about exponents
anytime you want to write exponent like
10 to 12th power
you put E which stands for exponent and
then put plus 12 and don't forget that
remember from like scientific notation
you can put like 10 to negative 8 power
and that's why you put plus 12 because
it's positive 12 power so now this is
like nine point three two and move the
decimal point over to the right 12
spaces
and you can also put negative make a
really small number but anyways like I
said don't even worry about doubles for
now we use them very rarely and the last
type of data I want to talk to you guys
about is something called a character
variable and put char C and what this
can hold is any single character which
is most commonly letters like I'll store
like being this one in order to do this
put two single quotation marks and put a
character in there so now whenever we
use this variable is going to just hold
that one character B and you can also do
cool things like store symbols like
semicolons and stuff like that but we
won't get in that now so let's go ahead
and print this out NS log let me go
ahead and make a template for this first
at the @ sign unless here we've got four
right here so here's a nice little
shortcut copy
oops that's embarrassing there so that's
the I FEC i F I for integer then percent
F flow then actually the most common way
to write a double in your print format
is the percent is put percent E and just
remember exponent double so that's how
you can remember that and also percent C
for character so now let's go ahead and
fill in the rest and we can print this
out and see if it work I F see what our
variables names are D see so now let's
go ahead and run this and hopefully we
didn't get in hair's succeeded very nice
and I see our integer is 20 our flow is
this and you see we have a little
problem with the rounding issues with
our computer but we'll get into that
later our double is this right here and
our character B for Bucky right there so
that's a store different types of data
so let's go ahead and delete this and we
can get into
other topic the other topic I want to
get into is precedence so go ahead and
make a variable called some actually
this isn't even really some it's just
the answer but name is some and put
something like three plus two times four
and now if you're wondering all right
three plus two is five times four is
twenty but look at this NS log add and
go ahead and put like percent I why I
really messed that up and percent I and
then go ahead and press some now what I
need to talk to you now is the concept
of precedence and now you see we get the
answer of eleven and if you're wondering
are right why did this happen well if
you ever took a math class in like fifth
grade you know the order I think it's
called the associative role or something
but certain operations have precedence
over another it goes the most important
is parentheses and exponents then
multiplication and division and then
adding in subtraction so what this means
is whenever you have an equation it's
going to do everything that's in
parentheses first then it's going to
take care of exponents then it takes
care of multiplication in the vision and
see since multiplication was first it
did this before it added three so why
didn't get eleven instead of twenty
because it said four times two is eight
first and foremost and then we add two
three so if you remember from math class
the same rules of computer program and
applied to an equation as you would
write it in high school or college or
whatever like that so let's go ahead and
delete this in the last thing I need to
go over with the guys is something
called the modulus now the modulus is
just a fancy name for remainder so go
ahead and make a variable called nm and
put thirty eight modulus seven that's a
modulus operator there % and what this
means is what is the remainder of 38
divided by seven well if you divide 38
by seven you get 35 or excuse me five
because 5 times 7 is 35 with a remainder
of 3
so that remainder is what's going to be
stored in the variable M don't believe
me check it out NS log X and let's go
ahead and put what's it program okay I
and M
don't forget your semicolons and now
we'll build this baby save all and run
it and it says 3 right here so if you're
expecting a 5 or anything else
this isn't divided divided would give
you 5 probably but or an error since we
have a remainder but 38 divided by 7
takes its bytes 38 by 7 doesn't care
about the answer doesn't care that it's
5 point something all it cares about is
the remainder and that's the value that
is stores so if you're wondering how do
I get the remainder this is out so
that's all the time I have for this
tutorial again not a lot of exciting
stuff but this is stuff that you need to
know because if you don't you're going
to be like why the heck did that do that
and what the heck does this % mean so
you know not the best oriole but you
know essential nonetheless so thank you
guys for watching and one other thing do
you guys like seeing my face in the
bottom right hand corner I'm going to
put a poll on my blog and you guys vote
whether you want my face in the bottom
right hand corner or not in the winter
you can either see my face or not see my
face so make sure to vote on whether you
want it there or not and that's what
I'll be doing for stories to come so one
last time thing you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
