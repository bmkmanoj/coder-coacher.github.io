video and up to this point we saw that
Excel is really good at working with
numbers has a bunch of cool built-in
functions can crunch them really quick
but did you know that excel is also
really stinking good at working with
strings too now by string I don't mean
like the string you climb with I mean a
string as in a bit of text like a word
or a sentence of course those are
coached strings in computer programming
and also Excel so let's go ahead and
make a couple right now so for this
example I'm just going to write my name
Bucky twice make any two strings right
there because the first it's not even
really a function just a little cool
test that you can do is if you ever want
to check if two cells are identical and
what you can do is you can hit equals
and then give the names of your two
cells so a1 equals again b1 and right
here what you're pretty much doing is
you're asking Excel a question you're
asking is a1 the same as b1 are the
contents the same hit enter and it says
true if they are and false if they're
not for example if this was named um ham
and hit enter that would be false now
one little thing you have to watch out
for is this test it's not case-sensitive
so if you ever have something like Bucky
and proper formatting and also Bucky all
in uppercase letters like here even
though they're not exactly the same it's
still going to give you true because
like I said this equals sign test to see
if two cells are identical it's not
case-sensitive so now you probably have
the question okay well what if I come
across a scenario where actually do want
to check if it's okay sensitive kind of
like um you would be expecting at first
but what you can do is you can use the
function exact and as you can see the
little details checks whether two
strings are exactly the same is
case-sensitive so exact let's go ahead
and throw this in again a one separate
your parameters with the comma B 1 and
hit enter
of course this one's going to give you
false because they are not the same the
other stuffs capitalized so that is
pretty sweet so now let me um make two
more examples all right so for the next
function I want to tell you about right
putting in a two and Hammack in situ or
excuse me B - they say B - twice a - B -
C - D - kind of like a rap song or
something a - B - C - D - Oh check it
out and help do okay getting kind of a
sidetrack there but check this out
anytime you want to join cells together
then all you have to do is hit equals
and then just like before click the name
of the cell you want to reference but
instead of the equals sign combine them
with the ampersand it's a little symbol
above the 700 keyboard now what you're
saying is okay the value or the data
that I want you to put in cell c2 is 8 2
combined with b2 hit enter and check it
out putting hammock alright so maybe
that's what we were going for but say
that this was someone's name his name
was putting hammock well obviously
that's not how you want to write his
name you want to have a little space in
the middle so how would you accomplish
that well this ampersand sign is really
just for combining things so what we're
saying is we're going to combine this
and this of course we didn't add a space
anywhere so if we ever want to combine a
space as well then here's how we
accomplish that add two little quotation
marks with the space in the middle and
add an ampersand after that so now what
this is saying is take putting combine
it with a space in the middle and then
combine it with hammock now you can
actually do this for I don't know if you
have like 10 different words and you can
combine them all and it will work the
same pretty sweet
so actually
yoishotto that but I have time to tell
you about a few other things so let me
do something like this mmm
Oh had a piece of skin hanging off my
now and uh alright had to bite that off
sounds kind of gross whenever I talk
like biting Ben my finger off and now
I'm just rambling on okay so say that
you arm like you had an address so my
address is 45 armed hand blaster Lane
and I'm not making that up that is my
row dress now the city I live in is a
pumpkin Virginia and that actually that
is a lie I will admit that so now we
want to have a new cell right here and
we want to format the address so what
we're going to do is put okay
this is a four so let me just put okay a
four and then what was that combined
thing goes right there and combine it
with this and I'll just hit enter and
okay well that's not what I wanted so
let me go ahead and my formula bar and
obviously what I want is I just don't
want everything on one line I want it
kind of like it's displayed up here
where the street name is on the top line
and then the city name is on bottom so I
know what we have to do just go up here
in in the middle like a text editor hit
enter crap you know what ENTER and Excel
does something else it actually submits
it so what we need is a special
character that equals a line break so in
order to accomplish this a special
character that we need to throw in there
is char and inside here put 10 now
anytime you have a weird character that
probably isn't on your keyboard like I
don't know some weird symbols and um
like maybe like a lot of weird symbols
for currency and stuff like that are
kind of weird but you need to use them
sometimes they're in this character set
now this 10 is a special parameter that
we pass in and it means line break
you're not supposed to memorize all this
there's like a
if you want to go check it out see what
all the cool symbols mean but basically
we're saying is take whatever contents
aren't a4 add a line break to it which
means pretty much the equivalent of
enter and then add your other one now I
just told you guys that but look at this
now ok well that didn't work buggy
you're an idiot this is the worst the
Toyota toriel but the ever now the
reason it isn't displaying properly is
because the way that this cell is
formatted it doesn't support line breaks
so even though there is technically a
line break in there we still need
actually might as well just go ahead and
okay let's just go ahead and format the
cell shows so you guys can see and of
course check this out it's not wrapping
text in other words it's making all your
data on one line so once we check that
and hit OK
boom check it out the line breaks occur
wherever you have this character right
there char 10 so that ladies and
gentlemen is how you properly format on
something like an address using special
characters for line breaks yeah the
Abbott tomato tomahto
and uh well oh oh my eye
I'm embarrassed so I'm going to stop the
video probably go cry and now well I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
