talk to you about the difference between
a syntax error and an exception because
whenever you're just trying to fix some
bugs in your program they kind of look
like the same thing but there is a big
difference between them and also how we
can handle them or fix them in our
program so let me make a very simple
program right now what we're going to do
is we're going to let the user input um
like a number so we'll just say what's
your fave number so what this is going
to do is it's going to display a little
prompt in the console whenever you run
it and then the user types something in
and we store it in the variable tuna now
what I want to do is I actually want to
take that and convert it to an int
because if they enter five we want to
make sure that Python doesn't treat that
five is a string and actually converts
it to an int or an integer number now
here's the problem that we may have
check this out
let me just complete this real quick by
printing out tuna see whenever you run
this right now if the user enters
something like what's my favorite number
20 and hit enter it prints it out fine
but what if this happens well if the
user decides to enter um
dur and hit enter well then we have a
little problem right here because you
can't convert dur to an integer so even
though we didn't have any typos and this
code looks fine right now an error still
occurred because the user was an idiot
so that's the difference between a
syntax error annex and an exception
whenever I say a syntax error that means
a problem with your code so instead of
writing input if you accidentally write
imp in OOP of course that's a typo
that's a syntax error so whenever you
run this that's why it says invalid
syntax whenever you see this it means
hey dude you made a typo and again the
other one
is called an exception and if we look
down here we can see that we don't
actually see the word exception anywhere
some IDs may but this one doesn't we
actually see this it says value error
now a value error is a special type of
an exception
this means that okay when we try to
convert this to another value we had a
problem and there are different type of
exceptions and I'm going to show you
guys how to handle them right now so of
course whenever you're making our
regular piece of software you want to
allow for these problems to occur
without breaking your entire program
because if the user is using this piece
of software and they accidentally hit
the wrong key you don't want your
program to crash like mine just did so
I'm going to show you guys a really cool
way to deal with these exceptions on how
you're supposed to so what I want to do
is I want to make my entire example in
arm while loop and whenever I write
while true this means that the loop is
going to keep going on and on and on
forever until it breaks
so not once not ten times just as many
times as we want it to and when we're
finished we'll just break it so I'll
show you guys the syntax of how to
handle an exception now or pretty much
just think of it whenever the user
messes something up that's a really
simple way to explain it so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to write the
keyword try and then I'm going to add a
colon and after that I'm going to type
my code now this is the code that I
think that the user could possibly mess
something up so instead of tuna actually
name is something good this time so int
input
what's your fave number us so again this
is the line of code right here that I
think ok maybe we're going to get an
error right here so I'm going to put
this in a try is pretty much telling
your computer try to do this but if
something goes wrong then we'll tell you
what to do later so then I'll do
something like take whatever they take
whatever number they entered and take 18
divided by just because I don't know we
just need something to do and then I'll
break so this is what we hopefully want
to happen they're going to enter some
number like 6 ok perfect no problems
it's going to say 18 divided by 6 which
is 3 and it breaks so our program ends
however we know from the previous
example that they can mess something up
they can enter something like derp or
they can enter I don't know maybe just
some stupid symbols like this so we have
to prepare for that without breaking our
program so remember whenever they
entered a word it can't convert it to an
int and it was called a value error so
what we're going to say is if you come
across a value error right there then do
this block of code right here and I hit
caps lock so print arm will say like
don't say make sure and enter a number
so basically what we have right here is
a very simple program to handle a very
basic exception so saying first run this
bit of code over and over and over again
until the user finally gets it right now
what we're going to do is we're going to
allow them to enter a number and
hopefully no problems work will occur
and we can break out of the loop however
if we get a value error then what we can
do is just give them a nice little
prompt on the screen and be
kay dude you got to try again so I'll
show you guys how to do that right now
so of course the first thing that always
happens is whatever is in the try so it
tries to do this code right here without
any problems whatsoever now if this
actually works fine and they just enter
3 then it's going to print and skip this
so this block of code only executes if
you indeed get an error so let me run
this and it says what's your favorite
number house well if you had her like
Bucky well then I said ok I tried to do
this I got an error and then what I did
is basically executed this code because
it was value error so then it loops
again well what if your inner tuna nope
do it again arm fart nope okay what
about 6 ok finally that works so finally
we can do this and break out of the loop
now of course a value error isn't the
only type of an exception a value there
is basically when the enter when the
user enters something that can't be
converted to an integer well what if the
user enters something like this all
right what's your favorite number well
what about zero ok that's a valid
integer so let me hit enter what the
heck now we can another type and that's
because of this whenever you take any
number and divide it by zero you get
another type of exception code as zero
division error so let me copy this and
I'll show you guys how to handle other
errors as well so this exception happens
whenever they enter string now a zero
division error basically says arm what
can we say we'll say don't pick 0 so I'm
going to try this if they enter the
string print this if they entered 0
print this and hopefully our program
will work fine so what's your favorite
number house 0
don't pick 0 what about I don't know
fifty-four okay there we go now there's
one other thing that I want to tell you
guys and that is what if you just want
to handle errors armed in general so
you're going to say an exception might
occur right here but I don't know if
it's going to be value error I don't
know it's going to be a zero division
error I just want a broad way to handle
every exception well in that instance
you can just use the keyword except now
99% of the time I'm going to recommend
not to do this and this is why whenever
you use accept it can hide a lot of your
problems so even though the user may
enter something that's not valid you're
going to go ahead and execute code
anyways without really knowing on the
source of your problem so it's generally
not a good idea to do this however you
can pretty much this is what's going to
happen I'll explain it this way it's
going to try to execute this code and if
a problem occurs is first going to check
this one okay well it wasn't a Valliere
then it's going to check this one well
it wasn't a zero division error and then
it's going to say okay well I'm just
breaking out of your program so that's
why it's not a good idea so that's what
I accept does and that's why I don't
like it now the one other thing that I
want to tell you guys with exceptions
before I let you guys go is a keyword
called finally so what finally is going
to do is of course we have a couple
options we're going to execute this or
this or this or this now only one of
these can execute per loop depending on
if the user didn't do anything wrong or
if they did now what finally does is it
basically says no matter if the code
worked or if you got an exception then
execute this line of code no matter what
so this is optional it's an optional
line of code you can have that says
execute this no matter what simple
enough and what can we put we'll just
put loop complete
so run it so if they entered a stupid
number or a stupid string and got an
exception or they entered a real number
and it went fine no matter what the
finally occurs every single time all
right so that's pretty much it with
exceptions so whenever you think um the
user can break your code or cause it
caused an issue with your software then
put it in a try block now whenever you
want to handle a specific type of
exception put except in that type now
whenever you want to handle a general
exception and you don't really know how
the user is going to mess it up and you
can use accept and whenever you want a
certain bit of code to execute no matter
if the user had a user program correctly
or caused an issue then you can use
finally so yes exceptions are kind of
boring but they're necessary especially
whenever we're making gooeys because
well show you guys then so for now
