tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the directory
class a little bit so all you're going
to need for this tutorial is a button
and a little bit of code so once you
have your button on your form is go out
and click the bottom alright so is code
that you're going to need is basically
just a folder browser dialog and an if
statement checking to see if when the
folder browser dialog is shown that the
user actually selects that directory
also you're going to need to be using
the system that il namespace because the
directory class inside of it so once you
have that all checked out just go ahead
and type a directory to access the
directory class then using a dot
operator and now have access to all the
methods inside of the directory class so
the first method that we're going to be
looking at it could get files method and
the get files method which just says
returns that return the names of files
in the specified directory so basically
that just means that it will get on the
file name for every file that is inside
of the directory specified so we were to
go ahead and here and we're just going
to use the path to directory that user
selects using the folder browser
dialogue to FPD selected path so
basically this will just return a string
array of the path to every file inside
of the folder for example who to select
this folder right here we get a string
array with a path to each one of these
folders so it'd be like Adam slash
desktop slash test folder slash text
document 1x back to Impex document 3 so
we would get on an element in this
string array for each one of these
documents so if we go ahead here and
create a new string let's call it files
and we'll study equal to this basically
just what it returns and you can tell by
right here since it returns a string
right as you can see just like string
where the two brackets after screen
so now we can see the for each statement
to loop through every single file inside
of this our string array right here so
we're going to wear every side of this
file - right we just want it to display
in a message box so you can see this and
make sure that it's going so now we
should just get on three massive boxes
one for each of the documents inside of
this folder here yep one for each of the
text documents so the next method that
I'm going to show you is get directories
method and basically it will just get a
I'll just get all the directories inside
of this test folder review so we should
get on this one and this one both of
these are folders so they're directories
so it's going to go out of here instead
of saying get files you're going to stay
get directories so like I said before we
should get a message box now for
directory 1 and directory to directly
one directly to the final thing that I'm
going to show you that is in the
directory class is the get logical
drives left it and basically this will
just return on all the drives on your
computer so we just go ahead here and
we're going to do directory dot get
logical drives and this will just return
a string or a with every drive on it
cubed so and we're just going to set
equal to the string or an hour drives
and like I said before the toilet return
a string array with every single drive
on your computer so now we're going to
pour each statement a loop through the
string array so that we can see all of
the drives so if you're going ask such
as drives rare you're looking on a
message box display it
get c d e f g and i have a party drive
so yep that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on the directory class and the
neck tutorial we're going to be getting
a little bit more into the directory
class so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
