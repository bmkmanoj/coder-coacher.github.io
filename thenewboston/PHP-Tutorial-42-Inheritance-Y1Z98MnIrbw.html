another PHP tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm gonna be talking about
inheritance now before I go on you guys
probably notice something's different
from this story from last tutorial
already and that is because I'm working
with a new text editor and that is
because I have a video uploading on my
PC right now so I had to hop over to my
Mac to make these tutorials so I had to
download this text editor called text
Wrangler and never used it before but
they didn't have no pad plus plus for a
Mac so anyways if I do something stupid
like press a button or if I'm doing
something weird then you know just let
me know but anyways that's why I'm using
the new text editor I actually when I
uploaded this video I was gonna just
play call of duty but I just texted my
friend I'm like game time
and he's like I'm eating dinner then I'm
gonna see my girlfriend and so anyways
no call of duty for me tonight so just
making stories instead so good for you
guys bad for me so anyways let's get
right into it inheritance now
inheritance is one of the key reasons
why people prefer to use object-oriented
PHP one of the many reasons but one of
the biggest as well
now inheritance is a lot like clone I
think I taught you guys about clone last
time I'm not sure though it's pretty
much inheriting all the methods in all
the variables from one class it pretty
much takes everything from one class and
imports it into another class so uh if
you ever like read about it in a book
they'll give you like eighteen chapters
about it but that's basically all it is
so let's go ahead and get coding this by
the way it's a lot different typing on a
Mac than it is BC so yeah you didn't
need to know that but anyways class
let's go ahead and make a new class the
parent now whenever you use inheritance
you always have to inherit from some
class it's like a hierarchy like
whenever you in hair something like if
your grandma dies there always has to be
someone you inherit from you just don't
uninhibit from my god or whatever so
anyways the order we say this in is the
child inherits from
parent so the parent is gonna have the
class with all the stuff in it and the
child class is gonna be the class where
all that stuff goes into so anyways
let's go ahead and and by the way they
don't need to be named the parent I just
want to make a very descriptive name so
we don't get confused there so you can
name it class anything name it
tuna fish ham sandwich for all I care
anyways go ahead and make a variable in
here make sure it's public by the way
okay
okay Mac go and crazy on me already okay
public and I name something stupid like
p1 and go ahead and name this like I am
a variable make sure you spell it
totally wrong and let's go ahead and
make a function like function some
function looks like a pretty beautiful
function right there okay Mac take it
easy I should name my Mac Mac there we
go tab what the heck's this little
swirly key over here
Oh anyways alright let's go ahead and
just do something in this function like
echo
I am a funky monkey why not that sounds
ridiculous so anyways so we have a class
called the parent with variable and a
function this is just a normal regular
class but say we had another class right
here called class the child and we're
saying all right I made this other class
called the child and what I want to do
is I want to get this variable and this
function inside this class but I'm Way
too lazy to copy and paste it because
you know if I do that that's gonna
create a whole bunch of code anyways and
you know pretty much lazy is just the
biggest factor here so how can I get
everything in here in here without
having to retype it all well anytime you
want to inherit all the stuff from some
class what you need to do is this ext en
D s extends and write the name of the
class you want to inherit from right
after it so the parent looking good so
anyways before I go on I want to say one
thing whoever gave us the keyword extend
I just want to tell you this is the
worst choice of keyword ever this is
called inheritance so why not make this
word and hair it or inherits from I
don't know but anyways you have to use
this dumb word extends and it basically
means inherits from so now here's what's
happening behind the scenes whenever you
write extends the parent where you're
telling PHP is this this class right
here inherit everything from this class
right here so even though there's
nothing in this class
PHP knows that it inherited everything
in this class so whenever we make an
object that's of the child and we K say
all right the child has a variable
called p1 actually let's just go ahead
and type it so let's go ahead and make
an object child object equals new the
child so again what we're doing is we're
making an object from this class right
here and you're saying Bucky there's
nothing in that class well actually
there is there's a variable and a
function and it thinks to this right
here so we can go ahead and echo out
something like child object and like p1
and just go ahead and way too lazy to
type all that all right copy that and by
the way if you have a Mac and a PC you
always I always do this instead of
hitting like copy and paste i always
accidentally hit FN copy and paste and
it's annoying because the command key
and the control key are different on the
two keyboard so anyways watch out for
that if you have both computers because
it's extremely annoying so well it
definitely should change that some I
spell that right I guess we'll find out
in a little bit
so anyways check this out I made a child
object right here and I echoed out the
variable and the function and you're
saying alright Bucky but didn't you
forget to type that in that class right
there well since it inherited from the
parent class what it said it was it take
took everything from the parent class
and threw in the child class so you
though can't see it it's there trust me
so let me go ahead and save this and
open up my Google Chrome right there
refreshing move this over connection
what's going on here oh I see like
disconnected because I was inactive for
15 seconds okay overwrite that Oh oh my
god since I'm uploading this video
everything's going slow but let's go
ahead and refresh my web page now and
check this out I am a variable
there's my variable right here and I am
funky Munky there's my function right
here so what we did if I can move this
out of the way where's TextWrangler now
all right so what we did is we made a
parent class right here and you we
pretty much made two classes Class A and
Class B now we wanted everything from
Class A to go in the Class B but we are
way too lazy to type it so what we can
do instead is write extends the parent
right like that and now this Class B has
this variable and this function without
without having to retype it and if we
went ahead and made another variable and
set it equal to like 9 it would have
this variable this variable and this
function so that's pretty much the
concept behind inheritance without my
mess up pseudocode right there it's
pretty much a way of getting everything
from one class into another class
without having or type it or copy and
paste or anything like that so don't
read any books because they give you the
most weirdest most messed-up analogies
and metaphors and it just confuses you
that's all inheritance is right there so
anyways thank you guys for watching I
don't forget to subscribe I'm gonna try
to figure out how to use my Mac and I
guess I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
