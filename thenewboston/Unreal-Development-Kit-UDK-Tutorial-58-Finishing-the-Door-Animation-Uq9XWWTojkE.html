UDK Toro and in this story I'm just
gonna be finishing up our little
animation so again we have matinee open
and I'm not gonna be talking you guys
through all the buttons and gadgets in
this story because I want to show you
guys a real quick example of what man
they can do and then when I give you
guys a nice demonstration you guys
understand what MANET is and what it can
do then I can go through all these
buttons you guys will have a better
understanding of what the heck I'm
talking about
so anyways for now just stick with me so
I'm gonna go ahead and select this gate
because this date or this door is the
thing that I'm gonna want to move so the
very first thing I needed to do is I
need to add a new empty group and you do
that by right-clicking in this gray area
and hit new empty group by the way
everything in matinee needs to be
organized in a group so it's just one of
the little rules of matinee just so it
helps you organize your animation better
so I'm gonna say door moving group looks
pretty good so now I have a group and
now inside that group I can animate
things so again I know I'm going fast
but hey I just want to give you guys a
real quick demonstration I keep saying
that but you know I kind of want to
stress it so now with your group go
ahead and right-click this and this is
where you add all your individual
animations for this animation we just
want to move this door so we're gonna
want to add a new movement track right
there so now on this movement track we
can move things so if you go ahead and
in this area scroll out a little bit we
can see that this entire movie is 5
seconds long at the beginning of this
movie this door is where it is right now
however 3 seconds into this movie what I
want to do is I want to add a new
keyframe so I'm going to go ahead and
hit this and by the way a keyframe is
basically this you know
whenever my let me think let me shave
this way you know back in the olden
times well I get I got a even better a
way explain things a movie isn't made up
of fluid motion a movie basically and
I'm talking like regular movies like
Avatar Good Will Hunting all they are is
individual pictures or frames piece
together so each individual frame is
slightly different than the last one and
whenever you play mall together it
creates the illusion of motion so that's
all movies are just a bunch of pictures
that are a little bit different from
each other play together and when you
play them all together it creates the
illusion of motion so that's what we're
gonna be doing in this we're gonna be
adding one point in time right here at
the beginning and that's where our doors
and then three seconds later we're going
to want to say alright move our door
down here and whenever you do what it
does is it automatically creates that
movement from here to here so basically
what we're doing is we're giving it keys
or key frames that's what these little
orange and red triangles are again a key
frame or key is pretty much a checkpoint
a point in time where you're telling are
right movie at this point in time this
is where I want you to be so at zero I
want you to be up and at three seconds I
want you to be down and what the matinee
or what the UDK is going to do is it's
automatically going to know in between
that time I'm supposed to fill in all
the in-between stuff to give you the
illusion of motion so that's pretty much
what we're doing however you're noticing
all these other triangles this green one
and this red one I'll go over the green
one a little bit later but if these two
keys are the really big things we have
to worry about then what the heck is
this one this one to the right is the
overall length of our movie so from 0 to
3 seconds is where all the good stuff is
happening and then for the rest of the 2
against it just kind of sits there it's
like having an hour-long movie but
really your content is only like 20
minutes long so this is pretty much
wasted space right here so we can go
ahead and get rid of that so now our
entire movie is three seconds long and
our animation is three seconds long so
you know it kind of makes more sense
than having a three-second long
animation and have in our entire movie
five seconds long that wouldn't make
sense so now our animation is good to go
so it's going to start up there and then
whenever our user hits the trigger it's
gonna go ahead and slide that door down
just like that and huh someone texted me
I could restart this tutorial or I
couldn't check this text but I'm
definitely gonna check this text it's
from my mom and she says what is our
wireless password how am I supposed to
know I don't even live with my I live in
North Carolina my mom lives in New York
and she's sexting me saying what is my
wireless password I don't know so mom
I'll get that later now she's calling me
so anyways I'm gonna go ahead and X out
of that and I think everything is good
go as long as I didn't mess anything up
so now let me go ahead and right click
on the other side and hit play from here
and now check this out by default my gay
is up and now when I hit that trigger
it's gonna slide that gate down and I
can hop over it and shoot the statue
okay that was just inappropriate I
shouldn't done that so anyways there you
guys have a basic idea of what animated
or not anime
what matinee is they're basically the
same thing so now that you guys know
what it is and you saw a demonstration
abut I can begin teaching you guys with
all those little buttons and gadgets
means and how to make some really sweet
animations you can actually make an
entire 3d movie in here if you want to
but we won't be doing that so anyways
thank you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
