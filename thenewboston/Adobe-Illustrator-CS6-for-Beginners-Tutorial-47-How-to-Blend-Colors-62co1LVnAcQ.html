in this illustrated cs6 tutorial we're
going to learn how to blend two colors
and we're going to blend the fill colors
because you can't use or you can't blend
the stroke colors using the this method
that we're going to use here so let's go
ahead and create three at least three
objects because you got to have three or
more objects to use this technique so I
made three circles and the colors I
picked in this were RGB red RGB green
and RGB blue you can find those they're
usually right up here at the top see RGB
red RGB green and then RGB blue alright
now I got those and I have these on top
of each other the first thing I'm going
to do is select all these together I'm
going to go to edit and we're going to
go to edit colors and we've got a couple
blendings going on here we got blend
front-to-back blend horizontally and
blend vertically we'll start with blend
front to back and I'll click on it now
what this is going to do is it's going
to use the fill color of the front and
the back objects and it in whatever you
have selected and it's going to it's
going to use those as a starting and
ending colors in the blend and then it's
going to blend this one if I hit ctrl Z
and go back we're going to go to the
next one which is blend horizontally and
I click that and that's going to use the
fill color of the left side in the right
side and then that's going to be the
starting and ending colors of the blend
so this one gets blended and then you
can probably guess what this one's going
to do when you blend vertically it's
going to use the top and the bottom
objects so this one's at the top and
this one's at the bottom and it's going
to make use those colors to blend to
make this color here
so that's how you use that one pretty
easy now we're going to show you how to
do another thing called an automatic
blend and what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to use two colors let me get
out of this I'll put this color over
here to the side and I'll use these two
colors I Stanley double clicked it I'm
going to select these and for this
method you got to select two or more and
you don't have to select three just two
or more and we're going to go to the
object menu this time and we're going to
go to blend which is down here and then
all we're going to do is click make and
that's going to do a gradual blend in
between the objects as you can see
that's pretty cool now I can go ahead
and try to make do these three object
blend make and you can see how this
works it does it from a path that's like
pretty much straight on and I can use my
selection tools to move these around
which is pretty nice alright now the
next thing that I want to show you is
all you need to do to get rid of these
if you didn't if you don't like what's
going on is just hit ctrl Z and it'll
take the blend right off now there's
another one that we can think that we
can do what's blend these two colors
together object blend and then we'll go
to make so you got these here and you
don't really like it go to object blend
and release and it's going to just
release it there for you that way if
you're way too far into your project and
you then you realize that you don't want
the blend anymore
then you can release them that way you
just have to have the two objects
selected already have them selected you
can see that when you blend objects it
makes a path as well and the path is
what connects these two objects and
and gives you gives the object the
blending path that you're looking for so
you've got a one which can create colors
blended on top of or create another
color by blending two other colors and
then you've got another one that blends
gradually kind of like a gradient
between two objects now that's all I'm
going to show you for this set of
blending and then the next tutorial
ending blending techniques so stay tuned
for that and be sure to subscribe if it
doesn't get posted immediately to be
updated when it does get posted so
