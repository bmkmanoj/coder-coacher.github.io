biology video and in this video what I
wanted to do is basically continue where
we left off in the last video and that's
with step 3
and what molecule we had is ISO citrate
which is of course the six carbon isomer
of citric acid now the first thing that
it does in step number three is this
isocitrate right here it actually gives
one of its hydrogens to a molecule
called nad plus and this process forms a
new molecule called NADH so this
molecule is actually important later on
for forming a bunch of ATP's
so just take note that we have an NADH
molecule form in step number three
so once the isocitrate is done donating
one of its hydrogens in pretty much
forming an NADH then what it does is it
isn't done yet it actually releases a
co2 molecule and of course co2 has a
carbon in it so now this molecule is no
longer isocitrate because that's the
molecule with six carbons is now a five
carbon molecule and it actually has a
new name and this is going to be a pain
to spell this new five carbon molecule
is called alpha keto glue derived
so now just to repeat one last time that
in step number three basically what
happens is we start with isocitrate
which is an isomer of citric acid and
the first thing it does is it donates a
hydrogen atom to nad plus forming n a d
H was very important later on and then
after that a co2 gets removed from it
and it causes this isocitrate which was
a six carbon molecule to become a five
carbon molecule called alpha
ketoglutarate which is a very long and
annoying molecule to say so now let's go
ahead and take this alpha alpha
ketoglutarate I'm not even gonna say
anymore and let's go ahead and bring
this the step number four so step four
start with some sex to me alpha
ketoglutarate and remember that this is
a five carbon molecule so this is
actually gonna look pretty familiar
because the first thing that it does is
it donates a hydrogen - can you guess it
yes
another nad plus and whenever this
happens we end up with another in a d H
so actually this is pretty important to
remember because in steps three and four
we got an NADH and remember that every
one of these molecules is actually going
through the process twice so each of
these steps actually generate two NADH
is because remember in glide kosis what
happened is that glucose molecule split
into two acids so now even though I'm
showing this demonstration for one
molecule this is actually two molecules
per glucose so now after that's done
what happens is let me go ahead and
change my color again this is gonna look
very repetitive but it gives off a co2
and remember this is a four or
exceedingly this is a five carbon
molecule right now so what happens is we
now have a four carbon molecule because
we lost one carbon right here when it
gave off co2 so with this four carbon
molecule is going to do is
it's gonna combine with the enzyme and
I'll just write actually I should write
it up here so once it's done giving off
the co2 it combines with the enzyme
coenzyme a again look familiar
so whenever coenzyme a bonds with this
four carbon molecule it forms a new
molecule and this new molecule is called
sucks no Co a much fun or to say sucks
in all Co a so basically the summary is
in step number four of the crip cycle it
forms a CO 2 and an N a d H and also
this molecule which is now a four carbon
molecule combines with coenzyme a right
here in the end product of step number
four is succinylcholine no one says Co
uh except me so now we can take this
molecule right here and move on to step
number five step 5
so step number five is of course sucks
in all co uh that's why I'm gonna call
it right now I don't care if it's wrong
so basically what happens is a
free-floating phosphate group so I'll
just go ahead and write P right here
it's gonna go ahead and float around and
it's gonna trade places with that
coenzyme a and it's going to bond with a
sucks in home so remember this is
basically a molecule right here sucks in
all co a is a sucks in all which you
know was our original molecule and it
bonded with an enzyme coenzyme a well
now this coenzyme a is going to switch
places with this phosphate group right
here now whenever this happens we now
have a molecule well don't worry about
what it's called what's important is
that this phosphate that's now now
bonded with this sucks in no instead of
the coenzyme it's gonna get released
from the molecule and it's going to
combine with something called GDP so now
this phosphate gets released in this
phosphate I guess I'll draw it like that
it can by get combined let me pick a new
color with a molecule called g.d.p
now if you remember a DP meant had two
phosphates GDP also has two phosphates
so when it combines with this phosphate
that came from this molecule it's going
to turn into something called G T P now
I know I didn't talk about GDP or gtp
before but the only thing that you have
to remember is that gtp can actually be
used to make a teepee a teepee and of
course we know what a teepee is valuable
valuable energy in the cell so just
remember that in step number five what
happens is this coenzyme a that's bonded
with sucks in all gets lost and instead
it combines with a phosphate and
whenever the phosphate gets lost it
combines with the gdp to form GTP which
means three phosphates and this gtp can
be used to form ATP which is of course
energy for the cells I just said P like
eighteen times and now I have to go P so
I'm gonna see you guys in the next video
thank you guys for watching and
hopefully in the next video we can
finish up step six through eight which
is the Krebs cycle
so again thank you for watching and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
