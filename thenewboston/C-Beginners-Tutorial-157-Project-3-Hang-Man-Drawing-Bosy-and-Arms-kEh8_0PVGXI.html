tutorial then I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to continue working on our egg map
project here
alright so we're basically just going to
be drawing the characters body arms and
legs so we're first going to check to
see if the user passes through the
person's body so to say if BP or our
body parts enumeration right here equals
body parts body then look basically is
going to draw a straight line down from
the guy's head to simulate stick figures
body and I already have the code for
this all written out so you don't have
to watch me type it but I'm going to
explain it like always
alright so the first point is 60 90 and
60 is the X and 60 is the center of the
characters head on the x-axis and I know
this because the hangman post ends at 60
so this hangman post right here the
point of this is 60 50 so the X of it is
60 so if you want like the line of the
person's body to be on the same line
we're just gonna put 60 alright and we
have 90 because we added 40 for the
height of the character's head to this
50 so the character's head right here
then this is 40 that is 40 right there
so we just add 40 to 50 and then we get
90 for the person's body all right
and then 6170
since they're both on the same x-axis we
know that it'll be a straight line and
70 or 170 does means that it'll be way
farther down so they'll just have a
pretty long line will be 80 pixels long
alright so now let's just test this out
and make sure that it works we're gonna
draw a body part and then we're just
going to draw the body
alright so yep perfect just a straight
line down coming the right from his head
and it doesn't go into his face at all
alright so now let's draw the arms
so we're first going to check to see if
the user passes through any of the arms
or going to say xvp
equals body parts dot I guess we'll do
the left arm first and like always lab
the code all ready written so you don't
for watch me figure out key points and
basically I start at sixty one hundred
and sixty one hundred means that I'm
going to be on the same line as you guys
so far this draw the guy right here I'm
on the same line of his body since this
is it's this point right here is sixty
on the X and one hundred just means that
I'll be down from his body
so ninety is right here 100 would be
like right here and then thirty on the
x-axis would be about over here so if
you go over thirty so I'm about over
there and then we go up fifteen cent the
difference between one hundred and
eighty five is fifteen so you just go
off fifteen like about there and if we
were just connecting these two points
we'll get a diagonal line that's about
an arm so let's just test this hour here
we're going to say to our body part body
parts dot left arm and again just like
the eyes the left arm will be on our
left not on the characters left so now
maybe bug we get yep a left arm and now
we're just going to do the exact
opposite for the right arm so we're
gonna say Alice if the body part equals
our right arm and we're just going to
basically just draw a diagonally in the
opposite direction and I already have
the code here so all right so they both
start at 6,100 so just like before it'll
start right there it's down from the
guys and so they won't the arms don't be
coming out of his neck and then ninety
eighty five this time
so they're both on the same y-axis so
they'll both end up on this line right
there the question is though on the
x-axis where we want it to end up on
this line right here and we want to end
up at 90
so that would basically be just thirty
from the center since
center of this is 60 and we had 30 right
there so it's 30 from here we're just
gonna want to go an equal distance from
his neck right here so you can go over
at 30 and we should give something
similar to that all right
and now let's just test this out and
your aw is right on here so we're gonna
draw a right arm and we should get
something similar to that all right and
yep perfect all right so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on the next
tutorial we're going to finish him up
and draw his legs so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
