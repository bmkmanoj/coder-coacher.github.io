Android tutorial for the new boss in and
again just a quick review here what
we've done in last tutorial we basically
created a long that is gonna be a row ID
and we're gonna pass that long into
these methods called get name and get
hotness and that's going to return some
kind of a string Forest which we're
gonna set to our return name and we're
just gonna you know set our edit text to
whatever that string is being returned
so now let's go into our hot-or-not java
class and what we're gonna do is we're
basically going to set up you know both
these methods and they're pretty much
gonna be the same because again we're
getting the row ID and we're just going
to return a string of some sort so again
it's pretty simple for the most part of
this is review again we need a cursor
that's gonna read some data for us so
let's set that up just cursor C equals
our database again we're going to quarry
it and again we need to enter a table
name which is gonna be our table name
and we're also going to set up you know
our columns name which we're just gonna
copy from this get data up here it's
gonna be pretty much the same or it is
gonna be the same and again that's what
our columns is going to be for a second
parameter just our string array that has
all of our columns in our database and
this time we're actually going to do
something a little different what we're
gonna do is we're going to for the
selection here we're gonna set up
basically our long or a row ID that
we're getting passed in so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna say key
underscore row ID and then we're gonna
say plus equals in quotations and then
plus RL that we're getting passed in and
then everything else is gonna be set to
null all right so basically the only
thing that's different again is for a
third parameter instead of having this
set to null what we're doing is we're
getting our row ID and we're setting
that equal to whatever is being passed
in again what's being passed in as
that whatever is in that edit text for a
row ID now we want to do is we want to
check if the cursor is set to null so
we're just gonna say if cursor is not
set to know again that's expression mark
we're going to basically return the data
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
say we have to first set our cursor to
move to first you might be thinking
that's the first row in our database but
actually again since we're passing and
with which real worker sir is looking
for it's gonna move to you know this row
that we're passing in and we have to
call that method for this you know for
us to look through it and then all we're
gonna do is set up a string call the
hotness or actually a name we're gonna
set this string equal to our cursor dot
get string and we're gonna put one here
and then what we're gonna do is we're
gonna return our name so again just to
quickly talk through everything that
we've done because pretty much our get
hotness that's going to be the same
thing for the most part again we set up
our columns and we set up our cursor
which is gonna look for the row that's
being passed in and then as long as our
cursor is not null we're gonna move to
that row for the most part and we're
going to get the string data of our
first column now quickly just to go back
because this is a little bit new I'm
just gonna scroll up to where we said
get data before because this is kind of
the same concept we had you know
something like this instead of a number
but basically what we're doing is we
have three columns again our column row
column name and column hotness and last
time we set up these ends but basically
what's happening is our call our row was
our first column so that's at position 0
our name is our second column that's
position 1 and this is positioned too so
if we're returning our name we can also
just say if we know which column it is
we can just say position 1 which will be
our second column because again
everything in
for the most part starts at 0 1 2 3 etc
so this will be our name column and then
we're gonna return our name and then if
our cursor is set to null it's just
going to return a null so it's only
going to return our name if this works
here so that's kind of the set up we're
just going to copy this and paste it
within our or actually copy right here
and paste it within our hotness and all
we're gonna change is basically which
cursor we're getting because again our
hotness is in our third column which is
0 1 2 so we're gonna look for you know
the hotness column and it's gonna get
hot Ness something like that and it's
gonna return that hotness so now let's
just run our application and make sure
everything works again for the most part
this this section we're just getting the
name and stuff it's kind of review
because we've done it before but again I
just kind of wanted to talk over it
because I'm not sure if I specified it
clearly so again let's just view our
database we have two entries so let's
say we want the second entry we're gonna
put two here and then we're gonna say
get information as you can see it pulls
up Samantha and 7 which is again our
second entry and we can also do one get
information pulls up this now just just
a note if we put like 5 it's going to
give us an error it's going to crash a
program so hopefully the person enters
the right you know the right number but
uh oh I'll catch you guys in the next
tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
