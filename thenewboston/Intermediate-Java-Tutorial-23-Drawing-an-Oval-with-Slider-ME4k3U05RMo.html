to your let's see twenty-third
intermediate Java tutorial and in this
tutorial let me show you the little
program we are going to be building
we're going to be building this little
jframe here and it has a circle in it
which slides so we're going to be taking
a break from applets for mmm about a
week maybe and we're going to be
learning more about gooeys because it's
a huge part of applets and once we get
drawing done with a g and you know don't
worry about it just to pay attention to
this tutorial and a you know that's all
you need to worry about and another
thing I want to mention before I get
started is I got a new fish this weekend
so if you guys are interested in that
there will be a video in my update later
tonight so you guys can check him out
his name is poppy and my sister named
him and he's the best fish in the world
so now what we're going to be doing is I
showed you we're going to be drawing
that oval and also be learning how to
use the J slider so what tools that we
need in order to do that well we're
going to be setting up three classes
here and the first one is we're going to
make a class specifically to draw the
oval itself and what this is going to do
we're going to pass it in a diameter
it's going to check if that diameter
first of all has to be greater than zero
because you can't draw anything if the
diameter is less than zero and then once
it validates it it's going to pass it in
and paint it on the panel itself in the
panel on a window is like the body of a
website it's that big white part so not
the window itself so let's go ahead
enough we'll be talking let's go ahead
and get started so go ahead and the
first variable we need to set up is the
diameter so put private
it would just be integer d and let's set
it equal to anything to begin with our
window zone you're going to be like 200
by 200 so let's by default set it equal
to 10 so now as soon as our oval pops up
on the screen and when I say oval it's
going to be a circle but anyways it's
going to have a diameter of 10 now this
isn't going to be changed until we get
input from
user to change it and the input from the
user we would be getting is whatever
they slide the slider to so we'll see
that later on but anyways next we need a
graphics object because without a
graphics object we can't draw anything
on the screen and once we have our
graphics object we can actually paint
this oval on screen so go ahead and put
public void paint component hopefully I
spelled that right and of course you
pass it in a graphics object and the
first thing that we want to do is fix
that and all right what we wanted to do
is called paint component from the
superclass and this perhaps our graphics
object so it's going to be ready to draw
so remember anytime you want to call a
method from the superclass and the
superclass
don't forget is jpanel right here so
whatever we extend is our superclass put
super dot paint component hopefully i
spelled that right and pass it in g and
what this does is essentially prep our
graphics object for drawing so now that
we actually have a graphics object we
can draw so let's go ahead and do that
put g dot and in order to draw a circle
on your screen the method for this is
fill oval and what this does is it
paints a solid circle or oval on the
screen this is built in method so we
don't have to build this later on and as
you see we have four parameters that it
takes XY this is position where it's
going to appear on the screen and width
and height now the width and height are
going to be the same in this case since
we're drawing a perfect circle but you
cannot change them if you want so let's
go ahead and where do we want it to
appear on the screen well let's put it
at ten ten you can put yours it like
fifteen fifteen if you want but don't go
any more than that now the width and
height this is the thing that's going to
be changing depending on how big to the
left or the right they slide their
slider so this is since this is going to
be a dynamic value we want to pass in a
variable instead of just a constant
number such as 10 or 20 so go ahead and
pass
d &amp;amp; D so now it's going to take whatever
value D is which is in this case 10 and
it's going to draw a circle that's 10 by
10 which is perfect circle at this
location but then if they change the
slider to let's say 50 then it's going
to draw a bigger circle with a 50
diameter at this location so now that we
got our paint component method set up
that's all we have to do for this method
so what do we need to do after this well
the one kind of check that we need to do
is we need to make sure that the
diameter that is passed in is greater
than zero
because if we say all right Java draw a
circle with a diameter of negative three
it's kind of like WTF are you talking
about I can't do that so that's what
we're going to check for so go ahead and
put public void set D and we're going to
pass in just an INT new D and this
pretty much means pass it in a new
diameter so in order to do this what we
need to do is check well let's see first
of all we want to change our diameter to
whatever value they're passing in so set
D which remember is our diameter equal
to and instead of having a whole if
statement here's a compressive statement
that you can do just put the new D that
they passed in if it's greater or equal
than zero then put a question mark and
this pretty much means if we're going to
set it equal to the value they passed in
so if it's greater than zero then take
whatever value they passed in and use
that value and instead of writing else
statement we can just put a colon right
there let me say else 10 so what this
means means in summary is our a they're
going to pass in a new number using the
slider which we're going to be learning
it in the next tutorial if that number
is greater than zero then go ahead and
use that number but if that number is
less than zero then someone effed up
sooner or later so
they effed up or if we have tup then
just use 10 right there so then our
program won't shut down it will just use
the default value of 10 so once you're
done validating your diameter what do
you need to do well you need to call
this paint method again because if you
have a new diameter you have to paint
the new circle on screen so in order to
do this just go ahead and call a repaint
and what repaint does is this is a
billing method as well
it automatically calls the paint
component method from the same class so
you don't have to call paint component
over and over again just once you
painted once just call repaint and it's
kind of paint whatever we define this
method to be up here so the two other
things to other methods I'm going to be
going over in this tutorial is you don't
really need to learn them they're just a
housekeeping methods for a layout
manager but make sure you include them
on public dimension get get preferred
size got type that slow so I don't mess
it up and it doesn't take any arguments
and again I said you don't really need
to learn this but if you're curious what
it does is it's used by the layout
manager to determine the preferred size
so go ahead and return a new dimension
turn new dimension just put like 200 by
200 and don't worry if you don't know
what that does for now but I only got
two minutes so the last one is another
housekeeping and this is used by layout
manager to determine the minimum size
and again these are built-in methods
don't really worry about this isn't what
the tutorial is about but it's a
necessity in our program so public
dimension get
minimum size hopefully I spelled that
right looks good and return get
preferred size so then they'll be the
same you just copy that and we're yet
paste right there so now go ahead and
check your program for errors and if you
are good to go then you're ready to move
on to my next tutorial so in this
tutorial one last time we pass that
diameter by default and this is what's
going to paint as soon as the program
starts up we made a way of painting the
circle on the screen
and we also said all right whenever we
decide to change our diameter we need to
check to make sure it's greater than
zero if it is use that one if it isn't
just use ten by default and then paint
the circle again on your screen so we
can actually see a changing circle and
then lastly we did these two
housekeeping methods just because we
need them I'll tell you about them in a
compute tutorials but that's it all for
now I'm going to go play with my fish so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
