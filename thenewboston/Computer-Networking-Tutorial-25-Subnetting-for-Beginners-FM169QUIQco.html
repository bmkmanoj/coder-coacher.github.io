to invent the Internet and we're getting
aggravated because we're already running
into a bunch of problems first of all we
need to assign an identification number
to each device but a we have a limited
amount of memory I mean back then if you
want to buy a new hard drive it's
probably going to take up like three
rooms in your house so memory really you
know it wasn't cheap back then like it
is today so we can't just like add more
bits to this IP address because we're
limited in that aspect and also we're
scratching your head because we don't
know how big the networks that are going
to make up the Internet are going to be
maybe this one has you know a hundred
computers maybe it's just like a college
maybe some other country is making a
network and they have you know tens and
thousands of computers what the heck are
we supposed to do now we already learned
in the last video that we're going to
need to break this up eventually so that
one part is for the network and one part
is used to identify the host and we
can't just stick this anywhere because
again like I said networks are different
sizes so some brilliant guy walks in and
he's like you know what what if you
added some information that said how big
your network was going to be but then
everyone yelled at them because they're
like hey dude we told you we only have
32 bits that can transfer across the
network
we can't just you know add like 1 0-0
some special code to say how big your
network is so we're like alright dude
get out of here we're done with you
you're fired so he's like well we'll
hold on let me get this straight so you
only want to use 32 bits for the IP
address and you also don't want to waste
any IPS so you don't want to put a hard
break anywhere and also you want the
size of the networks to be different for
example someone has a small network you
want someone else to have a big network
and everything can work out fine you
want it to be flexible you know what I
have a solution for you guys and this is
what he came up with ladies and
gentlemen welcome to subnetting now what
that guy said is you know what
keep your
32 bit IP address I know that computers
aren't really that advanced right now
they can't handle numbers longer than 32
bits so here's what we're going to do
whenever two computers try to
communicate with each other we're going
to send them the IP address just like
before right like this we're also going
to send them an additional 32 bit number
this is called the subnet mask now
whenever we see a one this represents
that this portion of the IP address is
for the network whenever we have a zero
that portion of the IP address is for
the host
so all subnet masks that you see there
are always a string of ones followed by
a string of zeros that's all they are
now this means in this example that the
first 20 bits of the IP address is
designated as the network address the
last 12 right here these last 12 can be
used to identify the hosts the
individual computers now another guy was
like alright that sounds dumb we already
had that problem what happens when you
know we have a smaller network and it
doesn't have that many computers well
all we have to do is take this subnet
mask and change it to 1 1 1 1 and now we
can designate 24 bits to the network
identifier and only eight bits to
identify the host so we can have
networks that are smaller or bigger and
we never exceed that 32-bit number now
if you're wondering Ari why is this
useful why do we even care that the
system is designed this way well let's
think about it
whenever we design a system in this way
it can move a lot faster it's a lot more
efficient now let's think about just
sending a letter to your friend who
lives in Texas or whatever for just a
second whenever we send them a letter
and we pass it through the mail system
no single person in that mail system
knows where everyone in America lives
you have one person that handles it
first and they make sure it gets to the
right state then it goes to another
person and they make sure it gets to the
right County and it goes to another
person and then makes
gets to the right Street so no one
central location has all this
information instead we have multiple
different devices that can fastly
inefficiently transfer that data or that
letter correctly now I'll show you guys
this example so for the network portion
of it all it does is it says okay this
is where I'm sending it it's very simple
and it breaks it down and this is also
why we can have 6000 Bob Williams in
America and we don't have any problems
because yes we have a bunch of Bob
Williams's but only one of them lives it
like 864 Maple Drive in Texas so it
doesn't become a problem now for the
network portion of this whenever the
network is trying to send data this is
what it sees okay I'm just going to make
sure that this data gets to the correct
network that's all I'm going to do what
happens after that not my problem it's
kind of like whenever on the mail person
delivers the letter to someone's house
yeah who's this letter for is it for
little Mary my little sister is it for
my mom my dad is it for me hey I'm just
giving it to the house after that you
guys decide you know whose mails who's
not my problem that's pretty much how
this system works as well the network is
just responsible if we're taking that
data sending it to the correct network
it doesn't really care about the info to
individual computers and then once it
gets that network it says okay let's rip
out this portion of the IP address I'm
going to look through all of my
individual hosts in my network the
individual computers and I'm going to
take the data and send it to the right
one so that ladies and gentlemen is the
basics of how the internet works how you
can send and receive data and it always
goes to the right computer and how you
can post your selfies and send pictures
of whatever you want to your girlfriend
so yeah hope you understood it if you
have any questions ask me in my forum
and I'll see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
