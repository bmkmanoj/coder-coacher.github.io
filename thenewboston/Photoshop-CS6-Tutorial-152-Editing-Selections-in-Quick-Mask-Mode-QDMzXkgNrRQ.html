we're going to be going over how to
modify selections in your quick mask
mode and this is in Photoshop cs6 so
what we're trying to do here is when you
make a selection so go ahead and load it
up an image and make a selection and the
selection isn't quite working out that
great for you you can see in my
selection some of the bottom has been
selected that I don't want and some
inside the cherry some of the white
spots and the cherry and then the stem
have been selected as well and I don't
really want those to be selected so I'm
going to use quick mask mode to quickly
get rid of that stuff so go ahead and
select your quick mask mode over here
and if you look at this you can see that
clicking on edit in quick mask mode is a
good way to see what you really have
selected in your image so let's go ahead
and select our brush tool and we make
sure we have black on there and I'm just
going to switch over to my channels
panel so I can always see what I'm doing
in my quick mask and then start I'm
going to start drawing my image here our
painting on it to start selecting parts
of the image that may have been selected
that are may have not or may have been
selected so I'm going to switch to my
white here to get a rid of some of my
selection especially this stuff down
here that didn't want selected now I'm
not going to be like super meticulous
about that this because I don't want to
waste your guys this time you don't want
to watch me just doing mundane stuff but
now you have the idea you know that you
can now edit in quick mask mode and edit
and edit your Mac's that you already
have existing so go ahead and you can
zoom in to see what you've got
we don't have in a
thing like that it's a good way to see
what your mask has in it already and
everything and see how good your mask
was made like you can see here that some
of my cherry doing it
it didn't get masked here and now we
know what we need to work with and
everything like that so now you know how
to modify your selections with your
quick mask mode and once you're done go
ahead and click on the Edit in standard
mode and then everything that you all
the selections and masking and
everything that you uh that you messed
with it is now all applied to the
selection now and no mask has been made
you have a selection there's nothing in
the channels panel anymore so this is a
good way to edit up your selections
nicely without having to use something
like the quick selection tool to just do
that stuff you have a lot more control
when you use the quick quick mask tool
and start paint using your paintbrush
here so that's how you do that and
that's all I wanted to show you remember
that you can double click to bring up
the mask options and change the color or
opacity if you really need to so that's
all I'm going to show you today for how
to modify your selections in the quick
mask mode and thanks for watching and I
look forward to seeing you guys in my
upcoming tutorials
have a good one everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
