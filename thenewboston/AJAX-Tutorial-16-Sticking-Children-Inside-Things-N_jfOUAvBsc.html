remember whenever you create an
unordered list
you have your unordered list tags and
then in between there you have list item
tags so of course anytime we want to add
a new element to this we put L I so what
we did basically is we created an Li to
put inside our unordered list an element
to put inside another element simple
enough so now what we need to do is
remember let's go ahead and take a step
back and look at HTML whenever you
create an unordered list you put list
items inside that and in between those
tags you go ahead and write whatever
text is in your list kind of like this
unordered list unordered list and then
you go to ahead and put list item list
item and then text in here so basically
the only thing we have to do is we need
to create this text so let me go ahead
and delete that because that wasn't
valid code so let's just go ahead and
name this variable text one and of
course anytime we want to create a text
node that's basically what text is a
node because everything is a node
document dot create text node is what
the function is called and we'll just go
ahead and put what's one of my favorite
things old Dan
I guess he's my favorite so now what we
want to do is we want to say okay we
want to stick this text inside this
element so why do we do this and why
doesn't it just you know figure it out
for us well the reason is because we do
this because we're going to be creating
a lot of different elements in a lot of
different text nodes now the reason that
we need to explicitly say I'll go ahead
and write the thing first item one
penned child text 1 now what I'm
basically saying in this line and this
is kind of like the last line we need to
really pay attention to is append child
means put something inside something
else so what we're saying is put this
text inside the Li tags so this was a
text node we want to put it inside the
Li and that's kind of how everything
works kind of you know in a CSS HTML XML
whenever something is a child of
something else
it means it's inside it kind of like
your child and you were inside your
mother and I mean that when you're a
baby not you know in some kind of weird
kind of way but basically this div is a
child of this body the script is a child
of this head the head is a child of this
HTML so that's basically what child
means to be inside something else so now
what we basically did is we created an
unordered list and we didn't really do
anything to it yet but we will
eventually and we created a list item
and we also created text in on this line
right here we put the text inside the
list item so now let me go ahead and
just copy this because I won't you know
type everything out because you know you
guys get got things to do alright so let
me go ahead and put two two text to text
two and three three three three all
right so now I just got to change this
what's another one my favorite things um
tuna
I'll put chicken wings in tuna chicken
wings in tuna all right so let me go
ahead and give me a little more space to
work with all right so basically what we
have here is three bits of text inside
three list items but if we take a look
at this we didn't a pen any of these
list items or we didn't stick them
inside the celestia so even though the
text is where it needs to be in between
the list items what we need to do now is
we need to put all the list items inside
this unordered list so you guys can
probably figure out how to do that
and I guess I can just do this oops what
the WTF alright so list dot append child
which pretty much means stick something
inside this list well what do we need to
stick inside well we need to stick
inside this which is item one and now
I'm just use my nice copy and paste
feature right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
