tutorial on XHTML last time we learn
about colors and headings and how to
make paragraphs and today I'm going to
teach you how to make a line break in
your paragraph how to align your
paragraphs and also how to make a simple
list if we have enough time now as you
can see I've cleared out our body and
added two simple paragraphs one right
here and one right here so let's take a
look at those and see how they look as
you can see every paragraph that we make
has a blank line above and below it now
sometimes this is the effect that you
want but other times you don't you just
want a line from to go from one to the
next line and keep going on and you want
a break in here somewhere and the
achieve this effect is very simple so
let's get rid of this right here and say
you want it to break right here so you
wanted it to look kind of just like that
as you can see it right now with this
line and then this line continuing on
now if we if we surrounded these with
paragraph tags then we wouldn't be able
to achieve this because they're just be
a space in between it so what we need to
do is add a special tag called a break
tag what a break tag does is allow the
line to continue on without having a
space now it's kind of a special tag
because it doesn't follow the same
format that I've been teaching you
before with an opening and an ending tag
it's just one single tag
and the reason for this is that you
never put anything in between a break
tag it's always stand alone and the only
has one function you don't need to put
anything in between ever and you never
add a attribute to it so the tag for
break is this less than sign BR for
break and anytime you have a
self-contained tag or a tag that stands
alone the slash goes at the end and you
close off just like normal so now we
should have hello a space because this
thing's still a paragraph this is a
paragraph line and then no space and
then it'll continue on it's easier just
to see it so let me show you how it
looks
as you can see this is our paragraph and
right here is where we added the break
now as you can see the difference
between this is in a paragraph that
there is a space right here and then a
break it doesn't space it just keeps
going on now if you look at this right
here you would say all right all this
text is aligned to the left hand side of
the website but what if I wanted to
align in the center what if I want to
align to the right hand side well this
is easy as well let's close out of this
instead we wanted to align this
paragraph to the center now you can
apply the line attribute either to the
paragraph or the body will apply it to
paragraph for now so after P type space
align and if we wanted to align to the
center we put equals and type center in
quotation marks now this paragraph
should be aligned to the center so let's
take a look
as you can see this hello still aligned
to the left because it wasn't enclosed
in the P tag and the entire paragraph is
lined to the center of the page now when
you're aligning you have three options
to the left hand side to the center into
the right hand side why to fall all
browsers automatically align your text
to the left hand side so if you want to
line it to the left hand side you don't
need to type anything but if you want to
align it to the center or to the right
then you have that you use the align
attribute which is a line equals then
type either center or right in your
value spot surrounded by quotation marks
and as I said this can either be applied
to the P tag for paragraphs or the
entire body if you want to align your
entire body and that's all the time we
have for now but in the next tutorial
I'm going to be teaching you about the
three different types of lists it's an
easier way to organize information
besides paragraphs and if you're not
already there you can go to ww Boston
calm and check out all my tutorials and
I'll give you a step-by-step guide so
you can follow along easier thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
