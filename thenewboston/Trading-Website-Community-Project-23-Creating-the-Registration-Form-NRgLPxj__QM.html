done with all the boring maintenance
stuff we can finally hop over to
register dot PHP and start working on
this main page the page that we have
been waiting to work on forever so the
very first thing we need to do is if we
go ahead and look at our register dot
PHP page right now we have nothing on it
we don't even have the logo or anything
all of that stuff is in this right here
the header and search chord code so in
order to use this function right here
the only thing that we need to do is we
already included the file so now what we
need to do is we need to go ahead and
write under wrapper go ahead and add
some PHP tags PHP just like that and now
we go ahead and call the function it's
better if we just copy it header and
search code now we just go ahead and
paste that baby right there and
essentially what this is going to do is
it's going to go ahead and run this
function right here now this one little
line this is responsible for adding the
logo the links the search bar all the
categories this is what it does so how
awesome is that instead of having the
code all of this and all of this and all
of this crap on every single page we
just add this one line of code to every
single page that we want our header on
and it's all there for us pretty sweet
huh so now let's go ahead and just work
top from bottom right to left so we
already got all this taken care from the
search bar and above the next thing is
this image right here now obviously I'm
not going to go ahead and create this
image I already created the image and
i'll upload it um whenever you guys can
download all these files i'll include
this as well but anyways i just went
ahead and I made a simple image so in
order to include that let's just go
ahead and write image source equals and
I actually stored this in an images
folder and it's called register
banner dot ping and let me just go ahead
and the image tag and now that's all
there is on that left hand section now
on the right-hand section that is where
the form is so let's go ahead and create
this form right now so the very first
thing in the form is of course the form
tag now I'm just going to go ahead and
hopefully you remember all the CSS for
this but the ID is general form now the
class which basically gave it the width
i believe is container and the method we
are going to set this equal to post and
let me just go ahead and set the action
to blank for now now remember the
register tag was basically that main or
excuse me the heading 3 was basically
the main title of the form that's what
we styled in CSS and I'm just going to
go ahead and put register right here
pretty much just tells the user what
you're supposed to do or what the form
is being used for and now after this I
want to include a little bit more PHP I
want to pretty much echo out a variable
and I didn't create this variable yet
but we will soon is called air
underscore message now what this
variable is going to do is it's pretty
much going to test if you have any error
messages and echo it out now the cool
thing about echoing out this variable is
if you don't have any error messages
then it's not going to echo anything
you're just going to get a blank thing
like that but if you do then it's going
to show your error messages right here
and that's basically how you can make a
dynamic form that shows error messages
at the top by outputting a variable and
it has the option if that variable is
set equal to something to pretty much
display an error message but if you
don't have any error messages then I
won't do anything although I just said
that so now we can go ahead and make the
fields now remember we have um how many
fields i can t remember myself use your
name email and password and button so
basically three different fields so
let's go ahead and do that
now now in order to make a field let me
just go ahead and make a div and set the
class equal to field you just go ahead
and that div right now so I don't forget
now since we have three different fields
I'm just going to go ahead and copy this
and paste it three times so the first
one is going to be for the user name the
second one is going to be for the email
and the third one is going to be for the
password that's the three pieces of
information that we need from the user
before they can register now in order to
make a little label we basically have
two parts of each field first is a label
to tell the user what you're supposed to
type in the input section and next is of
course the input section so the first
thing we need to make is the label now
in order to make the label for these
forms go ahead and type the word label
and next go ahead and type what it's for
and I'm just going to go ahead and put
username and now in between the
beginning and ending label tag I'm just
going to go ahead and write use your
name with one of those things but look
out Colin's there we go kind of a brain
fart for a second now since all of these
three fields have labels going to work
this copy and paste magic and do the
same thing for each one so the first is
username the second is email and I'll
just go ahead and write email right
there and the third is password
password</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
