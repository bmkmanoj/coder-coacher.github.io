video I'm going to show you guys a
really cool way to get the largest or
smallest elements from a list or set and
if you guys are like oh my god this is
like beginner stuff I'd know I'm just
going to have a list I'm going to sort
it and then I'll get like the last three
elements or the first three depending on
how I sorted it but the question is what
happens if you have like a custom object
like what happens if you has have a
employee class and they have ID numbers
in names and I don't know like their
profession and their salary and you need
to sort them all by salary or ID number
how the heck do you do that well welcome
to heap q so heap Q is essentially just
a special type of EQ algorithm and it
just allows you to sort stuff really
easily I'm going to show you guys a cool
tricks but before let's just go ahead
and use it to sort something really easy
so I'm going to pretend that I have a
list of grades let me just pick the Mike
of will say that we yet can upgrades
more than 100 so I'll do like 130 266 99
and 5 whatever alright so I have a bunch
of random numbers in there and say that
I want to get like the three highest
grade so maybe I'm a teacher and I'm
going to take the three highest grades
from every student and average them
together whatever so what we can do is
this we can use heap queue and we can
just say n largest so this allows you to
get a certain number of largest items so
if you only want the biggest one you can
just type 1 if you want the 3 biggest
ones then just like 3 right there and
the other parameter that it takes is
just what is data said that you're
trying to find so grades so what we're
saying is looking grades and give me the
3 largest values run and boom so it work
orders it nicely for you so 654 532 and
132 alright pretty cool but you know we
could probably have the
that earlier I mean we already know how
like the sort list and we can just get
like the first three elements ourselves
so nothing special so the question
becomes why is this useful well let's
say that we had a data set like this
hold on hold on copying it alright so I
just copied that I had it so you know I
didn't think you guys should watch me
type all this so this is pretty much a
list of dictionaries now even though
this is just a list of dictionaries you
can actually use this method on your own
custom class so if you had a class of
like NHL players or your friends or
anything so it's going to work the same
I just wanted to give you guys a quick
little data set for this tutorial so
what we're going to do in this case is
let's say that we wanted to give what am
I going to try to find I don't know
maybe I was buying stocks and I wanted
to find the two cheapest
stocks so of course right now we can see
that those are F and this is actually
forward and this tuna is actually a
company I made it up so Apple Google
forward Microsoft and tuna but let's say
that we had like a thousand and we
wanted to find the cheapest ones so what
we could do is this print keep queue
just like before and anytime you want
the smallest let's say we want the two
smallest you use n smallest and of
course the first one is how many values
that we want just two and the second one
is of course what is the data set that
you're trying to have me sift through
well just these stocks right here but
now check this out so these elements
right here they don't just have one
value like a list they have a ticker
they have a price maybe they have an ID
number maybe I have like a datum for
some reason whatever so this is only
going to work with a simple data set
however if you want to sort by price
then you can actually add the attribute
is the last thing so we already know how
lambdas work great I think I made it
sore about those so what we're going to
do is we're going to say lambda make a
really quick compact function and for
each stock just give me the stock
price now again you can put ticker in
here you can put price you can put any
attribute for your object or whatever
say you're trying to sift through and
check this out boom or roast it so it
returns this is actually from before
right here but this returns Ford in tuna
so how freaking awesome is that if you
guys ever try to sort your own custom
classes or objects it was probably a
pain in the butt but boom roasted there
you go so again whenever you're using a
simple set you can use just two
parameters whenever you're using your
own custom objects or a more complex set
like this whether it's JSON or your own
custom one or your classes or whatever
do this boom rose that thing guys for
watching I'll see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
