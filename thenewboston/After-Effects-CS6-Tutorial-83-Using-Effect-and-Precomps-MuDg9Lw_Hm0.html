Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial in this tutorial I
want to show you how to take certain 3d
layers and put them into a new
composition so you can just affect those
with certain effects that you want to
put on so what I mean is I'm gonna take
this gear that's here and I want to take
this CS TV and put them in a new
composition so I can put in an effect on
them that way it's not going to affect
my background layer at all or if you
have other 3d objects in here and you
put a try to put like an adjustment
layer or something like that on there
it's not going to affect those either
and you can do it all at once instead of
putting like effects on each layer which
can get tedious if you have a lot so I'm
gonna come to down to here to my layers
panel and I'm gonna select each of these
together I'm gonna come up to the layer
up here on the on the layer drop-down
menu and come to pre-compose and just
name it whatever new boss'd
whatever you want to name it doesn't
matter just make sure it's relevant to
what you're working on so everybody
knows what's going on now as you can see
the lights don't even affect this
anymore and it looks weird all the
material properties on it are gone the
way to fix that is to come down to this
column here and collapse the
transformations and now we've got all of
our stuff back we can now throw an
effect on there like I'm gonna throw on
curves
and you can see now that the layer
affects both but does not affect or the
effect affects both of these layers but
does not affect my background layer at
all
go like that and I'll just throw
something funky on there I know it
doesn't look awesome but it's on there
so that's how you organize things a
little bit better so that you can add
effects to certain 3d layers and have
all the properties still show up now I'm
just gonna turn this effect off real
quick and I want to remind you that you
don't have to click on this 3d cue
button to make it 3d at all because it
already is
the layers if I double click on this are
already in 3d within this layer or
within this pre-comp so when I click on
3d it really doesn't do anything now I
it messes with the effect though so if I
try to turn this curves back on by
clicking on this effect button and now
it's not all screwed up if I take it off
and now I can use the D effect so make
sure you don't have your 3d cube on and
that's just a helpful tip in case you
can't figure out why your effects aren't
working because it it just happened to
me when I was making the tutorial
earlier and it caused me to be mad at my
computer and I couldn't figure it out
for a second and then I saw that I had
stupidly checked that by accident
thinking that I needed to but and I
didn't so you live and you learn
hopefully you guys can understand how
this works and see its uses and I thank
you for watching and I want to see you
guys at the next tutorial because it's
been great making these tutorials for
you guys thank you guys have a good one
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
