game with Python and PI OpenGL tutorial
video from sent decks for bucking the
new Boston in the last video what we
were working on was our Glu perspective
and now we're ready to modify basically
we're where we start sort of in relation
to our cube so we're gonna use GL trans
translate F and geo translate officially
multiplies the current matrix by a
translation matrix so what it really
does is it lets you kind of move about
the object and the parameters that you
pass through here are just XY and Z and
you'll see what I mean in a moments
about moving about the object it you
know syndrome again so we're just going
to pass through 0.0 0.0 and then we'll
pass negative 5.0 okay so what this
means is like we could pass through
values here and again just like Glu
perspective and just like the importance
of order here I will show you once we
have a cube up on screen you can
actually have kind of a fun time editing
some of this stuff because OpenGL is
pretty much gonna duck draw whatever you
throw at it so sometimes you can draw
some pretty funny looking things anyway
this will be our basically negative 5
means we're gonna take five unit steps
back and from our cube otherwise if you
don't do negative five our cube will be
the screen and we'll have no idea the
cube is even there uh-huh
but it's there so we take negative five
well I guess if you took negative five
steps back you would actually take five
steps forward so we're actually going to
take five sites back and or five units
back and then we'll see our actual cube
so the next thing that we're gonna cover
is rotate so we can also do GL row
teh f and this is basically this
actually takes four parameters this
takes the angle then XYZ and so the
angle will just say 20 degrees and then
X will just have 0 and then 0 and then 0
so X Y Z all zeros but as you modify
these that's what's gonna basically like
tilt things so I'll show you what I mean
by that probably again once we render
the cube so let's work on actually
rendering the cube so we have a Wow
true and this is where we throw in our
typical PI game event loop right so for
events in PI game dot event die get what
do we want to do sometimes we print
event here but we won't first we're
gonna say if event dot type equals PI
game dot quit what do we want to do
we're gonna run whoops PI game dot quit
and then finally a quit so this allows
us to actually X out of the screen and
and that'll be it for now and now what
we want to do is so for bambor
we're done with that for loop for now so
that's basically gonna allow so just
leave won't want only if instead of like
having to like exit out very messy so
now what we want to do is we're gonna do
a little Duke will run a GL clear and
this basically acts like our fill
statement used to so before we would say
fill white and it would fill the screen
white and then we would draw everything
on top of the screen again GL clear
clears the view because if you draw like
in PI game it was okay because the way
it renders but in OpenGL it's if things
work a little differently if you draw
everything in the background it's still
gonna connect render it in the
foreground because why because more
matters than what can you can view right
you need to be
change your perspective so it's always
gonna have that stuff in the back end so
you kind of have to keep that in mind so
geo clear and then here we put in some
serious parameters so turn on your caps
caps button here GL color underscore
buffer underscore bit pipe then geo
underscore depth underscore buffer
underscore bit some some OpenGL
constants basically then after we clear
the screen we're gonna go ahead and run
draw cube so draw underscore cube and
then we'll run hi game dot display dot
update and then we don't really have I'm
gonna do frames per second but what we
can do instead is we can just do PI game
dot time wait ten then we can run main
and we've written a lot of code before
we get to a bug check so we'll see how
this pans out for us but let's go ahead
and save and run that and see what see
what happens G oh we a typo depth buffer
bit depth here we go DEP bit oh my
goodness I under case t oh well good all
right okay another problem for edge in
edges oops
we need to call that edges so this list
of edges needs to be edges for edge and
edges dragon it's a lot of errors folks
oh my goodness
Bert is not defined oh right vertex
one more time one more time oh my
goodness okay a pocket let's try it
let's a little pass through a flip I
just play update fluid mom okay so like
I said that was quite the challenge so
this is our obviously our display we've
got the cube up there it doesn't totally
I mean we can imagine that this is a
cube but we can't really do anything
with it we can't visualize it very well
so we still obviously have a lot of
stuff to cover as far as visualizing
this cube I'm gonna show you guys a lot
of the proper display changes and all
that but I guess we'll do that in the
next video so close out of this and
that's it so hopefully you guys are
excited you drew your first OpenGL cube
so anyways stay tuned a nice video and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
