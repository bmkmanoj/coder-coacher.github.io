fourteen c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making for living Boston and in this
tutorial I'm may be showing you how to
delete xml nodes so basically I'm just
going to be showing you how to delete
this full person entry just by their
name so if you're the type in Bob this
text box will just delete this entire
person entry for Bob so for this
tutorial you're obviously going to need
to have an XML document with multiple
people in it and you're going to need to
have a button a label and a text box to
enter the person's name you want to
believe so once you have all that on
your form is go ahead and double click
on your duty person button under that
just create a new XML document and load
that document that we created a few
tutorials back with all the people in it
first thing that we're going to do is
loop through each node and check to see
if the name of the person is the name
either entry in the text box and if it
is then we're going to do bleeding that
node so we're going to provide the
platform you to the on to the person
nodes and everything I want to loop
through each one of those I'm going to
say if the name of the person
select the name node so if the name of
that person is in your text so just
basically a side up here if that is Xbox
one attack their name if the user enters
in the text box then we just want to
move that node so X node dot remove all
and to remove all method will only just
remove all of the children of this
person though it won't actually remove
this person node I'll show you how to do
that in a little bit but before we move
on with that or before we even do
anything we're going to save it so that
it saves all the changes that we've made
ex-dog save save it path that that read
upon all right so it should just go
through every node and check to see if
the name is the name to enter in this
text box and if it is it will just
remove basically all this not the actual
personnel so we're just going to type in
Adam right here and I should remove Adam
the person go back to this updated as
you can see yeah I just removed the
stuff inside of the entry it didn't
actually remove that person so what
we're gonna have to do Alice to leave
this here and add another Yi's
alright so what we're gonna have to do
is you're going to have to do we're
going to go to the parent of it to the
parent node and that will just go to
Thomas people and then we're going to
want to do dot move child and then we're
just going to put the node we want to
remove and that would be this X node
right here
we just want to remove this text mode so
it will check to see if the nodes text
or if the name of that node is Adam and
and if it is it will just go through a
parent node and then select a child of
that so it'll basically just go to this
person node and then it will select the
person that has the name Adam or the
name that whatever we select in that
text box and I'll just going to move
that and higher note this time so now
let me be bugged here like in some of
the name add them again delete person
then we go back to notepad plus plus
updated and yet fit this remove the
entire entry you don't have to just get
a by name so if we wanted to get if I
age or email or something you can just
change this to age I think these are all
the same yeah a little 34 social change
like well over something all right so
now pipe enough 12 right here it should
remove this 10 one please 12-week person
go back for this and you have to remove
this him one so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial on removing nodes so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
