this video I'm going to talk to you
about the map function in Python so the
map function is basically a way that you
can take a list whatever it is you know
a list of foods of names of numbers and
you can run each item in that list
through a function really easily so
let's go ahead and make a simple list
I'll just say income so this list is how
much money I make and I'll say the first
week of work I made $10 the second week
I made 30 bucks and the last week I made
75 bucks
all right so now I have a list of stuff
but I also have this function and I'm
just going to make this function really
simple to demonstrate you know because
we aren't really learning about
functions or anything complex I just
want to demonstrate the map function so
all this function is going to do is it's
going to take each of these items in
multiplying by two so double your money
so we're going to pass in dollars which
is each item in the list and we're just
going to return okay there we go
returned dollars multiplied by two
all right so what we can do is we can
make a for loop so for items in income
and then we can do this yadda yadda
tomato tomahto but there's actually an
easier and more efficient way so what we
can do is actually call the map function
now the map function takes two
parameters the first one is what
function are you going to run all of
your items through well it's just double
money now we don't have any parameters
and the second function is alright what
is the list that you want to iterate
through well we only have one list which
is this so do that
so what this is going to do is it's
going to go through this list and for
each item 10 30 75 it's going to run it
through this function now if we just run
this right now it's not going to show
anything because we don't have any
output so let me just go ahead and
very like new income equals list.map all
right looking good
so I basically am going to run through
this multiply each of these values by
two so we end up with 20 60 and 150 and
then I'm just going to take all those
values and convert it to a list so we
can print it out so print new income and
there you go so now you see 20 60 and
150 now again you can also do this with
a for loop so just say for item in
income and then you can do it that way
but this is a much easier way in my
opinion and it's a lot more compact so
it doesn't clutter up all your code so
there you go that is what map is
basically taking some kind of iterable
and are running it through a function
boom roasted see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
