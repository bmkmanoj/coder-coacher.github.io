Photoshop cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackbird and today
I want to show you how to clean up
things like scratches dents dirt all
that crap in your photo so I have this
picture of taxis right here that I got
off the internet and as you can see if I
wanted to put this photo into something
like a magazine sometimes when you have
like magazines they want everything to
be perfect so they Photoshop up a lot of
pictures so if you take a look at this
you can see a couple of things wrong
there might be even more but we've got
this dirty-ass um ad sign up here that's
got a bunch of dirt on it and let me let
me highlight this stuff for you so you
can see it you know just use a brush
click on the brush and we've got this
crappy-ass a nice brush I got there
crappy-ass dirty sign and then down here
we've got a bunch of cracks and dents
and stuff like that so I want to clean
those up and I want them to look like
the area that is around them so what I'm
going to use is this what's called the
spa healing brush and it's the one with
the band-aid with some like dotted lines
in the background so that's a Spot
Healing Brush and the settings you want
to have on for right now are
content-aware and this will sample
what's around your image to fill in the
area that you want to remove so let's
zoom in into one of the areas let's zoom
in into these scratches down here so we
got a pretty decent area where we can
see these scratches and let's click on
our Spot Healing Brush if your healing
brush is on the right size you can use
the left and right bracket keys on your
keyboard to
mess with the size so we've got this
scratch here and just make sure your
settings are around this that we have
right here I've got my size at 40
hardness at 100 spacing at 25 so these
are the default settings that it came
with I'm not going to mess with them
just click and dislike paint where you
want to what you want to get fixed so we
had those two dents right there and a
let go and it'll fix that area so I got
this big-ass scratch right here click
get some of the background in there
don't try not to get any of the black
because then it's going to use that so
we got that area there and now that
scratch is pretty much gone same with
this try to keep it on the same plane as
you can see that this is a different
plane than this so this defining line
right here is going to show like the
definition between the front flat part
and the curved side part there so you
don't want to go over top of the line so
I'll show you what I mean
hey like try to get this line out mmm I
guess this shoot it doesn't it just
doesn't look that great
you've got the shadows here that define
the edges but the line defines it more
and it looks like this does taxi has
been hit like in this area before the
taxi driver hits something because it
looks like it's pretty dented here he's
got a bunch of repairs that gone on so
let's try and see if we can repair
anything else
so I mean sometimes it's not the not the
greatest at repairing you have to go
over it again or maybe go over it a few
times so that's working there we've got
this scratch here so that's how you use
that to fix up that kind of stuff so
let's go over to those
that dirty sign and try using this again
so we've got that scratch right there
now that's gone here's another scratch
this is too easy way too easy isn't it
get rid of all that stuff and now it's
not so dirty if you try to take a big
portion like something like this for one
it's going to take a lot of time for
Photoshop to process so you can see it's
waiting and it doesn't always give you
the best results so keep your
brushstrokes down to like a minimum keep
them keep them small and packed just to
get what you need to don't try to do
everything all at once now if you try to
like let's go to a different thing here
we've got this Beach thing here and if I
want to try to remove this and just have
no lifeguard here just have a beach
let's try that real quick and you can
see what happens so I'm going to
increase my brush size so I'm going to
try to get everything here to take this
completely out so I got to get into the
sand a little bit get that trash can out
of there and got to get that shadow out
of there oh I left a part in the middle
damn it so it's going to compute now
it's going to be all effed up because I
left this in the middle so I'll pause
this and let this do its thing
so I cancelled it and let me redo this
get all this stuff real quick and I
won't forget anything in the middle this
time
and there we go does it looks like I
didn't forget anything now let go and
it's going to puke and then I'll pause
this again when it's done I'll let guys
see what it does so here it is it's
getting ready to do what it's doing
we're waiting for it to calculate itself
I thought it was going to be done once
it hits an end bar but Photoshop is this
sometimes when you do huge areas like
this with us and this picture has a lot
of pixels in it so as you can see we
didn't get the best we didn't get the
best removal on this because it's a huge
set and it doesn't always work huge
things unless it's like a constant
background so if there was no sand and
no water and it was just this constant
sky then it might work but it did a
pretty decent job of removing it not
great however because we can obviously
see stuff that we don't want so I wanted
to show you another way that we can use
this so it's pretty much like the Spot
Healing tool except we're going to use
selections so let's go back to our taxi
here and we'll back up and we'll come
back down to here where we probably have
some more things that we can fix up like
here's a little dent spot there there's
a dirt spot so let's a mess with these
so pick like something like your lasso
tool and make a selection around the
area that you want to fix so we got that
selected then just come up to edit and
click fill and then make sure you have
use is content-aware you got some other
things here that I don't know if you
won't really want to use but
content-aware is going to do almost the
same thing as a Spot Healing Brush hit
okay and it'll fix the area for you it
ctrl D to deselect and that basically
does the same exact thing so the benefit
of using the content where selection or
I mean the fill content-aware is that
you can make pretty nicely looking
selections with your different selection
tools that you got and then
you can be a little more precise and
just using the brush tool unless you
want to spend a lot of time like getting
everything in with the brush tool then
use this to get complex selections in
there or if you just like using this way
better because you can select and all
that stuff then go ahead by all means
use that instead of the Spot Healing
Brush so that's going to be it for this
tutorial
we're going to go on to learn more about
content-aware items in the next tutorial
