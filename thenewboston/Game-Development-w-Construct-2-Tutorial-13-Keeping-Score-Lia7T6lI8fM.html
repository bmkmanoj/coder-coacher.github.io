and in this tutorial I want to show you
guys how to keep score in other words
keep track of how many monsters the
player killed so you might be thinking
alright I don't know what to do click on
the dude and add another instance
variable but not exactly and I want to
tell you guys why you can't edit
instance variable
whenever we'll say we kill this monster
for example whenever he gets destroyed
all instance variables get destroyed
along with them and it does this for the
same reason doesn't keep track of
bullets going off the screen because it
would be too much memory to keep track
of all these variables on objects that
get destroyed so why can't we use an
instance variable on him well whenever
our player dies at the end of the game
that would mean that his score would be
destroyed as well so that might be
useful if you you know you didn't care
about saving the high score or anything
but if you allowed a game to be online
where you had a high score it saved or
maybe just a game for your computer but
you had a like a leaderboard of what
what your friends and if you were better
than your friends you can't save that
data if you keep it in an instance
variable so for data like high score we
need a special type of variable called a
global variable a global variable is
basically a variable that it stores a
value no matter what objects get
destroyed so in order to create one go
ahead and over in your event Street this
is that I say event Street like that's a
road or something what we wanted to do
is we want to right click on the bottom
and click add global variable right
there now we give it a name in the name
of this I'm just going to put score
basically we're going to keep track of
how many monsters did each um did they
kill pretty much so the initial value
well of course it's a number to keep
track of how many the initial value 0
pretty much this all the defaults are
good right now and as you can see above
all of these events we now have a global
variable and we know it's a number and
it's called score
and it's set at zero by default so now
what we want to say is when we kill a
monster add 1 to the score so what is
the event where when monsters die well
it's actually this one right here when
monsters health is less than or equal to
zero that must mean that you just killed
a monster so what we want to do here is
we want to add an additional action to
add one to this global variable score so
add an action and what we select here is
system and now click Add to way that way
yeah add two under the global and local
variables and what this is going to do
is it allows you to add a value to a
variable and don't worry about local
variables right now I'll talk to you
guys about those later on so basically
you select what variable you want just
like before and how much you want to add
to it well just go ahead and increase it
by a value of 1 and hit done so
basically every time we kill a monster
make an explosion destroy the monster
and add 1 to the score so we can play
this game right now and kill monsters
but right now there's no way of seeing
our score or you know we need to give
the user some input to see keep track of
how many monsters they killed so indeed
our game is in fact changing this
variable and it is adding one or
increasing this number by one every time
we kill a monster but now we just need a
way to show the user what is going on
and what their score is currently so in
the next video that's what we're going
to be doing thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe in I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
