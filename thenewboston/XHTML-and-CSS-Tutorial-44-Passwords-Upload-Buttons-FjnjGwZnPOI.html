your 44th XHTML and CSS tutorial your
44th tutorial has a lot of tutorials I
bet if you took all these videos and
strung them together then you can make a
full-length movie but then again who the
heck would want to watch a movie about
this
I wouldn't even watch a movie about this
but anyways in this story we're going to
be covering two different types of input
fields the first one is the password and
the second one is the file field and
that's how you upload files for example
if you want to make a website like
Facebook or something and you wanted
users to be able to upload files of
pictures of them getting wasted and then
you know doing illegal things that their
bosses shouldn't see this is what you
would do so let's first of all learn how
to do the password field so go ahead and
type password right like that and now of
course we need the same input tag as
before and go ahead and enter right now
but instead of text or you know text
area for type we're going to go ahead
and put password in there and whenever
we do that and whenever this field
appears on our screen it's a little
different than the text but it has all
the same attributes it's the same in the
sense that you can use you know size max
length just like you could do text but
it's different in that whenever you type
in it either gives you little bullets or
little asterisks that cover up away
you're really typing that way whenever
you're logging onto YouTube at school
and you should be working the students
behind you can't see what your password
is so anyways the type is password and
the name again that's what is going to
come in handy whenever we're programming
this data with JavaScript or PHP but
just put like P word that looks good
enough so let's go ahead and actually
save this right now and see what it
looks like you see it looks a lot like
the text area at first but whenever we
start typing in it we got all those
bullet point Asterix
pretty cool so again like I mentioned
before you can also have the size and
max length to this so if you ever decide
that you want to change it up a bit or
you want to restrict them from entering
a password that's like 80 characters
long you can use that max length so
anyways now that we know how to do the
password just go ahead and
actually add a paragraph right here and
just uh put something like now submit a
file because we're going to be working
with a file input next and we want to
give them a little input of what to do
so go ahead and add a paragraph just
give us some spacing and now we are
ready to begin so crack your knuckles
and check it out so the tag for this is
of course input who woulda guessed and
the type is actually file now it only
has one other attribute and it's
required and it's actually the name this
way if you have more than one file
upload sections whenever you're working
with it programming it your program can
differentiate between which file is
which so just go ahead and name this
Bucky's file it doesn't really matter
because we're not going to be working
with this attribute for now the main
thing you have to concentrate is make
sure that the type is file now let's go
ahead and save this and see what happens
whenever we refresh our page it gives us
a little button and whenever we click
that button it opens up our Windows
Explorer whatever heck this thing is
called and it allows us to choose a file
so we can choose a file by either
double-clicking it or just hit open and
then we don't have a submit button yet
because I didn't teach you guys about
that but whenever we do and they hit
submit it allows us or excuse me it
allows them rather to upload their file
to the web server so that way they can
transfer their pictures onto the web or
you know maybe if you have to submit
homework for class and the teacher might
include this in their web page something
like that
but anyways that's basically all there
is to cover with file uploads again I
said that those are the only two
attributes because you don't really have
a size attribute because that doesn't
really make sense you don't have a max
length because that doesn't really make
sense the only thing that you might be
wondering is all right I don't want them
uploading a file that's like a thousand
gigabytes big so if you want to restrict
this you can't do this using strictly
XHTML you need to do this whenever you
learn JavaScript page be all those other
scripting languages that you guys might
know but you probably don't know yet so
you're going to have to stick with my
other tutorials if you want learn how to
do that but for now this is all you have
to remember and don't forget you can't
use size or max length and also if you
want to upload multiple files you can't
click this button once right here and
you can't choose a bunch of files if you
want to upload multiple files you have
to give them multiple buttons it's a
little different than a regular program
but that's what XHTML did so who's ever
making XHTML blame them they made the
rules not me so anyways that's all I
have for you guys for this lesson um I'm
going to go check the score of the
basketball game and in the next video
I'll let you guys know who won so they
guys for watching now see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
