third tutorial in stock analysis through
PHP and in this lesson what I'm going to
be doing is I'm gonna be showing you
guys how to connect to your database
through PHP file so what I like to do is
I like to put it in a separate folder so
go to wherever you're working make a new
folder and just name it will come you
name it name it includes because I don't
know how many files were gonna be
including in this program but whenever
you include something in PHP I like to
put it inside a separate include folder
so just go ahead and make that right now
and now they have folder code includes
go ahead and open up notepad now hold on
let me adjust myself in my seat now what
we need to do is we need to create a new
blank file so let me go ahead and hit
file new and I'm just gonna go ahead and
save it right now even though we didn't
write anything in it just go ahead and
hit file save as and make sure you save
this connection file inside your
includes folder now just go ahead and
name it connect dot PHP and it's gonna
save this is a PHP file so go ahead and
hit that and you should be good to go so
now that we have a connect dot PHP file
this is the file that we're going to be
writing all of our connection script
into and this is the database
information so how do we write a
connection script to connect to a
database the very first thing we need is
of course PHP tags and I just go ahead
and I write my first now what we need
well we don't need this but we need to
use the MySQL connect function and I
like to store this inside a variable
called connect and go ahead and set this
equal to my SQL underscore connect now
this MySQL connect function is already
built in it takes three parameters the
first parameter it takes is the location
or pretty much your server's address
however since we're gonna put this file
directly on our server and we're not
connecting to another server we can just
use localhost that means wherever the
script is located you
use this server now after this what we
need is the name of the user that
connects to that database and our user
name is daniele underscore sally so
remember the first two pieces of
information is what server do you want
to connect to and what's the user's name
now the third and final piece of
information if you couldn't have guessed
is the password so let me go ahead and
just hit this type it in and there you
go
so in my variable Connect I have the
name of the server the name of the user
and the password in after this we're
gonna go ahead and were make a simple if
statement so what this if statement is
gonna do is it's gonna test okay if not
connect because this function right here
MySQL connect it's going to return a
value true or false it's going to return
true if it could connect to the database
so now this variable Connect is either
going to be true if it connected or
false if it did it connect well I got
Fleming wry throat pretty gross so if we
say okay if a not connect in other words
if you could not connect to the database
then what we want to do is just go ahead
and hit die which pretty much kills the
script and let me just go ahead and say
something like whenever you use die you
can put something in between it's kind
of like a prompt it will just write
could not connect to database with
explanation point and that way whenever
we see this on our website we know that
we have an error with connecting to the
database and that's another thing a lot
of people just use this die but they
don't write anything in between and then
their website messes up and then they
have to look through all their code so
guys protip make sure you always include
a little prompt so now what I wanted to
do is mention this so what we did right
here is we connected basically to our
server through a user but we didn't
select what database we want to work
with yet we might have a database for
you know this we may have built another
website for our friend they may have a
database we
a bunch of databases on this server so
we need to specify which database we're
working with now in order to do that you
use a function called my SQL underscore
select underscore DB they didn't like
you type out database so this takes two
parameters the first parameter is what
is the name of the database that you
want to work with so again what this
does is it basically connects to your
server and right here we're saying what
database we want to work with and this
is the youtube database and the second
parameter is your connect it's actually
just go ahead and write that and it's
basically your connection script I want
to say I don't know how to say it so
basically this is the script that we use
to connect to a database and we can go
ahead and run this right now and if we
look at the what's called the web page
connect dot PHP it either says nothing
if it worked properly or we get this
error message if we couldn't connect
however I'm confident so I don't need to
test it out that this script is working
pretty dang good so after this I'm gonna
I didn't think I was gonna have time for
this but I want to show you guys this
let me go ahead and make a new am I
gonna have time for this yeah might as
well
so I'm gonna go ahead and make a new
file and I'm gonna go ahead and save
this file as not includes I'm just gonna
go ahead and save it in the main
directory and I'm gonna call it ticker
master text that's pretty good so now
this is a blank document that I named
ticker master why the heck did I do this
well I did it because of this what we're
gonna be doing is we're gonna be giving
this program a whole bunch of ticker
signal symbols now if you're saying what
is a ticker symbol well whenever we look
at a stock for a company like Google we
don't type in Google whenever you're
looking at it online or on you know the
Dow or whatever every company has like a
one two or three or four letter symbol
it's like a code for that website I mean
excuse me for that company so Google's
is goog if we type in yeah
look for that Yahoo's code is YH oh oh
and this is pretty much what the pros
use and what databases use to
distinguish companies from each other
so go ahead online and look for whatever
ticker whatever companies you want to
use and make sure you get their ticker
just don't type in the word like Netflix
or something like that so I already got
I don't know five different companies
that I'm gonna want to scan whenever we
have our formulas and they're always in
capital letters so I'm gonna use Yahoo
which is why hol Google which is goog
Netflix and apple and adobe I'm just
gonna use five tech companies but if you
want to use one company that you want to
scan or 500 companies it doesn't matter
whatever you want to test your formula
out on put all of the companies in the
file called ticker master text and make
sure that all the tickers are in
capitals and make sure you have one per
line and this is kind of gonna be the
master file of what companies we want to
text and I'll show you guys how to use
this file later on so anyways now that
we got our connect dot PHP set up you
can guys can go ahead and test that if
you want and also your ticker master
which is all the companies we want to
test we're ready to move on to the next
tutorial so in the next story we're
gonna finally be typing some real code
so thank you guys for watching you never
get subscribe and now see guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
