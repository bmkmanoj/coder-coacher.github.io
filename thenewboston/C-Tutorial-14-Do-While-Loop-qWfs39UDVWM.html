and in this story I'm going to be
teaching you guys
the famous do-while loop so in the last
tutorial we covered the while loop in
this story we're going to covering the
do-while loop
sounds fun oh it is so let's go ahead
and get rid of our entire while loop
there's one last look at it so goodbye
alright
sorry I got smoker's cough alright in
the last tutorial we made a while loop
and I said I had a test expression in a
body and so does this wonder but it's
kind of flip flopped around what the
do-while loop allows you to do is it
allows you to execute a piece of code at
least once before even testing it at all
so sounds kind of dangerous and but uh
alright enough with the chitchat let's
just do it
the first thing let's go ahead and
declare a variable int equals 1 so we're
going to actually let's make in X equals
1 so we have an integer variable X and
that's equal to 1
the syntax for your do loop is do so you
better not forget that because it's
really easy next in your body you want
to make your instructions what you want
your loop to do just like the loops are
4 so let's make something real easy but
kind of fun at the same time we'll make
it output on the screen arm something
clever let's say dentist appointment at
2:00
two-thirty get it
Dennis appointment at 2:30 slow joke my
sister told it to me so after that you
can put end line since we're done with
that line and then we have to increment
our variable so it doesn't keep
repeating X is equal to X plus 1 and
right now what we have is a variable and
no matter what our while loop says this
is going to do this at least once so
it's going to output on the screen
um dentist appointment at 2:30
aka 2:30 and then it's going to
increment it by 1 so now that we have
that at least once we're going to go
ahead and build our while loop so we're
going to put while and in our parameters
we're going to want to put while X is
less than or equal to 10 nothing fancy
so here's what we got going on here to
recap one more time before I show you
guys this loop what your guys are just
dying to see you have energy or variable
X is equal to 1 you're going to do the
instructions at least once without any
fight at all from anything else and then
after you're done doing it once it's
going to say all right now how many
times you want me to do this Oh free
every time X is less than or equal to 10
so let's go ahead and do this 10 times
all right so enough of the chitchat
execute compile and run this baby make
sure I didn't mess anything up so right
now we have dentist appointment at 2:30
and this is B quote because this
variable was true so it ran this and
then since it was true for 10 times it
ran it ten times so but if you're asking
alright what if this is false what if
you have variable like 55 where X equals
55 so you're going to output it on the
screen but um when it gets to this it's
false what's going to have
well what should happen if I didn't mess
anything up it should run this code down
its appointment at 2:30 at least one
time and by at least one time I mean run
at one time and then when it gets to
this it should not do anything else so
execute compiling run
compiling compiling come on baby no Amy
no AME
that's what I'm talking about so it ran
it one time dentist appointment it 2:30
so those are your basics for a do loop
again declare variable run the code at
least once and then test it and tell it
if it's true
still how many times you want it to run
so it's simple enough and this loop is
useful in a lot of different
applications but we won't get into that
for now for now you should be studying
this loop probably writing my video of 5
out of 5 and once you learn this you can
move on to my next tutorial so thanks
for watching now see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
