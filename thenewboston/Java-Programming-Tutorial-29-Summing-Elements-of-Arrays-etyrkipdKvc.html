29th Jeff tutorial and I'm going to make
a real quick tutorial this time by a
request I'm going to show you guys how
the sum all the elements in your array
or to use all the elements in your array
in any calculation so let's go ahead and
in order to do that the first thing we
need is an array so I'm going to name
mine Bucky as usual um I'm going to make
the array initializer so you don't need
to add the number it will do it for you
say you wanted to average the ages of
people go ahead and write however many
elements you want in your array it
doesn't matter I'm going to have let's
see 1 2 3 4 5 people these would be
their ages or anything um once you have
an array and I just use the object
initializer or see the array initializer
go ahead and make a variable called a
sum or some variable you can use to keep
your total of all your elements and and
make sure to set it equal to zero
because that's what you want to start
out is the next thing we need to do was
like last tutorial we need to make a for
loop and this is going to loop through
every element in the array so of course
let's go ahead and make a counter
variable and since the first index of
every array is 0
we want to start at 0 and then just do
the little array length so what's this
Bucky length and this will give you the
length of this array that's the trick I
told you guys how to do last time and
then go ahead and increment it by 1
after this and you don't really need
these curly brackets since it's only one
line but you want to take the sum and
you want to add um the previous number
to it so let's go ahead and do that and
what this is going to do is take
whatever the value is and add it to the
sum so its first it's going to take 21
add to 0 16 added 21 86 added that 21
added that 3 added to that and it's
going to go through and store all of
these values add together
in the variable sum so then once we have
all that all we have to do is output it
on the screen so let's go ahead and put
system.out.print line or whatever print
you feel like using and then let's go
ahead and write the sum of these modules
felt like that numbers is and now let's
go ahead and write our some variable and
this should be it hopefully it works
there we go and let's go ahead and run
this and if it works I actually forgot
to put space right there but the sum of
these numbers is 147 right there and
again it displayed it like that because
I forgot to put a space right there and
if I do it gives us our correct the sum
of these numbers is 147
so that again um to recap one last time
go ahead and do your housekeeping like
this what you do if you want to use all
these numbers in calculation then again
you don't have to get to sum you can
multiply them together or anything like
that just take a variable and just loop
through your entire array using your for
loop that I told you last time and use
your little neat little math trick that
I told you before to in this right here
this will loop through each element in
your array and get the value of it so
that is how you use this neat little
summing of the elements of an array
trick to get the sum or any other
calculation you want when looking at
your array so thank you guys for
watching hopefully now you know how to
sum all the elements in your right I
hope to see you next time and don't
