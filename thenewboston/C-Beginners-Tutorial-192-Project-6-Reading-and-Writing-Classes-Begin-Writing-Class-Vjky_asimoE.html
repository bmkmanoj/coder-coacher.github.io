tutorial and I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial and continue
working on our reader and writer class
so in the previous tutorial we finished
up making our reader class so now we
just have to create our writer class
let's just go right here and say public
class writer and like just like the
reader class we're gonna want to inherit
from face i/o class because remember
inside of this base diode class you have
that enumeration for the byte order and
then we have a variable for that byte
order so it's going to inherit from base
i/o and now we're just gonna wanna set
up our constructors so we're going to
type ctor
I mean to sit tap twice they don't
actually have to write out like public
writer and stuff and we're just going to
need to have the user pass through the
path to the file that they want to write
in just like the reader class right here
remember inside this constructor we just
haven't passed through the path so we're
just going to say pass right here and
then we're going to want to create a new
binary writer so we're gonna have to go
up here and create a binary writer so
that we can use it in all of our methods
and I'm just going to call it W and then
inside of the constructor right here
we're going to set BW equal to a new
binary writer and then we're just gonna
want to pass through that that path that
the user passed through the constructor
so it's the same path all right so now
basically whenever the user creates a
new instance of the writer class they'll
just create a new binary writer with the
path that the user specified and just
like the binary or just like the reader
class right here we're going to want to
create another constructor that will
allow them to pass through the fight
order so they can change if they want it
to write in little-endian so we're gonna
say public writer
so we're gonna say ctor and then just
have to tap twice and then just like up
here and I'm gonna pass through the
kayaks extreme cap and the byte order
variables are byte order and that's my
call vo or by order all right and just
like up here it's gonna want to create a
new binary writer in that path and now
we just need to set the byte order
variable to the byte order that the user
passes through so we're going to say
byte order and we're going to want to
set that equal to the byte order that
user passes through so we're just going
to study equal to vo and same thing with
up here only we're gonna set it equality
to big-endian byte order equals by order
big-endian a little deepali b big-endian
it either doesn't specify what by order
they want all right and just like with a
reader class make sure you have a
summary of what the destructor is and
stuff like that but I'm not going to
write it out in this tutorial you guys
can do that on your own and the last
thing we have to do is free a property
for the position of the writer so we say
public public long and we're going to
call this property positions no position
and then we're just going to want to get
and set the property position inside of
this binary writer class so we're just
gonna want to sear it here give DW be
streamed position so the position of the
binary writer and then when the user
sets this position property we're just
going to want to change the position of
the binary writer so we're just going to
say set and then DW be streamed position
with the value that the user sets was
property food alright so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial we have all
the boring stuff done for this writer
class in the next tutorial we're going
to actually get into writing values so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
