video and how to make a sweet Ajax
chatroom and here's a little fun fact
for you guys I actually made this video
before but my microphone was on mute I
must have hit the dumb button so now I
have to make the whole thing again so
for you of course it's your first time
but for me I already did all this crap
and it really took me off but anyways
now that we created this file and what
this file does is basically whenever we
import it it creates this chat table in
our database so let's go ahead and
figure out how to do that right now go
ahead to your cPanel and instead of the
database section which is where we
created the database we now have to add
the table to it so you do that you
manage all your tables and stuff in PHP
myadmin
so go ahead and click that and you can
actually do this through code but this
is a very easy way this is how people
typically work with their tables it
gives you more of a visualization
instead of you know looking at the
command line and crap by anyways go
ahead and click on your database name
and mine was just named chat so click on
your database and now this is where you
can go ahead and create a database
manually and that's great we can go
ahead and do that however we have a file
already set up and all we have to do is
import this so on top you have a bunch
of little tabs here if you click on
import then it gives you an area where
it says choose the file that you want to
import and if you choose a file and
navigate to it and let's see where I put
it
chat tutorials and chat SQL so just
click that and you don't have to change
any settings the settings should be fine
by default just go ahead and press GO
and now we get a little green prompt and
if your prompt is red if it has a red
background right here instead of green
then what this means is more likely than
not some of your you probably typed
something wrong in your code so go ahead
in make sure your source code is exactly
the same as mine and I'll have this file
available to you guys on my forum once
I'm done with all these tutorials but
anyways now if we go ahead and click
your database name again and you choose
structure then you can see that our
table was imported successfully and the
cool thing about this is whenever you
have a file what you can do is you can
just go ahead and give your friend this
file and then they don't have to create
the table manually or if you're working
with you know a team of developers or
something so that's why I like making
all of these in SQL files rather than
you know just doing everything manually
in phpMyAdmin
but now the important part is we now
have a table created in our database in
the table name is chat so now we can go
ahead and add the messages to the table
and just to recap one last time so you
guys don't get confused whenever we're
coding this thing it has a message ID
which is pretty much the ID number of
each message and a message is just one
thing that the user types a post it on
so it saves the time and the date that
it's posted the username which is either
you know Bucky or guest 88 the message
itself which is the text like hey what's
going on STFU or the color and also the
color of the text itself so it can
actually close out of this browser
because you know we don't need anything
in the browser for a while now what we
need to do is we need to create a new
file so create file new and just go
ahead and save this as Bucky underscore
