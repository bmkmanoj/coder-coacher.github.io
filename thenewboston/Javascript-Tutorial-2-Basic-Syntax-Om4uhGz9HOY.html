second JavaScript tutorial in this
tutorial we're actually gonna be writing
our first JavaScript so go ahead and get
your notepad editor's open and I'm using
notepad plus and if you want to know how
to get notepad plus then go to my XHTML
tutorial and I'll walk you through how
to get that and usually when you're
right JavaScript in a website that it
usually goes in the head section or the
body section of a website but just
because we're learning how to write
basic scripts I'm just gonna be writing
it with nothing else just plain
JavaScript and you can do this just fine
so let's go ahead and start writing our
first JavaScript now any JavaScript code
that you're right it has to go in
between two script tags a beginning tag
and an end tag here and here's what
those look like the beginning tag looks
like this
it says script and then you need an
attribute called type and you never need
to set it equal to the text slash
JavaScript
and this just makes it compliant with
the w3 standards
it isn't this attribute isn't really
necessary in some browsers but it will
be later on so it's just good practice
that so here's the beginning script
right here it tells your browser that
we're starting our JavaScript and of
course the end script is just a basic
end script egg and any code that will be
create any code it goes right in between
these two tags so with that being said
let's go ahead and create our first
script and as always we'll just write a
basic script the output text on the
screen and to do that in Java JavaScript
your right document period right and
that tells us that the document were
working on we just want to write basic
text on the screen and then after that
you have two parenthesis and a semicolon
the semicolon right here says that it's
the end of the line or we're camp and
anything we want to write goes in
between the parentheses any time we
write a number we can just go ahead and
write a number as you see if we save
this and refresh our screen it just
outputs the number on the screen
but anytime we want to write text on the
screen we have to enclose it in
parentheses either double or just very
easy house and as you see if we save
this
notice we have our text in double
parentheses little ray easy Hoss
or you can enclose it in single
parentheses as you see if we save it
it'll rate easy house again one thing
you can do is include text in no
parentheses or put one double and one
single oops
as you can see anytime you do this we
either get a blank screen or if you have
your browser configured sometimes in air
and explore an error message will pop up
so I always make sure when you're
working with text you enclose it in
similar parenthesis and besides the
document right which we won't really be
using that much to get started there's
another way to output text and that's
with an alert box and to be use this
instead of document right we just write
alert now any text that we write is
gonna show up in an alert box on our
browser as you can see a little box pops
up and you need to click OK to continue
and of course the rules are the same
with numbers anytime you have a number
you don't enclose it in parentheses so
as you see if we save this alert box
will pop up with our number or and
inside so now that we covered how to
write basic text on the screen as well
as just basic numbers and how to enclose
everything in our script tags next
lesson we're going to be going over
something a little more useful called
variables so study this tutorial and
learn how to output text on the screen
and then watch my next tutorial
