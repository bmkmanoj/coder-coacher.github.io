Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial today we're going to be
working with the line-to-line I'm going
to give you a an introduction to it now
what the line tool does is it just
basically creates lines for you to use
by dragging from one point in the
document to another now your line is
over here in the tools panel underneath
the text tool under Neath in this
section that the rectangle tool or like
the custom shape tool is in and you can
see that U is the hockey so go ahead and
select your line tool and we're going to
start off here by changing this to
pixels and this will allow us to create
raster layers ones that are already
ready for you to save out or anything
like that
so go ahead and just drag and you create
a new line on the layer now it's good
idea to create the lines on separate
layers for example if I create another
line here and now I want to go move this
line the bigger line I can see I can't
because I'm going to be dragging on both
lines so let me go back create the new
layer make my line and now on this layer
I can move I got to get like right on
the line I can move just a layer
individually so let's go over some of
the options that we've got here we have
let's go to our line here we've got
these option panel our options right
here we're allowed to put arrowheads on
the start or the end of our line let's
go to end and it makes that's how you
make arrows now if you want to increase
the weight you can let's go to like 16
or something like that and now when I
draw my arrow it's a lot thicker so
that's how you make the arrows a little
bit bigger
you've got your width length and
everything of your arrow here so if I
change this to like five
do this you can see that the length of
the arrow is shorter and the actual
Arrowhead is what I'm talking about so
let me go back so that we just have our
regular layer there now if you're
creating a line see if the how this one
looks and if you look at the line it
doesn't look very smooth right you want
to make sure that anti-alias here is
checked so that is smooth if I take that
off and try to create a line you can see
how it's a lot more JT and crappier
looking so have on anti-alias to make it
look smooth and it will look a lot nicer
so we put our opacity here which is
self-explanatory it's just going to be a
less opaque if you put the opacity down
and then we've got our blending modes
here where it's going to affect how it
blends in with the rest of the document
as you can see now if I just have it on
normal it's just going to go across
these normally so that's you can use the
blending mode to
change how these lines interact and if
you want to take off your arrowheads you
can just uncheck and then you won't have
arrows anymore so that's how these lines
work when you have it on pixels now if I
change this to shape and let me go back
to this when I create a new line it's
going to show up as a shape layer and I
don't have to create a new layer because
it will create new layers for me and now
these shape layers can act as shape
layers which I haven't gone over yet and
I'm not going to yet but just keep in
mind that you can create shape layers
with these and then the next thing that
we have is the path and this allows you
to create a path for a line and if I go
over here to the paths I have a new path
there and these paths can be imported
into illustrator
so that you can work in Illustrator with
them now a cool thing with the lines is
that you are able to hold down shift
when you're drawing these let me make it
take it off past and I'm just put on
pixels or something as I'm drawing this
and I hold shift I am able to create
45-degree angle lines and 90 degree
angle lines and you can see your degree
angle at the end of my cursor so this
one's twenty point five and then it
shows you the length in pixels so this
is a new in Photoshop cs6 where it does
this so and it's actually pretty helpful
now one thing you might want to use
lines for is guiding guides so when you
try to use these guides up here you only
get horizontal and vertical guides if
you need a guide that's um like at a 45
degree angle or a different type of
angle then you're going to want to use
the line tool just create your line as a
guide and then if I needed to like type
up text along this line I could and when
you are using it just name a guide lock
the layer so I would hit lock right here
and then I won't be able to move the
move it around and then just hide it
when you don't want to see the guide
anymore and just delete it when you're
done so that's how they can be used for
guides so you've got the line tool that
can make arrows it can make lines and
you can use it as a guide also so that's
the intro to the line tool and you can
make some cool line art with it and
other things if you want to become more
advanced using the line tool so thanks
for watching this tutorial and I look
forward to see you guys in the next one
have a good day everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
