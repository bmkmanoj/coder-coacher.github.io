slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
learning the if statement now the if
statement is one of the most useful
tools for beginners in Visual Basic
because there's so much that you can do
with it and it's very easy to pick up
it's very intuitive so let's go ahead
and get started
now first off we are going to make a
program that will ask a user for their
user name and password now this may be a
little bit different than what you'd
expect for a username password log in to
be but it will give you the concept of
the if statement and then you'll be able
to go make some programs using the if
statement and get used to it so that you
can move on to the next tutorials so
let's go ahead and get started we'll do
console dot write line what is your name
so now what we're going to do is we're
going to declare a string so we use the
Dib keyword to let Visual Basic know
that we're going to make a variable so
we'll DIMM username as string and we'll
set it equal to console dot read line so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to do console dot write line and
we're just going to ask them for their
password so what is your password
and then we'll declare another variable
and it'll be password so dim password as
a string and we're going to set equal to
console dot readline so we're just
getting whatever the user typed in so
now we're going to create our if
statement so to start off an if
statement you're just going to use the
keyword if and when you type that in
it's going to highlight it blue and it's
going to show it up in intellisense
now the the definition for the if
statement in this is conditionally
conditionally execute a group of
statements depending on the value of an
expression so basically what that says
is if a certain condition is true then
go ahead and do whatever is inside this
if statement so if username equals Sam
then what do we want it to do and if you
press ENTER you can see that it'll
automatically add in if for you now all
if statements have to end with an in if
or else you'll get a syntax error so do
if username equals Sam then console dot
write line welcome Sam
and now we're just going to create a
second if statement so if password
equals the new Boston did what what do
we want it to do we will just type
console dot write line inside of there
we'll type you have entered the correct
password
okay so now if we run this you're going
to see we have a little bit of a problem
here
so if we type what is your name and I
type Sam what is your password the new
Boston you can see it will close out
right after we're done with that so
we're just going to add a red line right
here so console dot read line and so
this should pause the program and let us
see what we have done so what is your
name Sam and what is your password the
new Boston so because name is equal to
Sam this is going to print out welcome
Sam and because the new Boston the
password that we have typed in is equal
to the new Boston in our code right here
it's going to say you have entered the
correct password so let's go ahead and
let's separate this a bit here just to
make the a little bit a little bit more
readable so we'll just write another
line which will just give us a blank
line and separate these so now if we run
this again it'll say what is your name
and if I type let's say Gerald and I'll
say what is your password I type the new
Boston it's going to say you have
entered the correct password but it
didn't say welcome Sam because Gerald is
not equal to Sam so username whatever
they have typed in is Gerald and it's
not equal to Sam so it will not do the
code inside of here and so since we
typed in the new Boston as our password
it's going to tell us that we have
entered the correct password and this
will also work the other way around so
if we do what is your name Sam and say
what is your password I'll just say on
live gamer it'll just say welcome Sam
but it won't tell us that we have
entered the correct password so here is
a basically example of an if statement
they're very fun to use when you're
first beginning programming you can do a
lot with them a lot more than you think
you could and so go ahead look at this
code over again go ahead and use some if
statements and make some programs
yourself and once you've got if
statements nailed down go ahead and move
on to the next tutorial
