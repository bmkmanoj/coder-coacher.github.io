37th UDK tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm gonna be talking to you guys about
how to add a material to your terrain
yes this is going to be awesome but
before I begin I want to tell you guys
this I got a new youtube channel it's
called the new Boston TV and on that
channel I'm gonna be adding all my
personal stuff like I'm gonna be doing
the live radio shows every now and then
I'm and I'm just gonna be making you
know personal blogs and update videos so
if you guys you know want to stalk me
want to see what's going on in my life
I definitely recommend you subscribe to
that challenge called the New Boston TV
and give you a nice little you know
break from my work making tutorials and
into my personal life so subscribe to
that channel and then this channel is
gonna stay my tutorial channel so
anyways just want to tell you guys about
that nice little plug so now like
promised I wanted you guys how to add
materials to your map and again my
materials I mean add grass and rocks and
dirt and you can maybe make this
mountain a mountain with the grass on
the bottom and in a Rocky Mountain with
snow on top of it so we can achieve that
through the use of materials but before
I just start plopping materials down my
map I want to talk to you guys about how
materials are gonna work in the UDK so
right now you see that we have one layer
and that layer is a height map now like
I said in the last sorrow a height map
is basically a map that tells your UDK
which area should be raised which area
should be lowered which area should be
flat it's pretty much a map telling well
just like I said just that but we can
add other layers to the UDK as well now
the other layers we're gonna be adding
is a material layer such as grass and
we're going to be adding another layer
for rocks and we can even add a layer
for trees and plants and bushes so
basically everything in our terrain gets
added in layers so I just wanted to tell
you guys that before you continue
because it might give you a little
better understanding of what we're
trying to accomplish so what we're going
to be doing now is since we already have
our height map layer we're gonna be
adding a grass layer so in order to add
a grass layer the first thing we need is
grass material so go ahead and clear
everything out and there are a bunch of
different materials that are built into
UDK if you go ahead and search Rock and
make sure you have material selected
there's a bunch of good ones right here
for you no this one's pretty good one
right there however I'm gonna be
searching ground because there's one I
like right here ground master zero one
so I'm gonna go ahead and select that
and X out of the content browser and now
it's still selected so keep that in mind
so in order to make this ground my base
layer here's what I need to do in the
layer panel right here and of course if
you have this closed out just go ahead
and hit terrain editing mode and they'll
pop back up go ahead and right-click and
select this work right here new terrain
setup layer from material auto create
and this is gonna basically take the
material that you selected and it's
gonna set up a new layer on your terrain
for it so go ahead and click it and it
takes a minute to you know load and
everything but now you have a new
terrain editing layer so now check it
out what happens when we paint as you
can see you can see a little bit better
than you know whether you were just
doing that with the default gray and
purple so what I typically like to do is
whenever I'm making a map I usually like
to make the outside mountains because
that way the user can't venture off into
the distant void so that's basically all
there is to add a new base layer so this
is nice we got a new layer of grass
covering our entire map pretty sane all
right that's cool and all but what if
you could add even another texture
because usually when you step outside
you don't see grass for ever and ever
you see rocks and trees and you see some
dirt in water so let's go ahead and add
another layer and I'm gonna teach you
guys how to do that so go ahead and open
your content browser and clear
everything out again make sure you have
material selected though and let me
think of something to look for I guess I
can just look for a rock or something
and let me look for a good rock ooh
these look pretty good I like this one
right here it's called a black Spyro 1
if you want to follow along with me so
go ahead and select that X out of your
content browser and right-click on the
empty spot on your layers panel and
click a new terrain setup from material
auto crate so it's gonna create that
layer but nothing's gonna happen pretty
weird huh
so in order for this layer to show what
we need to do is paint this layer on and
tell you decay exactly the way we want
it to appear so go ahead and make sure
your layer selected just like that and
whenever we select it we're basically
using the rock as paint
now go ahead and make sure you have your
paintbrush and I'm actually gonna bring
my radius down a titbit
because what I'm gonna be doing is I
want to paint this in only in specific
locations so let's go ahead and hold
ctrl and start to paint and now you can
see that well basically exactly like you
expect it's painting on that rock
texture
wherever I'm telling it to so that's
pretty cool that's how you get you know
a nice little rocky texture wherever you
want it so maybe it's like rocky here
maybe the inside of this mountain is
rocky and yeah that's basically how you
work with multiple layers in the UDK so
I'm gonna be putting rocks on top of my
mountains because hey if one mountain
has rocks on top of it they probably all
do so I think that's a nice look right
there but usually whenever I'm creating
a game and whenever you're creating game
here's what I recommend this is not like
a you deiicate that this is a game
development tip is you usually want to
make a path somewhere in your terrain so
the user has kind of a general idea of
where to follow if you ever play like
world Warcraft and Zelda you notice that
they had kind of dirt paths giving you a
general idea of where you're supposed to
run to because if you were to go ahead
and right-click and hit play from here
yours would be like uh okay so there's
not even like a kind of a clue on where
you're supposed to go because everything
kind of looks just like blind so go
ahead and
gonna be adding one more layer and I'm
just gonna go ahead and first clear
everything out and make sure we have
material selected and what can I search
for just go ahead and search for dirt or
something and go ahead and grab this
terrain dirt and once you have that
selected go ahead and add a new layer
for terrain dirt and make sure we have
our terrain dirt layer selected and go
ahead and paint this on so I'm gonna
bring the radius way down right about
the 28th and since my player is gonna be
starting right here that's where I want
to start my turn so what I'm gonna like
to do is hold down control and just
paint in that and now I'm gonna make a
path in between these mountains right
here and as you can see once we start
creating this path it's gonna give like
the user I want to say let me move my
camera tidbit it's gonna give the user a
general idea of where to run around in
the map so again they would be kind of
lost and now they have kind of a feeling
that alright there's a road here I
should probably travel along it to see
what's at the end of it so now if we go
ahead and pull up our player down right
here play from here again you can kind
of see that alright they're running
around
okay I'm not just running around blind
lessly anymore I have an actual path
that I need to follow and maybe the user
can go along this path and you know buy
some illegal drugs and so um the little
kids there so I don't know if you're
making the game like that you could do
that but that's the basics of how you
add multiple materials to give your
terrain a unique look and feel so that's
all you guys get in this story in the
next tutorial we have all these tools to
cover and you know a whole bunch of
stuff to cover but for now like I said
that's all you guys get so thank you for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
