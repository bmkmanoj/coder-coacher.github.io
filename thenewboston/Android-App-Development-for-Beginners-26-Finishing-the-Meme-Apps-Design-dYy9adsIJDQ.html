do is select that top one and we need to
start changing some properties so the
first thing of course is the text color
for both of these is white and the hex
is FFF and what as well do the same
thing for the bottom FFF enter RA so now
both of our text fields are white now
another thing I want to do is I actually
want to change the width of these so you
see how the size of this text field is
pretty much what it pretty much matches
whatever text is inside well that's kind
of annoying me even though it really
won't be a problem but what I'm going to
do is I'm going to change the layout
width for this text to match parent so
I'm going to put match parent and as you
can see now we can have the text field
pretty much span the entire fragment
we're going to do that for both layout
with match parent and of course the only
other problem we get for this is now
it's on the left and of course if you
like um I don't know having your text on
left you can leave it that way but
typically mean text is right in the
center so I'm going to switch back to
that first one I'm going to set gravity
to Center horizontal and Center
horizontal as well now what I actually
want to do is again for this app what's
going to happen is the user is going to
type in their own text and it's going to
pretty much set this text to whatever
they typed in but I just want to change
the default text of it because large
text looks kind of weird so for the
default text I'm just going to name this
one like top text and this one bottom
text actually let's just name it top and
bottom the user of course knows that it
is text already all right simple enough
so of course just so I don't have to
look at these stupid little warnings
changes extry
extreme resource and for the top just
going to call this one top text even
though we never actually use these
through our java code at least for the
bottom one or yet like bottom there yeah
and we will just call the bottom text
bottom underscore text and hit OK so
again I know it looks kind of weird
right now kind of stretched out and kind
of goofy-looking however whenever we
take this fragment and add it to our
activity and everything is said and done
it's actually going to look really nice
so for now the only other thing we have
to do is remember there's two parts to
every fragment the design of it which we
took care of already and the Java file
the class all right so creating the
class for this is going to take like two
and a half seconds so right-click the
package just like you created the class
for the other one new Java class of
course I'm going to name this class
bottom picture fragment all right it
looks good and now what we can actually
do instead of typing everything again is
just go to actually let me arrange this
a little bit better alright so go to all
that stuff we tucked out in I don't know
like two tutorials ago or whatever and
paste in all of those imports and again
remember I said the two rules that we
have to follow is we first need to
inherit from that fragment class so
extends fragment and the second rule was
we need to override oncreateview
and we already typed all this code so no
need to type it again alright so the one
thing that we actually do have to change
is this remember oncreateview
is where we tell it what design or what
XML file we're using so right now we sin
okay we want to use the top section for
this in the top section for this well
for that new fragment that we just
created we actually want to use
the bottom picture so if you go to this
little bit of code you can type bottom
picture fragment so now you have to
fragment classes the first one is made
to use this and the bottom one is using
this so now we have two fragments
created perfectly the only other thing
we have to do now is add these fragments
to the activity so go to your activity
main.xml file and first of all delete
this stupid default textview I wish they
didn't even include that but to add a
fragment to your main activities design
what you do is you scroll down all the
way way at the bottom and under the
custom folder you're going to see this
little thing called fragment so this
means ok we want to add a fragment to
this design and of course this is your
main activity your main screen so click
this and let's just go ahead and add the
top one first so click top section
fragment which is that fragment we just
created and hit ok so from here it says
where do you want to place that fragment
well let's just go ahead and plop it in
the very top center and now it says ok
you have a little issue I don't know
what I want your fragment to look like
and I really don't know why this pops up
I think it's going to be fixed in the
future tutorials but if you just click
this right here it says use this one
then it says ok that's what I'm using
that's what I don't know this fragment
is going to look like so now once we
have that taken care of the only other
thing we have to do is add that bottom
fragment this one right here so go back
to your activity main layout and pretty
much do the same exact thing so click
fragment choose bottom picture fragment
choose ok and stick it in the bottom
center now it says ok arm I don't know
what your layouts supposed to look like
just click this link and it says use
that XML file and
now I told you guys that since this is
actually a fragment and not an entire
activity what we can do is we can change
the size of this
so highlight fragment - which is that
bottom fragment and if you go to layout
actually you can change both of these so
layout width right now is wrap content
which means however big your contents
are just fit it to that size but what we
will actually want to do is we want to
give it a fixed height and width and we
want to make it square so I'm just going
to type like 275 DP and hit enter so
that's the width and actually let me
just copy that now for the height 275 DP
since I want this to be square and hit
enter again now since it's positioned at
the bottom Center that's where it's
going to reside and actually that's kind
of small and I have a little bit of
space so I'm going to change this to 300
G when we change the height can we go
bigger I think we can go 320 320 can you
do it without hole yeah look in sweet
look and sweetie oh my god I feel like I
want to eat that dropped beat alright so
that is pretty much how we arrange our
main activity so right now again this
entire thing is our main activity but
it's consisting of two different
fragments the top section fragment in
the bottom picture fragment pretty sweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
