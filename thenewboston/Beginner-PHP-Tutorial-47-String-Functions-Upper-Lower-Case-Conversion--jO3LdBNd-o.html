in this video created for the new Boston
we're going to be talking about upper
and lower case conversion in PHP now
let's first of all just take a look at a
simple string so I'm going to say I am
or I could be any case okay so this
string could be user user supply data it
could be anything really but in this
case we're you looking at a static
string that we've just created now what
happens if I want to create this string
completely lower case now we'll look at
an example of how we can do this first
the same with upper case however we'll
also then talk about why this might be
useful in real-life situations
so string lower I've create a new
variable and this is equal to STR to
lower and then in brackets we've add the
string that we want to convert with the
correct dollar sign
so essentially what we've done is create
a new variable here we've used a
function here called STR to lower so
it's quite easy to remember and we've
supplied it with the argument string so
we're converting this string to
lowercase so now what we can do is
underneath so we can echo string lower
so let's preview that in our browser and
see if that's worked and you can see M
has in fact worked the Iowas capital
before as you can see here and it's not
anymore so for example I could say I
could be any case and if i refresh now
you see that we get exactly the same
result because whatever capital letters
are there we're converting them back to
lowercase so now let's try the same but
with uppercase so I'm going to create a
new variable underneath here called
string upper and that's going to be
equal to STR - and you probably guessed
it upper and then we supply it with the
same data so string now let's just
change this output so we're echoing the
upper rather than the lower and we can
refresh and see what happens
Oh
let's just have a look here I think of
too many peas in them okay so let's
refresh okay so now we can see that our
string has been converted to completely
uppercase
so it's extremely simple to convert from
lowercase to uppercase from uppercase to
lowercase and from an user user typed
text to any case as well now why would
we want to use these functions inside of
PHP now I'm just going to be focusing on
the STR to lower just for the moment and
we're going to create a short program
that demonstrates this the first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
form with an action and a method so
we're going to post that get or submit
that as get and the action is going to
be index dot PHP and the form there and
we're just going to take one line of
user data so let's say name by doing I'm
starting a link for no reason so input
type is text the name of this is just
going to be user underscore name and
then we can break down and we'll add a
submit button type equals submit and the
value of that is going to be submit okay
so let's just preview this now browser
to make sure everything is looking and
working okay okay so the point of this
example I'm going to show you is I want
a user to enter their name and we want I
want to perform an if statement on this
user's name now if I was to type my name
usually in here I might just type Alex
in lowercase but me personally I'd
usually use Alex with a capital A and as
it should be written however how do you
know how your user is going to enter a
specific value into a text field you
don't they could type Alex they could
type Alex they could even say Alex like
that you don't know how people are going
to type their name in so if you're
taking generic data such as a name and
you just want to perform you know a
comparison on it using a comparison
operator you might want to convert it to
lowercase so whatever the user types in
you can always perform the
check correctly so if it doesn't make
sense we'll carry on and I'll show you
an example so the first thing we're
going to do is I'm going to check for
the data so when it's a is if is set
dollar underscore get user name and the
reason I've used get is so we can keep
an eye on it in the in the URL bar at
the top so I'm going to say and not
empty dollar underscore get user name
and if these two statements evaluates to
true or this whole site statements to
hold evaluates to true we can reset the
variable name here this is just to
ensure we don't grab any errors outside
of this because if we were to put this
username equals dollar underscore get
user name outside of this if statement
we'd probably have an undefined index
error so if you if you find you're
getting errors undefined index this is
why because you're setting a variable to
something that may not exist before you
do your checks or you might not be doing
check still anyway so username equals
get user name so let's just echo that
out so we can preview this now browser
and get an idea of what's going on so
I'm typing Alex with a capital A first
of all and I'm going to click Submit now
it doesn't seem to shown have a look
what we might have done wrong user name
oh yeah okay so I haven't included my
underscore there so let's just type that
in again I'm going to type Alex with a
capital A I'm going and I'm going to
click Submit so you can see that's been
posted back to us we can view it we can
also keep an eye on we've got a capital
A up here and then the rest are le X's
in lowercase now I'm going to type it in
in completely lowercase and you can see
that both values here are updated
however now what I want to do is inside
here let's just take away that echo or
to create a check to say if username
equals Alex so remember we're using a
double equals here for a comparison then
I want to say and let's just say you are
the best okay so um I know a bit of an
odd example but okay so my point is that
if we were checking for the username L
this users name that we've specified now
let's just type in Alex with a capital A
again now the result I'm going to get
now is absolutely nothing however if I
type in lowercase we're now checking in
lowercase just here so you know it's
only going to echo out you are the best
if the user has typed their name even
though it's the same name we're only
going to get this message here if you
look if it's in lowercase so this simple
solution is to create a new variable
don't convert this username variable
because if you if you need to use it
later on or store it you want to store
it the same way the user has typed it in
but you want to use a comparison on your
lowercase version so you want to create
a new variable for this so use a name
I'm going to say LLC for lowercase
equals
dollar underscore now what we can do is
say equals user name with the underscore
remember however we're going to enclose
this in the STR to lower function so now
what we're doing is we're creating a new
variable good user name we're converting
what the users already typed a lowercase
and now what we can do is we can simply
perform
check here but we've still got the
original value that the user entered
even though we've created a lowercase
version so let's just check if this
works which it should do so with Alex in
here with the lowercase version and we
click Submit
it says you're the best however with the
Alex and the capital A beforehand it
didn't work but now it does and we can
even just do something silly like that
and click Submit and it still works
however the point I wanted to get across
because we've created this new variable
now what you can do is you can specify
the variable the original way that it
was typed so even though we're comparing
only the lowercase version you can still
use the original version so let's just
refresh it says you are the best a
capital L small capital X so the same
with Alex with a capital A and then
exactly the same with a small so it
maintains the structure that the user
has used to type it whether it be this
this or this but we're performing the
check on the name as a whole so we're
not taking into account the users case
we're taking into account what they have
actually typed so that's basically a
really useful example of the STR to
lower and how it could be used in
everyday applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
