tutorial that I'm making fourth on New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to use the streamreader
class so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and a text box
and once you have those on your form
just go ahead and double down the bottom
now before we can create an instance of
our streamreader class we're first going
to want to have to access that namespace
of the streamreader is in and the
streamreader is in the system dot IO
namespace so in order to access that
we're going to want to use a using
statement here just to system dot IO so
now we can access everything inside of
this system dot IO namespace but before
we're going to create an instance of our
streamreader we're first going to want
to create an instance of an open file
dialog and have that open filed a lot
dialogue be shown so that the user can
specify which file that they want to be
read so we're just going to do open file
dialog and if you don't know what an
open file dialog is just go back and
watch my 34th c-sharp tutorial because
in that tutorial I explained how to use
equal to file dialogue and basically
what it is alright so once you have this
code typed out here we can now create an
instance of our stream reader so to do
that you're just going to type out
screen reader SR or stream reader and
just set it equal to a new stream reader
and right here it calls for a stream so
in order to create a stream we're just
going to do file dot and then open a
read because we're just going to be
reading the file and it says right there
opens an existing file for reading yeah
opens an existing file for reading and
that's exactly what we're going to do
we're going to be reading the file and
now inside of here it calls for a path
and we now need a path to the file that
we want to read and since we're using
this open file dialog right here you can
just do ofd dot file name use the file
name property in the Open File dialog
class to access that file and
explain a little bit more in depth of
what this filename property is in the
34th c-sharp tutorial so now that we
have that all set we can now read the
file and the first method that we're
going to be looking at is the read to
end method and it says right here read
it stream from the current position to
the end of the stream and since we
haven't specified a position it will
just default lis start at the beginning
and for text files what this will do is
it will read all the text inside of the
text file so we're going to have it read
all the text from the text file into our
text box and I already have a text file
set up for reading and the contents of
this text file is just hi period so now
if we go ahead debug here these are open
file dialog to navigate to our text file
open the text file we should just get
yeah hi and this message box right here
if we were to change the contents of
this text file to change to hello I am
Adam save it then reopen this program
and read it we should get hello my name
is Adam or hello I am Adam that's what I
wrote it as so now the next thing that
I'm going to show you is how to use the
clothes or how to use how to dispose of
this human reader you're just going to
do s are disposed and basically what
this will do is it will close the file
so if we were to try to create another
instance of stream reader without this
dispose and then read the same file we
would get an error saying this file is
already being used by another process so
getting a habit of disposing of your
streams whenever you're using them so
this way you'll never get that error now
this reach to end method is all great
for text files but what does it actually
do well in order to view what it
actually does you're going to have to
download a program called HX DX editor
and in order to do that just go on
google and type in
xD and go ahead and click the first link
and then scroll down until you see the
download page link put that and scroll
down until you see your language which
should be English and see it but yep
there it is so yeah it's go ahead and
download it and then once you have it
downloaded just open it up and then I'm
just going to open up the text file
right here txt file and right over to
the right right here is what the text
file or what this read to end reads so
as you can see for text files it's just
the contents of the text file and if we
were to change this is something like
different right here I don't know just
hello and then I guess it already was
that well if we were to just like spikes
a bunch of crap right here and save it
and then reopen that text file up we
should get all that crap we just tight
yep there's all those letters now like I
said before this is this is only for
text files if we were to open like an
exe or something or pretty much any
other file type it's not going to read
it how we'd expect like if we were to
open up this Exe or a year it just it's
just a whole bunch of crap and none of
this is really useful to us I'll talk
about what this is on this side in the
next tutorial but yeah this read to end
will just read all of this information
on the right side over here so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial in the
next tutorial we're still going to be
using the stream reader we're just going
to be looking into reading bytes so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
