with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we are going to be
creating an element and this element is
a div just here and the element is going
to follow us as we scroll down the page
so you see I've got some background
content here and my scroll bar shows
that I can scroll quite a way down the
page and we're also going to make it so
we can click on the element and hide it
as well so let's go ahead and start to
scroll down the page and see what
happens
you can see that the element is
following us all the way down so it's
staying in the exact position that it's
in now there's a it's a tiny bit jumpy
and we are not really going to look at
ways we can fix this but we're gonna be
dealing with the initial concept of
actually scrolling an element down the
page it shouldn't really matter too much
with things like images if you were to
place images inside this div so you know
you could just create your div as an
image essentially or have an image
scroll down the page on its own so we're
just going to be taking a look at
creating this just how you can see it
working which isn't bad at all it's
quite a neat effect and quite useful if
you want something on your page that you
know for example this could be a menu it
could be absolutely anything but I've
created the additional functionality
where we can click it and actually hide
it
so as we enter the page or as we enter
the page you see it slightly fades in
but when we click it we can actually
hide it as well so we can hide this you
know anywhere down the page as well it
has the same functionality so it's quite
useful for creating for example adverts
that would follow a user down the page
or such as something like information
that the user might need to know you
might want to let your users know as
they scroll down the page so let's go
ahead and go over to our text editor and
start to write this out ok so inside of
our text editor on our index page we're
going to have to actually create the div
that we want you know to be displayed
and obviously in just a minute ago you
would have seen the the paragraphs that
I have here this element will follow you
all the way down the page and you can
hide it
clicking on it so all I've done is I've
gone ahead and created a div with the
idea follow this is important because we
need to use this div ID to reference it
select it in jQuery and my page content
is here which is a long line of content
that you've seen so at the moment on our
page if we were to go over to our
browser you can see it looks like this
we've got these two paragraphs here
contained within the div however what we
want to go and do is actually style this
so it here's to the edge of the page and
also give it some sort of other other
CSS properties that will mean it is in
the correct position essentially so we
can go ahead and style this using the ID
follow so inside style dot CSS which
I've included on my page just here the
link rel to the stylesheet I'm gonna go
ahead and type follow and inside here
we're gonna need to give it some
properties so there's quite a bit to
think about here if you're not too good
at CSS but most of the the parameters
are self-explanatory
the first one is position:absolute and
all this means is that we can we can
place it at an absolute position on our
page which is extremely important
because we want it to overlap other page
content so we want the position set to
absolute and because we have the
position set to absolute we can then go
ahead and specify how many pixels from
the left-hand side of the page it is and
also how many pixels it is from the top
and I've chosen 10 and 10 now in ext is
which I've also included on the page
here obviously as well as jQuery we can
actually take this value a bit later on
so we wouldn't ever have to go ahead and
modify ext ojs if we wanted it's a 20
from the top and 20 from the left we
could change this in style dot CSS and
not have to worry about changing our
jQuery code so we're gonna make it more
dynamic as well in the way that it picks
up the position of the current element
so we'll just give it some basic
properties like a height will give this
300 pixels and also a width as well we
can just give this a width of say 180
pixels we also want to go ahead and just
give it a background
color which is you know just so we can
see it on the page and it hasn't just
got a plain white background and also we
want to go ahead and give it a border so
that's the border of one pixel a solid
border and the color is 40 40 40 which
I've chosen which is a sort of mid gray
color I'm also going to go ahead and
give it some padding so we have our text
shown correctly now the CSS that I've
just written here will enable it to be
viewed in a different way at the moment
you can just see it's just text here on
a page essentially but when we refresh
you can see that we've now got it styled
correctly it's in a position absolute
which means it is overlapping our
content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
