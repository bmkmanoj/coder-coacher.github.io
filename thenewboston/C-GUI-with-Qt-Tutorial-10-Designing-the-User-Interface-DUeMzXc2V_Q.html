want to show you guys one of the
shortcuts I was talking about and
actually hold on
I'm getting ahead of myself now once you
have this button selected go over here
to the object name and you see where it
says push button actually change this to
go button so go button and I think
that's all you know a little bit better
because it does say go on and whenever
we're coding it's just going to more
clearly define what button we're working
with so make sure that my object name is
set up now if you hit the shortcut hold
ctrl on your keyboard and hit a at the
same time as you notice is selected all
of my widgets so now that all of my
widgets are selected go ahead and hold
down control under your keyboard and hit
a CH now once you do that check it out
they line up in a horizontal layout
already set up for you by default so now
you can just go ahead and adjust this
entire layout and how freakin sweet is
that and who the heck is texting me
right in my middle it's ro
I'll read it if it's not too
embarrassing okay and two new messages
actually from Kirk and Joby not are we
going to read them because not
interested alright so sorry for that
little break and now that we have a
horizontal layout laid out perfectly
what we want to do now is we want to add
the main text area that text is going to
appear because you know what are we
searching for right now a word and we're
a grey box no way we need a text area so
go up here and type in the word text
edit and a text edit widget is basically
are you freaking kidding me quit texting
me should probably just put my phone on
silent but instead I'll just get mad
every time someone texted me during the
tutorial so I know it's a text edit area
it's basically an area that you can have
of course a big thing of text in so this
is going to be like the paragraph and
this is going to be the term that you're
searching for so go ahead and lay that
out in the general area and now once you
do that click the grey box and this is a
kind of important so pay attention if
you know you were you watching youtube
videos
something make sure you don't have any
widgets elected but the gray box itself
and once you have that gray box lesson
selected hold down control and press L
on your keyboard now check this out
everything gets laid out perfectly and a
nice beautiful vertical layout so now
that we have everything lined up and it
just looks amazingly pretty the last
thing I want you guys to do is go ahead
and right click the Go button and hit go
to slots now obviously you already know
what slots are pretty much armed well I
already explained I'm not going to
explain it again just waste of time but
what we are interested in is the clipped
slot right here so go ahead and hit OK
and now we pretty much have our
interface setup ready to start typing
the code so in the next couple of
tutorials what I'm going to do is first
of all show you guys that the code that
we need to create but aside from that
I'm going to be taking you guys through
all of the code that was generated
automatically for us and I just want to
go over all of this code line by line
because you know it's nice to know what
we need to do for the program to work
but it's even better if we have a full
understanding of what every single line
does even the ones that were
automatically generated for us so for
now I think you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe I'm going to put my
phone on vibrate and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
