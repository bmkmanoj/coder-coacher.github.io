welcome to another Photoshop cs6
tutorial today we're going to be going
over the custom shape tool and we're
gonna learn how to work with it so what
the custom shape tool does is allow you
to pick from a group of shapes that
Photoshop has preset or you can load in
your own custom shapes and you can
easily just put them on to your newest
layer so the custom shapes tool is where
the rectangle or the other shape tools
are so click on it and hold and then
come down to the custom shape tool now
your shape is going to be determined by
this part up here at the top where it
says shape and click go ahead and click
on the drop down menu and it'll have a
bunch of shapes for you that you can
pick from now I just hit the heart
selected right now so all I gotta do is
click and drag and I'll drag out a heart
for me if I hold shift it will constrain
it proportionally where the heart is
going to be the size that originally is
in the image or up here like the exact
proportions that it was a resilient app
so we can go ahead and pick other shapes
too if we want here's a tree easy enough
and then your shapes are determined or
the color of your shapes are made by the
layers here that you have are the
foreground color that you have selected
so now my tree is probably going to be
blue and that's how you just load up
those custom shapes pretty easy now if
you just want to have regular raster
shapes ones that you don't need to that
you're able to add filters to and things
like that you can make sure you have to
make sure that this right here up in the
top left is set to pixels now if you
want to shape layers which I haven't
gone over yet those are if you change it
to shape up here it'll create a shape
layer for you and I'll go over shape
layers in the next tutorial they have a
bit more options that I can go over I'm
just going to go back and you can see
that when you try to like make some of
these shapes unproportional and things
like that they might have some
artifacting
just like that last shape layer that I
had was so we'll go ahead and you can
mess around with your shapes now if you
want to add more shapes just click on
this gear right here for the tool
options and then you can add more and
here's the ones that Photoshop already
has in here for you so I'll go to
animals and then if you can hit OK to
replace all the shapes or you can hit a
pen to add it to the end so I'm going to
hit append and now we've got a couple
more animal shapes here or here I've got
the snail and that's how you do that
now if you want to load in shapes that
you've downloaded off the internet make
sure you download your shapes into your
custom shapes folder go to the tools and
go to load shapes it it'll automatically
take it to your custom shapes folder now
I don't have any custom shapes in here
because I don't really use it a lot but
that's how you would load them in you
just hit OK and then they would it would
ask you to pend or replace what's this
right here
just a bunch of seeds so there are a
couple of other options here we've got
our blending mode which will show how
these will interact with each other so
if I put these seeds on top of this the
blending of them is going to be
different where they are mixing with
each other um then we've got our opacity
which is self-explanatory just going to
show the epicness of what you just put
down so I'll just put this right next to
these ones enough you can see that these
ones are darker and are less opaque then
are more picked than then used once I
just put down that are at 50% and here's
that like 8% you can definitely see the
difference they're more lighter and then
here's a tool options we've got our you
can use this by defined proportions if
you click you can create your custom
shape there and after you drag out it's
always going to be at the proportions
that the image was originally made at so
that we don't have to hold down shift
let me put my opacity back up let's
clear the board a little bit
going into my history I'm just going
back to when it was just a regular board
let's get off of these seeds and put on
something that's easier to see like this
dog bone here now the rest of our things
we've got defined size so it's always
going to be the size that it's at I'm
trying to click and drag right now but
it's only giving me that so basically if
you click and drag it's going to give it
at the size that it's already at so if
you have like something like a company
logo maybe that you like to use a lot
you would want to load this into the
shape layers and then you can use your
these different parts here too are these
different options here to customize your
logo as I would say so we've got the
fixed size where you can type it in you
can type in what 100 pixels by 100
pixels and then when I go to click and
drag that's what it's 100 by 100 looks
like and then we've got our from Center
then I go to up constrained from Center
and then when I drag out it's going to
drag from the center of where I was or
it's going to expand from the center of
where I was dragging out instead of the
edge so this is what Center looks like
and I'll show you when it's off this is
what it looks like so that's how that
works
Handa that's basically all there is for
the shape tool oh there is one thing I
want to go over we've got the anti-alias
here and then if I have that unchecked
and dragged out you can see that the
edges are pretty choppy well if you turn
my back on the edges will be nice and
smooth so that's what that's for
so that now this is all I want it to go
over for this and hopefully you guys
learn how to use the shape tool pretty
well load up some things that you're
going to use all the time so you can
easily just add in whatever you're going
to use a lot with just one click and
it's easy enough so thanks a lot for
watching the tutorial and have a good
one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
