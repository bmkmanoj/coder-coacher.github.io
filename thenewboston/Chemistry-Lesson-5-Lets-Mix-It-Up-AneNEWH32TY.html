is to know about pure substances
elements and compounds we can finally
get into the good stuff and that is
mixtures so let me go ahead and remind
you guys one last time because I know
we've been talking about pure substances
for a while what a mixture is mixtures
are basically two or more pure
substances that are mixed together for
example if you have sand and salt put
them in a bag shook it all up mix it
together you don't have a chemically new
compound like water or anything no
chemical reactions are taking place you
just have a bunch of freaking sand in
your salt or salt in your sand depending
on which one you wanted like why would
you do that why would you even put salt
and sand in a bag and shake it up that's
just ridiculous there's no need for that
don't do it so basically there's still
two very distinct substances they're
just all mixed and jumbled together now
so whenever we look at our graph we can
say okay so how can you jumble things
together differently and get these two
different types of mixtures homogeneous
and heterogeneous let's go ahead and
take a look at that homogeneous mixtures
are sometimes called solutions because
they're uniform or same throughout for
example if you took some salt and you
threw into a cup of water and you shook
it up real good then you would have salt
water now whether you took a sample from
the top of the glass or the bottom of
the glass or somewhere in the middle
you're always going to have salt water
it's not going to change whether you
take a little bit a lot it's all salt
water there's nothing you can do about
it
however a heterogeneous mixture is a
little bit different it is not the same
throughout and it's not uniform think of
this is like if you went to McDonald's
and you got one of those delicious
delicious chicken salads you would have
like chunks of chicken in it and you
would have some lettuce hopefully not
too much lettuce that's gross we want
the chicken and you know maybe some
mayonnaise in there why not throw some
cheese in there so you pretty much have
a bunch of crap mixed together but you
can still it still has a very
distinctive parts
so while homogeneous mixtures are
something like kool-aid where you put
everything together mix it all
and you can't tell what's what it all
looks uniforming the same heterogeneous
mixtures is basically just the opposite
it's not the same throughout the crap is
mixed together but you can still
recognize the different pieces the parts
are still very distinct so now let's go
ahead and recap what we learned one last
time matter is split up into two parts
pure substances in mixtures I think we
cover that enough let's go ahead and
touch on these four and give you example
of each an example of an element would
be something like gold where all of the
atoms are the same an example of a
compound would be something like water
where you have two different types of
atoms and we'll talk about atoms later
on two different types of balls some
hydrogen some oxygen that's what you get
in order to make a compound both of
these things are classified as pure
substances by chemists not me
chemists blame them if you don't like it
now with mixtures it's pretty much a
bunch of pure substances mixed together
a homogeneous mixture is something like
kool-aid where you have the what's it
called the flavoring the sugar the water
you mix it all together and there are
any chemical reactions that's taking
place
you just can't tell what's what it's all
looks the same heterogeneous however is
different it's like a salad all your
craps mixed together but it has very
distinct and you can still recognize the
different pieces on it
so basically gold water kool-aid chicken
salad that's all you need to know thank
you for watching don't forget subscribe
and yeah I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
