freaking cat jaja sorry I gotta go I
gotta teach these guys how to connect
with frickin Silva sorry guys that's
just how I talk when I'm not on YouTube
but anyways in this lesson I'm going to
show you guys how to connect to a server
so connect a server there we go so of
course this is the method connect to
server that we're going to be coding so
you know we guess we might as well name
it private void connect to server and
this is also going to throws IO
inception I'm just getting exception not
as exciting not as good as a movie but
the first thing we have to do is we're
going to go ahead and display a message
which is a nice little prompt to the
user and we're going to say dude
attempting connection if we're not there
yet just hold your horses because that's
what we're doing so after this like I
said what we need to do is basically
create a socket and the socket is the
connection between this computer and
another computer so what information do
we need to connect to a server well
whenever we're connecting to a server
what we need is two pieces of
information the first piece of
information is the IP address of that
server now every computer on the
Internet has an IP address which is
pretty much unidentified for that
computer now once we know what computer
we want to connect to we need the port
number because there's a bunch of
different ports on that server
a bunch of different applications we
want to say that this is the application
that we want to use this is the port
that we want to use so connection equals
new socket and the socket of course
takes
we sure don't type anything wrong get by
name so get my name and the name that
goes in here is server IP server IP just
like that now the next one is the port
in its six seven eight nine all right so
basically those are two things I told
you remember in the last tutorial or not
the last Itoro but whenever we were
creating the server program then we said
remember that port this is what I said
to you guys remember that pour write it
down on a sticky note or something
because it's very important well if you
forgot it then just go ahead and open up
the program that you just made um what
if you were just following along with my
sorrows then the six seven eight nine
basically the port on your server that
we're going to connect to and what this
does right here is it passes it in the
IP address now you need the specific IP
address
whenever you're connecting to a server
and it's going to be different from mine
probably but for now just remember that
just for testing purposes we can just
use on the same computer that you're
working on but whenever you really make
it then you need to you know ask the
owner or just find out the IP address
from online or something and it gets
passed in through whenever we call this
class right here and it gets set
whenever we uh you know create the class
object itself then and get pet it will
excuse me got the hiccups gets passed in
through host and it sets equal to server
IP so now this variable server IP is a
variable that all these methods can use
and the server IP is the IP of the
server so that's why we are allowed to
use it right here this is the IP address
and this is the port on that server fair
enough so now the last thing that we
need to do is just give a nice little
prompt that says okay dude you are
connected so show massage and we'll just
say something like
connected to and we might as well give
them the IP drift so connection because
we're extracting information from that
connection or the socket get in an
address get host name so this is
basically going to say okay what is the
IP address of the server that we're
connected to and yeah I mean let me
review this one more time so basically
we're going to say attempting connection
once we're connection then the socket is
going to be made and we're going to be
connected to this server at this port
and then we just go ahead and say dude
you're connected you're good go so in
the next story what do we need to do
next
aha yes of course once we're connected
we have to set up the streams or the
roadways that communicate back and forth
between the client and the server it's
going to be awesome so thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
