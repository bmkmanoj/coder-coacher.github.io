absolute values because you're going to
be using them a lot in computer
programming and the reason for that is
because they are awesome whenever you're
doing stuff like calculating dates or
maybe on the weight of something or the
distance because you're going to allow
the user to answer to values such as May
they're calculating their age well what
if they put the year that they were born
first like 1986 and they said try to
subtract the current year from it like
2014 well if they did that then it's
going to give you a negative number
because you're subtracting a bigger
number from a smaller one and of course
their age wouldn't be negative 28 so you
need to convert that to a positive
number so your program doesn't crash so
again it's good for distances and
weights and ages so I'll show you guys
how to build a simple program like that
right now so we'll go ahead and put into
year 1 and int year 2 which is pretty
much going to be the two years that they
enter to calculate the age of something
and we're store the final age right
there now for printf let's just go ahead
and give them a nice little prompt on
the screen be like enter a year now
enter a tear you have to be crying to
use this program all right enter a year
newline and we'll just scanf and for
this of course for scanning percent D
since we love weird with integers and
ampersand year and % tyr year one all
right so now whatever value they entered
hopefully it was an integer we store it
in year one of course we need to do this
again enter another year and store that
in year two so now we got two numbers
integers so the first thing we need to
do is make an equation to calculate the
age so H equals year 1 minus year 2
now this actually doesn't matter since
we're going to be using absolute value
you can put your two minus two one
you know it won't make a difference cool
little thing about this so what I want
to do after this is actually print out
the value that we came up with first the
value or the original value that we
calculated without using absolute value
so for now percent the new line and age
now after this what we're going to do is
we're going to figure that this number
that we came up with can either be the
correct one if they entered armed you
know one of the numbers first or the
wrong one it can be negative if they
enter the smaller number first so no
matter what we want to go ahead and
calculate the absolute value using the
function a be s so whenever we pass age
into here if it's a negative number is
going to convert it convert it into the
positive number if it's positive is just
going to leave it the same so now when
you print that bad boy out again check
it out enter your year 1986 enter
another year 2014 okay so this one they
tried to subtract 2014 from 1986 and it
got negative 28 well you don't want to
put that into your program or else it's
going to crash everything later on so
the absolute value converts that to 28
and of course if they entered it
correctly which is 2014 1986 it
calculates 28 and leaves it at 28 so
again whenever you're developing
software you always want to assume that
the user is going to F something up and
you want to make your program is user
proof as possible so using absolute
value is a great way to do that
sometimes it's necessary whenever you're
using distances like if I was to put two
distances in there then either way would
be the correct way for the user so you
would still need to use absolute value
same thing with weights and so on and so
forth
so um for now that's probably good for
this tutorial thank you guys for
watching actually might as well show you
guys some other small ones real quick
and uh let's see what I can do go ahead
and do this so we'll just use one print
statement and we'll print out a couple
floats and I don't need to make a whole
tutorial for these um the first one is
this function POW now this means is
whenever you run this you have to punch
your computer as hard as you can until
your fist goes pow I'm just kidding
actually stands for power and you need
to enter two values for this the first
one is the base and the second one is
the exponent what this is pretty much
saying is I want to see 5 to the third
power so if you guys don't know what
this is it should be 125
so pretty much 5 times 5 is 25 times 5
is 125 so that's what that does again
I don't need a whole tutorial explaining
that and the only other one I wanted
mention real quick is SQ RT this stands
for squirt and you have to squirt water
on your computer just kind of good so
this actually stands for square root and
whatever number you pass in like 164 it
prints the square root of that number so
before I run this can you guess what it
is square root of 164 probably on a
twelve point six or something twelve
point eight I was close but basically
the square root of 164 is twelve point
eight maybe you guys gets closer than me
so those are a few math functions again
out of all of those you're probably
going to be using absolute value the
most but now you have the power function
and square root on hand so well for now
thank you guys for watching and I'll
I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
