today and in Illustrator cs6 we're gonna
do some more things with paths I'm gonna
learn how to divide up paths like pretty
much like cutting out shaped or cutting
shapes out of paths
I'm gonna learn how to split up paths
and probably gonna learn how to merge
paths as well so let's go on because we
got a lot to learn so the first thing I
want to show you is how to divide a path
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use
this star to cut a shape out of the
square or out of the rectangle that I
have here and this is going to be called
dividing paths so I'm gonna just take
this star I'm gonna put it over top of
the rectangle and you can't see it
because they're the same color maybe I
should actually change the color so we
can see it better there we go
and what I'm gonna do is select the make
sure it's selected and go to the object
menu and then we're gonna go to path and
then we're gonna go to divide objects
below so now it's cut out kind of like a
cookie cutter as you can see there and
and now it has moved out I had to use
the direct selection tool to get it out
because it was right in there and now we
have this going on if I take away the
stroke of this object you can see that
it's right in there the stroke was added
to the added to the middle because it's
around the edges of the object and
that's what a stroke does so that's uh
what I wanted to show you about dividing
paths pretty easy just you're basically
just like cookie cutting out of the path
all right the next thing that I want to
show you was about splitting paths so I
guess we can use this we can use this
star over here
and I'll make it bigger so we can all
see I'll just delete this out of there
so make this bigger get my selection
tool here there we go and we're gonna
want to select the scissors and that's
under the eraser tool and the hotkey for
scissors is C now when you have the
scissors tool it allows you to split an
open path into two paths or open up a
closed path so you have the scissors
tool selected and then you've got a
crosshairs icon here if you click on a
closed path it turns into an open and if
you click on an open path that splits it
into two paths so you just click on the
line segment and now it has put it looks
like it put an anchor point there but if
I move it the path is now actually
opened and that's how you cut paths out
using the scissor tool you have to use
the direct selection tool to move the
end points so I'll do it again I'll just
cut right here and you have to go to
your direct selection tool hotkey a so
you can move your anchor points now let
me just do an open path and I'll show
you what that does so that's an open
path because it's not doesn't have three
out of three sides that connect to each
other and then cut this right here and
it's basically you're just going to
create two new paths for me and there we
go pretty easy
now the next thing I want to show you is
how to split a path using the control
panel so make sure you have a direct
selection tool used or selected get down
here make and have the anchor points
that you want to split up or cut out
select one so I've got this one right
here selected if you come up here you
can see a scissor underneath a curved
line and that's cut paths at selected
anchor points click it and it does the
same thing as the scissor tool just did
now you can grab more than one so if I
grab these two and cut as you can you
can see that it cut those out we've got
another path here that it made out of it
so it doesn't delete them it just cuts
it out the last thing I want to show you
is how to join up your paths so say you
accidentally cut your path and 1/2 and
you start working and you don't realize
that you do a whole bunch of things and
then you realize that this path has been
cut so how do you get these paths back
together I'll grab your direct selection
tool and you see we have these two
anchor points just I just want to show
you that they are indeed to a cut path
and go ahead and select them both go to
object path and then go to join and now
when I try to move it you can see it's
actually 1 and then if I want to I can
just go ahead and delete that anchor
point and it'll be as if nothing was
ever nothing ever happened and it's just
a line there when you delete an anchor
point when it was when you didn't move
anything it's just gonna be fine it's
not really gonna mess up your original
shape now I want to show you what
happens if you try to move these I'm
gonna make sure some this is a path is
selected
all right and then I'll cut it with the
scissors and then I'll move these okay
so now these are moved I try to join
these it's gonna join them with a line
but make sure that your app your points
are on top of each other if you wanted
to join them that way there's one more
thing we go to object path and we go to
average you get to pick between a
horizontal and vertical axis or both and
I hit okay and it's going to try to
average them together when it joins them
so that's all I want to show you for
this we learned about marching the paths
splitting the paths and cutting shapes
out of your paths so thanks a lot for
watching the tutorial give a thumbs up
if you liked the video or give it a like
and thanks for watching and see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
