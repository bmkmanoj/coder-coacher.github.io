Photoshop cs6 tutorial and in this
tutorial we're just going to be learning
some of the basics of layers we're going
to learn about selecting layers and
grouping layers so let's get started
with the tutorial might as well so you
need to have a few layers within your
document to follow along with this so
just create some layers out of anything
that could be just shapes they could be
text layers or whatever just have a few
of them up here I just got a bunch of
pictures and then some text there and
then my background layer so sometimes
when you're working in Photoshop you may
need to select multiple layers and there
is a hacky that you need to hold down
while you're selecting your layers to
select multiple layers and it's the same
as in as if you were like searching
through like folders on just like your
computer regularly you can select
non-contiguous layers by holding down
ctrl and then selecting the layers and
that way when you do that nothing gets
selected in between or if you want to
select a bunch of layers that are in
between so from maybe that's all down to
the text here if I hold shift it's just
going to select all the layers for me
and now I can move those around if I
need to like if I need want to move them
below the background for some reason or
something like something crazy like that
who knows so when you have a layer
selected it turns to this blue color and
you know that your another way you know
that your layer selected is that it has
this like these little outlines around
your thumbnail on the layer so it's the
little white things that are around the
edges of the square so that's what how
you know when you have a layer selected
it's called the active layer in
Photoshop terms so another way that you
can select the layers without going down
here into your layer panel is by using
your move tool so the move tool is up
here in the top left it has the arrow
then the multi directional arrows so
right up here and you can select layers
by clicking on the picture and it will
select the layers for it so if you try
to just click on them regularly you
won't be getting be able to select a
layer you'll just be able to move around
the layer that you have selected over in
the layer panel if you hold down ctrl
and then go to click on a layer so I
just held down control and then click on
this picture here of Bucky now if I have
that layer selected as you can see on
the right and I'm able to move that
layer around instead instead of going
over and clicking on the layer panel now
this a nifty little hockey saves you a
ton of time by not having to go and find
what you're looking for in the layer
panel you can just click on it in your
canvas now if you want to select more
than one layer while you're working all
you have to do is hold down control may
deselect here what I got to do is hold
down ctrl shift and then click on the
layers that you want to have selected
and now you were able to move these
around it looks like when I hold ctrl
and shift it changes my it's a hot key
for my screen recorder to start being
able to use screen draw so I'm going to
have to change that later but if I just
hit escape then I'm fine
I can keep using this so it's a ctrl +
Shift and just select the pictures on
your canvas now if you need to deselect
the layers all I need to go up to is in
the menus up here go to select and
deselect layers which is right here if
you need to select all the layers at
once really quickly go up to select and
then you can select all layers and that
will select all the layers for you now
we can't do anything with the background
where our background layer or select it
because it is locked and that's one of
the things that locking does for you and
one of the advantages of using locks
now if you don't really feel like
holding down control to selected
different layers you can go to your move
tool options which is right up here
right underneath your menus up here
click on auto select and then you have
the option of layer or group so I don't
have any groups right now so we're going
to go to layers and we're just going to
click on anything I'll click on this
text here and if I click on it I don't
have to hold ctrl or anything it
automatically selects it so it depends
on your workflow what you want to do if
you want to automatically have the
Select without holding down any hotkeys
that's up to you
you just do that by clicking on the auto
select button up there the next thing
we're going to learn about is grouping
layers and grouping layers is good for
keeping your document organized and to
add like speed to your document for
example if I put all these in a layer
and then move the just the entire group
I could do that quickly without having
to go select everything so what you need
to do for that to be able to group
things is come down here to the bottom
where this a bottom right underneath
your layers panel and click on this
folder and it will create a group for
you and the group goes what goes right
above whatever you had less selected I'm
just going to drag it to the top and if
I double click on it I can name this
group and I'll just call it test or
something like that not the best name
and I can just grab our dragged a few of
these things into the group and now
they're contained within the group
folder I can collapse to hide some of
the stuff if I wanted to or undo it or
click on this little arrow here and
it'll expand the group to see what's
inside now one cool thing about grouping
is that all I have to do is hit this I
button once to maybe hide a whole
or make it show up or whatever I need to
and if I have the move tool selected and
I just go to have the group select it if
I go to move it oops I have the Auto
Select on that's one thing about Auto
Select so uncheck the auto select
because I want it to I don't want that
on and if I go to try to move the group
here I'm able to move everything at once
now just remember to turn off your Auto
Select if you want that to work out so
that's how that works I personally use
the hotkey control to just select things
that I need to it's not much of a like a
hassle to hit control because it's
something that we always use when you
use these kind of programs now there is
a hotkey that you can use to create new
groups quickly and that is ctrl G and
that will create a new group for you and
as you can see ahead the other group
already selected and it put the group I
had selected into the group that I just
created using the hotkey so this is the
main group here and then underneath that
we have another group and that's one of
the things that school photoshop is that
you can nest folders within other
folders so that is helpful to organize
your folders that you have in there what
you will be doing at some point if you
work on large projects so if you want to
quickly add some more stuff to your
group you can also select the layers
here then come up here to your layer
options and new group from layers and
then make your group
Oobi and I can add a color to it if I
want let's do blue and press ok
and then now everything is grouped
together like that so that's how you use
groups um use them to organize use them
for if you need to pass on your project
as someone else and now that person
that's working on your project knows
what the hell is going on because
everything is organized nicely in your
layer sack I guess I better show you
the way to ungroup some of your layers
if you just open up your group and it
has some of the layers in it you can
just click on it and drag it out of the
layers panel let's drag it we're gonna
we're gonna have to drag this somewhere
there we go and now it is completely out
of that group and no longer in it so you
just drag them out of the folder into
the layers panel somewhere so thanks for
watching this tutorial and hopefully you
guys learned some new selection
techniques when you're selecting layers
so thanks a lot have a good day
everybody
and see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
