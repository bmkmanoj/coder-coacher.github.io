duel in a quad core option and the max i
believe is 3.33 and this is a very high
in very stable get hurt so um it's super
fast again that's the core tues and
beside from their high and gigahertz
feed they have crazy high amounts of
cash and this is pretty much the best
processor you can get for your dollar
right now so again the core two
processors is the processor i would
highly recommend it's why I built every
computer with its the best processor you
can get for your dollar and that's it
just go out and buy some now if you have
tons of money to blow and you want the
best processor that is out there
possibly then you need to get the i7
processor this is the latest in the
greatest from Intel all I've 7s have
four cores in eight processing threads
which makes the i7 is the most beastly
beast on the market not even intel or
AMD this is the best processor you can
get for a personal computer right now
however there are like over a thousand
dollars so unless you have that kind of
money then I wouldn't even worry about
getting an i7 but just in case you
wanted to know some of the specs on it
they have eight megabytes of cash which
is extremely high and 2.9 three
gigahertz can pretty much handle
anything you throw at it and if you get
a I seven pretty much this processor is
going to be waiting for all your other
components or your internet or whatever
downloads to catch up with it so the i7
is a top of the line but i would
recommend again the core two processors
the best processor you can get for your
dollar so that is my overview for the
intel processors if you want to see a
visual review of this i'm going to put a
link in my description box and again
that's the new boston calm make sure to
go there
register so thank you guys for watching
I hope you guys learned something and I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
