youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and this tutorial we'll be
talking about constructors now sometimes
when you have a class and you want to
add what's called a constructor and what
this does is it initializes values for
that class so let's say we want to make
a new person I want to individually set
their weight money income and name by
what we want it to be and not just by
using the default so we can how we can
do this is to use a constructor now even
though these variables are private we
can still access them using a
constructor so to create one we're just
going to type sub new and now what I
need to do is we need to buy Val wait
money income and name so wait as double
or let's just do W as double by Val M as
double now mnw aren't very good to use
for names to be passed to our
constructor because if someone is trying
to create a new person and they look at
the arguments for the constructor and
they see what is W and what is M they're
not going to know what that is I'm just
going to use these in the tutorial so I
as double and by Val n as string okay so
now we're going to do is going to set
each one of these variables so weight
equals W money equals M income equals I
and name equals n so whenever a new
person object is created it's going to
be required for them to use to pass
these different data types to the
constructor now what you can also do is
use optional which we learned about
using in functions and this can also be
used with constructors so we'll come
back to form or not VB
and you can see that we get an error for
my default person so for the argument
for the constructor we're just going to
add two parentheses now inside of this
we'll need the weight so let's just go
ahead and set this to let's say the
person is going to be 150 pounds their
money will give them five hundred
dollars their income will pay them $20
an hour
and the name to default person okay so
now we've created this person and we've
set all that the values that are needed
for the person to work so now let's come
down here and we will add the person so
let's just use some default values for
the person in this so we'll just use
eight pounds 100 money $7.25 an hour and
then P name for the name for person name
so we created a new person and just use
the constructor to make the necessary
changes to the variables that are in
there so we'll go ahead and run this and
see what happens it should work just the
same as it did before so we'll click new
person and we will click I mean we won't
click I'll just type in Sam go ahead and
click OK you see we get the current
weighs eight money income instead of 725
we can work and make money we can
exercise and lose weight we can eat to
gain weight we can increase the income
so everything is working perfectly fine
so let's go in here and change some of
these values so you can see what changes
are made so let's have the person be
born at 150 pounds and we will give them
nine hundred ninety nine dollars and
we'll pay them five hundred dollars an
hour so we'll go ahead and run this and
if we click new person we'll just leave
it at John Doe and then click OK and see
John Doe weighs 150 pounds he has nine
hundred ninety nine dollars and he makes
five hundred dollars an hour and we can
just keep working this guy until he gets
a whole bunch of money
and we can exercise to lose some weight
so that is a way to initialize values
for objects whenever and that is
creating and it will force the person to
do that so that they will not forget it
and later on we're going to be talking
about overloading constructors and
default constructors so what I challenge
you guys to do is take this person
program and let the user enter the
weight the money and the income whenever
they create a new person and have it
passed to this add person so that it
will put the right values in there that
that the person specified when they
click new person and if you do make that
go ahead and leave that in a video
response so I can see you guys are
learning from these tutorials and thanks
for watching and stay tuned for the next
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
