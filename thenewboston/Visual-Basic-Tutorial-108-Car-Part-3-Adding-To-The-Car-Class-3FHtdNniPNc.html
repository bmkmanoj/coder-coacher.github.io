youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
new Boston and in this tutorial we're in
continue working on the car program now
you can see here that I've organized our
code and commented it so that we can see
what each part of it does now you can
minimize them and maximize them by using
these buttons right here and you if you
remember from the last tutorial we have
named color and show info and then I
just organized the button click events
into one little group right here and
then here's our form one load now let's
go ahead and add some stuff to our car
class that's gonna be inherited by other
classes but first let's get rid of some
of this a white space here okay so now
let's come down below overwrite to
straight and we're gonna create
something that will set and get the
number of doors now this is gonna be a
property called number of doors so we'll
create a variable here that's going to
store that so we'll make it private
because we're gonna use the property to
indirectly access the value and we'll be
able to set the value so number of doors
as integer so now that we have our
number of doors value there let's just
go ahead and add a comment that says
tells us what we're going to be doing so
number of doors property so gifts and
sets number of doors so now we're going
to do is declare our property so a
public property and we'll just call it
number of doors so number of doors as
integer and when we press enter let's
see yes this is not case-sensitive so
let's go ahead and call it property
number of doors
just to make it a little bit easier to
read let's leave this one to number of
doors as I just want to int I'm in
number of doors so that we know which
data type it is so now we have our
number of doors property and we will
let's do this we will add our get and
our set
so what I'd get I think an see that adds
and get and the set for us and the end
of the property so what do we want to
get we want to get the number of doors
so we'll return int number of doors now
we have our our set function or our set
method so if you know cars can only have
or at least like normal cars that you
see driving around there have either two
doors all the way up to five doors so
let's just add an if statement to keep
out any other values from to keep out
any other values besides two to five so
if and now the value passed a set that
will set the number of doors is called
value so if value is greater than or
equal to 2 and if value is greater than
or equal to 5 so or less than or equal
to 5 then what do we want to do we want
to set the number of doors to that value
so int number of doors equals value okay
so now that we have created this you can
see that if the value is anything else
it's not going to set it so let's just
tell the user that it has not been set
if any other value has been entered so
we'll just type else and we will type
message box dot show and we will show we
will say the number of doors you have
entered is not valid
okay so now that we've created this
property right here if number of doors
let's go ahead and come back over to our
form one bbcode and we'll add a another
button so we'll go ahead guy this button
on here we will set the text to doors
and we'll go ahead and set the name to
button set doors and we'll double click
on that to open up at the click event
and we'll just get rid of that white
space right there so it's group with our
button clicked event so let's go ahead
and look and see what we did up here
well you can see that we used an input
box so we will type default car dot and
let's access the property number of
doors you can see that it has the finger
and the little piece of paper because it
is a property instead of a an actual
variable like car name so default card
number of doors equals and what we're
gonna need to do is convert what they
type in to an integer so we'll just type
C type and now I need to do is type
input box please enter the number of
doors okay so when you call input box
it's going to return a string value T to
you or to the caller so basically what
we're putting right here for the first
argument is the string that is returned
by input box so we're going to be
converting a string to a type integer
okay
so now it will set the number of doors
and basically when you call default car
number of doors and use the equals sign
it's going to call the set method it's
going to use this right here as the
value that it uses for that so let's go
ahead and run this
but first let's go up here and we need
to change the two string so let's get
rid of this message box right here and
we'll come back here to all cars and for
our override two string let's go ahead
and show the number of doors so we'll do
that just before the car speed so we'll
type number of doors and then we will
add default or we'll add number of doors
and then we'll just add a new line and
then we'll add another am time okay so
now when we call to string it will give
us all of this stuff back so we'll go
ahead and set the name of it - or let's
do a challenger and we'll go ahead and
click OK
we'll set the color to black and we'll
set the number of doors to four so when
we show info we get Challenger srt8
black and number of doors is equal to
four now if we set the number of doors
to something like seven and click OK we
get a message box that says the number
of doors you have entered is not valid
so we'll go ahead and try that again
we'll do four doors right there and
click show info and we get all the info
about our car so if you haven't typed
this code in I highly suggest you do
that because you will learn a lot from
typing it in yourself and making changes
to it and then once you've done that go
ahead and move on to the next tutorial
