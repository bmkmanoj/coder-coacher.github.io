to your eighth walkthrough for
Assassin's Creed 2 and this is for the
memory - and sequence for occult Fox on
now in this sequence or memory we have
to locate someone called the Fox and
what you want to do is use your eagle
vision and a couple tips well first of
all you can first of all before I even
say that you need to make sure you're
not notorious at all so tear down
posters or do whatever you need to do
now a second thing stay away from guards
and people with crates because they're
going to draw attention to you so the
first thing you do is locate this guy
and it takes your money and make sure
that you start running after right away
and tag them would be if you let them
get a head start or Dom sentry message
if you'd let him get a head start or let
them get ahead of you at all you're
gonna be chasing them forever so that's
why you need to start to some right way
so there's the box right there and
whistles but you may call me la Volpe at
your service mr. ratio
do you know my name it is my business to
know everything in this city isn't that
why you're here
indeed I need to find someone know where
he'll be before even he does who bunch
Escada Patsy there's word on the street
of a caravan just arrived from Roma
a secret meeting at sunset tonight you
can learn something a Francesco's
whereabouts there do you know where it
is to be held yeah let me know when you
are ready
so there's your mission all you have to
remember is don't be a notorious avoid
guards and also people with crates and
if you want to know where your next
mission was just hop down this ledge and
it's right there so thank you for
watching don't forget subscribe and I
will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
