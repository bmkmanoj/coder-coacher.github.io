intermediate Java tutorial and in this
story we're going to be learning how to
put actual Java programs called applets
on the web so I'm going to be putting
mine on the new boston comm just because
it's a little site for me to test on so
the first thing the very first thing
that you want to do is if you're using
eclipse and I assume you are instead of
just coding it right in here what we
need to do is we actually need to get
the class file for this so go ahead and
run it one time and that's going to save
it to a class file and then go ahead in
your computer and in your search box go
ahead and search for this class or if
you know where it is you can just
navigate to it but what I always do is I
put search Bucky
dot class and this is going to give me a
bunch of different classes and I know
that mine is in applet right here so you
usually want to same it name it
something unique so you don't have the
same problem but for me I like the
confusion so let's copy this and I'm
going to go ahead and paste this to my
desktop just because I like to have
everything on my desktop so now I know
you guys can't see it but I have a
little icon called Bucky class right on
my desktop and that is where my class
file is so from now what we need to do
is since we're putting it on the website
itself we want to go ahead and make a
HTML file so go ahead and open and I'm
assuming if you are if your guys are
learning about applets you obviously
know how to make HTML file so I'm not
going to be going over that so anyways
go ahead and open notepad plus plus or
notepad whatever you use to make HTML
files and then go ahead and play your
HTML tags in here beginning and and go
ahead and put your body tags in there as
well body body and then the tag that you
use specifically for applet is yep you
guess it applet right like that and this
actually has an ending tag and nothing
is going to go in it
and the only thing that you need to do
is you need to add a couple attributes
in the opening tag of course the opening
tag so first thing you need to do is
write code and set this equal to the
class that you're going to be using
which is pretty much a program and I'm
going to set mine equal to Bucky class
and the only two other attributes you
need is the width and the height so I'm
going to set my width equal to and this
is how big your applets going to be I'm
going to set equal to like 400 or
something and I'm going to set my height
equal to 100 that sounds about good so
go ahead and save this and save it is
I'm going to save it as index.html and
I'm going to save it right to my desktop
as well and copy that and paste it again
to get my color is good and now let me
just check everything one last time and
another thing you want to take note of
make sure that you never put the when
you're doing the height than width
never put it more than 1024 wide and 768
tall because on your computer monitor
and computer screen that would be bigger
than the average computer screen so you
probably don't want to do that unless
you're like writing a really specific
applet for just a few people but anyways
that's just your general tip so now what
we have on my desktop is an index for my
homepage and a class file so what do we
do from here why I already have a
website set up at a let me minimize
Firefox so you guys can see right there
right there and wow that's a smallest I
ever had Firefox in my life so I have my
website set up at hostmonster calm and
let me go ahead and log in domain the
new boston.com my password I'm not going
to tell you guys that because I don't
trust you guys and let's go ahead and
it'll log in and go to your FTP or
having find mine this window is very
small right now
alright i maximising this there we go
unlimited to FTP and then go ahead and
click first of all we want to allow
pop-ups so option allow pop-ups and then
go ahead and click unlimited FTP to get
your FTP account I probably should have
had this uh my screen recorder set up
differently but well you guys can see
now go to your desktop and this is your
computer right here and this is the
server so we want to move the files from
your desktop to the server so everything
that you want to put on a website is
going to go in public HTML this these
are files that the public can see so
first of all we want to drag this Java
program over called Bucky class so just
drag and drop that's one thing I like
about hostmonster it's not command line
at all it's all visual so now we got the
Java program right in my public HTML
folder so now we need an actual website
to get to the program so that's why we
created that index.html so drag and drop
that over here and now you can see we
got index.html and we got Bucky class
and there we go right there it wasn't
messing up but it's good now so now we
can see and you you usually want to put
your class file which is your program in
the same directory as the website that
calls the applet so now let's go to the
New Boston comm and see if it worked
and there we go our applet pops up right
on the index the home page and it says
wow this actually worked and I don't
know if you guys can see it but there's
a little square right here that's 100 by
400 or whatever I named it so that's the
basics of how to take an applet or a
Java program and now instead of having
to put it on a CD and send it to all my
friends I'm just say hey guys just go to
this website in anyone who looks at this
website can see my applet so that's the
beauty of that and that's how you can
share Java programs with the rest of the
world so that's enough for this
tutorials I don't show your guys's minds
to blow up so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe
see you guys next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
