packages I need in this demonstration
copied so if you pause the video you can
go ahead and copy all those down or if
you want you can just wait to the end
and all the source code from these
tutorials I'm going to be putting in my
forum so if you just want to hop over
there in the Android section you can
just copy it and paste it whatever and
let me adjust here so the first object
that I'm going to create and you guys
are going to be really familiar with
this is a sprite batch object now sprite
batch works behind the scenes to make
drunk things and displaying things on
the screen really quick and efficient
and you guys are going to see exactly
how we use that in just a second and
since this is a tutorial for just
displaying simple text the text that
we're going to be using is actually
bitmap font this is just pretty much the
font and I'll just name that font so now
in crate remember I told you guys that
crate is the method where you pretty
much set everything up so for the batch
object we're just going to set this
equal to new sprite batch and doesn't
take any parameters and for the font
object which is actually the object that
we're going to be displaying on the
screen just set this equal to new bitmap
font and right now we didn't add any
parameters this is essentially equal to
a blank font object it doesn't have any
text that doesn't have any colors and
anything like that now by default the
parameters on your font I believe our 15
pixel and Arial now on pretty much any
device nowadays like um especially the
newer phones with super high resolution
15 pixels is really really small
I mean if it's like 1080 then what's 15
pixels it's like a little dot on the
screen so I'll show you guys how to kind
of scale your font up in just a bit
but now that we have the object the
first thing I actually want to do is
change the color of it just to keep
things interesting
so it's called set color and if we just
go color pick your favorite color so now
we have
font and for the size of it we can
actually call scale and we can just grow
it by 5 times so we need myself a little
bit more space so now we're working with
big blue fonts pretty sweet and we just
have the parameter set but we didn't
actually display on the screen yet now
before I do that I actually want to
include this method disposed now get rid
of all this now as you can see it's the
override method and this is another
method that gets called automatically
and it's from of course application
adapter so this one gets called whenever
we first start the app this one gets
called over and over pretty much as our
game is running now dispose it gets
called at the end of your lifecycle so
when this class when pretty much your
device is done using everything in this
class and the reason that we want to
call this is because this is where we
get rid of all our resources free them
up in other words dispose of them and if
you guys are like this is the boring
stuff memory management I'll skip over
this do not because if you don't dispose
of free resources and don't free them up
you're going to have really really bad
memory leaks on your phone and stuff is
going to start to happen real slow and
it's going to suck probably going to
need to restart your phone and cars are
going to start crashing in and meteors
are going to start raining down from the
sky do not skip over this methods very
important so the first thing is batch
I'm going to dispose of that and also
font dispose of that so now that we got
all the memory management freed up our
resources when we don't need them
because hey we're not greedy now in the
render is where we actually display on
the screen so I don't know that's kind
of what the whole purpose of it is now
before we display anything on the screen
you're always going to have two lines of
code in here and this is kind of a weird
but this is just how you do it we pretty
much need to wipe the screen clear
everything out so we're working with
blank canvas now if you call GD x GL dot
GL clear color what this is first is you
need to give a color to clear with so
just think of this is you're making a
paintbrush and you're going to wipe
paint your entire canvas a certain color
before you start adding game elements to
it now the parameters that takes our RGB
a which mean the first three are your
red green and blue and your last one is
your alpha your transparency
now if I just go 1 1 1 1 that means bump
up every value in other words it's white
now the reason that the last example was
red is because they went 1 0 0 which
really much means all red in nothing out
so if you I don't know if you just saw
following along this tutorial and you
want to print it out as red do that but
1 1 1 says we now have a white
paintbrush so now what we want to do is
we want to call GD XG l dot GL clear and
in here we want to call GL this is kind
of weird-looking but these are just the
built-in parameters that they gave us
and GL xx GL color buffer bit so again
all this says is we want to clear the
screen with this color in other words we
want to clear it with a white paintbrush
so if you just ran this right now we
would have a blank white screen however
we don't want that we actually want to
draw the font on the screen so in order
to draw what you first need to do is you
first need to begin your badge object
because remember I said that this
essentially speeds the drawing crosses
up so we want to say batch dot begin and
inside begin and from the time it ends
so make these two that's where you want
to do all of your drawing in now the
only thing that we have to display on
the screen and this tutorial is the
so we're going to take that font and
we're going to draw now whenever we
drought we actually need to pass batch
in and remember up here we just set a
bunch of parameters pretty much we're
choosing our font just like you would in
like Microsoft Word or something we
didn't give it any text yet in other
words we didn't say what text we want to
appear on the screen so I'm just going
to type like hello I hate hello world I
think it's stupid so say hello baby
don't say maybe explanation mark and so
now we have text setup ready to go but
we have to add two more values in that's
where do we want it to appear on the
screen now of course these are just the
x and y values one hundred four hundred
and another thing I want to point out is
whenever you're working with coordinates
in this framework zero zero is the
bottom of left I know in a lot of other
programming languages and a lot of other
frameworks it's the top left but
remember in this it's the bottom left so
this x and y-coordinates it's going to
appear somewhere in the bottom left so
now let me show you guys one cool last
thing now whenever I'm making a game
this emulator of course as you guys know
I don't have to say this it's incredibly
slow and annoying to work with it as
well
so what I'm going to do is this I'm
going to click this Android and if I
click this fun right here this is the
screen recorder for my phone so I have a
phone that's actually plugged in my
computer at the vise it's actually the
phone that I carry around and use every
day now I'm going to hit start recording
and whenever I do that it's going to
start recording the screen on my phone
pretty stinking awesome
so kick off the program make sure that
it's running in your phone and build
this baby build it up what will what yes
I want to run on my phone and I'll wait
to verify that it is running I'm looking
at my phone right now all right
so I'm looking at my phone just popped
up now do I want to record my phone
yes I do so now it should be recording
and again like I said I'll just take
this and I'll pop it into my videos but
as you can see 100 over 400 up again the
coordinates are in the bottom left and
yeah it's looking good so far so let me
just stop that recording and by the way
this is just how you save everything so
yeah that looks good
and I just hit OK so anyways that is how
you make simple text that appears on
your phone and again right now we just
have some text boring but eventually
we're going to be drawing some cool
stuff like enemies main characters it's
going to be sweet so yeah thanks for
watching now let's see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
