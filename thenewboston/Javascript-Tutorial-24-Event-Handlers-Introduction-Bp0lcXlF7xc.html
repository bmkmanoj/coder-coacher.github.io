JavaScript tutorial and this tutorial is
on something called event handlers see I
got something in my youtube inbox
from some person named alt Q 2001 and it
says dude you need to do one on buttons
and interactive effects so alright Oh Q
2001
here is your territorial or at least one
of the many I'm gonna be making on
interactive effects and buttons like I
said if you guys want to see tutorial
just let me know and I'll make it for
you now get your notepad open and I know
it's been a long time since we made a
JavaScript tutorial but make a basic
HTML document with just a body now as
you can see we don't have the basic
script tags that we used to do and this
is not a mistake I'm doing this for a
reason whenever you or I'm not gonna say
all the time but in the beginning when
we're working with it event handler this
is one of their rare situations where
you can actually code JavaScript without
putting it directly inside script tags
now instead of just talking let me
actually show you guys what I mean go
ahead in inside your body and make sure
it's inside your body and not your head
go ahead and make a simple form now you
can make event handlers and rollovers
and a lot of different things but for
this use we're just gonna be putting in
a basic form in case I didn't describe
or you guys don't know what event
handler is yet it's pretty much all the
interactive stuff a JavaScript say once
you click a box or a link or something
then a message pops up or if you want to
scroll over some it changes to a
different picture that's what we're
gonna be making today so anyways back to
this go ahead and create your basic form
make your opening tag
your closing tag and inside your form
you're gonna want to put a basic input
and to do that just type input and if
you don't know what any of this is make
sure you watch my XHTML tutorials and
I'll explain it right in there now
there's many different things you can
put inside a form
oops I put oh that's very actually and
there's many different things as I've
seen you can put inside a form right now
I'm gonna be putting a basic input
button so do that type type and type
button and this will give you a basic
button on your form now right now let me
just go ahead and close this and show
you guys what it is I open up in Firefox
this is my button right here you can
click it and now what happens as you can
see so it's pretty boring right now but
now we want to encode javascript in this
to make something actually happen make
this our button start coming to life so
to do this we need to embed some
JavaScript code and to do that you can
add other attribute to your input box
and this is the on click attribute now
this isn't a variable or anything else
this is actually built in JavaScript
code that we're using what this says is
on click whenever you click this item
which is in this case the button we want
you to do something now the computer
saying all right what do you want me to
do well we're gonna tell you to do this
go ahead and put an equal sign quotation
marks I got in trouble for that too I
kept calling them parentheses in my last
tutorials and if I comprehend this I
pretty much just call everything
parentheses no matter what it is so just
bear with me if I accidentally call
parentheses but in these quotation marks
type in window alert and if you watched
my last JavaScript asuras you know this
is pretty much as a basic alert box and
what exactly do we want to our
let's hurt a now brown cow I move this
box over so you can see and add one of
those babies and remember to add your
your single quotation marks and I'll
tell you why later and of course once
you're done alerting will everyone alert
and with another parenthesis and got it
right at that time and then and with
your semicolon and quotation marks and
what this does is whenever you click the
button you telling JavaScript to alert
hey now brown cow now a couple things on
one point out before I actually show you
guys what this does because I know you
guys are dying to see it um one thing is
the rules of quotes apply as you can see
you have double quotes right here and
right here
now usually going to working on
JavaScript you would make any string of
text and double quotes but sense is
embedded in the double quote you have to
make them single quotes so JavaScript
doesn't think that this is quote and
this is quote right here so just to make
sure you don't confuse it just make sure
you're obeying your rules of quotes and
another thing I want to point out that
if you wanted to you could embed more
JavaScript after a semicolon
so you have this JavaScript right here
and the semicolon and you can embed some
JavaScript right there just because it's
on one line doesn't mean you're only
allowed one line of JavaScript remember
that a semicolon means move to the next
slide
so actually if you wanted to put a whole
nother statement right here but hey now
brown cow and hey take it easy or
something else you could do it right
there so now you guys have made your
first interactive button now let's see
if this works like I'm hoping it does go
ahead and save it and actually since
it's already open just go ahead and
refresh it
now when we click the button we get this
beautiful little pop-up that says hey
now brown cow
just click OK and your form will
continue running to the rest of it so
that's your first tutorial and vent
handlers and as you can see we are now
finally using Java Script to begin
interacting with the computer instead of
just having to tell us what to do or
retail it will do and this is gonna be
the first of many interactive tutorials
in right now we get to see the true
power of JavaScript so pay attention
study this tutorial make sure you learn
the basics of event handlers and in my
next tutorial we'll be discussing this a
little bit more so I hope you enjoyed I
hope you learned something and remember
