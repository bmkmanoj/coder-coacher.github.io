want to do is I want to give you guys a
very and I emphasize a very basic
overview of a packet in the different
parts that it's broken into and well
just exactly what it is
so from this example go ahead and open
that file that you downloaded in the
first video so HTTP and boom there you
go
so select packet number 4 and we can see
already that this is a get request now
I'm guessing that you guys are already a
little bit familiar with get request
basically whenever you want a webpage
from you know some server like Facebook
or something then you're going to send
that server or get request and that
server hopefully if everything works
correctly it's going to send you back
some HTML file and it doesn't have to be
a HTML file it could be like a picture
whatever so we're just going to get
something from a server now whenever
you're trying to look at a packet to be
honest the way I think about it is it's
really easy to understand if you think
of it just like a package like you're
sending someone with a package in the
mail so whenever you send them a package
then what you do is you know you just
don't send my empty box you need the
address on it and you put your return
address in you know you put some stuff
inside the package unless you do want to
send my empty box for some reason but
that's basically how packets work with
computers as well whenever you look at a
packet what it basically is is it's a
package of information that you're going
to send to another computer so this
packet right here is just a package that
we're sending to some other server and
inside the package is pretty much saying
hey give me a file so we're going to
start at the bottom right here and let
me minimize this and maximize that and
spread it all out art so it all starts
with HTTP and this is pretty much the
protocol saying this is the type of data
that you're going to be sending and this
is how it's going to be formatted so
whenever the server gets this and sees
that it's HTTP that usually means ok so
they're looking for some web file maybe
a picture maybe um you know just html5
whatever now there are rules that
whenever we send an HTTP packet that it
needs to be formatted in a specific kind
of way so the server is going to look
through things like request URI request
method and it basically like I said
these are the rules of how the data is
formatted and what type of data it is
now we also need to include basic TCP
information now TCP this is the protocol
and again like I said this is a really
basic overview but these are the rules
on how we are going to connect to that
server now inside here there are some
real basic information like the port's
that we're going to be using and we're
going to be taking a closer look at TCP
specifically the handshake or the
process of exactly how they're connected
in probably the next tutorial but just
remember this is what type of data it is
and how its formatted and these are the
rules in on how we're going to be
connected now we're also going to
include ipv4 since we're using version
for IP addresses and this is the
destination and return address
information so we'll see ok what is the
IP address of the server we want to
connect to and whenever it sends
information back we need to give them
their IP so it can actually send it to
the you know our back to our computer
now this Ethernet section right here
whenever your message is all packaged up
and ready to be sent you just don't send
it directly to that server because you
know you don't have a big Ethernet cable
connected a Facebook server so you need
to send it to your router and then your
router sends it to I don't know maybe
another router and then through internet
magic and a finish it eventually gets
there so whenever you send it to your
router you need your routers MAC address
now whenever it goes to Facebook and
comes back it's going to go through your
router so that way whenever the data
gets to your router if a bunch of
different computers are connected to it
then your computer's like a over here
that that's for me so basically this is
the information to connect your computer
to
to your router and it uses Mac
addressing and frames this is basically
the point where the software becomes
real because this software that's on our
computer right now you can't touch it
you can't hold it in your hand it's just
you know a program however what is
eventually going to happen is the
software all these ones and zeros that
somehow magically become a picture they
need to be converted into either you
know like a if you're transferring it
over Ethernet a bit of electricity if
you're transferring it over fiber optics
then little pulses of light if you're
using Wi-Fi then it's going to convert
it into radio waves
now these frames in this framing
information is it includes a bunch of
hardware information like the MAC header
in the trailer and it also includes
Ethernet info but basically this helps
software become um real so data that can
actually be transmitted now we can
actually see that data so for example if
we see this see this is bytes on a wire
so whenever we transfer over a wire in
the ethernet cable what's going to
happen is it's going to send a pulse of
electricity every time you see one and
it's going to hold off or not send one
whenever you see a 0 so
boo-boo-boo-boo-boo kind of like a weird
Morse code so again fiber optics you
would use light Wi-Fi these would be
radio waves and Wi-Fi protocol is you
know a whole different beast that's
complex but that's the like I said real
basic overview of how you how you pretty
much look up memes on the Internet this
is what's happening behind the scenes
now the cool thing is once this gets the
destination and once all these
electrical signals get to like a server
um I don't know like Instagram server
then the first thing that's going to do
is it's going to be accepting all these
electronic signals and then it's going
to go through and says oh we got some
data and then it's going to go backwards
even more oh we got some HTTP data
oh they're requested this file and this
is how I'm supposed to send it back so
that's what we're going to do and we're
going to package it up in this kind of
way and whenever the server gets that
package it's going to unwrap it bit by
bit and eventually see the message
inside and the message says hey yo I
want this think meme send it back so
like I said it's a very basic overview
of what happened so hopefully you guys
understand these sections a little bit
more clearly and uh you know a lot more
to cover but there you go thank s for
watching next video TCP handshakes going
to be awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
