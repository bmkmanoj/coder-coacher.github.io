and I'm back with another video for the
new Boston now in the previous video we
looked at sending email using PHP mail
function if you haven't already watched
that video I recommend you go back and
watch it before you watch this
as this video is going to deal with
submitting a contact form so for example
you've seen websites where you have a
Contact Us page and you fill in your
information and you click the submit
button
now this then sends where I could do
them it could be storing values in a
database but for now we're going to be
dealing with sending an email address
sending the message to a specific email
address and that's how we're going to
receive it so the first thing we're
going to do is we're going to create our
form so let's go ahead and say form
action equals something and method
equals something and then we end with
form so the form action is going to be
index.php so we're going to be
submitting back to the same page and
this is going to submit it in post data
so we're going to submit a large amount
of data that we don't want to be shown
in the URL bar so we use the post method
to send the data in our form so let's go
ahead and set up the form before we
start processing our script or inside
PHP so the first field I'm going to
create is a name and oh sorry and I'm
going to break down after this and I'm
going to say input type its text because
we're taking the text value for the name
and the name of this is a contact name
okay now we're going to break down a
couple of times and we're going to say
email address
and we're going to break and we're going
to set input type equals text again name
equals contact email I'm not going to
specify things like telephone field this
is up to you to an input for yourself
but the next thing I'm going to do is
message so this is we're just going to
be passing three fields through PHP
they're going to be sent to our email
address so now message we're going to
put a text area so a text area is just a
large text area that can be typed in the
text area I'm going to give this a name
of contact text and we're going to set
the rows equal to something and the
calls or something that's other columns
so we've got six here and say 30 a that
should give us a large enough space to
submit our data so we're going to go on
the presumption that all of our fields
are required by this contact form so
obviously you can chop and change and
within PHP we can make the relevant
checks but for now I'm going to do a
couple of breaks down and I'm going to
create our submit button so it's a type
submit and the value is going to be send
so let's go ahead and save this page and
we can preview this in our in our
browser so I'm going to refresh the page
so you can see we've got a pretty
standard looking and looking contact
form now it's obviously up to you to
change the design of this you can
obviously implement CSS if you know how
pop this into your own design so for now
I'm just starting with the most basic
basic layout so we can type information
into here and what we want to do is we
want to we want to enter a different
email addresses and our messages and
we're going to test out well we're going
to fill in all fields first of all this
is what we need to make sure will happen
so let's go over to back to our file and
edit this ok so inside PHP when this is
submitted the first thing that we want
to do is we want to check to see if the
form has been submitted so we need to
check that each element is set so we use
the is set construct and we set is set
that underscore post because remember
we're submitting these variables using
the post variable so we post method so
we pick them up by dollar underscore
post and then inside here we need to
specify the first variable that we're
passing and this is contact name then we
need to say and so we apply the and
operator so we're saying if the contact
name is set and dollar underscore I'm
sorry and is set dollar underscore post
and we need to now specify the next
field that we are submitting that's
contact email at just a word of warning
before I continue we're not actually
going to be dealing with email
validation and the reason for this is
it's a lot too too big and too
unnecessary for this tutorial so there
will be another tutorial in my tutorials
for the new Boston that will deal with
email validation so go over and have a
look at that and you'll be able to apply
this to your your contact form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
