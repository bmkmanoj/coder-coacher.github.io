Blackford here with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial today I'm going to
go over different animation presets
called behaviors and these behaviors
have a couple of different things within
them that are pretty sweet-looking and
they use like a combination of effects
and expressions to animate your lair
without using keyframes which is pretty
sweet so I'm gonna get into those and
show you a few of those and how they
work and everything like that so right
now I just made some text and it has
nothing done to it it's just text on a
background so if we come into our
effects &amp;amp; presets section over here and
under animation presets if we twirl that
open and then twirl down presets just
regular presets the second one down is
called behaviors if we twirl that down
we've got all of our different behaviors
here now we've got Wiggles with that we
won't have to use the wiggler if we use
those we've got opacity and we got some
fade ins and some drifts and stuff like
that so one of the first ones I'll just
show you is this fade in fade out frames
you've got milliseconds and frames so it
depends on what you're using and your in
your timeline but most of the time when
you use or when you're working on like
commercials or movies anything like that
you're gonna use frames at least in the
United States so let's use that one so
I'm gonna click and drag it onto my text
and all we've got here is just a simple
fade in and then at the end it should
fade out yep so it's supposed to fade
out it doesn't fade out all the way for
some reason but I mean we can we can
change that by changing this source
opacity the source opacity over here is
red that means it's linked by an
expression somewhere so if we twirl down
and we press you--you we can get
everything that's moved
right here and we can check out this
expression now this expression is
actually longer than this just one line
if I go down here it's a pretty decently
big expression and I would have to go
into this and look at it a little bit
more to figure out what it's actually
doing because it's got a whole bunch of
stuff so pretty much this uses the
expression expression to determine how
many frames that this is gonna take to
fade in or out so these two go
hand-in-hand
you can edit some of these some of these
some of these properties and think of
the word that seems to happen to me some
once in a while these tutorials every
like five tutorials I can't think of the
word that I want to think of but so I
can make the duration of the of the fade
in longer so I can do like fifty and
maybe I'll do fifty here so it takes a
longer time for it to actually fade in
actually fifty frames instead of fifty
fifteen frames it's all depends on what
you want so that's how something like
that works so that's one behavior you
can put more than one behavior on top of
another so each one of these presets can
be like layered on top of each other so
if I want to go into wiggle and I'll do
a scale wiggle I'll bring that on top
and you can see that it's doing a scale
kind of wiggle and it's scaling from the
anchor point it's also got a transform
going on here and it's scaling the width
and the height separately let's see if
it actually is separate yep yep they are
separate so if I check uniform scale
it'll scale it together like that
so you can make the direction and all
that kind of stuff so you anything
that's not in red you can edit if you
try to edit something in the red or edit
the expression I'll probably break the
it'll probably break the expression and
won't work correctly so I mean you can
if you know how to use expressions a lot
which I haven't taught them yet then you
can go ahead and try to modify things
but for the most part now if you haven't
used them just don't just leave them
alone
so we've got these two if you hold ctrl
and press a you can select everything
and press delete to delete them out and
now it's back to normal
so we'll just throw on a couple of other
ones just for fun let's go scale bounce
layer markers now I think you got to put
some markers in on the layer here to do
this scale bounce oops what's uh let's
add a layer marker here so it's got a
layer and then where's that on here
again
sorry addmarker here it is so we've got
the letter marker there and then we can
add another one here the shortcut for
the lair marker is the star so which is
multiplied not that one that's on the
numpad there we go
so that's how that one works right where
you have a lair marker every time is
where it'll do this scale bounce so I
thought that was pretty cool that you
could put down lair markers and have an
effect that's has an expression linked
to that
so there's a another cool thing that you
can do so you guys can mess around with
the other behaviors on here
you got wiggler AMA I'll let you guys
figure out what that is because it
sounds crazy so I like guys find that
stuff out on your own just drag them on
and see what they do so thanks for
watching the tutorial now you know about
behaviors and what they are like so use
them to your advantage
see you guys later and I have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
