walk through I guess for assassin's
creed 2 and this is for a memory called
judge jury and executioner and this is
where you assassinated Berto or at least
attempt to so the first thing you have
to do is get to this checkpoint and it's
on a roof so I mean you can walk on the
ground to get to it then climb the roof
at the end but i'm just going to climb
the roof right now because it's a lot
more fun so if i can get off this thing
right here just run over and by the look
of my many maps it's not going to be
real easy to get there by rooftop so i
probably should've went on the ground
but you know it's a lot more exciting to
go on the rooftops so you see they don't
really have any good connections from
where I'm going but anyways I'm going to
go ahead and climb this and there's a
spot see this rope you can go ahead and
get to the other route from there you
probably want to do that if you're doing
the same thing I'm doing so just run
over here make a little hut and let's
see if you can see it from here nope so
what you're trying to do is get to the
little green arrow and that's kind of
pretty much well you might be able to
see it from where I am right
we get up here and there you go see
right there this is going to allow you
to look this gonna hurt yep that's going
to allow you to look at the crowd and
whenever you look down and by the way if
your lawn health now is a fabulous time
to heal you probably want to buy some
medicines from the doctors at least five
of them if you have a small pouch but
anyways go up here and get your
checkpoint and this is going to show you
a route that's taken by a lot of the
people pedestrians I guess so there's a
bird's eye right there he's talking to
you ah who is it who have crowned
yourself Lorenzo de Medici pinche payoff
so yeah he's gonna die non-elastic knees
and shins on cosa ever innocent how
convenient at least now we see how far
your reach extends which is to say no
we're at all it has proved the valuable
lesson I mean I send my allies yes your
allies depart see is that what this is
about be careful with your words
you might attract the wrong yeah
foreshadowing that's me with a blade to
your gut so now it says follow aberto
without being detected so now you have
to use the blend technique that you use
in the fitting in memory and it was
memory number one so go ahead and make
sure you're not detected by any guards
you can see the red dots on your screen
by blending with these people right here
and as long as you can get around the
corner then that's where you really want
to be you don't really want to rush into
the tower because you're just going to
get destroyed so what you want to do and
especially by those brutes you do not
want to mess with them with only five
health so around here you see a group of
what are their code quotations I guess I
well you don't know want to know what I
call them but I just call them you know
port Asians I guess so hyper them if you
have enough money and if not then go get
some money I highly suggested it and now
you can use the excuse me them to
distract these brutes right here because
trust me we did not want to fight these
guys so go ahead and target them press Y
to distract thinking Mike hey baby come
over it is Bruce come back oh ho you
like these moves right here yeah that's
what I'm talking about and you just walk
on right by him so now go ahead and use
your eagle vision and you can easily
target with berto and I psycho Julie my
name is a bit dull he's like you so go
ahead and yeah well you know what to do
um he doesn't put up much of a fight and
now he's gonna give this quick little
speech
so it's less then you would have done
the same to save the ones you love yes I
would and I have Bernie down the Dory on
that day I'm million EDH your daughter
turns on again look at that and anyways
um to get away the best way to get away
is you see this group boxes right here
and if i can get up it which evidently i
can't right now there it go play yeah
the best way to get up that is to go on
and go to the right you see the group of
red dots you don't want to run in any of
those so go in between them and you're
going to want to try to get out of this
yellow circle but the thing is you can't
just go ahead and jump down right now
because it'll kill you so go ahead and
drop down a little bit yeah there we go
just like that and now you probably want
to drop down from there too just because
you don't want to fail the mission right
now and now I mean you don't even have
any guards close to you I mean a little
drop is it going to hurt the main thing
if you need to take a little beating to
get away and bam mission complete so
that's pretty much it to the mission so
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
