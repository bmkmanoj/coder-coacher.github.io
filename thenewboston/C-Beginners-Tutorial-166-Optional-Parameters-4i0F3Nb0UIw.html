tutorial that I'm making for the new for
Austin and in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing you how to have optional
parameters so all you're gonna need for
this tutorial is a button and once you
have it on your form just go ahead and
double click on it alright so one way of
having optional parameters is just
overloading the method so for example we
had a method called
to show a message right here and we
wanted there to be two parameters one
will just be the message for the message
box and then the other one would be a
title for the message box and then in
here will this have a message box be
shown and it will make the message
inside that message box and be the
message we passed through here and then
the title will just be the title a
bastard here alright well if you wanted
to make it so that the user didn't have
to provide a title we could just
overload this method so we just copy it
and paste it right here delete this and
then delete this so now when we call
this method we can choose from which
message oops
show unless it so now we can choose
which one we want to do if we want to
provide a message or if we want to
provide both a message in a title but
something else that we can do is create
optional parameters so in order to do
that you're just going to want to set
this parameter equal to something so
we'll set it equal to an empty string
this way it'll make it optional since
it's default we set equal to something
so if you don't pass something through
here this will just be the default value
so if I just make this right here
default value so if we don't pass
something through here title will
represent default value and the title of
the message box will say default value
if we don't provide another one so let's
do show message right here pass through
I'll say message and then for the title
if I don't provide one they titled the
message box will just say default value
you have a default value up there but
now if we were to provide on the second
parameter for it
title then it'll say title now yep
now one thing you should know about
default parameters they must call them
after every other parameter and this
makes perfect sense because let's say we
were to set this make this be a default
parameter and then this not be a default
parameter well then the c-sharp compiler
wouldn't know what to do if you only
pass through one string right here let's
say we just passed through Adam it
wouldn't know if you're trying to only
represent this one and you're just
skipping over this one or if you're
trying to get to this one and you just
haven't provided another one for this
yet so make sure that your default
parameters or I mean your optional
parameters come after all your other
ones and you can have as many optional
parameters as you want so if we wanted
to have another one called int amount
this would be like the amount of message
boxes that will show so then we could
just say or I is less than amount then
show the message box that many times and
now this is optional right here and as
you can see just passing through Adam is
fine because these two parameters are
optional well this one is not so if we
wanted to provide an amount
we'd have to provide a title as well so
we do title to title right here and then
our mouth if we did like two then we
should get two message boxes one - yep
all right so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial on setting up optional
parameters so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
