think video and in this video I'm going
to be teaching you guys how to create
those individual screens so the first
thing that I said to do is we need to
make each screen or each state a
separate class so go ahead and click on
your package not that package this one
right here Java game right click new
class and name the first one which was a
first one menu ma nu Capital m and make
sure that you don't have the main method
in this one finish so this is the
beginning of our mini class now do the
exact same thing but with a play class
now so a right-click
package new class and play looking good
so now what I want to do is actually
start coding the menu class and I'll
talk you guys through which each part is
so of course our package that's what
package we're working with a Java game
and what we need to do is actually
import these two things from game Java
copy I could type them in but I'm way
too freakin lazy to do that so import
those two things from slick and now
actually I think what I'm going to do is
just go ahead and include each method
that I need to include in this class and
in the upcoming tutorials I'm going to
fill in and show you guys how to work
with each method but now I just want to
show you guys the very basics how to
create a very simple screen so whenever
you're creating a basic screen or basic
state what you need to do is you need to
have your class inherit from a built in
class called basic game state makes
sense right of course
so after this the only other thing that
we need to do is we need to build let me
think I think there's five different
methods the first one is the constructor
which public menu and this one takes
a state which is of course that number
which is going to be in this case zero
because that's what ID number we are
assigned menu so of course that's the
constructor and it's the first method
that we need to code whenever we decide
to code this the next one is a method
that's built into a slick 2d that just
helps slick initialize crap that it
means so public and once I start coding
this you guys you're going to have a
better idea of what's going on but
public void in it now in it takes okay
can't type today game container GC and
it also takes state based game object
and this is SVG or you actually can name
your object anything you want but you
know why not make it simple now just
like what was it oh and it states list
in the game class this one also throws a
slick exception so of course we might as
well just go ahead and cheat copy and
paste and there we go so now we have two
methods the constructor in this init
which basically initializes a bunch of
stuff that the class needs now after
this we get to the good you know pretty
much the good crab because right now
this is all housekeeping crap
constructors and initializing crap this
method right here public void render
this is the method that first takes
these two parameters a game container
and a state based game so we'll throw
those in there first
now this last um object that it takes is
actually a graphics object in that is
usually um has the variable G and that's
kind of like the industry standard so
don't name yours anything else because
whenever you get a job working for
someone drawing graphics and Java they
probably want you to name a G and this
also throws a slick exception so copy
this so why did I say that this is a
cool method well this is the method that
actually draws stuff on the screen
our main menu we wanted to I don't know
have a say
welcome to hand blaster well this is
where we're going to draw that text
maybe we wanted to you know draw a
picture of a ham blasting another ham
this is where we draw that render is
basically draw stuff on the screen and
our graphics object is basically like a
paintbrush where it draws everything
that we want - pretty sweet huh so now
we're getting in the good stuff okay I'm
kind of feeling it now this next method
is also cool public void update now
update takes three parameters game
container state based game copy-paste
that crap in there and the last one is
int Delta and I'll explain it to you
guys later on and this throws a slick
exception to however you know if you're
a cocky programmer and you just think
you never make errors you don't even
really need exceptions but we probably
do okay so I said that update is a cool
method - oh got the hiccups / burps i
hook up once then I burp Rowlands man I
amuse myself sometimes so anyways what
this method is going to be responsible
for doing is updating the images on the
screen why do we need to update them
well if we just have plain old images on
the screen then it wouldn't be very
exciting we need that crap to move
around crash into each other shapes
crashing into Pam's and and in order to
have animation on our game then the
images actually need to update which
causes them to change location which
causes them to move around giving it the
illusion of animation so that's how that
works
now this last method is actually a
boring one so you see how this was kind
of cool this is a little bit cooler this
was awesome and this was amazing now you
know I kind of built you guys up to
bring you back down because all this is
going to do is going to be a really
simple public int get ID doesn't even
take any parameters it's just going to
return the ID of this state and remember
menu is Z
zero return zero just like that so
basically to recap one last time
actually before we recap we need to do
something else so this is pretty much
the show of a screen the very basics of
how you can how you make a screen on
your game so of course this is for the
main menu go ahead and select all of
this copy this and also paste it into
your play class now of course we can't
just paste it and say see you'll save it
and leave it we need to change a couple
things first basically this is how you
create a screen for the play class but
you need to change the class name which
is of course play instead of menu
therefore we need to change the
constructor which is play instead of
menu and the last thing that we need to
change is the return value at the end
because remember menu was 0 but play was
1 so that's how you know our game is
going to know what one is menu and what
one is play so pretty cool that is the
core basics of how you create a screen
now to recap we can finally recap in
order to do that say we're working of
course whatever package we're working
with and for all the crap that we you
know downloaded now make sure you extend
from a basic game state which creates a
basic computer screen for your game now
a constructor in our init is going to be
where we're doing our housekeeping stuff
the render is going to be responsible
for drawing graphics the update is going
to be responsible for updating those or
moving them around and the get ID pretty
much returns the ID of that state now if
we hop back to our main master class
check it out oh no errors whatsoever so
we could go ahead and run this game and
it says ok hmm very exciting huh says
the frames per second and I you know not
a lot going on here so you know I don't
think I would get up right now and try
to sell this for millions of dollars we
probably need to change a couple more
things on it maybe add an image or
something but hey we have all the time
in the world to work on that we'll do
those in the next
toriel so anyways thank you guys so far
and yes so remember please don't forget
to add me on Twitter Google+ and I'll
see you on the forums see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
