welcome to another video and before I
actually start talking to you guys about
a four loop which is pretty much what I
wanted to teach in this video I want to
mention one thing and you guys probably
already noticed I included three other
files this C type string in math H and I
actually don't even need them in this
video because I'm just talking about
loop and they aren't included in any of
these but the reason that I included
them right now is because in the future
videos probably like the next dozen or
so I'm going to be showing you guys some
really cool functions that are built
into C and they're actually included in
these files right here so since I'm
going to be kind of concentrating in
this area right now where we're going to
be doing the majority of the programming
I just saw I want to tell you guys to
include them right now because then
later on when we need them where I teach
them they're going to be there so I
didn't want to forget them but I had to
mention it so now on to the good stuff
this video for loops so what the heck is
a for loop and why the heck do we even
need another loop well a for loop is
really good when you know exactly how
many times you want to loop you know
whenever we were like working with a
while loop it pretty much looped until
something happened or until we totally
break but for loops give you a lot of
control over exactly how many times you
want to loop which are good if you know
that in the future so I'll show you guys
is syntax for it and later on whenever
you're making programs you'll see why
sometimes you need for loops and
sometimes they're a lot better than
either while or do-while loops so right
now let's just go ahead and I'll show
you the syntax so make any variable an
integer variable name bacon and then a
couple lines down type the word for now
the basic structure for it is basically
the same as a while loop you just use
the word for or the keyword for instead
a while however inside the parentheses
it's going to take three different
pieces of information and their code
expressions now the thing you have to do
is unlike just a normal function or
something where
everything is separated with the comma
these actually get separated with a
semicolon because they are indeed
expressions now the very first
expression you pretty much have to say
where do you want to begin your loop so
I'm just going to go ahead and begin at
the number one so that's why I'm going
to put bacon equals one now the next
expression is pretty much going to say
okay well when do you want to end well
let's just go ahead and print out ten
numbers so I'll say bacon is less than
or equal to ten so of course the first
two pieces of the puzzle are easy pretty
much where you want to start and where
you want to end so the last piece is
actually saying how much do you want to
increment by so if we increment by one
then it's going to print out ten times
if we're increment by two it's going to
print out five times and I'll show you
guys a sample of this later if you're
better visually understanding but I want
to increment by one so I'm going to put
bacon plus plus so now basically what
this is saying is begin at one stop at
ten and go up by one so then this loop
is going to loop ten times whatever code
we put in here that's what's going to
happen so printf and in here I'm just
going to print something out on the
screen and I'll put bacon is and I'll
write the number of the loop iteration
that we're on so percent D and then I'll
push it on a new line I'll just print
out bacon so you guys can see what's
going on so let me run this and check it
out so pretty much as I stated before it
starts at one it ends at ten and because
we have bacon plus plus which means add
one to bacon every time that's why it
goes in steps of one at a time now we're
not just limited to steps of one at a
time or two at a time we can do
something like step up by eight at a
time so let me do that let's go ahead
and begin zero and go all the way to 100
and say that we wanted to step up by
eight well
in order to do that just put bacon plus
equals eight so basically this is saying
start at zero go up to a hundred like I
just said and go in steps of eight so
now when you run this check it out it
says zero eight sixteen and it keeps
adding eight until this condition is met
right here
bacon is less than or equal to 100 so
the next one after this would be 104 so
that's why it didn't print out so again
I know this was a real quick tutorial
and you guys are probably still
wondering okay well I could have done
all of this with a while loop so why the
heck would I even use this but later on
you're going to see while sometimes for
loops are incredibly powerful and why
they are incredibly also beneficial in
the future program so thank you guys for
watching and well I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
