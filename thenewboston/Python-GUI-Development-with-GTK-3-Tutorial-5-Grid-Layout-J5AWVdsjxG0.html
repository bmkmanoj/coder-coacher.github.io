example I am gonna be showing you guys
the first type of layout that you can
use with gtk and that is the grid layout
now as I'm sure you guys can guess a
grid layout is a way that you can lay
out your widgets using rows and columns
so it's pretty simple to understand one
of the easiest in my opinion so the
first thing you need to do is if you
call gtk grid then there you go so this
is our layout and let's just go ahead
and add it to the screen before we can
start adding our widgets so basically we
make a blank grid and then we make a
bunch of widgets and then we need to
pretty much give each widget a
coordinate of where it's supposed to be
in the grid and there's some other cool
things that we can do too so I'll just
create a bunch of buttons so to create a
bunch of buttons I'll create six of them
so button one gtk button and I'll just
keep things real simple so just a fun
one and you know just copy this all
right but one two three four five and
six dun dun dun dun dun dun - all right
boom roses so we got six buttons looking
sweet now for this first one all I'm
going to do is I'm just gonna add it
without any coordinates at all I'm just
gonna say we have a grid and we're just
gonna add button 1 now you're just
saying that and this is what I always do
for my first one by default it places it
in the top left I mean I guess it's just
they're not on top left it's the only
thing on our grid right now but I like
to add this first because this button
one is gonna be a reference point
whenever we add our other buttons and
you can actually um add them in
different kinds of ways ever as we're
gonna be seeing but the
um one of the easiest ways is if you
call grid attach then this is a way that
you can add more widgets to it so this
takes a couple of parameters first what
else do you want to add to the grid well
how about button two we want that one to
display too so button two it actually
takes 5 parameters that's just the first
the second one is what column I'll tell
you guys all the parameters so what item
do you want to add button to the column
the row and you can also give a a width
and a height or in other words columns
man or row span if you're familiar with
HTML so basically and remember this
since computers start counting at zero
your first row is the zero in your first
column as well so if you want it to
appear in the second column or the
second row that's actually one so I'm
gonna write one right here and that's
gonna appear in the second column so you
know that's just remember that so the
next thing I want to do is I want this
to appear in the top row because I just
want this button to right next to button
one just on the right hand side so in
the very first row that's zero so it's
gonna appear in the second column in the
top row or the first row and now I'm
actually want to make this twice as wide
so I'm just gonna write a width of two
and I'll just write a height of one now
this is actually technically called
column span and what is it row span but
it's the same thing is the width and the
height so now we have button two that's
to the right of button one and it's
twice as wide simple enough
now that is grid attached and let me
tighten this up just the wee bit all
right
so I bunt two and button one added
another thing that you can do is if you
just don't want to give it the
coordinates like this and this can get
kind of confusing if you have a lot of
widgets you can actually position these
in reference to other widgets so what if
you just want to say we want to add
button three but we want to position it
in a reference to
button1 well what we can do is we can
call grid attach next to so this one was
attached this one was attached next to
and this also takes some other
parameters the first one is all right
what widget are you trying to add to the
screen button three didn't add that one
yet
and now the other ones is what object
should it be placed next to well let's
just position this in reference to
button one and here let me take this
first so ttk position type bottom all
right so this next parameter after this
is it same okay I know you're trying to
add three next the button one but how do
you want it to be positioned next to it
to the right of it to the left of it on
top of it below it well I want button
three to be below button one so that's
why I said bottom right here so in
reference to button one how do you want
it to be positioned and the last two
parameters are the same so I'm just
gonna write like one and two so it's
gonna have a default width of one and
I'll make it twice as tall as normal
just so you guys can see that you know
you can change it up a bit and actually
let me pause my video and I won't make
you guys watch me do this alright so I
also added my other buttons right here I
didn't want to talk you guys through
that because I don't know I already
explained it like one second ago don't
want to repeat myself that one I have to
put you guys through that but there you
go
added all six buttons hopefully I did it
right and check it out so here's button
one that's the one we just added make
sure I don't lose that so button one we
just added it to the grid nothing you
know we didn't even give it any
coordinates or anything and that's why
it appeared in the top left right here
now for button number two what we did is
we attached it to the grid and we give
it a coordinate of 1 0 which means the
second column
the first row or the top row and we also
give it the last two parameters of 2/1
which means a width of two and a height
of one so that's why it was twice as
wide is the other ones and remember this
third one for button three right here we
attach it next to button one and we set
it to the bottom of it so that's why
it's a below bottom one and we gave it a
width and a height of one and two so
width of one in a height of two and then
the rest of these you guys can look see
how I position those but there you go
so in this example I probably made it
more confusing than it really is
but the cool thing about this is you
only have to get your layout once and
then you know you don't have to like
change it or you're not going to be like
moving these buttons around usually so
it's better just to actually write it
down on a piece of paper that's what I
always do I know it's kind of cheating
but it makes it a lot easier and then
yeah you can visually see exactly where
everything needs to go and to be honest
I usually just use attach every single
time because attach next to kind of gets
confusing whenever you have a
complicated layout so just and it's
basically like playing battleship with
your widgets so boom roasted I'm good to
go
this is almost too easy and in the
upcoming Sorrows I'll show you guys some
other types of layouts that may be a
little bit easier for your application
but anyways thanks for watching I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
