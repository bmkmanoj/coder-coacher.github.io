robotics and electronics tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm going to show you guys
how to use that circuit we just built
and how to use our multimeter to measure
the voltage in different parts of it and
this is important because if you have to
live a voltage your circuits not even
going to work the way you wanted to and
if you have too much voltage it's going
to damage some of your parts so I'm
going to actually be applying too much
voltage to some of these LEDs actually
I'm probably going to blow a big one
that's what she said so let's do that
right now so a lot of you guys were
thinking after watching my last tutorial
all right what would happen to that LED
right here if I didn't use a resistor at
all and just hooked it up straight to
the battery well the answer is that it
will blow and I will ruin it and I know
that you guys would probably want to see
that so I'm going to show you guys that
right now so go ahead and hook up your
red part to your longer part of your LED
just like that and I'm going to zoom in
before I hook this up because I want to
show you guys close up what it's going
to do so this is what happens when you
apply LED without any resistors at all
directly to your current as you can see
works good for a little bit oh that was
awesome that was probably the best LED
LED of blue so it pretty much just ruins
it in its thinking right now so I'm
going to unplug that and that's pretty
much what happens and that is why I'm
going to teach you guys how to measure a
voltage in your current or excuse me in
your circuit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
