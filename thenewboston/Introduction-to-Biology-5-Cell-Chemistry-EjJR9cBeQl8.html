this video we are going to cover up some
organic and biochemistry fun stuff right
this is still just introduction
introductory material so it's not going
to be explained in a lot of detail but
as with a lot of other things I've
already covered I will be explaining it
in much greater detail in future videos
I just can't fit everything into one
10-minute video anyways cells are
basically just tiny little chemical
factories they're constantly working to
break down build or modify compounds
cells contain both organic compounds
which contain hydrogen and carbon in a
chemical combination and also inorganic
compounds which do not contain carbon
and hydrogen in a chemical compound this
is not to say that inorganic compounds
cannot contain carbon for example
diamond is made of carbon however
diamond is not a an organic compound so
it's pretty much all of the chemistry
that happens within a cell is organic
chemistry that's what I'm going to be
talking about in this video we're going
to cover lipids carbohydrates proteins
and nucleic acids before I cover those
things though I'm just going to
introduce you guys to a couple of
functional groups that are found in
organic molecules that will be important
for you to know later on we start off
with hydroxyl groups you have an oxygen
and a hydrogen these are known as
alcohols and they have the formula R
which stands for pretty much any other
carbon hydrogen group whatever o H which
is your hydroxyl group an example would
be ethanol or your typical alcohol
what's found in beer vodka tequila
whatever excuse me as you can see here
there are two carbons and your hydroxyl
group we next have carbonyl groups which
have the function C with a double bonded
oxygen and two other groups on either
side you have ketones and aldehydes the
only difference between ketones and
aldehydes as that one of the R groups
has to be a hydrogen for an aldehyde and
as
temple of a ketone would be acetone or
nail polish remover and an example of an
aldehyde is acetaldehyde which is
believed to cause hangovers when you
drink too much of this you can see the
double bonded oxygen and the hydrogen
for the aldehyde and the double bonded
oxygen and these two methyl groups for
the ketone carboxyl groups have the
chemical formula C 0 H these are known
as carboxylic acids and these general
structure is a C double bond o and then
you have a hydroxyl group here that's
very it's very important to remember the
difference between carboxyl and carbonyl
groups an example of a carboxylic acid
is acetic acid also known as vinegar you
can see here you've got your carbon
double bonded oxygen hydroxyl group
right here we next have amino group
which are called amines these are a
nitrogen and down to some other organic
molecule an example would be ethyl amine
and you can see here nitrogen to
hydrogen there are different
classifications of a means you have
primary amines secondary amines and
tertiary amines this has to do with the
number of hydrogen's attached to the
nitrogen a primary amine has two
hydrogens on the nitrogen secondary
amine has one hydrogen and two R groups
and a tertiary amine does not have any
hydrogen's instead it's all R groups
next we have phosphates you have a
phosphorus three oxygens excuse me 4
oxygens 1 1 1 1 and a double bonded
oxygen and this has a charge of negative
2 this is what is called a polyatomic
ion but anyways an example of a
phosphate would be glucose 6-phosphate
glucose is a carbohydrate sugar
here you can see the phosphate attached
to the six carbon right here and the
last one is a sulfhydryl group our dials
or mercaptans
an example is butane Thyle four carbons
sulfur hydrogen and thiols are sulfur
containing groups think of it as a
sulfur alcohol</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
