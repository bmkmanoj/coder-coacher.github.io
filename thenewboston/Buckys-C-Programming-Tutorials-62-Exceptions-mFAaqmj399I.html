second tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
going to begin talking about something
called exception handling now an
exception is a way of handling an error
that might occur when your program is
running for example if you built a
calculator and the user is trying to
divide by 0 that may be a error that
occurs when the program is running or if
you know you have you made a game and
you need a user to register if they try
to use like 999 as their age that's
unacceptable so that may cause an error
to occur so let's go ahead and take a
look at the syntax for this now the
first thing we need is something called
a try block now in this try block this
is where we write the code that we want
to try aka the code that we think error
might occur so let's go ahead and make
something like I'm going to be making a
simple program that takes two ages the
mother's age and the son's age now we
all know that a son cannot be older than
its mom
so whenever the sons age is greater than
the mom's age this would of course cause
an error so let's go ahead and make two
variable int mom's H and int sons
actually might as well summon equal to
values right now and mom's age equals
like 30 and its sons age we'll set this
equal to 34 now we all know this is
impossible so let's go ahead and test it
right now so if the son's age is greater
than the mom's age then we want to go
ahead and we want to do something called
throwing an exception now it's basically
this whenever you have something that
occurs that shouldn't occur we need to
tell the computer that an error did
occur and we do this by throwing an
exception and in order to throw an
exception exception go ahead and type
throw and then type an error number and
you can make this any number you want
you can actually do other things besides
numbers but just throw a number because
later on say we made a program that
check for you know 20 different types of
errors we want to know what air
ha so let's go ahead and we already know
that in our little manual 99 means that
the mom is younger than the Sun so you
know it's pretty much just a reference
number so anytime we get an exception
and remember anytime this line of code
is going to run it basically means that
an error occurred so now that we know an
error occurred we need a way to handle
that error because we just don't want
our program to freak out and shut down
so in order to handle the air we do
something called catch the air catching
the air allows you to pass in that
number which is 99 so now X is equal to
99 and we can handle it a certain way
for example we can just output to the
user on something like this son can not
be older than mom um and then for
reference or a err number and this is
where we write that's X right there in
line and just scroll head so you guys
can see what I'm typing so now if you go
ahead and run this we can see all right
whenever this program runs and the kid
is older than the mom then we have error
message that pops up that says son
cannot be older than mom err number 99
so you know this is pretty much just for
our reference this error number but
let's go ahead and say that the mom was
indeed older than a son the mom was like
50 and the son was 34 well this is going
to work fine and this is never going to
happen
so no error is going to be thrown no
exceptions are going to be thrown so
this catch block is just going to be
skipped so let's go ahead and run this
and we don't get any error messages this
program works perfectly so basically the
concept of this is or oh is this an
exception is a way of handling errors
that may occur when your program is
running for example if the user tries
the divide by zero or pretty much if the
user does something they aren't supposed
to do now in the try block right here
this is where you write the code
where the air might occur and right
after it you need a catch block now the
catch block is basically what what to do
if there is indeed in air and if there
is no air in this try block then the
catch block is skipped all together and
just like a function a catch block takes
parameters so it can take an integer in
this case such as 99 and that's pretty
much just like an error number you know
whenever you're just playing on your
computer and windows messes up you know
how like the error message pops up well
that's pretty much what we're doing
right here it's like error message to
the yada yada yada do you want to send
to Microsoft or do you don't want to
send by the way does anyone ever send
those do they really get those error
messages I don't think so
but anyways now you guys know the basics
of exception handling and by the way if
you guys are saying you know what Bucky
I could just have used an if statement
and you know made a separate function
for this well I know that we can do this
a different way but um exception
handling is useful whenever you're
trying to you know do computer stuff
like allocate memory I just want to show
you guys a real easy example for this
case but I know that you could have
probably made this program just by using
a basic if statement and you know maybe
a simple function or something but I
wanted to demonstrate the try and catch
block in how to handle an error message
so these are useful for a lot more than
you know comparing two variables and
there are some instances where we can't
just make a simple program that we need
to use this exception handling so for
now I just want to tell you guys that so
I guess in the next tutorial I'm
probably going to show you guys another
example and show you guys how you can
use a different parameter for this catch
block right here but for now that's all
you guys get so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
