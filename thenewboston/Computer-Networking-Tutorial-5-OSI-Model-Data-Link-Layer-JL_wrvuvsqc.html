networking tutorial and in this tutorial
we're going to be going over the data
link layer now if you remember your OSI
model let me bring it up as you can see
I drew in that from my story but this is
the second layer from bottoms up
it's called the data link layer and it
sits on top of the physical layer now
what the data link layer does is took is
it takes all those bits we were talking
about remember let me get something to
draw on right here
remember all those bits were ones zeros
and ones ones and zeros all that binary
code and it formats it into something
called a frame now what frame is it's
pretty much a unit of data that goes
over your network and it contains your
address information so it contains I
it's pretty much all of your data but it
contains all of other data too that make
sense so it's pretty much all these ones
and zeros but it has things like the
address of your computer of where you're
sending it from the address of your
computer where you're sending it to it
also does some other cool things like
check for errors on your data and stuff
like that so for example what we have
going on so far is a connection between
one computer to another and remember the
cable between it is called the physical
layer physical layer is pretty much
anything you can touch now what the data
layer is it takes all the ones and zeros
and it pretty much puts the address on
them say this is your address and this
is your address what's going to happen
next I didn't tell you yet because we're
not to that tutorial now but that's what
pretty much the data link layer does is
pretty much puts all your ones and zeros
in envelope and the data link layer
stamps the envelope and puts the address
on BAM perfect analogy right there
so another thing that the data link
layer does is it check for incoming like
duplicate signals or anything like that
and if like it gets a duplicate signal
or up like only a part of the signal is
received then it says whoa whoa take it
easy Bessie go back send that to me
again I didn't get that entire signal
and this might be because like um again
let me uh let me get rid of this come on
delete delete uh if you can remember
from the last tutorial um I had
something like an analog wave that had
different waves like this and you can
have something called interference and
this can be like interference from
outside radio stations a radio in your
house a microwave even the ceiling fan
or something like that so if you get
interference in any of these then the
data layer links job is to say all right
go back send that to me again and also
another thing it does is I said before
is get the address of one computer to
another and this is called the MAC
address or physical address so if you're
wondering alright what the heck are you
talking about this is um well let me
just show you let's see if I can find
out on my computer acessories command
prompt right here now um let's go to see
you guys slash now hopefully you guys
can see this now I'm not going to show
you guys my actual address on my
computer because I don't want anyone
trying to send me crap through my
network but pretty much to find all your
information go to your command promt
right here type in CD and then go to
pack slash like that and this will take
you to your root command actually you
don't even need to do that but it's
always a good idea next type in IP conf
IG space slash all and make sure I know
fit that's a front slash I guess then
press Enter
now once you press ENTER this is going
to list all of your address that your
data link layer uses now I'm not showing
you guys there's actually stuff on the
right side of here but I'm not going to
show you guys what any of that is and
your physical address is the address
that your that's the one your data link
layer uses it actually uses all these
addresses right here on the physical
address should be under a local area
network connection or local area
connection so that is pretty much the
the addresses that the data link layer
uses that's just a nice little side note
you don't really need to know that but
that's pretty much how the data link
layer works you can understand a lot
more when I teach you guys the other
layers you pretty much need to know all
the layers and see how they work
together before you can learn this one
but that's a nice little side tutorial
so again learn the data link tutorial it
pretty much puts address on everything
that's a summary of it and checks for
errors and in the next tutorial we're
going to be going over the network layer
of the OSI model so I hope you guys
enjoyed make sure how to learn how to do
the command prompt and I will see you
next time thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
