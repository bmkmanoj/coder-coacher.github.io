tutorial for the new boss in again it's
me Travis what we're going to do in this
tutorial is basically set up our menu
because we're going to create a lot of
small applications and we just want to
have a menu so we can kind of go to each
each activity and see what that example
does so basically our menu is going to
be our activity that we want after our
splash screen so what we're going to do
is we're going to get just create a new
class by right-clicking on the package
my computer doesn't freeze here and then
go to new class and we're going to call
this menu now hopefully you guys kind of
get familiar with the layout of the
oncreate stuff again some some things
are probably still pretty confusing for
you guys but just stick with the series
and everything will make sense at the
end especially this this these next
three tutorials it might be a little bit
confusing because it's working with a
list list activity for the most part so
that's going to be different but when
you guys come back to it you'll realize
everything that we've done is going to
make sense so just this is a nice
framework that we can use so we're going
to say extends and before we'd say
extends activity for the most part but
since we want to create a list we can
use a different class called a list
activity so this is going to extend base
or we can use some of the methods from
the list activity after we import it so
we have to do that and we're going to be
able to use the same methods from the
activity class but we're also going to
use some additional methods from the
list activity class because it holds
both for the most part so we're going to
go into our brackets here and we're
going to create two methods within this
this class so we're going to go to
source override implement methods and as
you can see right here we can pull from
the list activity class and from the
activity class so what we're going to do
is we're going to go into the list
activity we're going to look for
something called on list item click and
we're going to add that method and then
we're going to go into the activity
class and again just get our on create
method
for the most part nothing too new here
what we're going to set up is a variable
it's going to be a string array and
basically what an array is is it holds
multiple values for basically the same
variable depending on what position it
is I know that's kind of confusing but
we're going to just set it up and I'll
explain it as we go and we want this
string array to be able to be accessed
by both or oncreate and our both are
oncreate and our list item click and I'm
just going to move this up real quickly
just cuz oops just because I can for the
most part above the on list item click
there we go and since we want this
string array to be accessed by both
these methods we're going to define it
again above or on create method or above
both methods so we're gonna say a string
and we're going to call this string
classes and to making it to make it an
array you want to add two square
brackets like that and we're going to
hit this equals and we're going to
define the string array and then I'll
kind of explain what extreme a string
array is after we set it up so we're
going to do is we're going to say again
another pair of brackets right here and
then within quotations because strings
are basically like words you can think
of think of it like that in programming
it's just a word so we're going to call
this first string position let's see
starting point the exact same name as
our class name that we have called
starting point make sure it's the exact
same case-sensitive and everything
because we're going to have this
application use these string positions
for the most part to open a new a new
activity so just a starting point and
then we're gonna put a comma and we can
say example 1 and then I'm just going to
copy this and paste it a few times just
to get some more things within our array
I'm just it's still all basically one
line of code I'm just copy and pasting
so we still need to enter bracket right
here and still need to finish it with a
with a semicolon so there we go we have
some things within our list array and we
can change these names as we go well
basically I'm just going to change them
for for the most part right now because
it'll be easy reference for you guys so
now what we can do is we can access this
string array and give it a position and
it will find what position it is within
the string so sorry got extra bracket
there sorry if I confused you guys so
now for example I'm not that we aren't
going to reference it right here but for
example we can use the the variable name
called classes and within the brackets
we can say for something like that now
what this is going to be equal to is our
class's string array the fourth position
so it's and it's always starts at a 0 so
starting point is our zero position this
will be our first position position to
position 3 position 4 so what this is
equal to is the exact same as quotations
example 4 which would be extreme
so basically hopefully that got kind of
makes sense and we're going to use this
more again I know it's kind of confusing
at the moment but just stick with the
series guys and everything will make
sense eventually thanks again for
watching we basically just setup the
string array and we're going to finish
this whole activity in the next couple
tutorials so I'll catch you guys then
have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
