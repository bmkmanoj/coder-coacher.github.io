today we're going to learn how to create
a vector mask in Photoshop cs6 now a
vector mask is a resolution independent
object which means that you can resize
it and move it move the points around in
everything and it's going to stay the
same resolution that's the greatness of
vectors you can scale up or scale down
and not lose resolution vector masks are
created with a pen tool or a shape tool
so we're when you try to use like a
paintbrush or anything like that or a
selection those are four layer masks and
the pen tools and the shape tools are
for vector masks so let's get started
load up any image and turn that image
into a layer go ahead and select your
shake tool and bring it down to the
custom shape tool or you could select
any of these other tools as well but
custom shape tool is cooler and you want
to make sure that this is set to path
and not shape go ahead and pick from any
of the shapes that you have and if you
don't have a whole lot of shapes in here
already just go to the little gear here
for the options and just click on all
and that will load in all of them for it
so go ahead and pick something that you
think looks cool and let's take the
union here I haven't seen one of those
in a long time since I was in like
second grade where I'll access it with
them on our like pogs and stuff like
that but anyways so go ahead and drag
out your shape which is now using path
and not shape so hold shift to constrain
it drag it out and you can see that
there's a lines going on here now we've
just got a path going on here but we
want to make into a mask if I click on
the add mask button here it's just going
to create a layer mask and that's not
what I want so ctrl Z to get that off
what you need to do is you need to hold
down control and then click on the layer
mask now it creates a vector mask for
you and you can see how that works going
on here so go ahead and um go to the
left of your ship custom shape tool here
and click on the pointer here and we've
got the path selection tool and direct
selection tool now if I click on the
actual mask here but on the image you
can see that there's different points
and you are able to adjust any of these
points however you want to affect the
mask and customize your mask make sure
that you have the mask layer selected or
nothing's going to happen oops
just just select it once and we're going
to go to the direct selection tool click
on an edge and you can see that the
points are here now if you drag like on
an edge here you are changing the way
that your mask looks but you keeping the
same resolution and everything like that
if I wanted to select all of them you
can go ahead and drag and then maybe
just you can drag it and move it around
like that if I select and can move
anything you can use these edges here to
change the way that your curve is
working on your mask now remember that I
said that when you're using a vector you
don't have to worry about resolution and
all that so what you can do is go ahead
and select the move tool hit ctrl T so
that you can resize your image and go
ahead and either scale it up or scale it
down and go ahead and hit enter and you
can see that along the edges no
resolutions lost so that's one of the
good things about using a vector mask
over a layer mask so that's it that I
want to show you about creating a
masks and in the next tutorial I'll show
you how to modify it up a little bit a
little bit more than I already showed
you so keep tuned for that next tutorial
and I hope you guys have a good day then
so see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
