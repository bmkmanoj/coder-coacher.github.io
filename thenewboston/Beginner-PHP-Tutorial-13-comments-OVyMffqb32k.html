and this is a video tutorial for the new
Boston now in this tutorial we're going
to be covering a comment inside PHP now
if you program before in any other
language you'll understand how important
commenting your code is this could be in
large chunks or commenting single lines
just to show yourself and other
programmers what the program does and
maybe just add notes for copyright
reasons or anything else now I've
created this extremely simple and basic
PHP script which basically just outputs
hello world to the browser now obviously
us looking at this we know exactly what
it does but for the purposes of this
tutorial I'm going to be commenting it
just to let anyone else that's looking
at it understand what's going on so the
first type of commenting is just single
line commenting so what I've done is
I've pulled this down a bit and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to do two
forward slashes now you can see that as
I type text my text editors change this
to italics and it's turned gray now this
is just a standard notation for my text
editor to show me a comment let's just
make sure it's an interfere with the
readability of the code so you'll
probably find that you whatever text
editor you're doing that unless you're
using something basic like notepad it's
not going to show you but in this case
it does so I'm going to comment uses
echo language construct to output the
text
hello world to the browser so that's a
simple comment that shows anyone that's
watching this what this does now what we
can also do is we can add comments
directly after lines as long as they're
not obviously before anything important
like this code so for example if I was
to put two forward slashes this is
automatically now commented out and that
line of code won't run but this is also
useful if you were to run through a
program and you're debugging it you
could just quickly put some forward
slashes and test different parts of your
code and remove parts of your code that
you didn't want to run now let's say I
want to add up here a little bit of
information about this page who it is
created by and the date so I want to
create a long long long sort of
paragraph or a short paragraph in this
case I've just text explaining about the
program now to do this I'm going to use
a forward slash and then an asterisk I'm
going to come down a few lines and I'm
going to type another asterisk and then
another forward slash now you could see
then just while I was typing that this
text down here was going gray and now
that I've ended that everything inside
here is going to be regarded as a
comment so you can see that this is a
lot easier than doing this for several
lines because you may want several lines
to write on each line
but obviously the easier way it would be
to use this notation so now what we can
do is we can write some information
inside here so we could just pop the
date in and that's sir just a lot of
better way and it looks neater as well
obviously you could bring say this up
here if you really wanted to it's
entirely up to you but anything between
this and this is going to be regarded as
a comment system and these are one line
comment systems or comments which can be
placed either above below or after
line but obviously not before because
that's going to render your code
unreadable by PHP so that's commenting
in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
