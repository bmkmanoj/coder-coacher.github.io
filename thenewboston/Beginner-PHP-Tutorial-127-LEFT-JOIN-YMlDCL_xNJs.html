and this is another video tutorial for
the new Boston now in this tutorial
we're going to be looking at the left
join inside of SQL statements that we've
already looked at basically taking data
from our database however what happens
when we have say a table called people
we've got a column called ID and we've
got a column called name here or a field
called idea in a field called name and
each person is assigned an ID so this is
an auto increment in primary key field
we've got one representing Alex and two
representing Dale and we've also got a
table called pets
now inside pets we have three fields and
the first one's ID which just
corresponds to an auto incrementing
primary key so each each Val each record
is unique we've also got people
underscore ID now people on the squat ID
corresponds to each person in the people
database so rather than having a name in
here we're using the unique the unique
identifier of each person so one is Alex
and two is Dales let's go over to pets
and interpret this what we're
essentially saying in this table is that
alex has a pet cat and alex has a pet
fish because we've got people ID one and
one and we're also saying Dale has a dog
okay so we've got one representing Alex
and two representing Dale and we've got
an entry called catfish and dog
we're cat belongs to Alex fish belongs
to Alex and dog belongs to Dale ok so
ignore this ID here for now in this
column all we need to focus on is people
ID pet obviously explicit what we're
going to be echoing out or retrieving
rather and also in the people table
we've got an idea of one for Alex an
idea of two Fidel so hopefully this
makes sense if it doesn't rewind the
video and have another look now what are
we going to be doing so it's fair enough
we've got all this data but what we want
to do is we want to join results so we
can echo out who has what pet at the
moment they're stored in separate tables
let me just talk to you about why
they're stored in
the tables when you're working in in PHP
you're going to most likely want to
reference someone's name with it's their
ID so therefore by storing it as an ID
here we can use an inner join statement
or sorry a left join in this case to
identify values that exist in this table
here in this people table we're going to
say 1 + 2 is going to match this here so
we're going to echo out essentially
we're going to echo out in the end
Alex twice with the cat and fish and dog
so Alex is going to be replaced by 1 1 +
2 is going to be replaced by Dale so
let's have a look at the SQL query in
how we might do this so we'll run
through this and then we'll have a look
at the results now it's slightly
different so when we're accessing
different tables data when we're doing
our Select query so we're going to say
select but this time what we're going to
do something dot something and we do
this because we can reference it from a
particular table so you might say select
people dot name let's just open up this
in a new tab so we can see what's going
on so we want to say people so the table
is called people and dot name so is
people dot name so it's from the people
table and the field name and we also
want to select from the pets table let's
just open this up we want to select pet
pet so essentially what we want to be
displaying will be written here so we
want to display the people from the
people table we want to display the name
and from the pets table we want to
display pet which is the name of the pet
now we want to say from people so we
want to inner joy out we want to left
join so we want to join this pet table
onto this where the left column exists
or the the left day - exists in the
right so we want to say where this ID
here
is equal to
to this people ID here so we do this in
a slightly odd way so we say from people
we say left join and the table we want
to join so pets we want to join pets so
select from people left join pets and
then we want to say on and this is the
condition that it's on so the condition
is that the ID here ID one or two
matches people ID so we can come back
and we can say on people dot ID is equal
to pets dot people ID so we're saying on
the condition that people do ID which is
here is equal to pets people ID so
inside the pet table people ID so let's
go ahead and copy and paste this just in
case we lose I'll copy this rather to
the clipboard and we'll click go now you
can see that what it's done is it's
returned the name column or field if you
like and the pet and what we've actually
got here is Alex owns a cat alex owns of
fish and downloads a dog so we've taken
data from two different tables and
joined it but by only using one SQL
statement now why would we want to do
this why we could in PHP we could say
loop through and then within a loop we
could do another query looking for this
ID and then represent that data the
reason we don't do this is it slows
everything down by just using one query
as opposed to two queries you will
already have the processing time of them
queries as a whole so it's obviously a
lot better to only use one query rather
than using two different queries and we
don't just have left join we have right
join and inner join as well so we can
use these in different ways and I'll be
display explaining that in other
tutorials but for now this is the left
join in how we're going to use it
so if you have app data in another table
that's represented by say an ID from
another table then you now know to use
left join to basically join two tables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
