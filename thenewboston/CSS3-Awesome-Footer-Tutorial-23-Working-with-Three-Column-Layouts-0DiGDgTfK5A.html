twenty-third tutorial and in this video
what we're gonna be doing is let me just
add a comment account button so we don't
get lost here so this was the account
button and now we have to work on the
amazing Mega three column layout which
is actually incredibly simple you guys
are going to see so let's scroll down
here and add another comment and this
just makes it easy to see because we're
usually gonna have you know this HTML
file is gonna be pretty long so whenever
I'm scrolling through it I noticed these
green things and those are like the main
parts that stand out I anyways this is
going to be the profile button so that's
what my comment will say profile button
alright so of course the first thing we
need to do is we need to add a list item
and our anchor tag I think that's what
it is so what this does is it basically
creates the button on your toolbar at
the bottom so we now have a profile
button and let me actually make sure
that everything is showing up alright so
what this does is it creates our profile
button on the toolbar but now what we
need to do is we need to create all the
good stuff and let's go ahead and break
this down before I show you guys what
we're doing what we're doing is we're
creating a three column layout it's a
layout that fits in by layout I pretty
much mean drop up menu it's a drop up
menu that fits one two three columns so
we know that's how many columns but now
let's break down how many rows well we
have one row and this actually is a row
that takes up three wide it takes up the
whole thing is just to the left we have
another row this is another row right
here so one two three four and then this
is actually in the Taira row right here
so we have five rows so this imagine it
like a grid where it's three wide by
five tall so that's what we have to
create and I want to show you guys how
to do it so the first thing we have to
tell
our program is just how big of a layout
that you do you want or how wide is this
can be so div class equals three column
layout
it really doesn't care how tall it is
that's up to you whenever you're making
crap in it right now it just needs to
know how wide to make it so now just go
ahead and and that div and now the next
thing you need to write is now that it
knows it's three columns you need to
start creating your rows now whenever
you create a row the only thing that you
need to do is say how wide do you want
this row so the first one is going to be
all three columns wide you can probably
get away with making this only two
columns wide because the first row is
this text example of three columns but
why not make it three columns wide you
know just in case so this is how you
create an individual row I guess I can
give myself a little bit more space here
div class equals column and then you say
how wide do you want this row basically
so Col 3 means I'm gonna take up 3
columns now just go ahead and and your
div and you put your content of your row
right in here now the content of our row
just says example of three columns and
it's actually a heading two so heading
two heading two and it just says example
of three columns so what we did right
here is we basically are get created
this very first row now remember that I
told you guys whenever you create a new
row using this format you just can't go
on to the next row what you need to do
is you need to add that special clear
class now let me see if I can find it
it's gonna be a pain in but because I
know I probably can't actually I'm gonna
find it because it's really important
now remember that I said you add this in
between rows now what this says is it
basically in everyday common terms it
says hey browser I'm going to a new row
but in technical terms what it's saying
is okay
nothing can float to the left or to the
right of me and this ensures that
instead of creating elements you know on
the right hand side if it has space it
says um make sure that nothing floats to
the left or the right hand side of me so
basically push anything I'm about to
write on a new row so in this row we're
going to do is we're going to add three
individual pieces of information so here
is how you do that actually I'm gonna go
ahead and copy this and copy that and my
other div and this is just the cheat div
however if we did this or I forgot to
add my clear class that is kind of
embarrassing so after each row class
equals clear and you can just end a div
on the same line because this right here
it doesn't show anything on the screen
it's just for your browser to say hey
you're moving to a new row so this was
the first row now let's go ahead and
create the second row right here now the
second row like I said it has three
individual columns so if we added this
it would take up three columns wide but
we actually want three of these that
take up one column so this is gonna take
up one column this is gonna take up
another column and this is going to take
up another column so you can either have
a row that takes up three columns or a
row that takes up three columns using
three individual blocks so from here we
can just you know add a paragraph or
something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
