tutorial and in this video since we
learned last time that loops are
freaking awesome what I want to do is I
want to teach you guys a new type of
loop called the do-while loop now it's
pretty much a way that you can run a
loop just like before but you can
guarantee that your code runs at least
once so let me show you the syntax for
it and when you would actually use this
type do and then without any parentheses
we're not testing anything so far
hit the curly brackets and inside here
is where the code is going to go the
meat of your code on anything you want
to run in this loop it's going to occur
right here just like the while loop now
for the tests outside your curly bracket
it's that ending one type while and this
is where you test it right here so
basically what's going to happen is it's
going to run your code and then it's
going to make the test after it to see
if it's true if it's true it's going to
run your code again over and over and
over again until the test becomes false
so the syntax is a little bit different
and like I said what it does is since
you're computer programs run from top to
bottom it's going to guarantee this code
runs at least once before the test even
occurs so if this test is false you
already ran your code once so I'll show
you guys why this is useful right now so
you know a couple of tutorials ago I
showed you guys how to make this program
that allows the user to enter three test
grades and then it gave them the average
of those test grades well whenever
you're making a program like this you
want to make it adaptable for any users
you don't know if they're going to add
it enter like three test grades ten test
grades if it's a big I don't know
college that once enter everyone's test
grade so you want to make a like I said
a program that can accept as many test
grades you want and still gives you the
correct answer so let's go ahead and
make that right now and I want to delete
this because this fake code is kind of
cramping my style so we need a couple
variable
and we'll make them all floats will be
easier to work with and will send more
equal to zero by default so this is
pretty much going to keep a running
score of all your grades so if you enter
three scores of like I don't know fifty
then 50 then 30 then your grade is going
to be 130 and the reason that we need to
keep track of all the scores combined is
in order to get the average we take all
your scores combined over total amount
of tests you took and it gives you your
average simple stuff so the next thing
is we need a variable to can't type and
talk at the same time to pretty much
store whatever they entered for that
test so the current score that they
entered and typed in we're just go ahead
and store it and score entered and
actually let me just do this since I'm a
lazy bum and all these are going to be
equal to zero so the third variable we
need is just number of tests and this is
zero right now but we can go ahead and
increment it each time using that auto
increment remember that so the last one
right here is just the average and of
course we know what that is that's
pretty much the end goal on their
average test score we'll print it out
right there so now that we have all of
these we can go ahead and add some
actually let's go ahead and give them a
little prompt right now print of all
right so this program like I said is
going to allow them to enter an
unlimited amount of grades and it's
always going to give them their average
and some other stats as well if we want
so how do we tell the program that it's
time to stop running well we'll say that
we'll just make a simple conditioner
right now we'll just say whenever the
user types in zero to quit the program
so that's going to be the test so press
zero when complete and just add some new
lines so I don't know it just looks a
little bit neater that way
now in your do statement remember this
is going to occur at least one time by
default so the first thing I want to
occur is pretty much just the print out
those stats basically saying on your
test in your average as well so it's
pretty much going to say oh well I just
said it so let's go stupid
so tests which is going to be 0 by
default and it's going to increase by 1
every time they enter a new test and
remember this is a float
so put % F and remember what we did up
here is we made everything a float
because we saw that your computer works
really well when everything is the same
data type but if you think about it you
can't like take half a test and by
default floats occur or excuse me
display 6 decimal places so you don't
want to display like one point zero zero
zero test because he's like what the
heck is going on I can't like have one
and a half test so whenever you want to
kind of cheat in to you don't have to
typecast this you can just press point
zero and it's just going to display the
whole number of the float like one two
three so on and so forth so it's just a
quick little tip so that's going to be
how many tests they entered and this
average of course you know that is
percent F and we can display this to
like I don't know two decimal places
it'll be good now keep that to a new
line and of course it says okay well now
you need to give me a float and the
average and this first one is how many
tests they entered and the second one is
average sweet now after this what we
need to do is just give them a little
prompt to actually enter the test score
so put enter test score actually what I
want to do is keep this one on new line
as well
and I actually don't want to break to a
new line after this because I think
it'll be cooler if it just displays this
on the screen and they can just enter it
to the right it'll be a blinking line on
the right look pretty cool in my opinion
so now of course scanf what kind of data
are you entering well we are entering a
float and after this where do you want
to store it well we just want to store
it in the variable score entered now
remember to put your ampersand there
because it is not an array so pretty
much arm the user is going to type in
some value hopefully like 90-something
and the first thing that we need to do
is take whatever they enter and add it
to grade because remember grade is the
running tally or the running total of
our all of your scores entered so grade
plus equals score entered so if they
entered 50 over and over again this
would be 50 100 150 200 and score is not
going to keep increasing it's just going
to be different every time
some like 0 to 100 so after this what we
need to do is increase the number of
tests by 1 and we can just do that with
a little increment operator plus plus so
ok we added the score to grade we
increase number of tests by 1 now the
only other thing we need to do is
calculate the average that's the goal of
the program so to calculate their
average test score easy stuff all we do
is take their grade divide by the number
of tests and boom there you go and also
we don't print it out right now because
that's what we do in this line right
here so the last thing that we need to
actually do is just remember right now
this is going to keep running and
running and running a
and over again because we don't have a
condition to tell it when to stop and
we'll say the test for this is when
score entered is not equal to zero
keep running so it's pretty much saying
if they entered anything other than zero
do this loop again so once they enter
zero it's going to break out of it in
your program is going to end so let's go
ahead and run this right now and see if
I messed anything up which I did and
what I do under find a reference to
print because I didn't put printf and
any other bugs looks good all right but
that took me how second to figure out
what's going on so pretty much said
press one zero okay everything looks
good right now enter a test score let's
see if this bad boy works
we'll put 70 80 and 90 so we can just
make sure that everything is working
correctly okay so after I entered one
test test one average equals 70 hit 80
well you enter two tests your average is
now 75 enter 90 you enter three tests
after the three tests your average is 80
and you can keep doing this forever and
ever
54 and eventually what's going to happen
is once the user hits zero check it out
that's going to process and say okay I'm
only supposed to do this loop
whenever um as long as you didn't enter
zero you did enter zero and this text
down here is pretty much saying end of
your program a return zero right here
what signifies the end so that is a do
loop and it's a pretty cool way that you
can enhance um your what's it called
this like average calculating test
program whatever the heck you want to
call it but hopefully you guys um
understand how that works if you don't
then just ask me any questions you have
or if you have a bug in your program
post the code on my forum I'll be happy
to answer for you guys but for now thank
you guys for watching and I'll see
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
