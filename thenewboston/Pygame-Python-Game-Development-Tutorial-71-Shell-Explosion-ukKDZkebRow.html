to yet another PI game tutorial video in
this video what we're gonna do is we
we're firing this show and that's all
fine and dandy but now in the last video
what we did is we calculated the impact
of the shell and now we want to actually
you know have that impact actually you
know take effect and the way that we're
gonna do that is with an explosion so in
this video that's what we're gonna be
creating is it an explosion function so
basically what's gonna happen is we have
this fire shell function and here you
have impact XY Beaubois after that at
that point we want to basically have a
function that is explosion and then
where do we want that explosion to occur
well we're gonna obviously have it occur
at hit X and hit Y so now we need to
create this explosion function so just
come up above fire shell and that's
where we're gonna create this explosion
function so there we go
define explode an explosion is going to
have the parameters of X and of course Y
: let's begin explosion like a lot of
our functions is its own little mini
sequence right so again like a lot of
this stuff will have explode and it's
gonna start off as true and then we're
gonna say wow explode and again we're
gonna allow the user to maybe exit if
they want so we'll just let's just copy
then paste this function from here so we
have to write it again so for event
plug-in multiple so while explode and
then for event and pygame event to get
bubble cool what do we want to do well
this starting point so start point of
this explosion is gonna be X and y right
so hit X hit wine so start point is x
and y and then an explosion has like all
kinds of different colors okay it just
so happens that we've already predefined
we've got red light red yellow and light
yellow let's use those so we've already
done those so I'm gonna come back down
to this explosion here and so we have
color choices so I'm gonna make it just
a list and we're gonna say color choices
equals and our choices are red light red
yellow and light underscore yellow so
those are color choices then we have
like the in theory we might decide to
change later on like we might have like
a simple shell and then we have like a
high-explosive shell you could add more
shells to the game to make it more
exciting but for now let's just assume
that the blow-up is about the same thing
but let's say we have let's say magnet
the total magnitude will be 50 okay we
start with magnitude of 1 so magnitude
equals 1 then we're gonna say wow
magnitude is less than 50 so we're gonna
say the magnitude will be 50 what do we
want to do well this is where we create
the explosion so the way that we're
gonna do this is we're gonna say
exploding underscore bit underscore X is
gonna equal X plus a random dot R and
and this will be a random range between
negative 1 times whatever the magnitude
is to whatever the magnitude is so
within you know plus or minus the
magnitude from the exploit of explosion
so as you can imagine as the magnitude
gets up the explosion will start small
and it will start to expand out until
the magnitude is reached and then we
basically do the exact same thing to Y
so I'm gonna go ahead and just copy and
paste this so copy and paste and just
modify X to Y and modify this to Y boom
done now let's actually draw these
little bits so what we'll do is we'll
just
say hi gang dot draw dot circle where do
we draw that the game display where or
what color do we draw that well we're
gonna draw it in color
sorry where do we draw it game is play
what color are we gonna draw color
choices and then we want this to be a
random choice every time so how do we do
that well we've got a zero one two three
so that's a range between zero and four
so you would say color choices and then
you would say random dot R and range and
then here we say zero comma four so this
could this will return either at zero
one two or three so random range zero
comma four so that's the color and then
we ask where do we want to actually draw
this little circle this would be a lot
of color choices now where do we draw it
the x and y and this is a tuple and
basically exploding underscore bit
underscore X exploding underscore bit
underscore Y and then the radius
basically so that now we'll just let's
say two for now we'll see how that works
and it actually in fact instead of two
let's do a random dot R and range one
five cool so now we've got our little
exploding bits every time we draw that
explosion will do magnitude plus equals
one and then of course we need to still
run a tie game dot displayed update and
then we also want to tick the clock so
we'll do clock tick and we'll run this
at 100 frames a second and then we'll
say explode equals false when all of
this wat while this state until the
statement is done when it's done
explosion is false so that's basically
it totally possible I have a typo or
something in here so let's go ahead and
run this
I think we did call explosion at least
let's find out so we fire and boom we
have a nice explosion now so it hits the
ground and it explodes awesome yeah we
got some power so basically just adds an
explosion wherever we you know draw it
so cool X out of this nice and that's it
so now we have an awesome explosion now
obviously there's a lot of other things
that we could do this explosion to make
it way cooler but for now that's a
pretty decent explosion I would say so
hopefully you guys enjoyed as always
thanks for watching and stay tuned to
