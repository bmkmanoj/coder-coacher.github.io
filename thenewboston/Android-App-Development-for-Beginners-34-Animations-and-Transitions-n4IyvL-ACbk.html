about transitions and David animations
then welcome to the tutorial alright so
there was my intro I hope you liked it
because it took me like eight hours to
make that sick beat
so yeah transitions aka we're going to
learn how to move crap across the screen
basically and later on um aside from
like basic animations I'm going to be
showing you guys something called scene
transitions which you can pretty much
take an entire scene and switch it for
the user and it kind of plays into what
we're going to learn later on pretty
much bee sting called intense and it's
pretty much how you change entire views
for the user
anyways I'm kind of overwhelming you
guys I know it already
way to go buggy way to go so let's go
ahead and get started with a new project
here and I'm just going to name this um
trainee it's just short for transitions
so I'm just going to hit next right
there and another thing I want to point
out make sure that you're using API 19
for the minimum because even though it's
not going to target all of the devices
for this tutorial we're going to be
using some libraries and well just
compatible that way so again nineteen
unlike before when we were just using
Froyo let's move up the KitKat by the
way kind of ironic um
Christmas was three days ago and my
grandma got me a huge bag of Kit Kats so
you know what do you guys care about
that what am I even talking about
anyways so let's go ahead and choose
blank activity next and that's good
right there doesn't really matter what
you name it all right so our interface
is looking sweet let's go ahead and
change this app theme to anything else
let's do material material dark so I'll
switch it up a little bit
I forgot I named a trainee how did I
forget that it was like two seconds ago
gets me every time
okay one time all right so what I'm
going to do first is I'm going to delete
this text view because as you know I
hate it and I'm going to drag a button
here oh this one looks good so drag that
bad boy right there
and what this tutorial is going to do is
it's going to essentially arm add a
really basic animation to this button
transition whatever you want to call it
it's going to take this button and we're
going to move it in the bottom right
hand corner and I'll also grow it by a
little bit or enlarge it I guess you
might want to say and this is going to
happen whenever the user touches
anywhere on the screen so pretty basic
demonstration use your taps the screen
button moves to the bottom right corner
boom roasted so I know you guys are
thinking like okay shouldn't you give
these things ID so we can reference them
in the java code
oh you silly old English man yes
yes I should so the first thing I want
to do is give this relative layout which
is pretty much your entire screen and ID
because we're going to be tapping that
and we need to listen for tabs so ID by
the way this screen that's apt at these
jokes they keep getting worse alright so
anyways once I can let me just laugh at
my own joke and done all right so I'll
just name it Bucky's layout that was
good joke that's good Ness and forth is
button I am just gonna name this Bucky's
button should name is Bucky's buff but
that's a little bit immature if you ask
me so now we have a very basic interface
of layout and button and they both have
IDs and you know I'm not even going to
fix this because don't give AF about
this string resource you know I'm just
feeling like that today so now that we
got that take care of pop over to Java
code and let's start importing
everything we need the first thing is
you that motion of
and endpoint Android view dot view
import what did I do wrong I always
write in Pratt Android view dot view
group there yep you drew Oh import
Android widget and of course we need to
reference the relative layout alright so
now that all this nonsense is taken care
of let's go ahead and get to the good
stuff the first thing I want to do is I
want to get a reference to my entire
layout and it was named Bucky's layout
and this is of course because before we
can move the button what we want to do
is just wait and see whenever the user
taps the screen so therefore that's why
we need a of course we did this before
just a reference to this layout and once
we have that we can hop down to our
crates and below set content view let's
set up a listener so Bucky's layout set
this equal to view guru who all right so
V group find V by ID and let's go ahead
and find our layout our that died be
Bucky's layout so on this layout what
I'm going to do is I'm going to set on
touch a listener in new relative layouts
on touch listener and within here we
have to implement the method public the
lien on touch so this is essentially
going to wait to see whenever the user
taps that layout and whenever they do
it's going to call this method right in
here now within this method we're going
to be writing quite a bit of code it's
actually not quite a but it's like ten
lines maybe but the code is going to be
responsible for moving this button now
since this is already getting pretty
cluttered and it's like way indented
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
send this over to a new method called
new button or excuse me move button and
we're going to be making this right
below there but before we do make sure
to return true to let your app know that
okay we handled that touch event so now
just for the sake of cleaning everything
up let's go ahead and make that go down
a second aging my eye and now I'm
itching my nose okay now I'm done
all right so public void movie button
not me interesting
all right move on and of course to move
the button you probably need a reference
to the button so view Bucky's button and
set equal to vine view by ID
Arda ID dot Bucky's button so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to be breaking
this transition up into two steps the
first step is just positioning the
button we'll put it in the bottom right
corner now the second step is changing
the button size so it's going to move to
the bottom right and it's also going to
grow simultaneously so let me just add
some comments change the position of the
button and we're going to change the
size of the button after that now even
though we do it after it's all going to
appear to the user like it's happening
at the same time so in order to change
the position of the button what we're
actually going to do is we're going to
go to relative layout layout params and
position rules and this is actually
going to be a really long line of code
because you need to add this stupid
thing like all the time alright so new
relative layout layout params and inside
here relative layout layout params rep
content and let me just do this you
actually pass this in twice I'll explain
what it means in just a second
all right so just so you guys can see
what's going on so this right here is
pretty much the rules on how we want to
position items within that layout so the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to wrap everything up so it's
pretty much just a nice tight package
and now with that package the first
thing I want to do is I want to add a
rule to it what do you want to do well
relative layouts align parent bottom
relative layout yadda yadda true and by
the way this is going to make a lot more
sense if you just pretend like this
relative layout word is not there at all
so for example you're just wrapping the
content and you're aligning it on the
bottom so pretty much you're wrapping up
the button and sticking it on the bottom
now another thing I want to do is just
real quick edit to the right as well so
align parent right so all this code is
going to do again is it's going to take
the contents of the sleigh out and stick
it on the bottom right aka position the
button right here pretty simple but they
made us type this 600 times because they
thought it was funny so you know you got
us that time so after we make all those
rules what we have to do is we actually
take that button and set layout params
to position rules simple enough so the
only other thing I have to do after this
is change the size of the button now the
reason that we can't do it right here is
because these are the parameters for the
layout itself now what we actually need
to do for the button is put view group
layout params there I go and I'm just
going to name this size rules since this
was going to be responsible for changing
the size so for Bucky's bun there's
function called get layout params and
what this does is pretty much just gets
information about whatever you call it
on it's essentially returning
information about the button itself so
now one of the pieces of information is
of course the width so now we can access
it through size rows and set it equal to
set that you go to like a 450
I think that'll look pretty good and
also let's change the height so sizer
rolls height set this equal to one not
300 sounds good now of course just like
before you take Bucky's button set
layout params which pretty much mean use
these rules what rules do one use well
just the sized rules so essentially we
made some rules on how we should
position it set those rules made some
rules on the size of it and set those
ones as well so now let's go ahead and
Noah I forgot to Sir my stupid emulator
so let me pause this and start up
alright so here we have it let me go
ahead and tap the screen and our button
moves to the bottom right it grows and
hmm see that's weird see I thought what
was going to happen is we're going to
have a nice smooth animation instead of
it just instantly hopping from the top
left to the bottom right well lucky for
you to do this it takes like two seconds
so if you ever want to just use a simple
transition to either move it around or
change something instantly that's what
you do however making a nice smooth
animation it is probably the easiest
thing you ever learn so let me go ahead
and hide this and the first thing we
need to do is we need to import one more
thing
Android dots transition dot transition
manager and then after this what we want
to do is you want to scroll all the way
down to move button and we're going to
add one more line of code and that's
this transition manager which is the
package that we just imported begin
delayed transition and we're just going
to pass in Bucky's layout now this is
pretty much going to give us the default
transition and let me just run this real
quick now again what we can do is we can
add some more parameters to give us some
more control over our animation what
this is going to do is is essentially
going to take your layout and look at
the very first state of it which is the
default one that looks just like this
and the ending state which is going to
be the button in the bottom right and
it's going to just guess what transition
you want in other words it's going to
use the default animation of sliding the
button down and growing it however if
you ever want some more control over the
details of our animation then I'm going
to show you guys how to do that in the
next couple tutorials but for right now
on this default transition we'll be fine
so once this bad boy loads up let me
just click it right here and as you can
see it now slides down in the bottom
right instead of just hopping instantly
so there you go there is your very basic
tutorial on how to make transitions in
animations
again in the next tutorial what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
showing you guys how to have a little
bit more control over the specifics of
your animations so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
