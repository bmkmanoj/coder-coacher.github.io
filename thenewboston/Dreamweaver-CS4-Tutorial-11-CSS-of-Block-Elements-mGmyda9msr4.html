formatting tutorial this continues from
the last tutorial where we added these
classes to format our paragraph text as
you can see here so in this tutorial we
are going to inspect the block elements
of CSS so double-click on p1 text over
here in the CSS Styles panel and click
on block you can see we have the option
of words basing letter spacing vertical
line text align text indent wide space
and display in this tutorial we're going
to we're going to base the letters out a
little bit about six pixels and what
this is going to do it's going to space
each individual letter out by six pixels
now you see I applied that and it did
exactly that you can also align our text
I'm going to align it left and i'm going
to indent the first word of the
paragraph here i'm going to attend about
sixty pixels as you can see it intended
it sixty pixels
and that is how you can format the text
even more to make it look exactly how
you want it to look a lot of times you
can use you can use this technique to
spread out words across the page you can
see ok we have lorem ipsum we want to
spread that out a little more maybe put
it in the center so let's go back to our
definition and let's put that in the
center and let's face the letters out a
little more than say 1201 see that's
interesting let's see what this looks
like inside the browser there we go
that's what I want to see that way it
gives it a cleaner look and feel it
spaces out the words a little bit more
and that is it for this tutorial we
inspected the block elements in CSS and
continue watching and we'll dive a
little bit deeper inside CSS thanks for
watching and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
