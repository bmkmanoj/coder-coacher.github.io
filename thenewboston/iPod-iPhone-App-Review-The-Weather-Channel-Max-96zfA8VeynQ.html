welcome to another app review in this
app review is for the weather channel's
up and this is app that actually why
didn't find it myself but I i guess i
did find myself come to think of it and
it's pretty useful if you check your the
weather a lot and i work outside so i
checked the weather a whole lot so the
basics of it you go ahead and you enter
your location right here already entered
in mine so i'm going to pick search and
it's going to say alright that because
i'm already on a rally right here but
again you got all your different things
that you would on the weather channel's
website the current the hourly and this
is going to show you what the weather is
going to do hour by hour 36 hour which
is a good day in half and 10 name which
is i look at the most to say all right
lens are going to rain what they wish I
wear so another cool thing about this
app is that um explore map and this is
pretty much the radar or I guess it's
called the Doppler radar and so you can
scroll out by just squeezing your
fingers together just like that and this
is going to give you the location of
rain using google maps and so if a
fronts come in you can actually see it
and you know if you want to be a junior
weatherman yourself and not listen to
the 10-hour you can just diagnose this
situation yourself and they also give
you video that i don't really watch a
lot or any severe weather alerts and it
says are no active alerts for that
location so that's good there's no
hurricanes coming by here so I mean this
pretty much will give you everything
that weather com did but it's a lot
easier to use than just going to the
website and I mean it's pretty much made
for the ipod touch made to make things
simple and just a lot easier than going
to the website and plus you don't have
to go type in whether I'm you just click
one button so that's why I'm going to
give this game a I guess it's not a game
that's why I'm going to give this app a
7 out of 10 I would give it more but the
paid version they have a free version
what you should get probably and paid
version which is 399
and I got the paid version and I wish I
would have got the free version but
again I have to review the paid versions
for you to see what you guys are missing
so again a 7 out of 10 just because if
you really want to take the extra time
you can just go to the website or get
the free app but I like this one because
you got the map in all these other cool
features that you probably want to get
on everyone so that's that for this
review I hope you guys decide to whether
or not to buy it now so thank you guys
