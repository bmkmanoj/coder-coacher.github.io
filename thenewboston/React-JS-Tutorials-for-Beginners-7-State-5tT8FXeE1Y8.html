video I want to talk to you about state
now state is pretty much a way that you
can customize a component and if you
guys are thinking wait a minute we
already can do that with properties
there is one big difference between
properties and states of your component
and that is States they can change so I
know I didn't mention this whenever we
were talking about properties but
whenever you give your component a
custom property whenever you create it
it's set for life so for example say
that you have this button component and
you pass it into property to make the
background color green well that button
is going to be green for the rest of its
life now say that you want it to make a
button that could change colors every
time the user hovered over it well you
couldn't use properties for that because
properties their values can't change
whenever you have a value that needs
changing on your component you need to
use state it sounds confusing but it's
actually really easy you can customize
your component using properties or
States whenever something is going to
stay the same use properties whenever
changes you States all right fantastic
so let's go ahead and make one using
States so I'm just going to go ahead and
make um a component called checkbox
because you know whenever you have a
checkbox it can either be checked or
unchecked so what we're going to love
the user to do is click that and then
we'll have a bit of text that changes it
says hey you checked it hey you
unchecked it hey you checked it hey you
unchecked it so since that bit of text
is going to change that's why I decided
to use state instead of property so it's
going to name it check box and set it
equal to react great class alright so I
guess first of all we can just go ahead
and render out the basic um kind of
structure of it so again like I said
what I'm going to have is I'm going to
have a checkbox and then under it I'll
have that a bit of text that says Hays
check Hays unchecked so pretty much two
different pieces to it so for the
message which is pretty much just going
to be equal to checked or unchecked um
I'll just go ahead and do this
msg and now I need an if statement so
the way you access states are pretty
much the same as properties except
instead of crops you just use state so
this state and later on we'll make one
called it checked and we're going to say
that this can either be equal to true or
false and I'll show you guys how to
actually set that in just a second
so if it is checked then this message
we're just going to say equal to checked
and then we'll say else message is
unchecked all right so there is our
basic logic right here and before we go
further in creating this component and
actually rendering out on any HTML I
want to build another function right
here to show you guys how to set the
initial value of your states so there's
a built in function and it's called get
initial State so whenever you call this
function was it going to auto populate
for me
come on right just do it alright so this
is a function that you can use and its
job is to basically set up the initial
state of your component and this is
actually why it wasn't Auto populating
art so what this does is it returns an
object of your state's now we're only
going to have one state in here and that
is checked now you can set this equal to
true or false to start with it really
doesn't matter I'm just going to set
this equal to true because I feel like
it and essentially what I'm going to do
is I'm going to set it up where whenever
this is true and that means that the
user has a checkbox checked if it's
false then it means that they didn't
check it so it's good for like filling
out forms and stuff like that alright so
right now we have one state checked and
it's equal to true and if you want to
add another one called like bacon and
set it equal to 32 you can you can add
as many states as you want it doesn't
matter so now that we have a state
variable what we can do now is actually
return some HTML so
turn and this is going to be a multiple
line so only that's and all right so
again like I said we're going to have a
checkbox and then just some text below
it so since we're going to have multiple
elements we need to wrap them inside a
parent div now for your input the type
of this is going to be checkbox now how
should I set this up all right I'm just
going to make it really basic at first
just so we make sure that something is
displaying on the screen and then later
on I'll show you guys the cool stuff so
this is going to be the check box and
it's a valid checkbox right now now
beneath it I'll say a checkbox is and
then this will either say checked or
unchecked now in order to do that all we
need to do is we need to output this
variable which is MSG so msg boom
roasted there you go now to actually
render this I just throw it in my render
function and let me go ahead and refresh
this and check it out so right now it
says checkbox is checked now why does it
say that well because we didn't add any
logic really we just went ahead and we
rendered this component and the initial
state of checked is equal to true so
then whenever it rendered it said
alright if this is checked which it was
then the MSG which is the message set it
equal to checked so it says check box is
checked and again if this was false then
this would say check box is unchecked
just like that
so we got our state working properly but
now we have to actually add the brains
to make it work correctly so let me
change that back to true and what I'm
going to do after this is I'm going to
say all right you see how whenever we
load this page for the very first time
the default behavior of HTML and Chrome
is that have these check boxes unchecked
well we can actually overwrite that and
there's a built-in value called a
default checked so this is essentially
equal to true
true or false you can set it equal to
whenever whatever you want you can
actually just type it in but what we
want to set it equal to is the state of
this check box whether it's checked or
unchecked or true or false so how do we
do that
what we need to access that state
variable by this state check
so again if this is true then it's going
to say true right here and it's going to
be checked which it should be just like
that and if it was false then it would
be unchecked which is pretty much the
default behavior anyways but it might as
well have control over it so we got this
taken care of now we have one other bit
of logic to work out and that is we want
to say whenever the user clicks this
area right here then we want this
message to change alright so how do we
do that well we already learned in the
last video how to work with event
handlers now instead of on clicked which
you may think it would be called it's
actually unchanged and that gets called
whenever the user clicks this whether
they check it or uncheck it so I'm going
to write unchanged right here
whenever the user clicks that checkbox
what do we want to call well we're going
to have to build a function in just a
second but for right now we'll just say
handle checked and again we didn't build
this yet but we'll build it right now so
again whenever the user clicks this
we're going to call a function called
handle check now again that's equal to a
function separate it with a comma and
art so what do we want to do whenever
they check the checkbox well all we want
to do is we want to pretty much set the
state of the checked which is either
true or false we don't know we want to
set it equal to the opposite of what it
was before so I say that because if it's
checked and they clicked it then we want
to set it to false if it already is
false and they check it then we want to
set it equal to true so we pretty much
change it from whatever it is now a
really cool way that we can do that is
this whenever you want to change the
state of a component variable then
all you have to do is call this set
state now this takes an object and just
like this you can pretty much set it to
whatever you want so we can just go
ahead and set stay equal to false or
true or anything like that but instead
of just passing it in on a value we just
want to get the current value of checked
and make it the opposite so how do we do
this well we already know how to get
this state by using this this dot state
that check and in order to flip it or
give the opposite we just write X what
is the exclamation mark in front of it
basically the set the symbol above the
one all right so what this is going to
do again whenever we click this is it's
going to get the current state of the
check box is it checked or not is this
going to set the new state equal to the
opposite of it that's it so now let's go
ahead and refresh this and check it out
it now toggles unchecked and checked
unchecked and check boom-boom-boom-boom
now this is another important thing that
I want to point out you see right here
all we did is we set the state all right
but why does it automatically rerender I
mean usually in most programs you would
have to be like art so we're going to
change the state and then we need to
explicitly tell react all right now we
have to redraw this piece of the Dom
this piece of the webpage but the cool
thing about react in components is you
don't need to explicitly say whenever
your state changes to redraw a certain
part of your webpage it automatically
watches for your states and where they
can change and whenever your state
changes that part of the web page gets
redrawn automatically to fit that so all
we have to do is we worry about changing
States and all the rest of the hardware
gets taken care of for us so look at
this we now got a custom part of this
component that can change so by default
let's check
and whenever we uncheck it and check it
again it redraws or changes pretty sweet
huh so again this is some things up
state is a lot like property but
whenever use property you can't change
it
like we're doing right here so whenever
you just want to set a background color
or maybe throw someone's name in there
and it's going to be that for the entire
lifetime of the component then use
properties whenever you have part of
your component that changes in this
example of this bit of text right here
then you state boom roasted thanks for
watching I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
