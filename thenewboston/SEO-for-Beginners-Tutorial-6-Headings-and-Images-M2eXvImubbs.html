video I want to start out by talking to
you guys about headings
now headings are usually displayed right
above an article or a section of your
website and they indicate what that
section is about pretty much like a mini
title but I hate calling it the title
because this of course is the title of
your webpage so anyways the reason I
want to talk about these is because they
are an excellent place to stick your
keywords so just like a title don't just
stick them in there randomly make sure
they make sense in are actually readable
to humans and another thing I want to
point out is whenever Google or any bot
crawls your page they actually rank the
importance of your headings depending on
what headings they are and by that I
mean you know whenever you're developing
a web page then you have a bunch of
different headings h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 and
basically if you didn't add any extra
styling at all heading 1 those are the
biggest heading 2 they're slightly
smaller heading 3 they're a little bit
smaller so what people usually do
whenever they're just making a normal
web page you're not thinking about SEO
they add something like this alright so
here's my heading and you know what I
think that this is a little bit too big
so I'm actually going to change this to
heading 3 so now let me refresh that in
our a so that's the size I want guys if
you only have one or two headings do not
do this even though it's smaller and you
may want this heading to actually appear
smaller what Google sees as this is the
third most important heading so you may
not have a heading 1 or heading 2 but
your search engine results are going to
be all skewed so say that this is your
only heading so what we need to do is we
need to change it to a heading 1 so then
how do we make the Texas Pier smaller so
it actually looks good we'll just go to
your style sheet right heading 1 and
then you can overrate the default style
so you can say font size you know 13
pixels so may
the default is like 22 pixels or
something you can just change it to
however many you want
but again whenever you're making
headings right here make sure to use
heading 1 for your most important ones
and heading 2 for your second most
important ones like your subtitles so on
and so forth and another thing that you
definitely should not do is don't just
put your titles and divs or spans or
anything like that
re so we got heading taken care of and
let me what was this before heading to I
would change that to heading 2 because
this is actually my heading 1 and this
is just a demo page by the way it's I
just made a real quick for this tutorial
series another thing I want to point out
is the use of the alt tag so you know
before I said that search engines they
have a really difficult time of telling
what these images are that's actually
why CAPTCHAs work so good because
computers aren't very good at looking at
an image in saying what it is and the
reason for that is because computers are
really good at solving problems where
there's only one answer so give it a
math problem and it's going to solve it
faster than human you know a hundred
times out of 100 but give it an image of
a horse and a kid that's three years old
it's going to be a computer every time
the reason for that is that people are
really good at looking at a picture and
just saying what it is
computers can because how many different
pictures of a horse can you have you can
have a horse's head you can have a horse
eating hay you can have a
black-and-white picture of it there are
an infinite number of possibilities so
this freaks the computer out so what we
need to do for the search engine is we
need to say hey this picture right here
I know you are smart as a three-year-old
so we're going to help you out so what
one was that are is yep this one right
here all right so this is the image
right here and it just has some styling
and of course the source to this person
writing notes so that's all that um the
bot is going to see but what we need to
do is we need to add a special alt tag
so an alt tag stands for
alternative text and it's basically a
way that you can say hey this is what
the image is in this is actually the
text that displays if for whatever
reason your browser can't render this
picture or some people with disabilities
who have a hard time seeing then they
can actually have like pictures to voice
and it just helps that with what as well
but anyways this is basically a way that
you can tell the search engine what this
picture is so I'm just going to say
person writing notes and there you go
so if you know 99% of time people are
never going to see this but it just
helps your crawler and BOTS say okay
this is what the picture is this is what
the content on my web page is all about
so there you go headings and alt - all
of your images and yeah learn a little
bit more about SEO I'll see you guys in
