to your eighth computer networking
tutorial and in this video what I want
to do is I want to talk to you guys
about a client and a host because these
are some of the two most commonly used
terms in computer networking so it's
probably a good idea if we understand
what the heck they mean so in the last
video we talked about basically how your
computer looks at a website on the
Internet so basically what happens is
your PC will say it's what - say it's a
Mac for this example what it's going to
do is it's going to type in the browser
I don't know the new Boston in the new
boston server wow that's a up looking
server a server basically like I said is
a special computer that anyone can
access we'll say this is a web server so
anyone can access it what it's going to
do is it's going to be like a web server
do you have any of those web files that
I want to look at and the web server is
going to be like why indeed I do
Guvna and then it's going to go ahead
and send those files over and then your
browser
hopefully Chrome is going to interpret
that file and turn into a nice pretty
looking web page well in this
relationship we would call the PC the
client the PC or the Mac or the laptop
whatever your home computer is the
client and the web server is the host so
why do we call this a client and why do
we call this the host well you can
remember this because whenever a
computer your PC gets a file it's called
the client you remember this because
whenever a client goes into a business
the client is the one who's getting the
service the client gets the stuff and in
computer networking they get either a
file or data of some sort now the host
which is the web server that's the
computer that gives the data or gives
the file so it gives it away and you
remember this because maybe you're
hosting a party your house you're giving
away food to your guests you're giving
away crap so basically that's what a
client is the computer that gets
something and the host is the computer
that give
away so again whenever we're talking
about this in computer networking we
aren't talking about you know getting
food or you know getting business
services we're talking about getting
data so one last time just to recap
whenever you want to view a website on
your computer you type it in and you
request it from the web server or the
host and the host is basically going to
give the data to the client so the
client gets data or a website file from
the host wham bam thank you ma'am
boom roasted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
