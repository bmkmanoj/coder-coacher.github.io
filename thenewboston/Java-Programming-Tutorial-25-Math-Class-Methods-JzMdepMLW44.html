25th java tutorial and in this tutorial
we're going to be going over different
methods in the math class now let's see
if it's probably like tutorials ago when
I built a simple compound interest
calculator we use one of the methods
called power by using pal and this
allows us to use the power function but
or our excuse me methods they're called
in Java but in this one I'm going to be
teaching you about other useful methods
so the first thing we need to do is go
ahead and make a print line now on the
screen so print line and make it take an
empty parameter for now and in this
parameter I'm going to be putting all
the methods of the math class so go
ahead and type math I'll put your dot
separator and then the first one why say
first first one I want to teach you guys
about is called the absolute value and
that's abs and inside your parameter it
takes one number now what the absolute
value does is take any number negative
or not and give you the absolute value
of it so if you have 26.7 and you go
ahead and run this it would output
twenty six point seven this is pretty
much if you have a positive 26 it would
give you 26 if you have negative 26 it
give you 26 how much away from zero that
this is so that's what abs does absolute
value the next thing I want to teach you
about is seal and this stands for
sealing any number you give it it's
going to round it up so if you give it a
7.4 when you run it it's going to round
it to eight so even if it is really
supposed to round down the seven when
you use seal it always rounds it up now
since it has seal there's always
something called floor again this takes
a number say you have seven point eight
it always rounds it down so again seal
always rounds up the number floor always
rounds down the number so your floor if
you have seven point eight is going to
be seven now that we learn absolute
value seal and floor let me teach you
about something outs
max now this is the first one we're in
the less three we learned how to make a
method that takes only one parameter but
max is the first one that takes multiple
parameters in the single method so what
max does is you give two numbers and it
gives you the maximum of those numbers
so say I have two parameters 8.6 and
separate them with a comma in 5.2
whenever you run this it gives you 8.6
because that's the maximum of the two
numbers so that's how you can get two
numbers and find the maximum of those
and again whenever you have a method
like that you also have the opposite and
this one is called men what min does is
take the lesser of the two numbers so
let's run this and the lesser of eight
point six and five point two is five
point two right down there so now we
learn absolute value steel floor max min
again our power function which takes
power and say you want something like
five to the third power you would use
five for your first argument and three
for your next one again when you run
this this was the same one we used in
our compound interest calculator it gets
125 since 5 times 5 times 5 is 125 and
the last built-in method I want to teach
about in the math class is something
called square root and sq RT that's what
stands for L only takes one parameter
such as nine and it finds the square
root of that number so when you run this
in the square root of nine is three
outputs three so that's how you use um
your built-in methods from your math
class again you want to notice that you
don't need to create an object like you
do when you're making your own classes
this is built-in so that's how you use
math with your dot separator and then
the method name and then put however
many arguments takes I just showed you
guys let's see absolute value zero for
max min pow square root I just showed
you guys the seven
probably most common ones and those are
the ones we're going to be working with
from now on so I just want to show you
guys what those do because we're going
to be using them and I don't want you
guys to get lost so play around to those
throw them in your built-in methods and
you can make some pretty cool stuff of
those so for now I just want to show you
guys that so thank you guys for watching
make sure to subscribe in my channel and
I will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
