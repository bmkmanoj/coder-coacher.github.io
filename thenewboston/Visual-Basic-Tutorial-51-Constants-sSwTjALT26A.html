slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at constants now basically
what a constant is is it's a variable
that you can use in your program or
throughout a class that the value cannot
be changed at runtime so let's say you
want to have pi that's already built
into the visual basic math class but if
you want to go ahead and do it yourself
for some strange reason you can declare
that as constant so you won't
accidentally change the value of pi
throughout the running of your program
or so somebody else is isn't able to
change the value of pi so let's go ahead
and create a little demo for this we'll
go ahead and select new project select
windows forms application and we'll go
ahead and call it constants we'll wait
for that to load now let's come over
here and open up our toolbox and we'll
add three buttons button one button two
and button three it means to do that
so let's just go ahead and shrink this
down and we will leave the name value
the same because it's not that important
in this tutorial so let's go ahead and
go into our code and we will create a
constant variable so we'll start off by
using the keyword private so it can only
be access in this class and then we're
going to type co and st which is short
for a constant and it says declares and
defines one or more constants so we can
type private constant and usually when
you're declaring a constant in other
languages you would use all caps and
underscores for spaces so we'll just
type quarter value as double and we'll
set that equal to 0.25
now if we go ahead and go into our form
1vb to this design
double-click on button one button two
and button three we can go ahead and
type message box dot show and then we'll
type our variable in there which is
quarter value and we can do that three
times and you can see that if we run
this quarter value is always the same so
0.25 0.25 and 0.25 now there's no way
for us to change this in the program so
if we type quarter value equals 0.5
we're going to get an error because
constants cannot change anywhere in the
program they have to be you have to set
the value when you're when you declare
them and after that you cannot do it so
we'll go ahead and run this one more
time and you can see it's 0.25 every
time now let's go ahead and close out of
this and later on when we are working
with data other data types such as
objects of classes that we make
ourselves you can also make a constant
enumeration or a constant property or
something like that so that it cannot be
changed and constant is very useful when
you want to protect a value from being
changed so this is a very simple concept
and you probably won't have to do any
practice on this and if the new tutorial
isn't out then just go ahead and wait
for that and if not move on to the next
tutorial and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
