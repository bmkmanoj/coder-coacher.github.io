tutorial and in this video what I'm
going to be doing is I'm going to be
showing you guys the very basics of how
to get up and started creating your very
first git project now before we start
you know adding a bunch of files or
doing anything like that we need to fill
out our username and our email and it's
basically gets way of creating an
account so the reason that we need to do
this is because whenever you're working
on a git project with a bunch of people
you're all going to be making changes to
the core project for example if you're
all building a website you're going to
have a programmer a web developer you
know maybe a graphic artist all making
changes to the same project so it's
easier to sort things out and see who
did what and that's why everyone needs
their own account so what do we need to
do in order to make an account well we
need to input our name and tell get our
email so let's go ahead and add our name
first and this is how you do it I'm in
bash I just opened this and put git
config now config is basically going to
change the configuration file and there
is also another way to do this but this
is the easiest way so we're basically
saying we're going to configure some
settings and in this case our name - -
global now this is the only part that
may confuse you global pretty much means
the settings for this user now whenever
you think global you may think the
entire project and it is a kind of bad
naming convention because in this case
global just means this user so I don't
know you have to yell it get for that
not me so get config - - global now to
change our name put user dot name and
add a space in between quotation marks
just put your name and mine is Bucky
Roberts so again get
Figg global username this pretty much
means configure my settings change my
username to Bucky Roberts hit enter and
my name is now Bucky Roberts now I said
the only other thing we need to do is we
need to change our email so this is
going to look really familiar
get config global user dot email and my
email is Bucky at pornhub gov so you
know of course I'm using a fake email
here because I don't want everyone
spamming my inbox by hit enter and now
my email is Bucky at pornhub gov now if
you want to go ahead and make sure that
your settings is oh I've got a friggin
turd in my throat you're setting saved
and everything is good to go
put git config - - list and hit enter
and this is pretty much going to list
all of your settings so we did not
change any of these yet so don't worry
but at the bottom you see the username
equals Bucky Roberts and the user email
equals Bucky at pornhub gov and by the
way you see how I you know I'm getting
kind of a lot of things on the screen
here if you ever want to just erase
everything
not like undo what you just did but
pretty much it's clear the screen just
type clear and hit enter and all those
settings are saved this pretty much is a
deletes all the text and give you a nice
clean screen now I showed you guys how
to get config - - list and this lists
all of the settings but if you only want
to view one then you can do something
like this get config user dot email and
hit enter and that pops up just that
user email so that's how you look at all
the settings and also how to view one
setting so you know pretty simple so far
we now have an account created we now
can pretty much start a project
now actually before I uh before you guys
watch the next tutorial in learn how to
actually create a folder install a
starter project and all that good stuff
I want to mention this
even though hopefully you guys are going
to keep watching these tutorials and
learning for me if you ever come across
something that you don't quite
understand if you type get help Candace
and Zach you know I want to get help in
hit enter it's going to give you this
big help menu and these are all the
topics that if you type one of those in
you can get more information on so let's
say that uh you want to do this you want
to learn more about this commit little
commander right here so what you can do
is you can type get help
commit and hit enter and it says
launching default browser to display
HTML and even though you guys didn't see
it let me make this my computer just
popped up this little page right here
and what it did is it open the commit
help page so you can learn about commit
and depending on what default browser
you have - Chrome
hopefully yours is - then it'll pop up
the Help section for whatever you type
so again that's get help and if you want
help on a specific topic get help in the
name of that topic alright ladies so we
figured out how to change our username
we figured out how to change our email
we are now good to go so in the next
video we're going to be starting our
very first project it's going to be
awesome so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
