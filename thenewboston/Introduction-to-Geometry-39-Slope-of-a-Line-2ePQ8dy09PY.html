slope of a line is equal to the ratio of
rise over run so if I have this line
right here and this is point one and
this is point two how high does it go
and then how far over does it go and a
mathematical formula for this is y2
minus y1 looks that will give you the
distance traveled upwards over x2 minus
x1 which will give you the distance
traveled over so for example if this
coordinate was 0 1 and this was 34 we
would take y2 which is 4 minus y1 which
is one over x2 minus x1 so we'd get 4
minus 33 and then 3-0 3 so that has a
slope of 1 and we always write slope
with a M so M of this line equals 1 so
there are four types of slopes you can
have a positive slope which means that
your line is increasing you can have a
negative slope which is decreasing you
can have a slope who equals zero which
means that which is a horizontal line
it's always a horizontal line because
this line right here this point right
here has a different xvalue but it has
the same y value so if you were to put
that in the formula you'd get why oh I'm
sorry it has
same y value because they're on the same
place on a graph so if you had if you're
going to put this in the formula you'd
get y1 minus y1 which would give you
zero over whatever this equals so you
get 0 over a number so you have a slope
of zero if you have a vertical line it's
called it has an undefined slope because
if you think about it this point is x1
y1 and this point would have the same x
value but a different y value so if you
were to plug it in the formula you'd get
y2 minus y1 over X 1 minus X 1 so you
get a zero on the bottom and some number
on top and you cannot divide a number by
zero you can't take a number and divide
it by nothing because that mean like you
just you just can't do it so whenever we
get a number / 0 it is an undefined
slope so now we're going to do some
examples find the slope of each line so
we're going to do the two easiest ones
first first this horizontal line this is
line one line to line three and line for
so the slope of line 1 equals well this
has it's a horizontal line so that means
that it has a zero slope because it's
not moving up any it's staying constant
across the board so this slope of line
two we have two points right here and
there's two different ways you can do it
you could literally count and say I go
up one
and over 2 and you'd find you have a
slope of one half but just to be safe
we're going to plug it into the formula
so I have two points right here and if
you look on the graph you can figure out
what they are this point right here is
to negative 2 and this point right here
is 0 negative 1 2 3 negative 3 so if i
plug this into the formula i get y 1
negative 2 minus y 2 negative 3 over x 1
minus or sorry x 2 minus x 1 and
negative 2 minus a negative is the same
thing as adding a positive so negative 2
plus 3 is 1 over 2 minus 0 is 2 so
either way you get one half so the slope
of line 3 equals lime three is right
here and it's a vertical line so right
away you should think it's an undefined
slope there's no other way to write that
all you do is a line 3 is undefined so
we have another one line fourth so the
slope of line four so we're going to do
both ways again we could say we go from
this point we go up to and left one so
that we have positive 2 over negative 1
which would give you negative 1 or you
could plug plug it into the formula so
this point here is point2 to this point
here is 110 sorry negative 1 negative 2
so y minus
y 1 over X minus X 1 so 1 minus 2 is
negative 1 over negative 1 plus positive
2 which gives me positive one and if you
divide a negative by a positive you get
another negative so the slope of that
line is negative 1 so now we're going to
talk about limes that have special kinds
of slopes so the slope of a parallel and
perpendicular lines parallel lines have
equal slopes so the M of line one would
equal the M of line two perpendicular
lines have opposite reciprocal slopes so
if this if the slope of line 1 equals M
&amp;amp; lion one is perpendicular to line two
I'm going to take the opposite of em
which opposite is another word for
opposite means take the opposite sign so
if this is positive m for line to i
want- m and then I want the reciprocal
of em and the olin and the reciprocal is
just 1 over m so the slope of a
perpendicular line is negative 1 over m
if M is your slope i know that's a
little confusing so we're going to do
some examples so we want a line parallel
to align with a positive rise of two and
a run of negative three so our formula
is rise over run so I have a positive
rise of to positive 2 and a run of
negative 3 so if we want to line
parallel to this line we want it to have
a slope of negative two-thirds so line
perpendicular to a line whose slope is
for so line 1 the slope of line 1 equals
4 so to find the slope of line 2 i'm
going to take first the opposite so i'm
going to so since this is positive i'm
going to make it negative and then I
want the reciprocal of it so the
reciprocal full of 4 is 1 over 4 so the
slope of line two would equal negative 1
over 4 and that's all we're gonna do
with slope today but this is gonna help
us when we do the equation of line of a
line in a couple videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
