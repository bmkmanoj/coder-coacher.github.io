this video I'm going to be covering
shapes and graphics and I'm only going
to be touching on it a little bit
because I eventually want to get into
like showing you guys how to put images
and icons on pretty much your gooeys but
for now I'll show you guys how to make
some simple shapes because it does come
in handy a lot especially whenever
you're trying to make graphs and
anything like that so the first thing we
need kind of like in real life is
something to draw on now just like if
you're painting in art class what we use
is a canvas and this is actually going
to be pretty familiar if you ever worked
with the html5 canvas but it's basically
a blank white area and you're allowed to
draw Anna aka make shapes on it so you
can't just make a shape in the normal
frame or a normal window you actually
need this canvas to draw on so just
remember that so make an object named
and set it equal to canvas now the
parameters of this are of course where
is it going well first of all it's going
in your main window of course and it
also needs to know how big am I supposed
to make this canvas well let's just go
ahead and give a width of 200 pixels but
you just write too much you're not
pixels and give it a height of 100 so
now if you just run this right now
actually let me pack it in there first
so canvas pack and actually just run it
for you we can see that it kind of just
looks like blank but there is indeed a
canvas there and it is 200 wide by 100
tall and this thing we can create shapes
on don't believe me well I will prove it
to you right now so I'll just show you
guys how to make some really simple
stuff first so I'll make a couple lines
so by default all your shapes and all
your lines are going to be black so
whenever I create um a line and I want
to be black I don't need to specify
color black fill black anything like
that so the first thing you do is say
okay
you're going to draw shape what are you
drawing it on well we only have one
canvas right here so it's pretty easy to
say this is what we're drawing on then
use the dot separator and now you can
call a function on it so what we want to
do is you can see pretty much all of
them that pop up what kind of thing you
want to create do you want to create um
like an oval a line well for now we're
just create a basic line now of course
whenever you're creating a line all you
need is it's actually four parameters
but it's really to two points a
beginning point in an ending point now
of course each point is made up of an x
and a y-coordinate so by default or just
to start things out I'll start it is
zero zero now of course it starts from
the top left so zero zero means in the
top left corner 0 in the X Direction
zero in the Y direction so the first two
is your x and y of your starting point
so the next two numbers you put in
I'll just put 250 what this is are your
ending point
so go 200 over and 50 down in other
words 200 in the x-direction and 50 in
the y-direction and that's where I want
you to end so for a line you just need
to give a starting point ending point
and you know not all the points in
between because what's the point of that
get it point and don't worry about it
all right so now let's go ahead and
create one more I'll make a red one and
then after this you guys would be like
pros and Magilla line alright so canvas
great line let's start this one let's
see how big is our so our little canvas
is a hundred tall so I'll start this one
in the bottom left so of course that one
would be zero because it's zero in the
x-direction still and 100 so that's
going to start at the bottom left zero
or over which is the same as place than
100 down so actually put this on
might as well like ended in the same
spot so whenever you do that then
they're going to start in different
places but they're going to be touching
at the end so that's how you do that
little maneuver and also another thing I
want to do is even though that this is
just the line and this may seem kind of
confusing if you ever work with
Photoshop because you don't need a fill
you just like need a stroke well
everything in kinter has a fill even
lines even though it bug doesn't get
filled with anything because it's one
pixel but if you set this equal to red
pretty much means hey make my line red
simple enough so now we got a black line
and the red line actually and run this
right now and show you guys of course
this one starts at 0 0 goes to 250 this
one starts at 0 100 it goes to 250 of
course so now we know how to make basic
lines what does this look like nothing
alright so might as well show you guys
how to make a real simple shape now
because it's a little bit different all
right so I'll make a green box so I'm
going to name it green box why the heck
not and just like before say where do
you want to draw it and also what do you
want to do well we want to create a
rectangle so there we go that's a
function name great underscore rectangle
now the parameters for this are kind of
I don't want to say confusing but
they're not very intuitive the first
parameter is you need to give it a point
now the point you give it is the top
left of the rectangle so basically it's
asking where do you want the top left of
the rectangle to be well just so it
isn't butting up right against the
corner let's move it in a little bit
25:25 so this means go over 25 go down
25 and that's where the top left is
going to be now the next two parameters
are the width in the height of the
rectangle so I'm going to say like 130
and
I don't know don't want to go go 60
she'll go over 25 down 25 and from that
point make a rectangle that's 130 pixels
by 60 pixels tall and of course what we
can do is just fill this - what color
was it green so all this does if you run
it as you can see it goes over 25 down
25 and then it makes a rectangle 130 by
60 simple enough so just by looking at
this it's kind of confusing but once we
understand it we're good to go now for
this tutorial we drew all the stuff that
I wanted to demonstrate you know just
real simple stuff if you want to figure
out how to make ovals and stuff like
that it's really easy just to learn but
eventually whenever you're making these
applications you're going to want to
delete these graphics and I just don't
mean arm delete them by closing out your
window sometimes you're going to want
your window interactive to change so
you're going to want to hide and show
these graphics so whenever you want to
delete something what you do is you call
the delete function now inside here what
you can do is you can pass it a
parameter of whatever object you want to
delete so we'll say that we want to
delete that red line so let's run this
so what this is going to do hold on like
a random hair tickling my ear let's just
a bit of hair so what this is going to
do in the blink of my eye is draw this
black line and draw the red line and
then draw the green box and then it's
going to delete the red line so of
course in this example it's kind of
stupid because we might as well not even
drawn the red line but eventually um
you're going to have a application where
like the user makes a graph and maybe
it's like showing stock prices and then
the red line might be like Microsoft
Mike okay hide this so they click a
button and then it will delete so of
course you never want to do it on just
like this because it's kind of a waste
of time but
you would have you have like a bun that
has the delete functionality that's an
example and another cool thing is this
whenever you want to delete all of the
graphics on your canvas what you can do
instead of having a line for red line
black line and green box you can just
pass in all now of course what this is
going to do is as you guess take
whatever is on this canvas whatever you
drew and just wipe it all clean so
that's going to save you guys a bunch of
time and with those basic arm functions
you guys have a pretty good
understanding of the canvas I'm probably
going to be teaching guys a few more
complex things that you can do with
graphics on it but for now thank you
guys for watching of course all of the
source codes can be on my forum I I'm
gonna go I don't know I don't know I'm
going to do probably go eat some bacon
or maybe go eat a donut or something
irrelevant I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
