our new algebra series we're going to
talk about multiplying and dividing real
numbers for the first thing you need to
know is that multiplication and division
or what's called inverse functions that
means to undo multiplication you divide
and to undo division you multiply so
when we have a positive number times
another positive number we're always
going to get a positive number so when
we have 4 times 6 we're going to get
positive 24 when you have a positive
number times a negative number you're
always going to get a negative number
because if you take a negative number
and multiply it a positive amount of
times you're still going to have a
negative amount of something so for this
negative 4 times 6 gives you negative 24
now this works if it's a negative times
a positive number so 4 was positive and
6 was negative it would still give you
negative 24 and if we have a negative
number times a negative number we're
going to get a positive number so if you
think 2 of the same sign positive
positive or negative negative is always
going to give you a positive it's only
when you have two opposite signs
positive and negative are you ever going
to get a negative answer so negative 4
times negative 6 would be positive 24 so
now we're going to do some multiplying
with numbers and we're going to work on
how you multiply fractions so for this
we're going to take a
negative times a positive so negative 10
times 3 gives us negative 30 then we're
going to take negative 30 and multiply
it by negative 4 so since we have two of
the same sign we're going to get a
positive number so this becomes positive
120 now multiplication has a property
which is called communitive now because
multiplication is commutative that means
you can multiply numbers in edit any
order you want and you'll still get the
same thing because if I had taken 3
times negative 4 I would have got
negative 12 and then negative 12 times
negative 10 would still give me positive
120 I can take these numbers and write
them however I want and I'll still get
the same number when I'm multiplying
okay so right here we have 3 ace
multiplied by 5 6 so when we multiply
fractions what we're going to do is we
multiply across the top and across the
bottom so on the top we have 3 times 5
and then over 8 times 6 so 3 times 5 is
15 8 times 6 is 48 so our answer is
plotted positive 15 48 now here we have
what's called an improper fraction or
excuse me we have fractions written
properly but in order to multiply them
we have to write them as an improper
fraction so what we do is we're going to
take 6 and write it as something over 2
so we're going to take 6 and multiply it
by 2 which is 12 and then we have 1 up
here so we add 1 so our new fraction is
going to be 13 halves we're going to do
the same thing here we're going to take
4 multiply it by 3 get 12 plus 1
gives us 13 so this is times 13 thirds
so now what we're going to do is the
same thing we're going to multiply a top
across and atop the bottom so we have 13
times 13 over 2 times 6 and when we do
that we get a hundred and 69 over 2
times 3 which is 6 ok so for our last
example we have negative 2/3 x 4 now the
any number divided by 1 is going to stay
the same number so when we multiply
these fractions we're going to write 4
as 4 over 1
that way we can multiply across the top
and bottom so this becomes and since we
have opposite signs multiplying we know
it's going to be negative and we're
going to have 2 times 4 which is 8 over
3 times 1 which is 3 now it you can
write this fraction as negative 8 over 3
or 8 over negative 3 it doesn't matter
or you could just write it out front as
negative 8/3 it doesn't matter because
either way you do it you're going to end
up with a negative number so now we're
going to move on to division and the
same rules apply when you have a
positive divided by a positive you're
going to get a positive so 50 divided by
2 is going to get you 25 positive
divided by a negative or a negative
divided by a positive is going to get
you a negative so 50 divided by negative
2 is going to be negative 25 a negative
divided negative and you're going to get
a positive so negative 50 divided by
negative 2 is going to get you positive
25
five so now we're going to do some
practice with this now when we divide
real numbers what we do is we are going
to write this as a fraction with this
which is the number this is the divisor
what we're dividing by and then we're
going to write it to get our dividend
which is what we get after we divide so
we're going to get negative 24 and when
and when we show division we write it as
over 3 and then we reduce so three goes
into negative 24 eight times so we get
negative eight as our answer when we
divide fractions it's a little different
we use this rule which is called keep
change flip so first you keep the first
term exactly how it is
so negative 1/2 then you change your
sign to multiplication and then you flip
your fraction so that we get 8/3 and
then you multiply across the top and
across the bottom like you would with
multiplication so then we would get
negative eight over six and we always
want to reduce our fractions so both of
these two goes into evenly so we'd get
negative three over two but there's also
this little trick what you can do is
before you multiply you can reduce and
you reduce diagonally so 2 goes into 8
how many times well 2 goes into 2 once 2
goes into 8 3 times and if you were to
multiply that across you would get
oh excuse me I made a mistake right here
sorry 2 goes into 8 4 times and I made
this mistake over here negative 4 and
then third says what you should have
gotten okay so when we have a decimal
sometimes it's always sometimes as easy
as to write it as a fraction so we're
going to take 12 and we're going to
multiply it by 0.5 which is the same as
1/2 because we used our keep change flip
rule our keep change and I forgot to
flip this because this is 1/2 so we flip
it and get 2 so 12 divided by 0.5 is 24
so we're going to do the same thing over
here and we're going to write them as
two fractions so this is 1/2 divided by
1/10 and then you're going to keep
change flip if you multiply across in
top get 10 over 2 which reduces to 5 now
that's all we're going to do with
multiplication and division but make
sure you come back and watch your video
where we talk about order of operations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
