3d studio max tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
hide freeze objects and also how to work
with layers so I started a new right
here so let's go ahead and create
something like two boxes and put those
over here and we will create a no great
to fears over here and I just go ahead
and move those up go ahead and move
those up above the plane just cuz oh
there's no really reason to just do it
and now let's go ahead and get started
with the tutorial so you can go ahead
and hide and freeze objects now when you
freeze in objects or freeze an object it
prevents it from moving or being
selected but it's still rendered out and
when you hide it an object it hides it
from view and also it's not rendered so
if you're wondering all right how do I
do this in order to hide or freeze an
object go to tools and go ahead and go
to display floater and now this brings
up your very much hide and freeze panel
so now if you go ahead and click an
object like I said you can go ahead and
freeze it under this section and put
freeze selected and as you can see
anything that's frozen it turns grey so
you can take this one and freeze it too
so free selected and now you can see
like I said anytime it's frozen you
can't move it with the mouse so let me
try a head let me go ahead and try to
select this can't select it can't select
either on these can't move them I can
select these but I can't select these so
let's go ahead and unfreeze all so we
can unfreeze everything and now let me
show you what hiding it does so go ahead
and click an object and go ahead hide
selected and what that does is not only
hide it from view but also whenever you
render out that object will not render
so you can hide a bunch of objects hide
selected and then whenever you want to
have them pop up again just go ahead and
press unhide all and then unhide all of
them if you couldn't guess it's pretty
easy but that's pretty much how you hide
and freeze objects
so that's all you need to know for that
pretty much the other thing I want to
show you is about layers now in order to
work with layers you need this little
layer toolbar right here and if you
don't have it already then what you need
to do is go to customize show UI and
show floating toolbars then the layers
toolbar will pop up and you can dock it
in your main toolbar up here so I'm not
going to click it or a bunch of toolbars
are going to pop up but you do you do
that and get all your layers I'll wait
for you
do you do it yet to do it alright good
to go so now you should have this
toolbar that popped up along with 80
other toolbars and I'll show you guys
how to create new layers and also you'll
see why new layers are useful so at
default everything is in your default
layer all four objects we created Bam
Bam Bam Bam but say we want to separate
these objects and the layers from
squares or cubes to spheres so what we
need to do is go click create new layer
which is the three pieces of paper with
a lift up through the tzus star on it
and then we got a new layer and we'll
name eyeballs can name of spheres
because spheres isn't funny at all got
name of balls go ahead and click okay
now go ahead and select an object and
you need to hit this add selection to
current layer then go ahead and select
this and click Add selection to current
layer so now we've got these two balls
in our layer so let's go ahead and
create another layer for the cubes
create a new layer and create cubes
press ok and do the same thing add this
to the layer and add this to the layer
now if you're wondering all right pretty
much how can we see all these layers
well I'm just going to show you enough
talking go ahead and click on manage
layers and now you can see that you have
a default layer with no objects in it
and you have if you click this little
plus sign next to balls you have sphere
0 1 and next 2 cubes
somehow I got sphere 0 2 in there just
go ahead and cut that and paste it in
here so we got our two spheres in balls
and our two boxes in
cubes so this is pretty much how you can
work with the layers easier if you say
alright what's the point of layers just
four aside from giving me its store on
them
well if you go ahead and collapse those
again what you can do instead of hiding
or freezing individual objects you can
now hide and freeze entire layers so
look at that if you want to freeze all
of your cubes go ahead and freeze cubes
if you want to hide all of your balls go
ahead and hide both your balls and this
is just an easy way that you can work
with a group of layers so say for
example you have huge a huge animation
with a portion of things that you don't
want to UM accidentally mess up just put
them all in the layer and freeze them
and then you can't move them around no
matter what so in order to delete a
layer you need to meet two creative
criteria first of all no matter what
I'll show you first first of all it
needs to be empty so go ahead and cut
the objects out of that and paste it in
default and as you can see this cubes
layer is empty right now but if we go
ahead and try to put delete highlighted
empty layers we can that's because
there's a checkbox right here go ahead
and check another layer and then you can
delete it so you can't delete any layer
that has a checkbox in on it
or if it has something in it so again if
you want to delete this layer balls
you just can't highlight balls and press
the X you have to cut everything out of
it paste the end of somewhere else cut
paste because you know it has to go
somewhere
it just can't you just can't delete a
layer in all your objects can delete and
then make sure it's not checked
highlight it and then go ahead and press
the delete highlighted empty layers
button and no delete highlighted empty
layers pretty simple so that's your
pretty much let me think if there's
anything I forgot I've already covered
that pretty much so yeah that's it
that's it for this tutorial you finally
made it through I know it was tough but
I thank you guys for watching if there's
anything I forgot I'll just put them in
the next tutorial but I think I covered
everything all the basics at least so
again thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I will see you
next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
