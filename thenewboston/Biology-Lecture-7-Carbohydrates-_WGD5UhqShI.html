to your seventh biology tutorial and in
this video I want to talk to you guys
about carbohydrates but before I get in
that I want to go ahead and mention a
few things about carbon because believe
it or not they kind of tie in together
really closely and I guess before I even
start talking about the educational
stuff I just want to say I apologize if
I sound kind of nasally right now but
unfortunately I'm allergic to just about
everything on earth so uh you know if I
sound kind of weird you know sorry but
you'll get over it
so basically your body absolutely loves
carbon and this is supposed to be a
heart right here I know it kind of looks
kind of weird like a loaf of bread or
kidney bean but this is supposed to be
hard and that means that your body loves
carbon why is that well your body uses
carbon and it turns into a bunch of
different stuff that you need to live
like carbohydrates and proteins and
nucleic acids and lipids and actually
what I want to do is I want to make a
separate video for each one of those
things because each of those compounds
is incredibly poor important in your
body so they deserve their own video but
for right now we're just going to be
talking about carbohydrates and if
you're wondering you know what where do
I even get carbon from if I love it so
much and I need it well you actually get
carbon from food there's a bunch of
carbon and food and whenever you eat it
your body you know breaks apart uses the
carbon for you know turns into a bunch
of different stuff plants however they
don't eat food they make their own food
but we'll talk about more of those
differences later on for now just
remember that your body loves carbon and
it turns carbon into different things
that your body needs
starting with carbohydrates so let's go
ahead and talk about that see a rb/o
shrine' carbohydrates so carpa
carbohydrate kind of a tongue-twister is
compound that consists of carbon
hydrogen and oxygen now the typical
formula for this is ch2
Oh which basically means that you have
one carbon two hydrogen's and one oxygen
however this formula can be multiplied
and by multiplying that carbohydrates
usually have the ratio one to one but
you can have something like c6 h-12 o-6
so even though um their formula is
technically different the ratio is the
same one to two to one six to twelve to
six it's basically all the same thing so
now that we know what carbohydrates kind
of you know the chemical formula at
least your honor
why the heck does your body even need
carbohydrates because you know what
Bucky I read the Atkins diet and he said
that carbohydrates are bad and make you
fat well that is true if you have a
tonne of carbohydrates in your body but
your body needs at least a few
carbohydrates just the function to do
what kind of stuff well living things
including your body they actually break
down carbohydrates for energy and your
body you know uses a bunch of different
things for energy but the reason that
loves cover hydrates so much is because
it can get really it can get energy from
them really quickly now the only
downfall of this is the energy from
carbohydrates it doesn't last very long
and that's why your body needs to eat
every few hours to get those carbs it
burns them off so it can get a quick
source of energy but the energy doesn't
last that long so that's why your body
needs to store energy and other things
other than carbohydrates but we're going
to be talking about that later now just
some random information just because
this is bugging me right here this I
said is the basic formula for a
carbohydrate a ratio of one carbon the
two hydrogen and one oxygen
however this right here is actually a
special carbohydrate called glucose it's
actually a sugar and sugars are
carbohydrates believe it or not
fun fact gonna be talking about that
later but for right now you know I just
wanted to give you guys that little
random bit of information because this
was bugging me right down there for this
tutorial all you have to remember is
that
the formula for carbohydrate is
typically with the ratio one carbon to
hydrogen one oxygen and your body needs
carbohydrates because they can break
them down and use them for a quick
source of energy however the energy from
carbohydrates doesn't last very long and
therefore your body needs to store
energy in other things and we're going
to be talking about that later on so for
now thank you guys for watching and we
can subscribe and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
