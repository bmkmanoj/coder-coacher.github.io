tutorial that I'm creating for London
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use constructors
so all you're going to need first
tutorial is a button and the class we
created in the last tutorial if you
don't have this class anymore just go
back and watch the last tutorial and
create again so usually when you're
dealing with your classes you're going
to be creating a new instance of them
and I know you don't know how to do this
yet or what it does but trust me you're
going to use this a lot so to create a
new instance of your class you're first
going to type the name of the class so
we're just going to use my class as an
example and I call them my class so just
type the name of a class be you call
yours and following that you're going to
want to type the name that you want to
call this instance of your class I'm
just going to call it MC and then you're
going to want to set equal to a new
instance of your class and then you want
to have two parentheses after it
so when um when you create a new
instance of your class the compiler
looks for a constructor and if you do
not have a constructor inside of your
class it will just create a default one
and the default one doesn't do much it
doesn't pass any parameters and all it
does is it just sets the default value
for all variables inside of your class
like if you had a string you know just
set equal to null so yeah it doesn't
really do anything special so in order
to create your own custom constructor um
just type the just type ctor
and then just hit tab twice and it will
auto create a constructor for you and we
can tell this is a constructor because
it's public and I know you don't know
what public means yet but trust me it
has to be public and it doesn't have a
return type like it doesn't have like
employed or a string or something like
that and then state it's the same name
as your class and this is a method so
basically when you create a new instance
of your class it's calling this method
my class and it's just doing everything
inside of here so
say you want to pass a string parameter
into your class in order to do that it's
very simple just type whatever you want
to pass into your class into these
parentheses right here so I'm going to
call it I'm just trying to pass a string
parameter and have it pass a name so now
when we go back here we get an error
that says my club my name is face stop
my class does not contain a constructor
that taking zero arguments and that's
true we only have one constructor right
here and we'll get into more
constructors later but we only have one
constructor right now and it pet in it
calls for a string parameter so we need
to pass a string parameter in there so
I'm smart ass Adam all right so now that
we have passed adam here we can now use
this string name inside of this method
right here and in order to use it in the
rest of the class this is what you're
usually going to want to do you're just
going to create a string up here and
just call it anything else I'll call it
name little capital at end and then I'm
going to set the string we just created
equal to the string we passed through so
now when you pass this string right
through it's going to set this string
equal to the string that it passes
through so now whenever we reference
this string name it's going to be the
same thing as referencing this one so if
we were to like create like a new method
down here that reference name it would
be equal to Adam because we just passed
the Adam group now you can have multiple
constructors inside your class let's
have a call for different parameters and
you can do this with any type of method
as well so for example like if you were
to create another constructor here ctor
and you got to hit tab twice anyways um
once you create another constructor here
and I have to have a different it has to
call for different parameters and this
one calls for no parameters right now so
that's okay but if we're to have it pass
another string and even if we were to
name the string something else like
Hello um we would still get an error
because the compiler doesn't
oh the compiler doesn't know on which of
these constructors to use because
they're both strings but if we were to
change this to like a bool or something
then it would be okay because in since
this is a string right here it knows to
go to this constructor so yeah that's
basically it for this tutorial
in the next tutorial we're going to be
looking at creating methods inside of
our classes and I'll show you what these
public and all that stuff means so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
