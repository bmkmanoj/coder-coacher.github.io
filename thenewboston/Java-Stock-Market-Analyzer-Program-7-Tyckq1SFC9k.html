seventh tutorial and how to create a
stock market analyzer program in the
java programming language and in this
tutorial i'm pretty much going to be
taking the rest of the values from this
array right here and turning them into
floats now i already handled our date
objects right here so now we pretty much
got a loop through the entire array
again and change all the rest of the
elements into pretty much just floats so
remember we can't work with them right
now because their string and we can't do
math - like strings we can only do it if
it's like a math float and it double
something like that so let's just make a
comment creates a float array for rest
of elements right there so now we
already created this array called data
array and all we're going to be doing in
this method is populating it so let's go
ahead and make a method called public
void great data array make sure to spell
that right it's pretty important and
instead of oblique make sure you put
public right there so now let's go ahead
and loop through the array again so for
int x equals 0 X is less than n the
length and I forgot to do something for
the parameter we need to pass in string
of n n so this pretty much means that we
have an array called n so n x equals
equal equals 0 X is less than n dot
length and next just do X plus plus and
for our inner loop we're going to loop
through the columns for and it's just
name it y equals 0 because we always do
Y is less than n of X dot length and
just go ahead and put Y plus plus the
increment through Y every time so this
is pretty much going through every
single element in our array
dunh dunh dunh dunh dunh dunh dunh next
row it's pretty much going to iterate
through every single one of those so we
already handled the 0 element in there
right here so what we have to do is
we're going to
test for every element in here so we can
have a bunch of if else if else if
statements but instead we're going to
make it easy and we're going to just
pass a switch it's going to test for Y
which is pretty much the elements as I
said and what's going to happen is this
if it gets the case of zero which is the
first element element we already handled
what do we want to do
well we already handled this but we need
to populate the array called data array
and we're going to set it equal to X of
Y which is pretty much its position
we're just going to set it equal to zero
because we're not going to be using ever
you can sit equal to null if you want
probably but we're using floats so let's
just set equal to zero and after
everything after you set an element you
want to break it out each time since it
there's no need to keep doing it so
here's where you get to the good stuff
in the case of one if it gets to the
first element which would be this one
what do we want to do well in the case
of one let's just go ahead and make our
data array right there into position
that it's at all ready we're going to
set this equal to new float and as your
parameters and that just put n X Y and
what this pretty much does is a puts it
being in the exact same position it was
but it puts it in a different array as a
float instead of a string and remember
we're doing this we're pretty much
duplicating the array but we're putting
it in an array called data array instead
of items and we're changing it from a
string to a float so now when we do that
we just want to break out a bit right
here so that's the case of one but what
about four two three four five six six
seven well look how easy this is right
here essentially wrote our code with X's
and Y's instead of ones and twos and
stuff like that we can do something like
this two three four five six seven and
now we got to change out of this two
three
four five six and seven and we don't
need a default because we wrote our code
perfectly or at least you should so
again what this pretty much does is it
loops through this entire thing when it
gets to zero it pretty much just sets to
the zero changes all these the floats
new line zero changes it to zero put
these all in the new array where they
were before
but as floats now so now we have an
array that we can actually work with and
what we usually want to do is just print
it out so let's make comment right here
called print data array and let's go
ahead and make that comments real there
we go
and now let's make a method real quick
to print out the data array and
someone's texting me but oh well
public avoid print array it doesn't take
any parameters and void right there and
now I'm going to loop through the array
again one last time I promise it's x
equals zero X is less than data array
stop the length you could probably make
it so you could pass an array in here as
an argument but I mean what's the fun to
that and now let's flip through the
columns for into y equals zero and go
ahead and put Y is listed or you get Y
less than data array of X dot length and
go ahead and put Y plus plus the loop
through that and now what do we want to
do is pretty much just print out the
item so system I always do that out
print its F is probably our best option
and let's go ahead and for the format
just put percent s and of course that
string is data array
X of Y right there
so put system.out.print line and I make
sure to print out the data array yes I
did so now we have a method to pretty
much print out the array to make sure we
didn't fudge anything up so let's go
ahead and in our main stock market with
our main method let's go ahead and make
our new formulas object because remember
we made a new class called formulas
right here and named F equal new
formulas and I spell that around for you
lows and doesn't take anything because
we didn't build a constructor for it and
what we need to do first is we need to
create that data array right here create
data array so F dot create data array
those are parameters it takes and it
takes a parameter this called n of an
array and remember we made this method
called get array just for this purpose
so we don't have to pass it in items how
awesome is that in our get array and
that's all we have to do so instead of
passing in items we called a method from
this read files class to read that right
so how awesome is that I mean this is
some pretty clever programming here
thank you very much and after this of
course we just made that method called
print array right here so let's go ahead
and use that baby F dot print array and
now let's see what we got hopefully no
errors oh my God look how beautiful this
is a nice perfectly formatted printed
array with a data array that we just
created and now you can see instead of
strings it went through each it went
through the old array of strings set the
first element zero point zero and so all
of these elements these are actually
floats instead of string now so now when
we try to add them up in do calculations
to them they
actually work how awesome is that so in
the next tour I will be teaching you how
to do some cool formulas with all this
dad and now that is actually data and
not just a bunch of characters so that
was a I kind of went fast but you guys
were complaining that I mean I need to
get in some pretty advanced stuff so
this should this should give you a good
head start on how to create a real um
you know a real working Java program so
in the next tutorial we're going to be
finally getting into the good stuff and
how to do some formulas and analyze the
stocks of themselves so if you don't
understand trust me you will next time
it's going to be amazing so thank you
guys for watching and sticking with me
so far I'm so happy to be teaching guys
don't forget to subscribe and I look
forward to seeing you in the next
