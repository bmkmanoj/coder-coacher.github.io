Friday everybody's looking - oh crap is
this thing recording
oh man that's embarrassing well anyways
guys welcome to your 16 JavaScript
tutorial and in this tutorial well you
know what before I even get started
first of all I apologize for my voice
it's a little raspy but anyways I'm not
sick but I got like a bunch of phlegm in
my throat won't go into detail but I'm
taking mucinex DM so anyways if I copy
up a huge loogie during story then you
know don't be mad at me
it's destiny it's bound to happen so
just deal with it so anyways let's go
ahead and talk about nesting what it is
and why it's useful you know before when
we had an if statement it's basically
said this I'm going to give you a
condition and if it's true run a bit of
code well now what we can do is nesting
is the idea that you can have a if
statement and you can stick another if
statement inside it and then it's going
to say basically I'm going to give you a
condition and then I'm going to give you
another condition and if they're both
true then run a bit of code so it's just
saying instead of meeting one instead of
passing one test you have to pass two
tests instead so let's go ahead and give
you guys an example before you get
extremely confused so I'm going to go
ahead and set my first name equal to
Bucky because that's my dang name and
then go ahead and set my last name equal
to Robert's because that's my dang name
and now let's go ahead and build a basic
if statement what we learned before if
um first name equals two equal signs
Bucky then go ahead and run this bit of
code and we already know that whatever
we write in here is our statement then
it's going to run because we gave a test
and it passed it so now it runs the bit
of code but what nesting is is the idea
that instead of just a regular statement
like print out hello Bucky er alert box
pops up we can actually go ahead and put
another if statement in here with
another condition so let's go ahead and
put
if lastname equals Roberts and make sure
I spelled everything right
you see when whenever you are like have
a variable or something and you want to
make sure it matches just go ahead and
double click it and then you don't have
to big fi rst fi rst and AME enemy just
double click it and is going to
highlight all the other ones that are
spelled the same by anyways back to the
story so now let's go ahead and add a
body to this and now let's go ahead and
write something like document dot write
welcome Bucky Roberts explanation
explanation and I accidentally hit
notepad so there we go just like that so
now let's go ahead and save it and run
this baby and see what we get whoa
probably shouldn't minimize that a
little bit okay ah yeah about this um I
don't want to talk about this I actually
forget I forgot that that was up there
so yeah pretty embarrassing but anyways
as you can see it says welcome
Bucky Roberta meant to say Roberts but
who cares so now you can see the basics
of nesting instead of having one test
the pest you now have to pass another
test before you can get to your code and
this isn't only basic if you can also
nest if-else and now check it out say
you're making a script here and you want
to make sure the Bucky's or excuse me
the users first name was Bucky and then
you want to make sure their last name
was Roberts
so if their first name is buggy and
their last name is Roberts it's going to
say hello Bucky Roberts I'll just go
ahead and change it but if their first
name is Bucky and their last name is not
Roberts let's go ahead and write
something else
copy paste hello Bucky someone or
something like that so now if your
variable was Bucky Covington or
something like that
you go ahead and it says welcome Bucky
someone because it passed this first
test right here so what got in his first
name was Bucky but then it says is your
last name Roberts well no so
so I'm going to go to else and that says
welcome Bucky someone so again I just
want to give you guys the idea that
instead of just writing a statement in
here you can actually nest an entire if
statement in here and then it's just
going to give it more tests to pass and
actually I don't want to confuse you
guys too much but you can actually put
another if statement in here and you can
nest it like a thousand times if you
want so if you're saying all right make
sure your name is Bucky make sure your
last names Roberts make sure your
favorite color is blue make sure you're
24 and you can give a bunch of different
ifs but actually if you guys are
thinking about doing then there is a lot
easier way so mostly people nest
you can probably nest three ifs instead
of inside each other and that is you
know most the deepest that people go if
you want to get deeper than that then
there are better techniques and I'm
going to show you guys those techniques
and upcoming tutorials but I guess now
that the cats out of the bag then I'm
going to go back to watching my favorite
music video and I guess I'll see you
guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
