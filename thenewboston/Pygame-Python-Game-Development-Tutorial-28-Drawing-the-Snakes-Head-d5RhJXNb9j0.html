another pugging tutorial from Harrison
to Bucky in the new Boston and to you
guys so why are we left off we set our
text but and we're still going to make
some more changes to our text don't
worry but now we have another issue sort
of and that is that well let's be honest
we're using these this ugly just blocks
for everything and that's not really I
mean it's still the whole like
fundamental aspect of the game is you
know working but the aesthetics suck so
uh I say I want us to change is I want
us to make our snake a little more look
like a snake so so what we're going to
do is we're going to make a sprite for
our the head of our snake and so instead
of the head of our snake being a block
it's an image that we've created and
then later on we can modify that image
so when we turn and stuff the snake's
head will turn and all that when you do
all kinds of really neat stuff so that's
what we're going to be starting to do in
this video so the very first thing we
have to do is first of all we know we
want to add a head to the snake and
we're just going to replace the block
right and so the way that we're going to
kind of go about doing that is first of
all the block size is 20 so we can just
what we can do is that we know that
first block is a 20 by 20 so let's make
a 20 by 20 image of a snake head so what
I'm going to use I'm on I'm on Windows
so I'm going to use Microsoft Paint if
you're on a Mac you can you Mac's have a
lot more fancier options than I do
and if you're on Linux I don't even know
what you would use if you're on Linux
I've never used any image editing but
find something or you go online and like
find like a cartoon snake head and just
resize it to 20/20 just make sure at the
base it's 20 but anyway I'm gonna trot
in paint so let me open up paint and
then I'm going to show you guys at least
you Windows users how you can convert it
to have a transparent background as well
so right now our game actually has a
white background so it's not the biggest
deal but generally you want to use
images that have
transparent background simply because
when they cross over things if you have
a white background you like get like
that white you know block out of it and
it looks ugly so um in Microsoft Paint
Alex to do this for now and you want to
go to resize and then 4 pixels choose 20
and then it would be 20 by 20 so now
we're just going to make it quick 20 by
20 I'm holding ctrl and zooming in by
the way so for our snakehead we just use
green and in fact actually we defined
green up here at 0 1 55 zero so instead
just straight up green I'm gonna go to
edit colors and we're going to do 0 1 55
in zero
so it's an identical match to our
snakehead and now I'm going to just draw
our snake uh so a snake has you know
looks I don't know Holly this is ahead
and we'll just do this on the same side
that cool so that's our snake head and
then we can get this fill it in and then
snakes have a like a little slithery
tone so add the tongue here and it like
goes off into like Oh be like that and
then snakes have eyes and they're like
little beady eyes usually so we'll just
have like video I like that and a little
lady be like oh my goodness let's just
copy and paste this okay we're gonna
line it it's just so so there's a snake
head that looks pretty good
I'm gonna fix our tunnel real quick it's
driving me nuts to not be balanced so
that's a ok snake head we can zoom out a
little bit and like that's a this
probably what it's going to look like
decent enough cool so we have a snake
head now what we're going to want to do
is go file save and then save it in the
directory that we're coding in I happen
to be coding in Bucky PI game tutorial
and I'm going to save this as snake head
to already made one so I'll just close
snake head too and that's it well close
snake close that and then now what we
want to do if you're on Windows again
is if you want transparent background
it's kind of hard on Windows on Mac I
know it's really easy in on Linux I
don't know what you would use again you
don't have to make a transparent
background but if you're on Windows or
if you're on Mac OS you probably know
how to do it if you're on Windows the
program I would recommend is GIMP so I'm
going to open up GIMP now as soon as I
find it here so I'm going to open up
GIMP and show you guys really quickly
how you can use GIMP to give yourself a
transparent background on images
honestly the only time I even use GIMP
is for pi game and making transparent
image transparent backgrounds for the
most part so once you've got GIMP open
just go file open and you want to open
that image again mine's in desktop
Buckey and then we did snake head too so
this is our image and then you can go to
colors and then color to alpha and then
you see here preview and it says just
the default is white so you don't have
to do anything at this point and just
hit OK boom you have a transparent
background now how to a file and export
as done I'm just going to overwrite it
you can change it if you want and then
we'll export replace export done so now
we've converted that I'm not going to
save those changes I don't really don't
really need to do that and now we're
able to actually incorporate our snake
head into our PI game so before this one
gets too long I think we'll just cut it
off here and we'll go into the next
tutorial and actually bring in our
snake's head so stay tuned for that
