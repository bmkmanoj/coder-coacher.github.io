C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
going to be beginning to talk about
something called pointers now pointers
is something that confuses a lot of
people so I'm going to try to explain it
really simple for you guys now you
remember how we made some variables that
contain strings of text and we made some
variables that contain integers and we
made some variables that contain floats
well a pointer is a special type of
variable that contains a memory address
as their value pretty weird huh
so let's go ahead and the first thing we
need is a plain old integer variable so
let's go ahead and make a variable
called fish and set it equal to the
value of 5 it doesn't really matter what
the value is to be honest so anyways we
have a plain old variable named fish now
let me go ahead and show you guys how to
retrieve the memory address of this
variable so as you probably already know
this variable called fish is stored
somewhere on a computer somewhere in the
memory you know who knows where so
sometimes we need to be able to access
where indeed that memory is so in order
to do that you go ahead and you write
that and sign and the and sign is called
the address operator and now whatever
variable you type after it this means
the address in your memory of fish so if
we go ahead and print this out on the
screen using C out and might as well end
that line hello can't type in line today
and L there we go
I'm going to go ahead and build and run
this we see that we get this weird
hexadecimal who knows what this is this
is actually the memory address of where
the variable fish is so again like I
said the first thing we need to find the
address of something is of course a
variable because we need to find the
address of something and in order to
find the memory address of the variable
you go ahead and you write the and sign
right before the variable and then those
two combined pretty much tell your C++
compiler all right I want to print out
the memory address of fish
not the variable fish itself so this is
of course the address of where your
variable fish lips now you're saying all
right well you just want over address
operators I thought you were going to go
over something called pointers well
let's get into that right now a pointer
like I said is a special type of
variable that points to a memory address
in other words um a pointer is a
variable that contains memory addresses
a value so let's go ahead and I'll show
you guys how to make a pointer in order
to make a pointer go ahead and write the
type of data you're going to be pointing
to so we're going to make a pointer that
points to an int value or in other words
an int variable so this is going to be
an int pointer simple enough now in
order to tell C++ we're making a pointer
instead of just another variable we need
to add an asterisks that little star
above the eight on your keyboard and now
we can go ahead and name a variable like
fish pointer and this tells our compiler
that we're going to be making a pointer
instead of a regular variable again if
we just had it like that our compiler
would think that we're just making a
regular variable but we're not we're
making a pointer so that's why we needed
that little asterisk before fish pointer
so we went ahead and we declared a fish
pointer right here pretty much telling
our program we're going to be making a
pointer called fish pointer and what
this fish pointer is going to do is it's
going to point to a memory address so
now we have to of course assign a memory
address so let's go ahead and whenever
you assign a memory address to a pointer
you don't need to include the star again
because you only do that whenever you're
first creating the variable from now on
whenever you use the variable fish
pointer C++ already knows that it's
pointer because you told it whenever you
created the variable so make sure you
don't put star fish pointer twice only
one time C++ is smart enough to
recognize this now go ahead and set it
equal to the memory address of variable
and we only got one variable fish so now
fish pointer is
equal to the memory address of fish it
isn't equal to five it is an equal to
the word fish fish pointer is equal to
the memory address of where the variable
fish lives that long hexadecimal thing
so now when we go ahead and see out
print fish pointer and go ahead and then
that line now these two lines should be
identical because first we're printing
out the memory address of fish and next
we just are basically printing out the
memory address of fish so let's go ahead
and make sure these lines are the same
so I don't look like a fool and see
there we go so basically we know how to
print out the memory address of a
variable using the memory address
operator that's a pretty nice name for
it so then I taught you guys how to
create a pointer and all a pointer was
was a special type of variable that had
a memory address as its value so again
whenever we ran this we can't assign
this to an INT because it's not an
integer
we can't assign it to a float because
it's obviously not a float so we have to
assign it to a special type of variable
called a pointer so that's why you need
to be able to use pointers and of course
when we just printed it out it printed
it out the memory address pretty cool
huh so that is your basics of what a
pointer is how they're created and how
you obtain the memory address of a
variable so now with all that knowledge
we can begin programming and we're
actually you're going to use these
pointers and programs and they're
actually useful for something believe it
or believe it or not so thank you guys
for watching and hopefully you
understand everything in this story if
you have any questions don't forget to
check out my website the new Boston comm
and I'll see you guys in the next
