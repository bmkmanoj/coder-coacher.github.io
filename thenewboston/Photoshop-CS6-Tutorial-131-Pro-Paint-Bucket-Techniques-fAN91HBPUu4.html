going over using the paint bucket tool
in Photoshop cs6 now most of you may
know how to use the paint bucket tool
it's been around for almost as long as
Photoshop has been around so and if you
don't know how to use the paint bucket
tool this is a good tutorial start at
and otherwise just keep watching and see
what's going to go down in this tutorial
yeah so the paint buckets primary
function is to fill an area with the
active foreground color so the
foreground color is going to be over
here right now it's blue
so that's your foreground color and the
paint bucket tool is over here on in
your tool section and if anything's
covering it up it will be the gradient
tool it would be covering it up and you
can see that the hotkey is G so go ahead
and select your pink bucket tool and you
can see that we have some different
options going on around here we can set
it to use the foreground color here or
we can set it to use a pattern so let me
go to foreground first and just click
and you guys oh my I am on the wrong
layer and click on this one so somehow
my pasady got turned on by accident but
if I click on the layer I can change
that solid color there to a foreground
color and if I'm on a layer that's not
on this one if I click on it then we're
going to get some background that's been
filled in with the paint bucket and as
you can see the entire canvas has been
filled with the paint bucket now it's
going to stay in like an area that has
been closed off by other pixels so that
way when you use something a paint
bucket it's going to stay within the
lines and you can use that to your
advantage by clicking on the middle or
something like that clicking in
somewhere to see if all your lines are
connected all your pixels are filled so
let's move on the next thing that I
wanted to show you was the pattern so
get back on my
Paint Bucket tool go to pattern and then
we can select from some patterns you can
load any patterns that you have have
saved on your computer anything like
that so I'll just stay with the bubble
pattern here and if I add that to a head
my background layer clicked you can see
that a pattern is added instead of just
a solid color we've got we change this
back to foreground we've got our
blending modes here now if you don't
understand blending modes yet just go
ahead and check out the evil anymo
tutorial it's a three or four parter
there and it goes really in-depth about
each of blending mode we've got our
opacity so that means when you lay down
your color let me change this back to
white real quick if I lower my opacity
the color is going to be a more pick
when you lay it down as you can see
there's not that full blue but it's a
more opaque color of that blue excuse me
more transparent color or the blue
because I lower the bus opacity the next
thing that we got here is tolerant now
what tolerance is is it's a value that
influences the range that the paint
bucket uses to fill given area so if
you're trying to fill in like a sky or
something that has a few different
colors in it but they're like close
together like a bunch of different Blues
in the sky so if you lower the tolerance
it'll grab more of those blues or and if
you increase it'll take less so that's
what the tolerance does the couple
buttons over here anti-alias will give
you a nice crisp smooth lines instead of
jagged edges if we have contiguous
selected it'll select all of the colors
that are within that color range so I
have this orange color here if I go have
my contiguous unchecked and click run
wrong layer my bed
everything that was around orange
according to the tolerance here
everything that was close enough to
orange got changed to blue so if I go
back and I put my tolerance up to down
to like thirty I keep on doing that
accident and I click on this you can see
that since I lowered the tolerance it
didn't accept as many colors and the
oranges came out and that's what happens
when you have contiguous unchecked if I
had contiguous checked and then I
clicked on this orange here it's only
going to do this orange area because
it's closed off contiguous just takes
all the colors so there's your unchecks
and checks for that the next one we got
here is all layers and you take that if
you're going to select that checkbox
it's going to fill the color range
information from all the images layers
so basically just takes information and
fills in all every layer if you have
that checked that's in here in your
layers panel so that's it for the paint
bucket tool very rudimentary
introduction to the paint bucket tool
and at some point we'll go over how to
use the paint bucket tool in more
advanced ways to make some cool-looking
projects so thanks a lot for watching
everybody you guys have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
