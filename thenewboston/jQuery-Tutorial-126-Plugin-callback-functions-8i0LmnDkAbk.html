merging two arrays so we okay so let me
start from the beginning this is
mentioned in on the tutorials but I'll
go ahead and mention it again
we are just setting a default value from
from however if the options are set we
want to go ahead and merge settings with
options ie
the option that provided inside of here
we want to overwrite this value with so
this will become ten in the case that
we've provided it tells ten here so
hopefully that makes sense now what I'm
gonna do is go ahead and alert out this
setting just to make sure I've got it
right this is just something I always do
so I'm gonna alert out from settings
from because remember we're working with
an array here let's go and refresh you
can see that it says ten this is the
value that we did provide here if I go
ahead and change this to three for
example and refresh we get the value
three so we know that this value here is
being sent through options it's them
overriding this value here so it's
changing it here whatever we provide and
then we're just alerting that out so
we'll get rid of that for now we don't
actually need that okay so let's go
ahead and create the actual
functionality of the countdown and then
we'll go ahead and provide the callback
function a bit later on so the first
thing I want to do is just up here
because we're using this either this
selector inside of a function in a
minute
we want to select or created this
selected variable and that's just going
to equal this and that's so we can just
use this variable here inside a function
down here which we're going to create
and this is called countdown
execution so inside of this function
we're gonna run the code over and over
again by using an interval and we're
using this selected because we need this
to be global hopefully that makes sense
if you know about global and local
functions or variable sorry the scope of
variables then this will make sense so
inside the countdown execution or rather
outside first of all we want to set the
current value so the current value that
we're starting the counter at and this
is settings and from so is starting at
for example 10 inside countdown
execution we want to reduce this value
by 1 each time so current is equal to
current minus 1 quite simple what we
then want to do is place the place the
current value inside this selected so
this will equal this because we're using
it in the function ie this countdown div
so we want to go ahead and say this
underscore selected remember when using
this outside of here because it's now
global dot text current so now at the
moment because we just have this
function here we're not actually calling
the function at all but if we go ahead
and call countdown execution and refresh
you can see that 10 is been put into
this div so that's worked but we
actually want to run this every 1 second
because we want the value to increase by
1 every one second so we create an
interval and we call this or we create
an interval using set interval and we
call this interval so interval equals
set interval and so here we give the
function name without the crap without
the parentheses so countdown
and then 1004 a thousand milliseconds ie
every second so every second this
function here is going to be run using
this here and then we are reducing the
value by one every time and placing it
inside this selected which is this which
is this countdown div so quite a sort of
complicated to explain but now when we
run it you can see that the value comes
down every time now the only problem we
have here is that we don't have a way to
stop this so you'll see that when once
it gets to zero it will go into minus 1
minus 2 minus 3 bla bla bla so what we
want is a check inside of this function
to check when it equals 0 so we say if
current is equal to zero then the first
thing we want to do is stop the
execution of this interval so we want to
clear the interval so we say clear
interval and then we specify the name of
the interval and we gave the interval
name as just interval so we type in
interval and then after this we want to
send the callback function ready if you
like now I'll write this and then I'll
explain what we're doing callback call
this so essentially what this means is
this callback here is our callback
function and we've said callback Col so
we've sent a call back to this this here
and then we've provided just this inside
so now callback is obviously a parameter
in here so we can go into final
so we've created a callback function as
we would with any other jQuery any other
jQuery function if you like or plugin or
set of tools and now inside of here we
can like alert done and because when
it's got to 0 we clear the interval cuz
obviously we don't need the countdown to
continue then we send the callback you
know as this so we send the callback as
sort of done if you like which is our
callback thing here which is we've
subplots of supplied in here and then we
alert out done so let's go ahead and
refresh nearly 100 - 100 there so as it
counts down we obviously take a look at
this code and you know it's counting
down as we specified but when it gets to
0 we send the callback and then we
execute the block of code that we
specified as our callback function here
so ie
like I showed in the beginning we could
say window.location equals something dot
code at UK or blah blah blah or web
address so we've taken a look at how we
can obviously supply a plug-in with
parameters or or options or settings
whatever you'd like to call them as
we've seen in other tutorials however
we've now looked at creating a callback
function and using callback called
callback being the name here dot call
and sending the fact that or sending
this as itself essentially so we know
when this has completed and then when it
has completed we execute everything
within the callback function block so
that's how we create callback functions
in our jQuery plugins</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
