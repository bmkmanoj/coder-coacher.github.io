is Bucky Roberts and welcome to your
very first video in building an awesome
freakin Ajax chatroom so this is
actually the chatroom that we're going
to be building and as you can see it's
very basic I actually based this off
some source code that I found from book
Ajax in PHP building responsive web
applications it's awesome book go by if
you don't have it but anyways in these
tutorial series what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you guys how to build
this ajax-based chatroom and of course
you do need some knowledge of Ajax so if
you never work with it before then
please click on the link below the new
boston org I made an entire video series
about ajax teaching the beginners you
know the very basic stuff so like I said
if you have no idea what Ajax is or
never worked with it before then please
watch those videos and once you were
done with those you'll be good to go
so here is the application right here
and there's some cool features but of
course it's very simple I didn't want to
add too many features because right now
it's very easy to integrate into your
own web application so let me go ahead
and show you guys you know a quick tour
of it basically you know of course you
text like hi my name is Bucky and of
course you can spell stuff wrong if you
want to and press ENTER or you can press
send and then of course it goes to the
database and just to show you guys that
this actually does work I have my iPad
right here and I am pretending to be
someone named Emily so let me go ahead
and send that message and of course I
typed STFU on my iPad and you know my
cursor is right here and I'm typing on
my iPad hehehe whatever send so boom
there you go and this can have unlimited
amount of people or you can set it just
as a private chat one-on-one and some
other cool features is that you can
change your name from guest whatever to
Bucky you can also change your text
color to let's say red
this is red now and you know some very
simple features so like I said it's a
very simple yet very awesome amazing
Ajax chat so let's go ahead and get
started and figure out how to program
this bad boy now of course all of these
messages are working with PHP in MySQL
so we are actually storing all of these
messages and all of this information in
a database so let's go ahead and make
that database first and also we need to
make a user that can access that
database so I actually got a small
account on Hostgator but you can really
use anything you can even test it out on
your local machine but you know it's
really easy just by like a hosting
account for like three dollars a month
now if you click on MySQL databases then
it says go ahead and create a new
database and you guys should know how to
do this already hopefully but if you
never work with MySQL databases with um
you know the control panel I'm going to
show you guys that do that right now so
there was the testing database that I
made before a chat chat one but for
these tutorials I'm just going to name
this chat and press create database and
you actually want to save this
information so actually if I do this
database chat I'm going to save it in
file
and we want to save this because we need
the information later on whenever
programming so my database is called
Bucky underscore chat now I'm going to
go back and now I have to make a user to
access that database so Bucky I'm just
going to name my user chat and I'm going
to generate a random password copy I've
copied this in a safe place use password
and create user so the user is called
Bucky underscore chat so that's the user
and the password is this by the way when
I'm done with this tutorial I'm going to
change the password because I don't
trust you guys and you guys are probably
going to try to hack my database so that
is basically on how to do it and I'm
actually going to show you guys how to
make the config file and then I'm going
to change my password my anyways go back
and now we have a database created and
we also have a user but the user doesn't
have access to that database yet you
need to give that user access to your
database manually and this is how you do
it scroll down you're going to see add
user to database find the user that you
just created
Bucky chat in the database Bucky chat
probably shouldn't name those you know
the same thing but we did F it in Adam
now not Adam like you know a person
named Adam but add him or her to the
database depending on it for your
computer's male or female now typically
what you want to do is you only want to
give them privileges that you need but
just for this tutorial going to keep
things simple go ahead and give them all
privileges make changes boom
roasted so now this user was edited the
database now you can go ahead and access
it in our PHP database is almost set up
we just have to add a table real quick
but before we do that I actually want to
show you guys how to make the config
file so I already made a single file um
before I even started making this
tutorial and that's my config file and
this is basically the file that
establishes a connect
in to the database so this is how you
make that of course it's a PHP file and
you guys probably have done this up
plenty of times before but you know for
anyone who this is how you properly set
it up even if you've done it before then
it's good to watch so the first thing
you want to do is define a couple things
actually the first thing is DB host and
this is just a local host and anytime
you have a script and it's just running
locally on the server because this PHP
file it's not going to run on your
computer it's going to run on the server
and of course our database is also on
that server so that's why you can type
localhost and set up specifying you know
the IP address of the server so we're
actually going to wanted to define three
more things 1 2 3 so we have the host
which pretty much says what server do
you want to connect to well the same
server that our PHP files on and the
next thing that you want to do is you
want to define a user and that's just
the username which was Bucky chat and
now you want to define the password and
that was just this thing right here the
password and the last thing you want to
define is of course the database name
and the database was also Bucky chat so
there you go and there is your config
file so go ahead and actually you want
to delete this first and save it so now
our config file is set up the only other
thing that we have to do is we need to
make a table in the database so that you
know whenever we're typing messages of
course these have to be stored in the
table inside your database so that's
where we're going to be doing in the
next video but for now thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
