and let's go ahead and start building
that add item page so the first thing
that we need to do of course is throw in
some PHP tags because we need to add
that header and search code so just go
ahead and copy this header and search
and that is going to give you of course
your search bar and all those links at
the top of the screen now after this
what we need to do is we want to build
the section of links on the left hand
side now well I'll come back to these
well am I going to teach you guys okay I
might as well tell you guys now you see
all of these links okay that's pretty
interesting now do you see after some of
these links there's a number in
parentheses well that number is to tell
you how many of those things you have
for example it says in box eight that
means I have eight unread messages now
pending one means i have one item that
is pending review now even though I
don't have any active items now whenever
I receive an offer it would be like
offers received 12 offers made seven
armed completed trades three so all of
these numbers are statistics telling you
how many of each item you have it just
helps you you know easy pretty much
easily visualize what's going on at a
glance in your account so just keep that
in mind because I'm going to come back
to that point later on so on the links
the side on the left i was just talking
about that is actually a side with the
ID main underscore aside now of course
let's go ahead and end that aside now
what I did is each of these pages we go
to it's going to have the same links on
the left hand side so instead of writing
the links in HTML and coding them using
the same bit of code over and over and
over again what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create all those links in a PA
HP function and instead of you know I
don't know what would it be probably
like a hundred lines of code I'm just
going to include that one PHP function
which is this PHP actually I can just go
ahead and steal this now the function is
going to be called account links and
just go ahead and put 0 in here and
you'll see why later on now of course
instead of you know coding that all
those links every single time we need
them we can just call this function and
we're good to go now we'll get to this
function in a little bit which is
basically the function responsible for
creating all the HTML for those links
but before we create the HTML for those
links we first need to calculate the
statistics for that user now if you said
statistics what are you talking about
I'm talking about the numbers of pending
items the number of offers that user
receive the number of offers that user
made the number of I or excuse me the
number of messages that they have not
read yet all of the statistics for that
individual user why do we need to do
this first well we need to do this
because they are they are actually part
of the links themselves so before we can
code this function account links i'm
going to show you guys how to code those
statistical functions now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go ahead and
create a new file and I'm just going to
go ahead and save this not in any of
these folders but since these statistics
are valuable statistics we're going to
want to reuse these not only you
whenever we see the links but we're
going to want to use some of these on
the homepage and you know whenever the
offer item page so I'm going to go ahead
and make a new folder and I'm going to
call this functions now all of the
functions that are kind of general
that's what I'm going to code in here so
of course these are user statistics how
many of certain items does this user
have so i'm going to call this file fun
so I know it's a funk
file user stats now just go ahead and
throw in that PHP extension and I want
to mention this and listen carefully or
else you're going to get a whole bunch
of code that you have no idea what it
does there's going to be a bunch of
different statistics that we have to
calculate how many pending items that
they have how many active items that
they have how many completed trades does
user have however the code is very
similar for each function so instead of
showing you guys how to do 12 different
functions that do the same exact thing
I'm going to show you guys how to do one
function and then i'm going to give you
guys the rest so if you guys want the
other functions they're going to be
available in a download file but let me
show you guys how to calculate
statistics for that user and then once
you understand how to do this you
understand how to calculate any
statistic so let's go ahead and
calculate the users pending items
calculate arm users pending items now of
course this is a function and the
function will be calculate users pending
items now as a parameter that would be
of course their user ID so if we if my
user ID was 11 we have passed an 11
right here and it would calculate my
pending items which would return you
know three if I had three items pending
so the first thing I need to do is I
need to query the database and what I'm
going to do is I'm pretty much going to
query the database and look at all of
the items where the user ID equals my
user ID and the status of that item
equals pen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
