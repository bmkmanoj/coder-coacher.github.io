sweet construct 2 tutorial that's kind
of weird said constructed tutorial
whatever
so anyways welcome back and in this
video I'm gonna be showing you guys how
to add the player so of course he's a
sprite so let's go ahead and
double-click anywhere on the layout
that's bright
you know we obviously know how to do
that and sir and we'll just insert
somewhere above this platform for now
now just like before what we want to do
is we want to import a sprite strip so
right click this impress import sprite
strip in your animation frames window
and then it's gonna say ok your sprite
shape is pretty much the animation of
the dude you want so what one do you
want well we want if you go into your
media bundle sorry sprites jungle
performer layer and these are pretty
much two different positions he can be
in he can be running he can be jumping
well we just want right now is just him
idling which pretty much means that um
the user isn't pressing anything he's
just standing there but the reason that
there's an animation for it is because
um he actually like Bob's up and down a
little bit as you guys are gonna see so
he's just not actually standing in one
place he's II know moving around a
little bit makes it more natural so
select this right here this idle and
I'll show you guys what it is real quick
you guys probably can't even see just by
looking at it but he does indeed his
body Bob's up and down a little bit and
what its gonna do since it's not square
like the other one this is actually one
long strip whenever we double click this
or open it
what construct 2 is gonna do is it's
automatically gonna tech detect how many
images will work and it's automatically
gonna crop them up for you so there were
indeed I know you guys didn't count them
but the were indeed 11 individual images
in that sprite strip so that's one of
the cool things and that's uh one of the
things that construct 2 is actually
really intelligent about and really
helpful so just like before get rid of
this 0 1 which is the default empty one
by right-clicking and delete it and once
we do that you can see that our do
is now in this little window right here
now
the first thing you're gonna notice is
this the box around this guy and I'm
gonna sneeze in like five seconds once I
- okay Wow
okay where was I so right now we have a
bunch of empty space around this dude
and you might think okay
no big deal not a big problem but it
actually is and this is why this box
right here is what constructive is gonna
look at whenever you're doing things
like collision detection so right now if
we he were to run into a box that was
very or I don't know an enemy that was
right where my mouse is he would die
because it would be part of him and
obviously we want to make this a little
bit tighter to his body because the user
might be confused back I didn't even
touch an enemy in my dear dad so in
order to crop this area to make it nice
and tight around the player what you
want to do is this you want to hold
shift on your keyboard and press this
tool right here this is crop transparent
edges so hold down shift and just click
that tool and as you can see we now have
a box that surrounds this guy nice and
tight so now whenever he it's a guy it's
a like an enemy or something it's going
to react properly and the reason that I
actually held down shift on my keyboard
is when you hold down shift it applies
it to all the animations as you can see
if I didn't hold down shift then like
one through ten it would still have that
empty space so that's a nice little
shortcut through again constructive
making everything real easy so the next
thing we want to do after this is we
want to change the origin point now if
you click this little box right here
it's going to show you where the origin
is now what the origin is another main
point that whenever you're making a game
it detects pretty much where the object
is now whenever you're making a
platformer game it's always best to put
the origin at the bottom Center or other
words on his feet because
you want to detect when the guy is
jumping on enemies you want to detect
when the guy is standing on platforms
and for this you don't want to keep
track of this point on his eye because
you don't care when his eyes on the
platform you care when his feet are on
the platform or on the ground or when he
jumps on something so in order to get
this origin point right here exactly
where you want it there's actually a
shortcut once you have this tool
selected this origin point tool you can
hit two on your number pad and look at
the origin point right now I just hit
two and it moved directly to the bottom
Center and actually if you hit for a six
into you guys can see how it corresponds
with the origin point but hit two and
that's going to move your origin point
to the bottom Center now this obviously
only does it for that first frame we
were working on so we can either go one
two through ten into it manually or of
course I want to tell you guys a
shortcut that makes things a lot easier
in order to get all of these other words
your points aligned just like this
original one was make sure you have that
zero frame selected and then this image
points window that popped up if you
right click origin and hit apply to
whole animation what this is gonna do is
it's gonna apply that origin point it's
pretty much gonna say okay make the
origin point at the bottom Center for
every single frame how freaking awesome
is that so pretty much this construct 2
is like making this game really easy for
us um you know if we just programmed all
that it would be up pane and the furqan
but but that just saved us like an hour
just by learning those couple shortcuts
so now our dude is good to go and he's
all set up he's cropped nice and easy
his origin point or pretty much
detection point is on his feet so yeah I
think we're good for this tutorial so in
the next video I'm gonna get I'm gonna
show you guys how to actually make this
into actual animation so it doesn't just
stay in one place like the ground does
so until then thank you guys for
watching and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
