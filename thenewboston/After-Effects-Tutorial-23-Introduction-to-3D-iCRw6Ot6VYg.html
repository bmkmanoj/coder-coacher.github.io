Effects tutorial and in this tutorial
we're gonna be going over 3d your intro
to 3d so go ahead and create a new
composition you can either put an image
on there or you can go ahead and put
video file it's not going to matter for
this story I'm working with the video
file and the first thing I want you to
do is go ahead to your first layer again
it doesn't matter what it is and check
out the position and scale properties
now again the position is the position
along the x axis and the y axis and the
scales of course the - width of the
image now again what I want you to take
note of more importantly than that is
that there's only two attributes on
either one of these but with 3d you need
a third attribute so go ahead and make
sure you have that this little thing q
popped up and if you don't have a popped
up press f4 and it'll pop up and right
under the cube but go ahead and click
that checkbox and what that checkbox is
gonna do is add a third attribute to any
images or any of your properties that
you can be working with 3d such as
position and scale and go ahead and
change that third attribute right now by
scrubbing the value now again like I
said the first one is the x-axis which
goes the left and right the second one
is the y-axis which goes up and down and
the third one is called the z axis and
the z axis goads um
goes on a how to describe it towards me
and outwards so again that's up and down
left and right in inners and hours so if
you move the position along the z axis
it either gets farther away or closer to
you but no even though the size is
changing the scale isn't changing at all
and this is because it's not actually
changing it's just changing the position
for example is just moving farther away
and closer to us and this is the same
thing with scale you can either scale it
along the x axis or Y or in this case
it's all locked so it doesn't matter so
another thing that you can do if this is
kind of hard to understand
still is right here this is your camera
angle on what you're viewing your
composition now if you want to view it
from the front that's what we were doing
by default if you want to view your
composition from the top go ahead and
press top and as you can see you can't
see anything and this is because just
regular pictures they aren't 3d so what
we need to do is view it from angle and
custom view three is a good angle and
here's where you can see now if you go
ahead and change position you get a
better view of what the z-axis is again
we would be sitting somewhere right here
and the z-axis would bring it closer to
us or further away from us and if we're
bringing it closer to us it would make
it appear bigger further away from us
would make it appear smaller again with
scale it would increase the whole thing
and this would also make it appear
bigger or decreasing it would also make
it appear smaller so another thing that
I want to talk to you guys about aside
from what are the position and scale is
also a rotation so let's go ahead and
change the active camera or you can
change the front and doesn't matter
and aside from x and y rotation you also
have a Z rotation now what X rotation is
is when you scrub this value it's going
to change it so it rotates over the x
axis and by rotating over the x axis
which is left and right it flips up and
down by rotating over the z axis it goes
left and right and by rotating over the
z axis it just spins around because that
axis is pointing towards us so that is
how you can manipulate 2d images to work
in 3d and again you can um what's it
called animate these just like you would
any other so let's go ahead and do that
right now let's first change the
position so it's pretty far out and
let's go ahead and make a keyframe right
there next let's go ahead
and actually let's zoom in we only want
this animation about three seconds long
so put it right about there and we'll
make another position actually just
change that to zero and now you see
instead of just animating in 2d it's
actually growing towards us and we can
combine this with other keyframes as
well such as rotation so say we wanted
to animate extra rotation just go over
there and then here we can add another
one say have it spin five times or
something so now once you play our
animation it's not only going to be
getting closer to us but it's also going
to be flipping over the y-axis such as
that and it's and it's spinning a little
bit over the y-axis because I was
playing around with it right here but
now if we go ahead and look at our
animation you can see we now have turned
our 2d image into a 3d effect and this
is a cool effect
that you can use and it's a neat little
enhancement and After Effects so for
this tutorial those are the real basics
of 3d and again let me show you this at
a different angle if we play from this
angle we can see it just that might be a
little more clear to you
maybe not but oh well but for now I just
wanted to give you guys the basics of
working with 3d and After Effects and
keynotes that point out here if you ever
are working and you can't see your image
that probably means that your camera
angle is looking directly at it at an
angle and remember 2d images have no
depth so that's why you might not be
able to see it but for now this tutorial
is getting kind of long so thank you
guys for watching in my next tutorial
I'll clear things up and teach you guys
some other cool 3d tricks but for now
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
