name is buddy Blackford and this is
After Effects cs6 where I'm going to
teach you about how to use different
camera rigs you want to use camera rigs
because the property values on a camera
are all clumped together and I'll show
you what I mean real quick and make a
camera just real quick and pull up
position
for example position doesn't have the
keyframe value separated so maybe you
want to move your camera what set it was
set some keyframes here you want to move
your camera in a few keyframes there but
at this point right here you want to
center it a little better because it's
not very well centered and there then
you're like oh man now I got to go
Center it again to where I wanted it and
you end up getting having all these
keyframes that end up just being
annoying and everything because you
can't split these up the way you want to
with like a regular camera move so I'm
gonna take this off and show you a good
way to make it so you don't have to have
so many keyframes all over the place I'm
gonna make a new camera and I'm using
the default settings which is the 50
millimeter camera and I'm going to also
create a null object a null object is
pretty much nothing and it's used to
parent things to or that's pretty much
it you can put some effects on it it
doesn't have any like visual properties
or anything to us so that's what a null
object is so make that null object 3d
and we're gonna name this one
Orbitz because this camera rig that
we're making is called an orbit camera
rig the other camera rig that we're
gonna make is called a dolly camera rig
so this one is oops I accidently took
off the name somehow and this camera rig
is going to be able to spin around an
object all the way around in a 360
degree motion and it's gonna be perfect
and you're not gonna be able to or
you're not gonna have any camera or key
frames on the camera so the first thing
that we want to do is put this know onto
the object that we want to rotate around
and I have this vector right here so I'm
going to open up its position and then
I'm going to open up this position and
just copy the position values from the
vector onto the position values of the
null by ctrl C oops control C and
control V to paste which if you don't
know the controls C and control V to
paste and cut and all that stuff then
you need to brush up on your basic
hotkeys because those are for everything
even like an internet explorer if you
use that but like in your browser or
anything like that you need to know
those so we have the null now right on
this object here and if I go to my
custom view I can look here and see that
the null is right on him right in the
center of him there is an anchor point
on the null object here and if I click
off of it you can see it I don't know
you can't
well it's in the top-left corner so
that's where the anchor point of the
null object is now let's parent there's
no or parent the camera to the null so
we're gonna do that and now I'm gonna
come out to the top view actually I'm
gonna put up two views for you to use I
always do the wrong one every time
and we're in the top view here and in
this side we're gonna go into our camera
and see what we can see here now let's
go into our null and since we're
orbiting we're going to go into our
rotation values and use the Y rotation
to orbit around this object now this is
the camera down here and just watch how
it goes around the object like that
perfectly around it and you can tell
because the object doesn't move in 3d
space except for on its own axis so
there's your over rig you can keyframe
anything in the null so if a keyframe at
the first frame come out a few frames
and move around here to back to where we
were I guess and then you can also
change your other rotation values here
if you need to so
want to move him on the Z a little bit
not a lot though cuz then I look weird
to give him like a little kind of like
Wiggly feeling I guess you can do that
also so I'm just gonna do a little RAM
preview so you can see what's going on
and there you've got something like if
you have a 3d object and you want to
rotate around it there you go you can
use that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
