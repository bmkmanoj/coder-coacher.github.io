38 PI game tutorial video in this video
we're talking about is how to add a
score to our snake game so once what
we're going to need to do is we're going
to come up to the top of our script here
and we're just going to define a new
function and this is going to be score
so we're gonna say define score and then
the score function is gonna have one
parameter that we passed through it and
if you couldn't guess now it's score so
now within our score function what do we
want to do well our score we want it to
be kind of like up into the left so the
top left side of our screen will do so
that's what we know we want so we're
going to put that there so we already
know basically we have every tool that
we need to put a score at the top left
of our screen so now we're just going to
kind of put together some of the things
that we've learned and recycle it to
make a score so first of all it makes
score we need to use some sort of text
so we're going to say text equals or nu
small font got render and then we're
going to render using that font the
following we're first going to say score
: and then um an actual score column
space + because if we use the comments
gonna treat like a new parameter score +
string version of the skull and then
true and then we will use the color of
black in trees dev capital T and that's
our score now all we have to do is blitt
this to our screen so we go game display
dot lit what do we want to blue it
one of lit text where do we want it now
zero zero we just want to write at the
top left so easy enough to put that up
and that is it obviously we need a game
dot display it up up or game display dot
update to show this but that's okay so
now we want to do is we're going to come
down to our game loop
down here and basically right before
this pygame dot display to update we're
gonna call score so that's easy enough
score and then we have to fill in the
score blank well shoot how are we going
to calculate the score well we could you
know every time we eat an apple we could
say score + equals 1 or something but
that sounds like something we're already
doing right so snake length
we're already adding plus equals 1 every
time we eat an apple the snake length so
why don't we use snake length so for our
score we could just throw in snake
length but snake length starts at 1 so
we don't really want to start at 1 we
start at 0 so it's easy enough we would
say snake length minus 1 and now we have
a score and that's passed through this
is actually a number right this can be
an integer but we convert it to string
up here if you recall so that should be
all we had to do so let's go ahead and
save and run that bad boy see what we
get Oh invalid syntax Andrew string
school oh we forgot comma let's try that
again
welcome to slither to play so we see we
got a score we need an apple and the
score ticks up by one every time so
that's easy enough um just as a another
side oops try to get my snake to go over
to score so I could show you but you can
see how our snake is under the score
depending on what you put up there you
might want to keep that in mind
same thing with the Apple the Apple is
going to generate or should generate I
think under the score let's go back and
look at the code but just remember that
everything is up at an order that it
split so first we are bleeding our snake
right we're drawing our snake to the
screen then the score so actually
hmm where are where the heck are we
drawing the Apple look where is the call
okay
right so we're bleeding the Apple very
first then the snakes the snake in
theory goes above the Apple then the
score which goes above all of that
depending on what you're making
sometimes the wording that you want you
may want that to be on top of everything
or you may want that to be behind
everything so it doesn't become
obstructive to the game just kind of
have to keep that in mind for snake it's
really not a problem if there's an Apple
there in the text is covering it we can
still see it really easily if our snake
is there we can still see our snake
really easily so it's not a big deal but
it is something that you want to keep in
mind that you need to think about that
when you create things like scores and
in other images like and putting on
sprites to the screen and stuff you just
have to keep in mind that it's goes in
the order that you call them so anyways
that was easy enough so that's it with
with our game here I'm pretty content
with the game there might be like some
little subtle things that we want to
change about snake but for the most part
I'd say we have a pretty darn good snake
game here so what's next well chances
are if you've just made your first game
ever
you're kind of excited about it you
might want to show it to your friends or
whatever but your friends might not have
Python and even if they don't have
Python they don't have PI game installed
and all this stuff it's a huge mess and
you're not really able to show off your
epic coding skills but in Python there's
a couple of things that we can do first
of all we can use something like in
Python 2:7 there's a module called PI to
exe and that allows people to share
their Python scripts that way by
converting it to an executable but in
Python 3 hi to exe is not really the
best solution if at all so I use it for
Python 3 is a module called CX freeze so
what we're going to be doing in the next
video 2 or even 3 is covering CX freeze
so that's going to allow you to convert
your PI your PI game to an executable so
somebody can run it on Windows also show
you guys how you can build the
distribution with it so you can actually
even build like in
aller for your game and then after that
and then if you're on Mac I'll show you
a little bit of what you need to do but
then also there's a lot of little things
when it comes to converting your scripts
to executables that we're going to have
to cover especially with PI game because
there's a lot of stuff going in like
some stuff you just wouldn't even
consider like fonts since we're using
system fonts you have to think about
well are those system fonts even
available on other machines and all this
kind of stuff so definitely a lot of
stuff you got to think about when you're
doing it but luckily I'll be able to
help you guys out so we'll talk about
distributing your game and all that in
the next video so stay tuned for that
