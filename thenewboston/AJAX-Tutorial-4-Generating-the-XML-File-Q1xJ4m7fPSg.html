video and what I did is I actually
updated the server or the website so now
basically as you can see what we have is
just a website that doesn't do anything
it says enter the food you like to order
and I write tuna you know we have no
functionality built in yet we can even
hit enter and you know nothing happens
so what we want to do now is we need to
build we're going to start building the
scripts now remember like I said this
program is basically going to consist of
this HTML file which is what you're
looking at right here a PHP file in a
Java Script file now the PHP file is
going to stay on your server and the
JavaScript file is going to be basically
on your the user's computer so that way
the users computer in the PHP file on
your server they can communicate with
each other behind the scenes and all the
user sees is this interface it doesn't
even see the complex stuff that's going
on behind the scenes but of course we
know what's really going on back there
waha
or Dewey let's go ahead and start coding
that right now so file new and let's
just go ahead and PHP and save this as
we'll just go ahead and save this as
food store dot PHP and by the way guys
all of this source code is going to be
available on my forum T&amp;amp;B forum com so
if you know you made a mistake or if
your program isn't working like mine
just go ahead and I go to tnb forum com
or if you go to the New Boston org then
you can go ahead and click a link to the
forum um just go ahead in the PHP
section look for or actually it'll be
under the Ajax section look for this but
anyways um the first thing we need to do
is remember what this is going to do the
PHP file well let me back up remember
what we're learning here we're learning
Ajax asynchronous JavaScript and XML
that pretty much means we're learning
about cool way to use JavaScript and XML
together now this is why we need a PHP
file in this because the PHP file is
going to Jen
the XML the XML file and then it's going
to send the XML file to the clients
computer so remember the JavaScript file
it sees XML file even though it was
generated from PHP code pretty confusing
but you'll see I know it sounds complex
but it's actually really simple once you
see this example so the first thing we
need to do is make a header and the
header will just go ahead and put
content type might as well do everything
proper text slash XML now with this
basically means is we're going to we're
basically telling it's basically
housekeeping these first couple lines
I'm going to build basically basically
saying we're going to be generating XML
content remember not to put FML because
that's something completely different
and if you make a mistake you might say
FML but you know I'm getting off-track
so basically this is just a housekeeping
thing whenever we generate an XML file
with PHP another thing that we want to
do is we want echo got to be careful to
type everything right this time XML and
I actually want to put my ending tags
right there XML version and these are if
you never work with XML file it pretty
much has like attributes and values just
like a HTML file but the version is 1.0
and and don't worry about what all this
stuff means because it's all
housekeeping you need this anytime arm
you generate an XML file with PHP but
the encoding is utf-8 and stand-alone
equals yes and we write this because I'm
actually standing alone right now in my
room so I'm just kidding but you
actually need that because it's
housekeeping so make sure you have the
version encoding and standalone equals
yes and by the way this is the only time
you're going to have to see me type this
for the rest of the time I'll just skip
over it
now so this is basically what you need
whenever you're making any xml file just
for housekeeping purposes now what we
need to do now is we need to make an XML
element so we start off by echoing and
we'll just go ahead and name this
element response response now all of our
code is going to be sent in between the
beginning response tag in the ending
response tag right here so remember the
response right here is what the
JavaScript file is going to see and it's
basically going to say ok this is what
we're going to output under the input
right here it's either going to say arm
we don't have that food or we don't have
tuna or yes we do have cheeseburgers or
something like that so that's what we're
going to be creating dynamically using
PHP so the first thing we want to do is
actually let me tighten this up a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
