make a video real quick going over an
over view of intel processors now I got
a request on my website the New Boston
calm where someone was building the
computer and they had seen the whole
series of Intel processors and they
didn't really know what one to choose so
I decided to make a guide to help you
guys choose and learn the difference
between intel processors so the oldest
processor you're probably going to come
across is called the Celeron processor
and this is a pretty old processor 4
intel in the gigahertz range from 0.2 26
or excuse me 0.26 6 from 3-point three
gigahertz and that's only for a single
core the seller ons only have a single
core so you don't have to worry about
that but since they have located her
speed and a single core i would not
recommend the seller rounds for any
build the next processor you're going to
come across is the pentium series now
pentium series is a huge series it's
Intel's biggest series of processor they
may like eight thousand different kinds
of Pentium processors they range from
the 4 series to the m series now they
max out at 3.8 gigahertz which is decent
for a processor and that's for a single
core two and the dual cores of the
Pentiums they max out at three point
seven three gigahertz so on both of
these are a decent speed in another
thing about opinions is they have pretty
good l2 cache which is pretty much the
built-in memory so that's going to help
speed up your presser performance too
and the Pentiums are good for basic
built but I'm not really good if you if
you're building a high-performance
computer or anything like that so after
the Pentiums the next step up is or some
people think it's a step up it's called
the dual-core processors now the
dual-core processors are different from
the core two processors so you want to
keep an eye out
for that um these max out I believe 2.5
gigahertz and their cash in the front
side bus on the court I mean the dual
dual cores isn't that impressive so I
would not recommend getting a dual core
intel processor but the next series the
core two processors I would highly
recommend getting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
