slash on live gamer for the New Boston
in this tutorial we're going to continue
working on our paint program now if this
is it this isn't familiar to you you may
want to move back to the beginning of
these tutorials and once again this
program is from the book beginning
Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by fear on
Willis and Brian Newsome post by rocks
it's a great book but there are better
books out there it's still good for a
beginning so beginners to learn and it
takes you through making a whole bunch
of programs so let's go ahead and
continue what we were doing so here is
our paint canvas class we've got our
enumerations the graphic sizes and the
graphics tools so we'll go ahead and put
those two together now let's go ahead
and create some public variables so
public variables and let's make an
ArrayList so public graphics items as
new ArrayList
and we're going to create a graphics
tool so public graphic tool as
graphics tools
and we're going to set that equal to
graphics tools dot circle pin because
that is our only option and now will
cute we will create the graphic sighs so
public graphics size as graphic sizes
and then
we're going to set it equal to graphic
sizes
dot medium so we'll just make the brush
medium-sized right now and now we're
going to need one more variable so
public graphics color as colored and
we'll set it equal to color dot black
let's go ahead and add an S right there
so these are all matched up so here we
have our graphics item ArrayList and
this is going to hold a whole bunch of
graphics items object now it can also
hold graphics circle objects because the
graphic circles inherit from the
graphics items they are treated as a
graphics items object even though that
an ArrayList can hold any data type
we're gonna be filling it with types
even graphics items or graphics circles
and then we have our graphics tool which
is the circle pin which is what we're
going to be drawing on the paint canvas
with and say circle pin we've got our
graphic size which is set to medium
which will be 10 and just kind of a
little bit of spoiler 10 is gonna be the
side of the square so it's gonna be a 10
by 10 square it's going to create a
circle out of that so it's gonna have a
circle with a diameter of 10 pixels and
then we have our color our graphics
color which is going to be equal to
black that's pretty self-explanatory
okay so now we need to make some private
methods so we'll just call this one
private and we'll make it a sub because
it doesn't return anything and it will
call it do Mouse paint and what we're
gonna need for a do Mouse paint is a
some arguments so we're just gonna need
1 arguments and we're gonna by Val E as
Mouse event args so E is gonna be the
arguments and what its gonna let us do
is it's gonna let us get the x position
and the y position of
where the mouse is on the screen so what
we've used Mouse event arts before in
the program that animated a-squared so
under doo-doo mouse paint what we're
gonna do is create a new object so we'll
call it object graphics item as graphics
item so now we have a graphics items
item object you can see that's got a
little green line under it because we
haven't used it yet so now we're gonna
select which tool we are using so we'll
use a select case here but because we
are only using one there's only one
possible thing for this we're gonna only
need one select case here now the reason
we're doing select case is in case we
want to add more to our program later on
we can just add some items to our select
case and add some items to our
numeration and our programs gonna work
on the same way it did but we're gonna
have some more options now this is a
good thing to do when you're making
programs is to make it so that you can
expand your program and so it's easier
to add more stuff in the future so we'll
just add case graphics tool or graphics
tools dot circle pin
so if circle pin is selected what do we
want to do we want to create a new
object of graphics circle so we'll just
declare it so object graphics circle and
we're gonna make a new graphics circle
object so you can see we have it right
here which is what we created and it
doesn't take any arguments so now that
we've created our object of graphics
circle which is going to draw a circle
on the screen what we want to do is we
want to set the point for that
so object graphics circle dot set point
it's gonna take our X position our y
position our size color and is filled so
to get our x position what we want to do
is type e dot X so for our mouse event
args and a dot X is going to hold the x
position position of the mouse and then
we're gonna do a dot Y for the y
coordinates and if we come over here to
graphic circle or graphics item I mean
we have set points it's gonna take the
eggs and to subtract graphics size
divided by 2 from it which basically
just sets wherever your mouse in the
middle of your mouse is to the center of
the circle instead of the top-left
corner
so come back over here to paint canvas
dot B B and then we're gonna need to
fill in the rest of the arguments so for
the third argument we're just gonna do
graphics size so and then we're gonna
need graphic color so let's find the
name up here this gets a little
confusing graphics color and then we're
going to need the graphics is filled so
for this we're just gonna use true
because we do want to fill our circle
now you can play with this and set that
equal to false if you want and see what
happens later on so now what we need to
do is we need to store this item so that
we can add it to our ArrayList so object
graphics item equals object graphics
circle now we have objects graphics
items which is a type graphics items so
this variable right here is of type
graphics item but because object
graphics circle which is a graphic
circle inherits from graphics items we
can use polymorphism to set this equal
to a subclass of itself
so we're gonna add more to this sub when
we get back
it's just I'm running out of time in
this tutorial so if you have any
questions leave them in the comments and
if not go ahead and move forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
