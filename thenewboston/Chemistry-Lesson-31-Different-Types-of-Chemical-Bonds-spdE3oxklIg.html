31st chemistry tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be going over
the different types of bonds and I know
what you're saying you're like Bucky
already told me covalent and ionic well
it gets even deeper than that and I'm
actually going to show you guys a cool
way to predict the type of bond that can
form between elements based on the
electronegativity of that element so
let's go ahead and talk about some bonds
that we are already familiar with
hydrogen bonding with hydrogen now
whenever this happens we already know
that it forms a covalent bond basically
they share the electrons now why does
this happen exactly well if we take a
look at the electronegativity of each
one this hydrogen has 2.1 and this
hydrogen also has an electronegativity
of 2.1 so whenever electrons are in the
middle deciding which hydrogen to
circular around or orbit around they're
saying okay well they have the same so I
guess we'll just orbit around both of
them just like that you know makes a
pattern a little more neat than that but
that was the best I could do so
basically depending on the
electronegativity of each of these
elements if they are both the exact same
then we make something called a non
polar nonpolar covalent we already know
what covalent means bond now nonpolar
pretty much means equal I'll just go
ahead and put it in really incredibly
simple terms so this means the equal
covalent bond in other words the two
elements have the same electronegativity
or they are really really close now this
isn't always the case you have in some
instances something called a polar let
me go ahead and write that a bit neater
polar
covalent bond now this happens in the
case of say you would have let me think
of something a hydrogen and a bromine
now bromine has electronegativity of two
point eight in hydrogen of course two
point one so whenever we would draw this
we would of course get the hydrogen and
actually we probably don't even need to
draw this but it annoys me whenever I
don't draw the valence electrons so what
we have is the hydrogen and the bromine
would share this pair of electrons right
here in the middle however it wouldn't
share them equally because since bromine
has a stronger electronegativity of two
point eight in hydrogen only has
electronegativity of two point one the
electrons would be more strongly
attracted to the bromine so pretty much
they would tend to gravitate towards the
bromine more and if you would look at
the electron path it would may look
something like this that's a really bad
drawing I'm going to go ahead and get
rid of that but if they're pretty much
more likely to be gravitating around the
bromine rather than the hydrogen because
the bromine has a stronger
electronegativity a stronger pull and we
call this a polar covalent bond now
polar pretty much just means unequal
they're more likely to gravitate towards
one side as opposed to the other side
and we already know what covalent means
when they share and we already know what
bond is from like James Bond double O
seven that's where I learn most of my
terminology from nintendo 64 so the last
type of bond we have is of course ionic
and there's only one type of ionic bond
thank god now an ionic bond can form
between two elements and we know that
they don't share anything at all so say
we have an a CL which is sodium chloride
in sodium let me go ahead and find the
color has electronegativity of 0.9 which
means it's actually really weak and
chlorine has an electronegativity of 3.0
so whenever one element is so much
stronger
and the other element then it could
actually cause an electron from the
sodium to pop over and hop right on top
of that chlorine so again actually steal
an electron if that force is strong
enough now you're saying okay how do I
know if the force is going to be strong
enough or not well hold on I got like
Fleming my thrill for me like 30 chicken
wings about an hour ago
but anyways so the difference in
electronegativity can determine which
type of bonds that will form if you have
a difference of 0 to 0.2 then you have a
nonpolar covalent bond if you have
electronegativity probably she left me
some space here of 0.3 to 1.4 then
that's when you have a polar covalent
bond and if you have a difference
between two elements that is 1.5 and
above then the difference is so strong
that it forms the ionic bond in other
words it steals one of those electrons
and pretty much it steals it so this is
again well you are do you know I'm not
going to explain ionic bonds again go
watch my tutorial on ionic bonds if you
want to know how these elements are
bonded together but anyways that's
difference and those are the numerical
values and no I just didn't make those
up that's what the science book is
telling me so anyways um thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I will see you guys in the next
