how to create an immutable array in
other words an array that can't be
changed we set an array and that's our
array for the rest of the program but
saying we wanted to create an array that
you know maybe we didn't know how many
things we're gonna put in it how many
objects and maybe we one like delete an
object later on and replace it with
another one well if you want to do
anything weird like this then what you
need to do is create an mutable array
and this is actually kind of similar to
creating a regular NS array but it's in
a different class NS mutable array look
at that I already filled it in and go
ahead and name it something I'm going to
name mine change me since we can change
this array and in order to create it
what you need to do is set it equal to
it NS mutable array of course that's
class and to give it an idea first of
all how much how many objects you wanted
to hold array with capacity go ahead and
type in however many numbers
hold on gotta itch in my ear there we go
however many objects you think it's
going to hold and I'm gonna set mine to
default at 25 now the cool thing about
mutable array is if you add more than 25
objects then your program you're not
going to freak out it's gonna
automatically change the size of your
array to fit the needs of your program
so say instead of 25 you accidentally
put in 28 objects it's not going to send
you an error message it's just gonna
automatically increase the capacity of
your array so this is pretty much just
giving an idea since we need to build
something to start out so the first
thing I want to add what to do is
manually add objects to the end of Virna
right now go ahead and remember the
arrays name is change me and in order to
add an object to it
go ahead there's a built-in method
called add object pretty cool and I'm
going to be adding numbers to this array
but again we're 43 that's just a data
type we don't want to add numbers right
like that we want to actually add
objects
see add objects and remember I told you
that whenever you want to create a
number object you type NS number this is
from the number remember we talked about
number object string objects here's what
you do you type NS number and then
create number with integer and then you
type in what value and let's say our
program by the way is going to store
create an array of all the even numbers
from two to a hundred so we already
added two that's a good starting point
let's go ahead and add four to you know
to give it a little bit some momentum so
four and go ahead and do this 50 times
and add a hundred I'm just kidding
there's a lot easier way to do that I
mean we already gave it two and four but
now we have to do six through a hundred
no way I'm not typing all that manually
what I'm gonna do is make a loop to
automatically add the even number six to
100 so why not how to do that well you
are in luck because I'm about to show
you and I said this equal to six
so you start at six where do you end
make sure I is less than or equal to 100
you just can't put less than my eyes
lesson 101 but just put that and now
what we want to do is we want to loop
through two at a time we're gonna go six
eight ten we don't want to go six seven
eight nine ten we only want the even so
go ahead and put I plus equals two and
this is going to loop through six to 100
by twos so now for each time it loops
through the first one is going to be six
second one's gonna be eight third is 10
so on and so forth so now what we can do
is go ahead and do this exact same thing
add a number object but instead of
typing in the number manually just put
an eye and what this is gonna do is
gonna loop through in each time it comes
across a new number new even number it's
automatically gonna plop it on the under
view array so now at this point right
here we got an array of objects of
number objects from two 200 all of the
even numbers so
now we want to see some proof that this
actually works so let's go ahead and
display the array so in order to display
their array let's go ahead and make
another for loop and put X I don't like
to use and I again set this equal to
zero this is what we want to start and
how far in the array do we want to go
we'll check this out X is less than and
you want to say well how many members
are in the array sometimes you know
sometimes you don't I mean we could have
put 50 but maybe it's 51 maybe it's 49
maybe something weird happened check
this out
if you automatically want to get the
length of your array but change me which
is the array name and count and this is
automatically gonna count how many
objects are in your array so this is
awesome this is pretty much what you
should do every time when you're looping
through an array because I mean you
could type like 50 manually but
sometimes you have like one-off or you
know sometimes you don't get it exactly
you don't want to have a bunch of weird
error messages and this is a foolproof
way to get it right every time and of
course we wanted to loop through them
once at a time because remember we're
looping through the array index and this
is of course starts at 0 goes through 1
2 3 4 or 5
this isn't 2 4 6 8 10 that's the what's
in the array the array index still
starts at 0 goes from 1 2 3 4 5 and so
on and so forth so NSLog at and let's go
ahead what item should now this pot item
here is % I looks good so far
so now all we want to do is make sure
you add change me objects at index and
here is rewrite all right if I could get
this selected
there we go obviously exit index X so
what we're going to be doing right now
is looping through the array and each
index or each member of the array is an
object so we're going to loop through
each object but we don't want to print
out the object because well I'll show
you look what happens if you print out
the object you get all this weird stuff
thousand this is the object right here
we want to find what the integer value
in that object is so what we want to do
is but I already filled in the other
bracket for us that's pretty cool
integer value just like that now
remember all these 1000 these are the
where the object is stored so now let's
go ahead and save and check it out oh
yeah beautiful program right here the
item index zero is two item at index one
is for item at index two is six index
three is eight and so on and so forth
until you get a hundred which is the
last one and check this out remember at
the beginning where we said array with
capacity 25 well I mean there are more
than 25 numbers in here so that's the
beauty 25 is right here so what it did
is it automatically since there's a
mutable array automatically added more
room for objects as the program needed
it
so that's difference between a mutable
and immutable array mutable ones are
pretty much a lot cooler and again this
is how you automatically add elements to
your array and this my friend is how you
loop through each object and print out
the integer value whatever is stored at
that index so with that being said we
are ready to move on to the next subject
I mean this is enough with arrays for
now we've got the basics of mutable and
immutable I mean we can probably build
some pretty sweet programs from now but
I don't know what I'm gonna be teaching
in next but it's going to be awesome and
we are one step closer to iPhones
