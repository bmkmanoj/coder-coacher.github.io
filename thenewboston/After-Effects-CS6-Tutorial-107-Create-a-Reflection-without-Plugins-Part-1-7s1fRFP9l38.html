Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and in
this tutorial I want to go over how to
create some fake reflections without
using plugins in After Effects
now these reflections aren't going to be
as cool as some of the plugins you can
find out in the internet but if you
don't have any of those or you can't
find any plugins then just you can use
this technique and it'll get the job
done - pretty much a satisfactory result
so what we need to do is we have a comp
made here and I need to import some
stuff so I'm going to come here to my
images I'm just going to import my image
of the floor that I have if I can find
it wooden background there we go
and I need to create a camera also
because this is going to be in 3d so
here's my camera and I want to set it to
50 millimeter because that's what I like
hit OK and now I've got this wooden
background I'm gonna make it 3d and I'm
gonna rotate this so it's a floor so I'm
gonna go to my orientation and rotate it
on this X on the first axis here the x
axis I'm gonna go 180 and see what that
gives me nope not that much
and then drag it down and now we can see
that there's a floor there now it's a
little too big so I'm going to scale it
down a little bit so it looks kind of
more real there we go so now we've got a
floor going on here
and drag it down a little more scale it
down a little more all right I'm gonna
turn off my transparency and actually
I'm gonna throw up just a black
background in there just for looks all
the way in the back okay now what we
need to do is bring in something to
create a reflection off of so let's just
select any picture here and let's see if
I can find one this is halfway decent
there we go drag this in and we're also
gonna make that a 3d layer and what I
want to do is set the anchor point of
this layer to the very bottom so what
I'm gonna do is press a for anchor point
and click on it the anchor point here
and press right click and click on edit
value' and I want to change my units
here to percent of source and set DX to
50 and then the Y to 100 and that's
going to put a rate at the bottom and
that's a quick way for you to get right
to the bottom if you're trying to do
that there so I'm gonna drag this down
to where it's rate intersecting with
with the ground I'm gonna check my views
to make sure this is in like oh this is
in a good position so it's right in the
middle which is what we want
unfortunately lights and after-effects
they don't cast reflections so this is
why I'm teaching you how to make the
reflections in like a fake way so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna duplicate
this a picture that we have and we're
gonna go to the scale property
unlike the scale and make this negative
100 and all that's gonna do is flip the
image so I'm in my custom view now and I
can look down here and the image is just
flipped so there we go for that and
being in your custom view helps a lot
for this so now we have the problem that
the wooden background is over top of
this picture that we have here so we
need to put the wooden background our
wooden floor here in between and then
we're gonna go to toggle switches and
modes and we're gonna set that to screen
and now you can see how this might be
able to show off as a reflection now
what I want to do is make sure that when
I animate any positions or anything like
that for my picture here that it pretty
much is it's parented to the other
picture so first of all I need to rename
my objects so that they don't get
confused so I'm going to change this one
to bush reflection and then I'm gonna
parent this bush reflection to the
regular Bush there and then I'm going to
switch these so the reflection is
underneath the wood the next thing I
need to do is set the track mat of the
reflection here to alpha mat and now the
wooden background is gone so I need to
turn it back on
and it's just going to cut out the Alpha
part over where the the reflection is
and now since the reflection is probably
too long and doesn't really totally look
like a reflection we need to add some
effects to it so let's go to effect and
we're gonna add a transition called
linear wipe we're gonna set that linear
wipe to 180 for the wipe angle so when
we wipe it's gonna just go straight up
and down and transition complete we're
gonna make that so it's not as long and
then we're gonna feather it out so it
looks like the reflection is fading off
so we have that going on there let's
check our camera to see what it looks
like looks like we need to zoom our
camera out a little
so if I can zoom it out too much because
the floor is too far so let me bring the
floor forward using this wine here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
