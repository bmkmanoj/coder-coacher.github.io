wonderful app review and this F is for a
little game called let's golf and it's
pretty much the coolest golfing game you
can get on your iPod or iPhone so it
starts out this little video we don't
really need to wash it you can if you
want go ahead and click done and this
gives you a entry screen and the cool
thing about this is it gives you a bunch
of different modes that you can play I
always go ahead and tap that I always
put instant play because I don't have
the attention span planned hangouts and
just go ahead and pick your person and
the mother thing I do is I always pick
Elena um I don't really look at her
stats but she is the cutest on the game
so I'm gonna go ahead and pick her it
and now it gives you a three random
holes to play and there are over sixty
holes in this game so I mean you can't
really run out of things to do and just
for like a little app this is like one
of the coolest and most advanced I mean
any 3d app is pretty cool but for this
one it's awfully awesome so what you do
is the first thing I do is click on this
little piece right here and this gives
you where kind of a bird's eye view of
we're gonna shoot so we just go ahead
and click that again to uh go back to
normal view and another thing if you
want to move right or left let's go
ahead and tap the screen to the right of
her left or right and if you want to
change your golf club just go ahead and
press this little button right here and
this can change your golf club but it
usually gives you the best one by
default so let's go ahead and just do
the shot so in order to shoot if you
ever play like n64 it's pretty much any
a call from game ever made
it's pretty much the same just this
button is the same for power
go ahead until you get full power and
then on your backswing its accuracy and
while your ball is in the air you can go
ahead and put spin on it and why they
why you can put spin on your ball while
it's in the air
I don't know
I mean it's the easiest way and a couple
things you wanted to do is take into
account your wind direction right here
and also I mean that's it really and why
she's using wood on fairway I don't know
but I'm gonna go with it so that looks
pretty good right there they pretty much
aligned you up and give you the club you
need to begin with but sometimes it's a
little messed up so sometimes you need
to change it so let me go ahead and
finish this hole and right there and why
that's pretty much perfect I'm pretty
much awesome at this game so we roll it
forward because it is going further and
did you hear that
nice shot they're impressed so let me go
ahead and ship this in looks good and
what I want to do here is pretty much
just go to the flag and the accuracy
like that and maybe put some backspin on
it like this and wow wow you guys see
that I'm glad I was recording one into
that and you usually have to play
yourself but once you have an awesome
shot like that one I mean they just
output for you so that's pretty much it
for this tutorial and actually this is
an Totoro it's a little walkthrough
gameplay so I'm birdy right now I'm
going to continue my instant playing
probably set a new record because I am
osmanthus and again like I said this
game is one one of the best golfing
games on a review on the App Store it's
a three and a half out of five
I don't know that why they rated at
three and a half out of five it deserves
a lot more I'm gonna go ahead and rate
it an 8 out of 10 because I mean it
doesn't have any ads on that the
graphics are awesome and it's really a
dipping and last but not least it's only
199 by highly recommend it it's
definitely worth it so thank you guys
