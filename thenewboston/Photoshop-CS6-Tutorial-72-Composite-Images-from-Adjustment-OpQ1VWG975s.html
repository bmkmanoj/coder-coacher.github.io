Photoshop cs6 tutorial and this is buddy
Blackford here teaching you about how to
create a temporary composite image now
in the previous tutorial the one right
before this we talked about merging
adjustment and layers and the way we did
that was merging the adjustment layers
with the image that you were actually
trying to adjust so they all merged into
one and created just one picture and you
didn't really have control over the
adjustment layers anymore and that also
made the adjustment layers disappear now
what if you don't really want to do that
you want to do something different and
create a new or create the look but you
don't want the adjustment layers to go
away or anything like that well that's
possible by creating a composite layer
and the best way to teach you about what
a composite layer is is to pretty much
just show you what to show you how to do
it and then you'll know so we what you
need to do is I have an image that you
want to put some adjustment layers on
and then make two or more adjustment
layers here actually you could do just
one if you wanted to so what we're gonna
do now is create a new blank layer at
the top and make sure you have that
layer selected now on your keyboard hold
down the Alt key or if you're using a
Mac you want to hold down the option key
and we're gonna click and hold on the
layers options here and you have to
click and hold on it because it it'll
just go away if you just try to click on
it and just come down because we had all
button hold that held down and I'm gonna
come down here to merge your visible and
now you can see that my blink layer has
now been populated with the composite
image if I turn off all these here we
can see that this layer is now the all
of the
adjustment layers and the background
layer combined so that's pretty cool and
that's a good way to still have all
these other things intact and this way
is in my opinion better than the one I
showed last time but I like to show both
are different types of things and
because everybody else has different
preferences it's not my way or the
highway and Photoshop
pretty much always gives you two or more
ways to do something for pretty much
everything there is so just remember
that there you can always do a bunch of
different things so might as well go
over that again real quick so I'm gonna
turn back on all my layers I'm just
gonna delete this layer out so what
we're gonna do is make sure you have
your adjustment layers above and then
your other layer that you want the
adjustments to be applied to on the
bottom create a new layer have that
layer selected make sure it's a blank
layer hold down alt or option click and
hold and come down to merge visible and
make sure you have the Alt key down the
whole time and then that creates your
composite layer or your composite image
and just use that to show off to your
client or something like that and that
way you don't have to go back into the
history or undo anything stuff like that
you still have your adjustment layers
here so that's my cool little quick
little tip that I wanted to show you
guys for this tutorial and I hope you
liked it hopefully it comes in useful
thanks everybody and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
