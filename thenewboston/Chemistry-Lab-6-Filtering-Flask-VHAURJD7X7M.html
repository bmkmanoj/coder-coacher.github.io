this video I want to talk to you guys
about the filtering flask now a
filtering flask looks a lot like an
Erlenmeyer flask but it has a little
sidearm on the side right there
now this sidearm is so you can hook up a
vacuum tube to it and that's pretty much
what I'm gonna be showing you guys later
but the overall job of a filtering flask
is the pretty much speed up filtration
so let me go ahead and show you guys you
know a quick example of filtration and
it'll be easier to understand exactly
how this thing works now in order to use
a filtering flask right here you
actually need more than just the
filtering flask you need a whole bunch
of stuff and this stuff is actually
usually sold in a kit I got all of these
as one kit including the paper so let me
go ahead and go through the pieces right
now of course I already talked to you
guys about the filtering flask itself
this thing right here is called a
Buechner funnel and this is essentially
gonna go inside here and it just makes
pouring the mixture in a little bit
easier and aside from that you have a
rubber stopper and this is just to make
a good seal between the funnel and the
flask aside from that you have your
vacuum pump I have a hand pump because I
really don't do a lot of filtering so I
can just do mine in my hand but other
systems more complex systems are
actually built right into the lab like
whenever you go to a college or anything
but mine is just a simple hand pump and
the last thing you need is filter paper
now this is kind of like a coffee filter
but smaller and you know more scientific
of course now in order to set this up
the first thing you want to do is you
want to make sure you have a hose
connected on your vacuum pump I assume
that you're using a hand pump like me
now to take the other end of the hose
and put it tightly on your filter flask
and you can use a little oil if it goes
on there tightly and you don't need to
get it all the way on you just need a
you know have enough to make a good
connection so that there's no air
leaking it seal so after that go ahead
and take your rubber stopper and put it
right on your filtering flask like that
now you put this on because what we're
essentially going to do is we're going
to add the funnel on top so it makes the
solution easier to go
flask however if you just have it like
this it's gonna be really loose and we
don't like loose things of course so
what we need to do is we need to use a
special stopper then well it pretty much
came with a kit so go ahead and put that
on and then go ahead and put your funnel
on just like that and look at that nice
and tight beautiful now this is my
mixture right here it's just a really
simple mixture I made for demonstration
just some sand and some water so
basically what we're going to do is
we're going to filter the same from the
water so we're going to be pouring this
in the top of beacon or funnel right
here but before we do what we want to do
is we want to add a piece of filter
paper so we can get a more fine
filtration now as you can see this paper
is just kind of you know it doesn't make
a really good seal so in order to you
know make this paper stick to the funnel
a little bit better before we start
pouring our mixture in just go ahead and
grab a little water and as you can see
whenever I pour it on the filter paper
right here it's gonna make that paper
stick to the funnel and make a real good
seal and this doesn't mess up your
experiment at all because this water is
actually part of the mixture itself so
now as you can see our paper makes a
really good seal and none of our mixture
is going to go between the sides of the
paper in the funnel so now of course the
only thing left to do is to go ahead and
filter our mixture so as you can see I
have a mixture of sand and water here
now I'm going to go ahead and pour all
of this in the top of the funnel and
there's gonna be a little bit of sand
left over and usually what you would
want to do if you're doing this for real
sorry about the noise is you would
basically want to rinse this out with
water just to make sure that you know
there's no sand left over but just for
this demonstration um it doesn't really
matter if they're sand leftover or not
now as you can see this is filtering of
course but it's going really slow drip
by drip by drip
and this sory it's going to take about
an hour to get all that water
you know separated from the sand so what
you do is you actually again make sure
you have a good connection here I'm
going to go ahead and start pumping and
whenever I do keep an eye on this you
know water right here it's going to turn
from a drip to a stream and let me go
ahead and start pumping right now and
check that out
now what's happening here is this vacuum
is basically creating negative pressure
so basically it's taking all the air
from this bottle and sucking it out now
whenever it sucks it out it pretty much
pulls down the water faster leaving you
with nothing but dry sand on top so
again basically what this does is it
speeds up the filtration process by a
lot and it does that again exactly like
I said and instead of this process
taking you know an hour or two I just
felt through that entire mixture and
about I don't know 20 seconds probably</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
