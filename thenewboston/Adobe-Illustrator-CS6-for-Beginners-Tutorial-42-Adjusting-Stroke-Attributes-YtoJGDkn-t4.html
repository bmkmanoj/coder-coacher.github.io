Illustrator cs6 tutorial today we're
gonna learn how to change the attributes
of the stroke that you put onto your
object the stroke panel which is if you
go to window and then you come here to
stroke has a bunch of different options
that you can use so click on this the
options part and go to show options and
we're gonna have all these options that
we're able to use we have the option to
change the way of our stroke the we can
change the alignment of a stroke on the
path we can change how the ends of the
stroke are it could be round it could be
square and I'll go over all that stuff
with you so the first thing we've got a
few things here here this is a line
segment with a stroke of nine points so
all I did was use the line segment tool
this is a circle with a stroke on it
I've also six points and this is text
with a stroke on it of two points now
move this over here so I could see let's
start out with this circle here let's
start out with the weight over here then
we can choose from a bunch of different
weights if I set at one that's the basic
it's just one pixel wide I come out to
like nine don't make sure it's selected
and then go to nine it's gonna be a lot
fatter so that's depending on what you
want and as you can see on the blue line
is our path that's where the original
circle ends up the the actual bluish
green part of the circle that's where it
actually goes out to so the stroke goes
out from the middle of this path and
comes out from both sides that's how we
have it set up right now at least the
next thing we've got here is cap so I'm
going to come over here to this a line
segment and click on it then we're going
to mess with the caps
we can use a rounded cap and now if we
look at this line segment and now has
rounded edges kind of like how the
stickman is in those stickman fights and
then we also have projecting cap if I
click on that it's also square or but
the the thing about the projecting cap
is that it goes out past the path the
butt cap is what this one was called
that goes right to the edge of the cap
right to the edge of the path as you can
see if you look at the blue line in the
path all right now we know those let's
check it out on the text let's do a
rounded and you can't really tell
anything with that
and here's projecting hmm not much is
going on with the with the text as you
can see so what should we use let's try
with corner here if we go this is miter
joint this one is rounded join I don't
know if you can see it very well I'll
zoom in on the text especially look here
where this K end of this K is where were
my Mouse's bye click back on it and then
I hit brown join you can see that the
end caps are a little bit more round now
if I go to bevel join they come off at
like they get cut off at an angle like a
square same with the side of this e and
everything like that now you guys can
probably see the difference here all
right let me zoom back out I'm gonna
just hit fit to screen the other one
we've got here is a line stroke and I
think that will probably be best shown
on this circle here if I hit the left
one is this is gonna align stroke to the
center and this is what it's already
doing it's the stroke is coming off from
the left and the right or from both
sides of this path if I hit a line
stroke to inside
the stroke is only coming out into the
object if I hit a line stroke to outside
it's only going to come outside of the
object so it's up to you what you want
I'll just set it back to the middle
another thing we've got is - - line so
let me grab this line here let me click
on dashed line we can set up the dashes
and gaps if we want to these are these
ones here preserves exact - and gap
lengths and this one aligns - is the
corners so it's up to you what you want
to use but as you can see the dashes on
this aren't exactly symmetrical all the
time this one's all skinny and these
ones are longer so you can set up your -
the length here so if I set this to look
just like to point gonna be a bunch of
dashed lines and then you can also put a
gap and then another - and then a gap in
with it so that's cool about the - two
lines got some arrowheads you can make
arrows at the ends I take off the dashed
line there's how you make an arrow and
then I can make like a arrow and there
and there's how you make like that's an
arrow I don't know if it'll do it on the
circle I've never actually tried yeah it
does so if I wanted to make like a
double circle arrow kind of thing it
doesn't look like it works both ways but
there you go you can scale down the
arrow so it's not so big
or all that stuff then you got that you
can link and swap and then you can also
align to the end of the path or to the
tip of the path and that's all I'm gonna
be going over with the stroke and now
you know how to create arrows you can
adjust a stroke where it is you have a
lot more fine-tuning to your stroke so
that's awesome
I also sounded kind of perverted let me
make this end cap yeah there we go
that's cool so thanks for watching this
you guys it was a stroke is one of the
things that's really nice with design
it's still in to use strokes that helps
bring out the color in objects and
brings more emphasis on the edges and
makes things more refined I guess and
definitive so thanks a lot for watching
this one hopefully you guys liked it if
you did give it a thumbs up and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
