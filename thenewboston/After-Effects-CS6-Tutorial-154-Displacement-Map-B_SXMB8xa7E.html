my name is buddy Blackford and this is
After Effects cs6 and today I want to
teach you about the displacement map
compound effect and a compound effect
from what you can find about more in my
last tutorial it's pretty much in effect
that uses another layer to affect it
even more and you have to have another
layer on the effect to have the actually
work now sometimes the layers that you
pick need to be like certain have
certain properties or be a certain way
and this is true the displacement map so
we're going to create something like
this displacement effect that I have on
this text here and what it does is it
displaces where the actual text is and
moves it around so I'll just do a quick
play on this and you can see what's
going on the actual text moves around
let me zoom in actually so that it's
actually moving around the edges and
everything like that so that's pretty
cool-looking I guess so what's uh let's
get started and I'll show you how to do
it so we're just going to create some
regular text I'm going to delete
everything off so just pick some text
I'm going to delete all my other stuff I
have my layers shied so that all the
extra stuff doesn't I'm pretty all that
doesn't show up like so it doesn't
confuse you so I got like stuff for
other tutorials in here that I don't
want to confuse everybody so shy those
layers so you don't have to look at them
so right now we're starting off with a
regular piece of text let me throw the
displacement map effect on there by
typing in to displace and then you it's
under this section called distort and
displacement map and we'll put it right
on the text now as the first layer our
first property here we need a
displacement
map lair and if we come down to the next
property we can use the red-green-blue
or alpha channel for displacement lair
luminance to lightness saturation on all
these other things here so remember that
when you're using picking something for
your displacement map it doesn't have to
be just like a black and white image it
could be like something that's like red
and black or something like that
depending on what channel you want to
use so I'm going to create a
displacement map using fractal noise
because that's pretty cool-looking so
what we're going to do is go to layer
new sup we're going to go to a new solid
and we're going to call this fractal
noise make sure it's the comp size and
hit OK and it gives us some white here
man I didn't even spell fractal right
but it doesn't matter let's go to effect
and we're going to go to noise and grain
we're going to go to fractal noise now I
used fractal noise to make smoke in the
creepy - logo tutorial and I could have
used it to mess around with the edges if
I wanted to but I didn't I wanted to
show you like another effect and besides
fractal noise to be able to do that with
and I was hoping that you guys might
have been able to figure it out that you
could have done that on your own but I
didn't show the distortion yet back in
that tutorial or or compound effects for
that matter
so let's get get on with it we're going
to put this to smeary so fractal type -
smeary and it gives us like this gross
looking thing noise type soft linear
keep it like that we can up to contrast
a little and if we look in here there's
a lot of extra like small lines in here
and these small lines like this stuff is
going to affect what are how much it
like affects our text and it this is
like too much we don't want this much
for it to affect
texts so we're going to come down here
into the sub settings which is going to
manage these small lines we're going to
set all this stuff to zero
so and now we get all this plain stuff
so that's all you had to do is these two
and set them at zero now what's a we can
mess with our contrasts a little bit to
give what we want maybe we want
something like this then we've got our
complexity here that we can mess around
with let's see and not really doing too
much with the complexity I'll just keep
it where it was make up my contrast a
little more so I got that 128 and then
what I want to do is keyframe the
evolution so I'll come start a keyframe
at the beginning and then come to the
end of my stuff here so I'm about seven
seconds in so that's good for a half a
revolution and that's what it looks like
so that's a pretty cool looking now if I
go to the red Channel and just look at
that by clicking on this button here and
going to the red Channel you can see
that it's still in black and white and
everything like that so we can use the
red channel or the green or blue or
whatever if we go to alpha however there
is no alpha for this because it's a
white solid so we can't use alpha so let
me go back to the regular now you think
you might think that you can just put on
the fractal noise layer hide it and it
will affect the layer but for a reason
for the displacement map it doesn't do
it like that and you're like come on man
I got to do more stuff yep you got to do
more stuff so we've got our fractal our
displacement map effect that actually
looks at a layer when it starts out so
the effect that's placed on it isn't
looked at what we're going to have to do
is pre compose the fractal noise and
move all its attributes into the next
layer now I'm showing you like a real
life kind of problem that happens when
that you need to use pre comping to
solve the problem so just keep that in
mind so we're going to pre compose this
and if you haven't read about pre
composing which I'm not going to get
into a lot in this tutorial you're going
to I made a few tutorials on like ten
back or something like that about this
so learn about pre composing and it
helps you fix a lot of problems that you
might be having in your in your
compositions so we're going to go to pre
compose we're going to move all the
attributes into the new composition and
we'll just name this fractal map hit OK
and now the displacement map are
automatically picked our fractal map and
if I
move now our text is getting displaced
so that's really cool you can mess
around with the amount of displacement
but if you use it too much with the
fractal noise it's going to just screw
it up so keep those at a low something
low as you can see I've got red and
green being used they're both black and
white in those channels so that's fine
we could use luminance and that would
work also the luminous looks the coolest
I guess give you a quick preview of this
hopefully it renders fast look like it's
going to yeah so that's what we got
going on there and we got like some like
creepy effect going on there
and you can use other types of fractal
noise to create effects like this with
your displacement map layer you can also
use video if you would like to use that
as displacement map layer and everything
doesn't have to be animated for the
displacement map layer to work like that
correctly either it'll just be like a
static displacement now we've got this
map behavior here which will give us
three options and you can mess with
those if if your displacement map is
like larger or smaller you can use the
center map to just put it in the center
of your cop here we can't see it right
now because it's obviously only
affecting the displacement of this here
but we got the stretch map to fit so you
can use that if your map is too small
and then the tile will tile the cross
also if your map is too small so these
these are mainly for if your map is just
not as the size of your comp the rap
pixels around will
I'll show the ones that are cut off at
the top so I mean for this instance it
doesn't work out obviously and the
expand output don't even have to worry
about that for now really so just let's
uncheck it and see if anything even
actually happens with our text now I
didn't think so so that's how you use
your displacement map in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
create another displacement map with a
turbulent displace which you can see
over here in our effects and presets and
it'll do kind of like the same thing but
you don't have to use your fractal map
or anything like that but you don't have
as much control if you don't use like a
custom map so it's up to you which one
you use and I'll get to that tutorial in
a second so see you guys at that one
thanks for watching this one and
subscribe if you want more tutorials see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
