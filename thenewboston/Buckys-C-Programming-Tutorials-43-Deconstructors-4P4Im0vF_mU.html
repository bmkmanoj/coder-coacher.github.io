43rd c++ tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm finally going to be explaining to
you guys those things called
deconstructors you know whenever we
created class and said automatically
create a Deconstructor or whatever and
we had it unchecked well I'm going to
explain you guys what they are when
they're used and then you know when
we're creating in class from now on we
can understand what they mean so the
first thing I want to say is a
Deconstructor is basically code that
runs automatically upon the destruction
of your object and that's the technical
term for it but basically at the end of
your program one all your memories
getting freed up in your programs ending
and all your objects are getting
destroyed and you want a less a little
bit of code to run that's when your D
constructor is going to run so you know
as soon as you create an object the
constructor runs well as soon as it's
deleted the Deconstructor runs so that's
basically you know when that happens so
let's go ahead and first before I even
start talking about D constructor let's
go ahead and type some code into our
constructor like um C out I am the
constructor and make sure you spell it
wrong and then in that line so now we
can see if we go ahead and main dot CPP
and create come on keyboard type regular
and create a Sally objects so Sally um s
o and then after this we really
firetruck are you really gonna run right
behind me in the middle of this tutorial
no that's not annoying well that was
kind of annoying but anyways continuing
on so we went ahead and we created a
sally object now as soon as we create
this object our constructor is going to
run and all our constructor does is
shout out I am the constructor on the
screen so now we go ahead and type
another line of code like C out armed
oMG what DF is this on my shoe or
something stupid like that and in that
line so let's go ahead and run our
program so far so our object was created
and it shout it out I am the constructor
automatically we didn't have to call a
specific function it just did on
automatically and then our program ran
that said oMG WTF is this on my shoe so
now let's go ahead and add a D
constructor now to create a
Deconstructor it's as simple as this the
name of your D constructor is the tilde
and that's above the tab on your
keyboard but under the escape ill well
that's where it is on mine if you look
the left of the one umm you see that
little squiggly sign it's called the
tilde I think at least that's what I
call it so go ahead and type that and
then type your class name which is Sally
so basically your Deconstructor looks
the exact same as your constructor
except it has that little squiggly tilde
above it so now let's go ahead and
create the body of it and again it's the
exact same as your constructor except it
has that little squiggly tilde right
before it so another thing I want to
point out is this whenever you're
creating a destructor it has no
parameters no matter what you can never
give it parameters also it never has a
return value you can't even give it void
and aside from that there's no D
constructor overloading you have one D
constructor and that's it you can't have
different versions of your D constructor
so basically it's a point
another fire truck are you serious this
is gonna run right past me you guys hear
that
yeah I'm just continuing on with my
story line is and I really don't feel
like redoing it so sorry guys so
basically whenever your object is first
created your constructor is going to run
and whenever your object is
automatically deleted or you know um
destroyed I mean that's the technical
term for it
your Deconstructor is going to run so
let's go ahead and type some code and
see out
I am the D constructor and make sure you
type that very wrong and then go ahead
and end that line and let's go ahead and
take a look at our main and I'll explain
you guys what's going on our first line
of code we created a Sally object so
right after it right around here our
constructor is going to get called in
our constructor shouts out I am the
constructor so then after this it goes
ahead and runs the program oMG WTF is
this on my shoe so the next line of code
is going to be did is going to be this
excuse me now after this line of code is
running it's going to see that it got to
the end of the program whenever it gets
to the end of your program C++
automatically destroys all your objects
so by default automatically is going to
call your D constructor for this object
right here so let's go ahead and build
and run this and see what happens
I am the constructor OMG WTF is this on
my shoe and I am the D constructor so as
you can see it automatically called the
D constructor and constructor for us so
another thing I want to point out is
when your program is finished running
that's when your D constructor is going
to get called so again your constructor
in your D constructor you don't have to
explicitly column like you would another
function inside your class they called
automatically and again remember
whenever you're creating your
constructor it's basically a duplicate
the constructor except you need a little
tilde right there and unlike a
constructor you can't overload it it
can't have parameters it can't have a
return value and make sure you don't
even put void is there a return value
it's basically a dumbed-down
very simple function so that's the very
basics of a constructor and a D
constructor and later on I'm going to be
showing you guys why D constructor is
useful other than just printing out
stuff on the screen but for now just
understand the concept and I'm going to
go ahead and help these firetrucks put
out a fire so hopefully in the next
tutorial they will stop running past me
but for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
