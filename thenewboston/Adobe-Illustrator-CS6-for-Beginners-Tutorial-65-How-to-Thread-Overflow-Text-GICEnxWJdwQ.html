illustration to toriel and in this
tutorial I'm gonna show you how to fix
what's going on when you start putting
in too much text into a text box and it
doesn't all show up so that's called
overflow tech overflow type and I'm just
basically going to show you how to work
around with that so the first thing is
you want to make a text box and you want
to paste your text in it and when you do
that this red plus sign here
will show up if you have too much text
that doesn't fit in the box so one way
you can fix this is by double clicking
on the red plus sign and it'll create a
another box here that keeps on keeps the
sentence going if you keep on double
clicking the boxes you'll get a couple
more boxes if you move them around you
can see that they're connected by these
threads and this is called threading the
type and threading the overflow type is
actually what it's called so they just
pretty much continue the sentences on
into the next text box and when you
double click it just makes us text box
the same exact size and puts it a little
bit bomp to the bottom right so I'm
gonna hit control Z and make it so I
don't have any of those anymore
now for terminology purposes in case
somebody asks you there's this box right
here that's called the out port and
that's because when you create a thread
it's going to line up and connect to the
import of another set of another
overflow text so let's get going on two
other ways now go ahead and have your
selection tool selected and click on
your text and then just click on the
button once and when you do your icon
will change to some kind of like like a
piece of paper with writing on it or
something
and what you want to do is go ahead drag
another text box out and then it will it
will fill up the amount of text on there
and if you draw your text box too small
you might have to draw another one it's
up to you the size that you want but the
thread is here again and it has
everything in it so remember this right
here that's the import and then this is
the out port that I was talking oh my
bad I got a mixed up this is the out
port because the rest of the text is
going out in to this one so this is the
import here and you only really need to
know that if someone says the
terminology to you you don't want to not
know what it is because that sometimes
that makes people think you know you
don't know what you're doing alright so
the let's see there are some more things
that you can do you can create a text
area and be able to type within that so
I'm going to make a text area by using
my area type tool and just clicking and
I've got that here so there's my text
area and I'm going to click on this once
to get my icon that I had and move over
to where the text area is and when I get
this chain link going on here click and
then that's going to put the rest of the
text into the text area that I just made
now if you want to unthread this all you
need to do is make sure you have your
selection icon and double click path
here or the thread there and let me get
to it yup and now it has not threaded
anymore so you just either double-click
on the import or the out port of the
selected object that you have and I'm
gonna go back undo alright and the next
thing I want to show you is how to
unthread or disconnect the type object
so make sure you have your selection
tool selected again and you want to
select a threaded type object that you
want to release or disconnect so this
one and you're going to go up to this
type menu
and we're gonna go to threaded text here
and we're going to either click on
remove threading or we're gonna just
click on
yeah let's click on remove threading so
that's another way there so now the
threading is removed and there are two
separate texts and they aren't linked to
each other anymore and that's pretty
much it that's it for threading text I
think yep so that's how you work with
the overflow text and get that into like
workable a workable situation for you so
without having to resize the text box so
if you pretty much let me go back you
just just wanna have all this in the
same box all you need to do is just
resize your text box and it all become
will be in there just resize it big
enough and it all be in there so that's
it for the tutorial thanks a lot for
watching I hope you guys have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
