this video I am going to teach you guys
how to design layouts using the grid
system in bootstrap
now a grid as we know is made up of a
bunch of rows left and right and columns
up and down now whenever we use
bootstrap we can have a maximum of 12
columns now this doesn't mean that every
single webpage that we make it has to be
twelve columns and you know look like a
big grid we can actually take these
twelve columns and if we just want one
big one we can just group them all
together and also let's say that you
just wanted to have a sidebar on the
left-hand side in your main area well we
can like take two of those columns group
them together put them on the left and
we can take the ten other ones and use
them for the main content right here but
remember twelve
it's our magic number now another thing
I want to point out and this is the less
terminology that I'm going to throw at
you guys before you start actually
getting hands on whenever we're using
our grid system it has four different
classes let me just type all these out
XS SM MD and LG
so extra small small medium enlarged
that's what they stand for and these
relate to what device are you trying to
design your website for so extra small
is for phones small is for tablets
medium is for normal desktops and
laptops and large is for larger desktops
like those huge IMAX now later on what
we're going to be doing is let's say
that you want to create a layout that I
don't know let's say a desktop you want
to have a layout that the sidebar only
takes up two columns but for a tablet
you think it looks better if you know
your sidebar takes up four columns you
can actually use these classes to change
it but in these first couple of examples
and for the most of my tutorials I'm
just going to make one generic website
that's responsive to every single device
so we can just use say like MD and I'm
going to show you how to make website
that looks good on every you know single
device whether it's a phone or you know
a big jumbo desktop
let's get into that right now so let's
say that we what can we do in this video
we'll say that we're making a really
simple webpage and it's going to have
three columns and it's going to take up
the entire width of the screen
so how would we do that well remember
the first thing we need to do is change
this from container which is a fixed
width to container fluid now remember
that is going to give us the
functionality to take up the entire
width of the screen now so let me add a
header so heading one I'll just say um
three column layout now whenever you
make columns they have to go inside rows
so div and the class for this is just
row so now inside this row we're just
going to stick three columns and
remember since we have to take up twelve
columns and we only want three of them
we're going to have each of those take
up four columns so 4 plus 4 plus 4 is 12
simple enough so div class equals Co L
minus MD Center is just going to make
this a generic you know website for a
desktop and then minus 4 so we're just
making a regular column that's going to
span four columns I know I use the word
columns a lot but that's what it's doing
it's taking off the width of four
columns and just so we can differentiate
these I'm just going to change the
background color of each one will be
easier to see in this little demo so
background color got to find my shortcut
too lazy to type it and what's a good
color so FF I don't know like nine nine
nine nine and this one can just say
first so let me copy this and just add
it two more times all right so this is
going to be the first column on the left
hand side this one's going to be the one
in the middle so I'll actually just
write left middle and right
and let me just change the color - I
don't know 99 CC FF and what else is a
Goods color 0 0 CC 9 9 let me rerun this
and check it out alright so there you go
here is our heading right here and
remember since we use a fluid container
it's taking up the entire screen so left
middle right this is all one row with
three columns and check out what happens
whenever I shirt this huh that's pretty
handy I mean we didn't add any
functionality so it you know all stacked
on top of each other but I mean a phone
is about that size let's say everything
is all there nothing gets squished this
middle and right section aren't getting
cut off the stirrup they are still right
there and check that out pretty awesome
eh and a real quick let me show you guys
what it looks like if it is a regular
container instead of fluid so let me run
this and check it out so here is our
fluid one and we can see that this takes
up the full width of the screen no space
on the left or right and this is the
regular container you see that we now
have a fixed width and we have some
spacing on the left and a right so full
screen not full screen that's the
difference in that is how you use the
grid system to make a really simple
layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
