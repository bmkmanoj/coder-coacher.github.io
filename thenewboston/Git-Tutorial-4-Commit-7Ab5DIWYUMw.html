tutorial all right guys how was my
singing I think I'm going to try out for
American Idol ASAP alright so now that
that little moment of fame was done
let's go ahead and get started with this
tutorial and in this video we're going
to be making our very first commit it's
going to be freaking awesome probably
the best moment of your life so before I
get started let me go ahead and tell you
guys that I am in the tuna folder which
is my main project folder and the first
thing I want to do is verify that our
project is empty by typing LS now hit
enter and of course LS is supposed to
list all the files and folders in your
project in ours of course is empty right
now no big deal ain't worried about nine
so you guys are probably wondering Bucky
okay our project is empty but now I'm
scratching my head trying to figure out
how exactly does get keep track of all
these changes what's going on behind the
scenes that you know is causing this
program to work well let me show you
guys a little secret and remember that
when I show you this never tell anyone
else about it and definitely don't fudge
with what what I'm about to tell you if
you type LS which pretty much means list
everything in your project and then you
hit space and hit - L a what this does
is it lists all the not only the regular
folders and files but also all the
hidden stuff as well so even though if
you open to none you can't see anything
on your desktop or in your Windows
Explorer let me open up bash again there
are indeed hidden files there and
they're hidden for a reason they're
hidden because these are the files that
pretty much control everything they
manage GUID they keep track of the
changes but guys do not ever touch these
files don't edit them don't try to find
them or change them because your entire
project will be messed up so why did I
even tell you guys about that I don't
know I'm kind of sliding myself upon
ahead but um you know if you want to
learn about gay
you want to get expert you got to know
how things work so there you go but guys
just remember that's how you find them
but don't ever ever touch them alright
so now that we did that let me just go
ahead and clear my screen here and the
first thing that we can do is let's go
ahead and add some random file to this
project so I'm just going to be making a
text file so open up your text editor
I'm using notepad plus plus and write
the dumbest thing that you can possibly
think of what's mine oh let me think I
am Sam and I like ham Wow I should've
really took some time to think about
this before I made this tutorial but
anyways that's the dumbest thing I can
think of right now and I also want to
put something like um this is our first
commit so now let's go ahead and save
this I'm in my tuna project folder right
now and let's just save this as first
dot text so now this is our first text
document and as you can see we now have
a file in this tuna project called text
pretty freakin sweet but now we have to
go back in bash and say alright we
downloaded get to keep track of changes
in our project so let's go ahead and
figure out how to do that right now so
the first thing that we need to do is
let get know that we made some changes
to our project and to do that press get
ad space dot or period now what this
means is basically add all of the
changes that we made to our project in
this little dot right here means folder
or directory so pretty much um since
we're in the two non directory this is
pretty much saying hey git add all the
changes that we made to our project and
hit enter and now what it does is it's
aware that we may changes aka we added a
file to this project
but in order forget to keep track of the
changes we actually need to go ahead and
commit these changes all right didn't we
just do that well not exactly it's a
two-step process now whenever you make a
commit to get what you're telling it is
save this point in time so whenever we
make a commit it's like taking a
snapshot of that point in time and any
time later you mess up you can come back
to that point in time kind of like
redoing it so let me go ahead and show
you guys how to make a commit right now
get commit minus M and what this does is
this get commit takes a snapshot of this
point in time so if we ever mess
anything up we can come back to it in
this minus M and what I'm about to write
right here inside a quotation marks
let's just put something like this is
our first commit this is just a message
because whenever you're looking through
all your snapshots to figure out where
you want to go back to you always want
to put a message to see where you've
done because if you just have a bunch of
things like I don't know if you're just
looking at the dates of it you're like
all right is that where I fix the code
is a is that where I fixed the bug is
that where I want to go back to if you
have a very detailed message then you go
oh that's what I did on that commit so
we're going to be talking about messages
more in detail about later on but just
remember every commit whenever you hit
enter is pretty much a point of time or
a point in time that you can save and
come back to so now if we ever are
messing up this file later on or if we
just hired and turn any accidentally you
know makes a bunch of changes like Vista
the file then we can easily come back to
this commit later on and it will turn it
our project right back into there and
I'm going to be showing you guys about
that all later on but for now just
remember whenever you make a commit
which is we just we just did that using
commit and then give it a detailed
message what you're doing is you're
saving this project at that point in
time and we can come back to it later on
so pretty freakin sweet and that's what
we're going to be basically doing in
these upcoming videos making some
changes to our project adding the
changes in committing them so if we mess
up later we can come back to there but
it gets a lot more detailed than that
and I know I explained a simple command
for a long time but this is one of the
most important concepts and get so
anyways thank you guys for watching if
you have any questions ask me on my
forum
