Android tutorial for the new boss in
again with me Travis what we're going to
do in this tutorial is basically fix our
other air that we have within our
Android
that's a annoying little splash sound
what we're going to do is fix basically
our inch I'm sorry this other air that
we're getting when we take a picture it
sets it and then when our emulator goes
off to its side such as let's see like
this it's going to reset the picture
back to this default icon and before we
get started it's going to be real quick
tutorial but before we get started I
want to show you guys how to turn the
emulator outside pretty simple I believe
if you guys just shut off your numpad if
you guys are on Windows and then just
hit 7 or 9 on your numpad it will change
it or you can hit ctrl C ctrl f11 it's
not working for me I think it might be a
Mac thing but I believe it's ctrl f11
and f12 or f10 one of those and that
will change the emulator over to
basically this is landscape mode and
this is portrait mode which is going to
be important for this tutorial but
basically we're going to do is we're
going to fix the orientation and also
now to think about it just the I mean
you guys don't really probably care
about this but this little app name we
can do that as well we're going to
change that so that's where we're going
to do in this tutorial pretty quickly
pretty simply and how we do that is we
set that code up within the Android
manifest so I want you guys to open that
up and scroll down to our camera
application and first to change this
title it's referring to the string
variable app name so you guys can change
this to like camera application or
something like that if you want and then
it'll change the title or a label I
should say nothing too important but we
can also set up someone different some
different initialization kind of codes
within this activity opening bracket of
the activity of our class that we want
to
mess around with and we can use
basically a code called Android thought
and as you guys can see there's quite a
few different codes we can do within
manifest so that's pretty neat
we're going to say set orientation I
believe it is but now it's not coming up
so I gotta make sure I got think believe
this said Orion no oh yeah I always
always mess up on this one for some
reason its screen orientation and we can
set the screen orientation either to
landscape or portrait so what we want to
do is have it kind of like this because
we kind of set it up in XML for a
portrait view so we're going to keep it
portrait the whole time
so so how do you spell portrait I
believe so let's check it out make sure
my Spelling's right and basically that's
the end of the tutorial
pretty quickly pretty quick like I said
oh and also this brings up another point
if you guys want to run your actual
application on your Android phone if you
guys have an Android phone I don't
really want to waste my time with in the
series telling you guys how to do that
but on my website I have a blog post
that kind of walks you guys through that
and if also if you guys have any
additional questions of what we're doing
if I'm not making sense
you guys can contact me through that
email I did in that other tutorial where
we set up that hate mail or whatever you
guys can contact me at that email I'll
try and help you guys out as best I can
and you know because I don't I can't
really get any feedback because Bucky
wants like 200 tutorials so I can't see
if I'm moving too fast or if everything
that I say is confusing I know some
things are confusing for the most part
but it'll get better
some of those things will get better but
some I just don't know if you guys are
completely confused on like the
lifecycle like you know the activity
extending activity if you guys are still
confused about that or not but I know
some of the bitmap and still at ListView
is probably kind of confusing but let's
check out make sure application works as
you can see we change the application
name right here and when we switch it
over to
landscape mode it's a fixed orientation
at portrait mode so it's not going to
reach Ange basically everything and that
will get rid of that error that that we
had with this bitmap and I know I told
you guys about running on your phone I
don't know if I told you guys I have a
blog post or not on my website but I
know it started saying that but I'm not
sure if I said that or not so again my
websites my bring back calm so you guys
can check that out and get some
additional help as well as some more
Android tutorials I have a basic series
if this if you aren't liking the way
that I'm teaching this one it's kind of
a different teaching style but hopefully
you guys like this tutorial pretty neat
especially for game development a lot of
times you want to set the screen
orientation to landscape only so that's
how you can do that is just with this
code within the Android manifest for the
activity that you're working for so
again guys thanks for watching I'll
catch you in the next tutorial peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
