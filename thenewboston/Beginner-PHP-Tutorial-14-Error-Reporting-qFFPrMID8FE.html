back with another video for the new
Boston now in this tutorial we're going
to be talking about error reporting and
I'm going to be speaking a bit white
every reporting is important during
development and then again why it's
important to turn it off when you're not
developing and when you're releasing
software or releasing code rather onto a
public web server for public use now
let's take a look at what error
reporting is now if I was to create a
PHP document and I've got my PHP tags
here and I was to say writing some
invalid code so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a variable and I'm
going to make this equal to Alex but I'm
missing out the line terminator which is
a semicolon so I'm missing that out on
purpose now at the moment my error
reporting is turned off so when you're
developing you may find that your code
will not run even if you have output
outside of your PHP tags so let's put
this into practice in an example I'm
going to refresh my page now you can see
that nothing has been returned to us no
errors or no output at all let's in fact
echo this here and we can demonstrate
that we're getting no output whatsoever
oh we are okay oh yeah okay well we are
because it's the only line in our code
so let's create another variable down
here called Billy
remember PHP works on a line by line
basis so if you've got only one line in
your program you're not required to use
a semicolon but I'm going to put another
variable in there as well and I'm going
to refresh the page and you'll see that
no content appears where as it did
before so no content appears but no
error message has been given so we need
to turn every reporting on to our select
value of error reporting I'll select how
can I say settings if you like a very
reporting and I'll explain this in a
minute when we take a look at our PHP
dot ini file
now if you open up your X our PHP
location where the PHP folder exists for
me this is C colon backslash 4 sorry C
colon backslash xampp backslash PHP and
we need this file called PHP to ienai so
I'm going to double click on this and
open this we open it in notepad and I'm
going to go and find on the page error
reporting so now you can see we've come
down to this error handling and logging
place here we have an explanation here
of each stage or each setting rather of
error reporting so for example if we
were to set error reporting to e or this
will report all errors and warnings but
not including East richt error
fatal runtime errors a warning runtime
warning so we have all these different
types of warnings and errors that we can
allow our user to see or or us as a
developer to see but by default I think
mine is actually set to zero so let's go
down okay so we've got error reporting
equals zero and this is Error reporting
off altogether as we've seen in our
browser
we've not retrieved an error orbit not
being returned with an error even though
we're missing a semicolon our pages are
working now it's also great to note that
if we have outside content outside of
our PHP tags this is also not going to
going to be displayed now you may have
come across this before where you've
created a PHP document you've had
outside an inside PHP comments you've
got HTML comment up content here and
then you've got PHP content inside here
we are just getting a blank page up take
a look inside your PHP 2 ini file and
check for this check error reporting and
I can pretty much guarantee most of the
time it's going to equal 0 so what we
need to do is we need to change this to
something that's going to give us back
an error and there's a few examples here
but we can create our own custom if you
like in this tutorial I'm just going to
be dealing with e all
so you can say eat all now bear in mind
this doesn't equal East ricked
so we'll have a look at that in just a
moment so we've got eat all here now
let's go and say go ahead and save this
so save what we need to do now is we
need to restart our Pachi server so we
come into our exam control panel click
stop and click start this may be
slightly different for you you might be
using another package installation now
what we can do is we can open up our
browser and click refresh and you can
see that it's giving us our error back
so we're saying here pass error
expecting a comma or expecting a
semicolon on line 4 so what we can do
now is go over to line 4 and you might
think well I've got a semicolon on line
4 but in actual fact it's referring to
the end of this line meaning it's
expected either here or in terms of
reading it it's expected here so when we
fix this and we refresh you can see that
it's working fine so we've got our
outside content and our inside content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
