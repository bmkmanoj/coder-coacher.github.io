and welcome to your very first bootstrap
tutorial now the first question you may
have is what the heck is bootstrap well
bootstrap is a way that you can make
awesome looking websites for every
single device now whenever you guys
first started learning how to make
websites my guess is that you probably
design it for the desktop and then you
try to look at on a phone and you're
like hmm
everything is really tiny I got to zoom
in you know I'm trying to click a link
with my thumb but it's accidentally
clicking the wrong link and you know
it's just a pain so then you might have
been like all right I'll just design it
for mobile first so you did that and
then you looked at it on a desktop and
you know all the buttons were huge white
space was out of control and it was just
a pain in the butt and you know it kind
of makes sense I mean what kind of
design looks good on a 27-inch iMac and
also a tiny little mobile phone well the
answer is bootstrap so that's pretty
much the broad overview of what
bootstrap is and why it's so popular now
what else we got down here alright so if
you go to the site get bootstrap comm
you can look at a couple demo websites
that were made using bootstrap and look
at this girl right here I think that she
thinks that this guy's trying to take a
picture of her but he's just like on
Google Maps
not even intention to her so alright
getting kind of sidetracked here but in
order to use bootstrap we need to
download some files and include them in
our project so again go to the site get
bootstrap comm and click this big jumbo
download bootstrap button now it's going
to take you to this page and as you can
see we have a couple different options
of how we want to include those files in
our project so the first thing that we
can do is click this button download
them and by the way don't click it yet
because I'm going to show you guys a
better way but if you want you can
download the file so you have a copy on
your own computer and then if you go to
your downloads extract them extract
album
and check them out so these are files
that you would include in every single
project so every single time you made a
project copy um include um make another
one copy them include them it can be
kind of redundant and kind of a pain in
the butt so what I'm going to recommend
is doing it this way so whenever you
decide to make a bootstrap website you
can just add these links right here and
whenever you include these links what
it's going to do is it's going to pull
all of those files from the CDN now a
CDN is just a content delivery network
and all this is is a server online that
has the files stored on it so you
actually don't need them on your own
machine you can just say ok I'm going to
link to these files then whenever the
user browses your website it downloads
those files and you're good to go by the
way I don't know why they call it a CDN
for some reason whenever people are
making like something new with computers
they find the need to give everything a
new name in acronym you know a content
delivery network is it's a freaking
internet it's a big network and they
deliver content but ok
it's my little rant so you know getting
kind of off track here anyways in these
tutorials what I'm going to be doing is
instead of including all of these files
then I'm just going to be including
these links right here and also what I
did already is I made a really simple
template where I did all that and I'm
going to be putting it on my github page
so if you go to my github page and
there's a link right below this video
anytime you want to make a bootstrap
website just copy the template and this
can be your starting point so we're
going to be writing most of our code
right here and that way you know you
don't have to go find those links and
you know setting up every single time
and by the way if you guys are using
jetbrains or IntelliJ or any IDE that
JetBrains made if you want a real easy
way to set up a bootstrap website you
can just go to file new project and then
if you go to static web this Twitter
bootstrap
is your template that you can use or you
can just use mine from github whatever
you want to do
follow your heart so before I get into
the good stuff showing you guys all
different features that you can add I
want to talk to you about these files
right here so we already know what most
of the stuff is just regular HTML the
first interesting line is this now you
really don't have to worry about this
but just so you guys you know our pros
and understand every single thing a
viewport is essentially just the user
screen and the two settings that we're
changing it right here is for the device
width we're just going to use the width
of the screen so nothing you know
mind-blowing in initial scale this means
don't zoom in or zoom out any special
way just use regular zoom 100% and this
just make sure that it's consistent
across every device now this line of
code right here this is just a CSS file
where we get all of the you know default
styling coloring of the look of all the
different widgets and these files are
one of them is for jQuery the standard
jQuery library and the other one is
actually the bootstrap JavaScript file
so again that's what all of these are
and this is going to be our starting
point on every single bootstrap web page
that we make alright so now that we got
all that boring stuff out of the way
let's go ahead and jump into the fun
stuff and start designing our website so
most every single thing that I'm going
to be showing you guys in these
tutorials it needs to go inside a
container now there are two different
types of containers in what one you
choose is dependent on do you want your
website to have a fixed width or do you
want it to take up the full screen so if
you want it to have a fixed width then
the class you use is container if you
wanted to take up the entire width of
the device then you use container /
fluid not to fooied fluid so this would
be full screen but for this demo I'm
just going to use container and then
I'll show you guys the difference so for
right now let's just make
really something really simple I'll say
like um welcome to the new Boston
that'll be my site and for the paragraph
I'll just say uh like I love the Boston
my name is Bucky alright so let me just
save this and run it and check it out so
there you go
congratulations you now know how to make
the most simple bootstrap website that
has ever been created and now that we
have a solid foundation and know how to
set up our project and what everything
is we can start getting into all the
features all of the cool design elements
it's going to be awesome so I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
