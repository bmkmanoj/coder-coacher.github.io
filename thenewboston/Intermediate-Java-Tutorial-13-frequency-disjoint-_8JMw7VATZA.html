another intermediate Java tutorial this
is actually a 13th tutorial in the
series and we're going to be going over
some more collections methods and
specifically frequency and another
method called disjoint and you'll see
what those doing a little bit so well
first let me tell you guys what
frequency does frequency checks one list
against the other or excusing one list
against a term or element and if it
appears in the list
I pretty much outputs how many times
that element appears in the list so
let's go ahead and just we can print it
on the same land so system.out.print
line and then go ahead and put here's
the method right here it's in the
collections class frequency right there
it's already filled in in the collection
that we want to test if the elements in
is a list - and remember that's our big
list and the object we want to test is
go ahead and type in something that's in
a list dig so what it does is it goes
through list two which is right here and
it checks if dig is in it and it appears
one time in it so it should return a one
so let's go ahead and run this and as
you can see it returned the number one
right there and if I appeared in this
list more than like three times a return
of three obviously but that's that so
now we can move on to the next method so
the next common method unless I want to
go over is called this joint and what
this joint does is it checks one list
against another list actually collection
against another collection and it
returns true if they have nothing in
common no elements and commented at all
so let's go ahead and make a variable
just make it boolean's and on they may
TRF for a true or false and set this
equal to collections dot disjoint and as
parameters we want to write all right
what are their two collections that we
want to test
well of course list one and list two and
here's list one right here and here's
list two
and since they do have items in common
it's going to return false because
remember it returns true if they have no
items in common so let's go ahead and
just see that right now and in our next
line we'll just go ahead and print it
out system.out.print line tof so this if
we coded it correctly should print out
false and look that false right here and
remember false means is that they do
indeed have elements in common so a more
practical use for this would be pretty
much if statement just go ahead and
write if tos then we're going to rock
system.out.print line so if it's true
then it's going to mean these lists do
not have anything in common simple
enough so now on the next line let's
write our else so if it's false then
well might as well copy this and paste
so if it's false go ahead and write
these lists must have something in
common and put an exclamation point
because this is an exciting point in our
lives so go ahead and write okay and
since it's false it goes this list or
these lists must have something in
common and what do they have in common
these three things YouTube Google and
Digg so if they had nothing in common it
would be true and it says um it would
run this these lists did not have
anything in common so that's pretty much
the basics of frequency and disjoint and
how to use them in collections so thank
you guys for watching this tutorial

you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
