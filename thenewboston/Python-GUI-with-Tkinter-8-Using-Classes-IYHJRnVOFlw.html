video I'm going to show you guys how to
use classes with kinter and whenever you
work with the professional piece of
software or whenever you're just making
anything more than you know just a few
simple buttons this is a technique that
you really should use because it's kind
of the standard for well not only making
GUI applications but making all software
so let's go ahead and get started right
now I mean we already know the basics of
classes from the regular place on
tutorials so now let's see how to use it
in Kinser so this application is just
going to be a really simple arm it's
going to have a window in one button
you're going to click it and it's just
going to print some out on the screen
and another button you click it and it
just quit same as the X button but you
know it's a different technique I want
to show you guys so you can name your
class anything you want I'm just going
to name mine Bucky's buttons because I
don't know seemed appropriate now I
don't even know if I taught you guys
about the init method but if I didn't
then I'll make another tutorial in my
regular python tutorial is because it's
kind of um doesn't really have to deal
with kintyre and GUI and stuff but what
it is is if you don't know already put
two underscores and then type in it and
then two more underscores and what this
is is it's a special kind of function
because whenever you create an object
from this class you don't need to call
this explicitly
this stands for initialize and it gets
called automatically whenever you create
an object so without having to call any
variables or any functions on this
function is gonna pretty much occur as
soon as you create something so kind of
hard to explain but you'll see um at the
end of it now of course like all
functions is going to take the parameter
self or well most of our functions and
it also is going to take one more
parameter sense we're working with
gooeys and I'm just going to call it
master now anytime you see master this
means the root or the main window and I
want to pass it in because since we're
creating GUI
I'm going to say okay whenever you first
create an object from this class create
that route or main window so I know I
named it something different but just so
you guys can differentiate between this
variable and the one we pass in the
function but they're really the same
thing so what are we going to do with
our GUI well let's go ahead and create a
frame first just something to stick in
there so of course we create a variable
and we set it equal to the frame and
inside it it says okay where do you want
to put this frame well we want to put it
right in the main window the room but
remember root is now master so we put
master right here so all we did right
here is we created a frame in the main
window simple enough so now let's go
ahead and just display on the screen so
frame pack it's pretty much means
display on the screen place it in there
all right this is pretty easy to set
this up so far so let's go ahead and
create some buttons now so now that we
have that frame we can go ahead and
create some buttons and put them in
there so remember anytime you want to
create on a button variable set equal to
self and I'll make the print button
first so print button and this is going
to be the one that you click and it just
prints something out down here just some
really simple functionality so of course
you already know how to create that
button where do you want to put it well
we'll just go ahead and put it in the
frame right there and the text that we
want to appear on our button would just
say like a print yeah we'll just say
print message who cares now the last
thing I want to do is of course whenever
we click this button we have to say okay
call a certain function and we don't
have any other functions created yet but
we will in just a second so command set
this equal to self print message and
again this is a function that we're
going to create in just a second so
under this we created the button all we
have to do is display on the screen now
so self this button what do I want to do
well I want to pack it aka
place it on the screen actually let me
go ahead and put this on the left-hand
side just so we got everything nice and
organized so pretty much we have a blank
window with a button in it right now a
button that is supposed to do something
but you know we didn't create the
functionality for yet but it takes a few
seconds so don't worry so the only other
button I want to show you guys how to
make is that quit button so pretty much
going to do the same thing up here so
self I'll call this the quit button it
set this equal to actually I'm going to
copy all this because I'm feeling kind
of lazy today so of course button frame
the text can just be like I don't just
quit won't get too fancy with it and
this command is actually we don't have
to right arm a custom function to quit
because there's already something that's
built-in kinter and that is frame quit
as you can see it already popped up down
there whenever you call this command
what it does is quit basically breaks
the main loop and remember whenever you
break the main loop it's the equivalent
of closing it or ending your program so
the main window only displays because
the loop keeps going and going so
whenever we quit it it's going to close
your program same as closing the next
month simple enough so the only thing we
have to do for this is display it on the
screen and of course instead of primp on
whip on and back this to the left to sew
this print button where it will appear
on the left and this even though we have
it side left it'll appear to the right
of that since there's already something
on the left but um this is how you like
this is how you commonly layout things
just put left and left and then you
don't get organized or disorganized
whenever you're adding more crap
so our program looks pretty good the
only other thing we have to do is first
we're getting a little warning right
here because it says hey you said
whenever you click this button call the
function print message so give me a
function print message
oh okay go do that bossy little Kinser
are
right so two fine print massage and of
course nice it already threw it in there
and of course self we know means
whenever we create an object from this
class
Lucky's buttons it's just throwing this
object in there so what do we want this
but um function do we'll just go ahead
and print out wow this actually worked
all right
pretty sweet everything's looking good
so we made a class and that's what that
little warning means right here if you
ever see this but this is just like um
the rules for how you're supposed to
format it it won't mess it up but
whenever you make a class you need two
blank lines above it I know kind of
stupid but whatever alright so we made
our class looking good and the only
other thing we need to do remember any
time we want to use something from a
class we need to make an object an
object allows us to access the crap
inside the class so just name just this
object B and set it equal to the class
name buckey's button and remember we
need to pass in the root window or the
main window and that gets treated as
mastered so now this is all we have to
do because remember we don't need to
call any of these functions explicitly
with our object because in it
automatically gets called as soon as we
create any object from this class in
print message is going to get called
whenever we click this button so now if
I run this and I hate having to like
grab in this little tiny area but
basically check out down here when I hit
print message every time I click it it
says wow this actually worked and of
course quit is going to call the command
frame quit which is the equivalent of
pressing this which are both the
equivalent of ending your main loop so
how easy is that you create your entire
class and all of the functionality is
built right in you don't have to
explicitly call anything from these
silly little
pretty freakin sweet actually working
new classes in my mind is a lot easier
than working without them so I don't
know I get a little too excited about
you know program in the classes and
stuff so I'm going to go take a break
cool my head and well thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
