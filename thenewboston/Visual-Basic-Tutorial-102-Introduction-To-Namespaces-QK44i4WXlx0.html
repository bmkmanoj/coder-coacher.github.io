youtube.com slash on live camera for the
New Boston and in this tutorial we're
going to be taking a look at namespaces
now what namespaces do is they make it
easier for you to organize your classes
so let's say you have one namespace and
you can put several different classes in
there so that when you want to access
let's say you group similar classes in
that so when you when you want to access
classes that are related to the
namespace you would just use that
namespace that you created and then
access the class in here and also let's
say for example if we were making the
person program in one of the previous
tutorials let's say you wanted to have
two class two person classes but you
know that if you are working in the same
namespace it will not let you create two
classes with the same name but if you
put each one of those classes in a
different namespace then you will not
get any errors and your program will
what will run fine so let's go ahead and
make a little project to a demo
namespaces so we'll go ahead and select
windows forms application and we'll set
the name to namespaces and we'll go
ahead and click OK and we'll just wait
for that to load
okay so we'll come over here to our
solution Explorer we will select the
namespaces solution we'll right-click it
and we will add a class so we'll just
name this class the people class so
people dot VB go ahead and click add now
here is our people class that we just
created we're going to create some
namespaces to go in to encapsulate this
people class so we'll go ahead and come
up here and we'll just come right above
the people class and we will type
namespace other people and now you
always have to end a namespace with the
end namespace keyword okay so now that
we've created our namespace other people
let's go ahead and add some stuff to our
people class so we will do the first
name and the last name so public
property
first name as a string and then we will
do another property last name as string
and we'll just go ahead and override the
to string function so that it returns
their first name and their last name as
a string so we'll type public overrides
function to string okay so you can see
that it automatically fills in the rest
of this function for us so what we want
to return is we'll return first name and
then we will add a space and then we
will add the last name
okay so you can see that we may
namespace other people and a class
people inside of that so now I'll just
come down here and create a second
namespace so namespace friends go ahead
and hit enter and you can see that gives
us in namespace now if we create public
class people and hit enter you can see
that we don't get any errors for using
duplicate people classes because these
are inside of different namespaces so we
can go ahead and put the same stuff
inside of our friends class so public
property first name as string and we can
put their last name in there too so
public property last name as string and
let's go ahead and put let's say how
many years we've been friends with them
so public property years friends as
integer so now I'll just override the
two string function so public overrides
function to string and we will just
return first name and their last name
with a space
okay so you can see that we have used
two seemingly identical people classes
but they both are a little bit different
and they refer to different things and
they are inside of separate namespaces
so we've got other people and friends so
go ahead you can practice a little bit
with namespaces and later on we're going
to be going into accessing namespaces
and classes with inside of the namespace
so once you understand what namespaces
are go ahead and move onto the next
