org and I'm creating this tutorial for
the New Boston about functions and this
time we're going to be passing arguments
to our function and I've already spoken
about why functions are useful but I'll
recap functions are useful in code to
shorten the amount of code you do have
to write and you can refer back to these
functions which is called calling a
function and it will process the same
code every time you call and we set up a
function like this we have function we
have the name of the function we have a
block of code and the code goes in here
and we call the function simply by
calling the function name so this is the
standard syntax that you would expect to
find in a function now what if I want to
create a function that's going to add
two numbers together now this is a sort
of real-life example of why you might
use a function you may have a program
that simply does add two numbers
together you might take user input you
might take number one and number two and
you may need a function to add these two
numbers together to save you know
repeating this code it's always good
practice to use functions as well
because they structure your code a lot
better than if you're doing things on
the fly by calling functions especially
with arguments you're saving a lot of
time you're making it look a lot better
a lot easier to read as well so what
we're going to do is I'm going to get
rid of this calling here I'm going to
get rid of this and I'm going to call
this function add now inside this
function I need to specify which
arguments I want to bring into the
function to be able to use and these are
in the form of variables so I one number
one comma
number two so I'm feeding in two
different numbers
now I haven't specified the the variable
type I haven't specified if these are
numbers or string it doesn't actually
matter that depends on how you deal with
everything inside your function here so
my function is going to add two numbers
together now what I want to do is I want
to echo out this particular result so I
want to echo number one now this is in
reference to this so the arguments up
here must match when you reference them
inside your function so number one plus
number two and then we've just echoed
that out so now if we call our function
first of all I'm going to show you I'm
going to call it without any argument
inside here just to show you what
happens so let's refresh now you can see
that we've got a warning come up which
is missing argument for one or missing
argument one for add so it's telling us
the first argument is missing for this
named function and it tells us where
it's been called and it also tells us
where function it's been declared it's
also missing an argument two for the
same function called in the same place
and defined or declared in the same
place and then it's actually giving us
our result so we obviously want to now
include some numbers so what I'm going
to do is up here I'm going to say number
or I number one equals ten I just for me
stands for input so and I'm going to say
I
number two equals five so by the end of
this when we've created this we should
have the result of 15 because 10 add
five is 15 we're going to add these two
numbers together so when we call our
function down here we want to specify
these two variables now these two
variables will then be passed through I
number one will be passed through to
number one and I number two I mean I
number one nine number two can record
absolutely anything you could
call it sort of Numb one-and-one
anything you wanted but I'm just using
these so we can keep an eye on it so I
number one comma I number two that's all
the arguments that we need to pass so
these two variables here are going to be
interpreted here and then they're going
to be processed here and we're just
echoing out the result of this
so now let's refresh and see what we get
we get the result of 15 so let's change
these variables around Pitt will say 22
add 8 this should equal 30 so let's
refresh and see if everything works
that's fine okay so now what what do we
want to do if we wanting to pass let's
say a number and a string so let's
create another function and delete
everything and start again I'm going to
create a new function called display
date okay
and what's this what this is going to do
is it's going to feed in the day the
date and the year okay so the first
thing we want to do is echo day and we
want to append a space then we want to
append date append another space and
append year so obviously our day here is
going to be in a string format because
it will be either Monday Tuesday
Wednesday all the way up to Sunday date
is going to mean an integer and year is
going to be an integer so what we need
to do to be able to say well we need to
read in a string and we need to read in
two integers well the answer is we need
to do absolutely nothing as with
variables on their own PHP is going to
handle this for us so now I'm going to
call the function display date I'm going
to type in Monday 31 2011 just for an
example and now the result of this will
be Monday 31 2011 so it's doing exactly
what we've asked it to do even if we
combine variables so that's function
with arguments being passed in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
