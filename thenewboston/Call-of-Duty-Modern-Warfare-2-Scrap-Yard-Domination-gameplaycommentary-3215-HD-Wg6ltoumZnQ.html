domination game on scrapyard I got spawn
killed by a throwing knife right there
what a great way to start a game okay um
and of course I spawn in the exact same
spot oh don't you just love infinity
ward spawn system okay um I in this
video I'm going to talk about um
domination since I usually usually you
guys see anything either search or team
deathmatch I'm going to talk about
domination domination is definitely one
of my favorite game types in the call of
duty series in general just for the sake
it's it's long it's a very good it's
very good and the only problems that you
could probably have is that sometimes
you can spawn killed which that can't
which just like that I literally just
got killed from that guy spawning which
is that still considers is that
considered a spawn kill I don't know you
guys think about it and uh in a scrap
yard scrap yard is probably one probably
one of the better maps oh and i'm using
a i'm using silenced UMP marathon cold
blooded and ninja pro if you guys not
already realize it back to domination
domination usually is a long game type
or a longer game type just for the fact
that
you can get or just for the fact that
it's just it depends really you see like
a second ago they had two out of three
positions completely and it's like
completely guarded and much other stuff
like that sit and now we just completely
turned it around and now we have two out
of three positions and for like about a
minute or so we had all three positions
which which is can be one of the good
things about a domination game it can be
long it can be short or you can as the
game implies dominate everything
most it just depends on how you actually
can play this game for good game if you
go to the game why not you're bad at the
game why not and if you don't get what
if you don't understand what I just said
don't worry I didn't really get it too
and if I'm not making sense to you right
now just completely ignore what i said
about 10 seconds ago okay let's start
making sense again um Oh domination
domination nomination domination very
good game type depends on the map though
you could be on wasteland where the map
already sucks and then you get pretty
much spawn killed or you could have some
part or you could be planning on this or
you get still can get spawn killed but
you don't get pissed because you're not
sniped every 30 seconds actually punish
every 10 seconds okay um
went away from the grenade okay and see
now as I was saying earlier in the vid
or in this video sorry um they basically
just switched the ADA basically just
switch the spawns if I them I mean the
other team and don't say that was an
epic fail I love using the throwing
knife I'm sorry if I cannot help it
blinded by the light um and in
domination this game can either be your
best friend or your worst enemy can be
it can be your friend it could be your
enemy it could be your worst nightmare
it could be all happy it could be all
happy okay if I can't find other word
for really good for you and that's why
you don't and that's why commando pro
you sometimes you can t lie but ninja
pro still better and domination looks
like a spawns can change pretty fast
piss you off just a bunch of really good
things that can happen don't you just
love it whenever the spawns change
infinity ward's game you always get
really pissed
don't you just love that and another
thing I've actually I've thought of
recently and I've rid of review that
gave this game actually a 2 on gamefaqs
com and it actually does make a lot of
sense it's like it's still one of the
best games or one of the best
multiplayer games I've ever played but
it actually made did make a lot of sense
they did slap this I'm not set don't
hate me just because I'm saying this I
this is I don't think this at all I'm
just making a point because some of
parts of it is actually pretty true that
this game Infinity Ward did know this
game was going to sell basically no
matter what and there are a lot of
people that just bought it cuz it was
the new modern warfare which is
completely true because I did too I
didn't think there was gonna be anything
wrong with it and hear anything blah
blah blah stuff like that and then a
more nor I played this game I've
realized this games there's a triple
kill right there with a predator this
game can have some pretty bad spawn
system sometimes like you can you can
either kill a guy and then you could
spot and then he'll spawn right behind
you and then he kills you
and yes that has happened to me in
almost every basically almost every game
type the only game type hasn't have to
be a search thankfully that's never
happened and it will happen if it ever
did happen i probably throw my
controller into the wall because for the
sake that searches basically made not to
have the spawn killing system on and I
just got falcon punched by a grenade out
that window would you agree um um ok
what I'm trying to say from this is
about the spawn system in call of duty
don't hate me because I'm saying this
I'm not I'm just proving a point again
with the multi-billion dollar company
that fit any award is why can't they
make a sponsor I mean even halo threes
this month system I probably say is
better than this which yes I have played
803 before I played it even before I
played call of duty so i dunno yes I
know exactly what I'm talking about so
don't leave hate comments about what I'm
saying just don't just live with it and
listen ok um the game is about to the
game is getting pretty close to ending
over here so I'm just gonna try and
finish up a little bit
domination if you haven't played it
definitely at least try it you'll prop
unless you're playing on a really bad
map you're probably gonna have a lot of
fun hope this was a good I hope this was
good for you guys leave a comment rate
