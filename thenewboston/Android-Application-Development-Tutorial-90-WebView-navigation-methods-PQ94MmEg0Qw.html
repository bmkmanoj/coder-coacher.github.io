Android tutorial for the new boss in and
what I'm doing right now I'm just
finishing setting up some of those
variables so we're going to do that
quickly the two variables we want to be
able to use for whole class is a webview
and also the URL so basically our web
view where we label that as our browser
so make sure those are variables we can
use throughout our whole class and then
again I set up the edit text this is
going to be basically the URL if you
type that in we're going to allow that
to use that URL and then also I set up
all of our buttons with the references
and I set all the on click listeners and
I implement it again the onclicklistener
up here and set up just the standard
switching case that we're familiar with
so what we're going to do is we're going
to get into some of the methods that we
can use with this webview so far the
only method we have is loading a URL
from default but we're also going to
allow all these buttons to actually do
something that's what we're basically
going to establish in this tutorial
pretty simple stuff for the most part
nothing too complicated it's going to be
pretty like said pretty simple here so
let's get into it I just we're going to
just kind of do some of the methods with
this go button so basically the first
thing that we're going to do is we have
our edit text right so they can type in
a URL and then once we hit the Go button
it's just going to create basically just
the website we want within our webview
so first thing we're going to do is
we're going to use our edit text which
we called URL at least I called URL
we're going to say set this equal to our
URL dot or actually let's start a new
string we're going to say string and
we're going to say the website something
like that this is going to be equal to
our URL which is our edit text we're
going to say again get text and then
we're going to say to string so that's
kind of a review but basically we're
creating a string that's going to be
whatever is in our edit text then we're
going to say
basically again our webview so we're
going to say our brow which is our
webview and we're going to say dot load
URL and then we're just going to load
that string that we set up so the
website so so far nothing new for the
most part but now we're just allowing
people to type in their own basically
what URL that they want to go to and
then we're going to you know go to that
URL so nothing nothing new there nothing
complicated basically once we use our
browser webview a few times we can have
we store some of that data so we can use
a back button to go to the previous
website forward button to go to the next
website and what we can use is a method
called we're going to use this on our
web webview so we're going to say our
brow and then we can say like for
example since this is the back button we
can say go back pretty simple method
pretty easy to remember because we want
to go back and let's say for example
right when our application starts it's
going to load my website my bring back
com but let's say there's no you know no
previous history so there's nothing to
go back to so we're going to set up a
simple if statement and we're going to
say is we're going to say web or our
brow again which is our web view and
then we're going to say a method this is
boolean so it's me true or false so we
can say can whoops can go back so that's
going to be like hey can we go back and
if we can then we're going to do this
line of code which will go back that's
going to be kind of the same layout for
a go forward as well so we're just going
to copy and paste that instead of saying
can go back we're going to say dot can
go forward so again that's boolean
checking if it's true or false and if
it's true we're going to make it our web
view go forward and can you guess the
method it's called go forward pretty
simple again but again these are just
some of the methods that we can use for
web view now the Refresh we're going to
again say something like our brow again
referring to our web view and we're just
going to simply just go dot
reload so it's not actually refresh but
it's reload
still pretty easy method to remember and
that's just going to reload the website
and then for example if we want to clear
history so we go through ten websites
and we want clear the history so our go
back button won't work anymore
to do that we're going to say our brow
and then dot clear history so that one's
pretty easy as well and those are the
simple methods that I want to teach you
guys in this lesson we can run it or
save it let's see I'm get in an air just
got to finish off that statement there
and we can run this and it will work but
I want to show you one of the problems
that we're going to solve in the next
tutorial all right so we're going to go
down to our simple browser application
and it's going to load up again my bring
back and the only thing well this isn't
the problem that we're going to solve
but for example if you just said www dot
it's not going to work you have to do
the HTTP forward slash forward slash WWE
new Boston or something like that comm
and then we just hit our Go button and
it's going to load up that website as
you can see here and so that's pretty
neat and then if we hit the go back
button it's going to go back to my bring
back up forward go back and then we're
history then we try and go forward again
it's not going to allow us because it
cleared all the history now here's the
problem that we're going to solve in the
next tutorial let's say I want to click
on one of the links like blog from my
website it opens up a new intent and it
uses the browser intent that's built in
with Android so we want to get rid of
that for the most part I mean we don't
necessarily want to but we're going to
because we want to have our browser kind
of do everything so it reloads in this
webview so I'll catch you guys in that
tutorial and have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
