tutorial that I'm making tour of the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm in
showing you how to use the convert class
so all you're going to need for this
tutorial is a button and a text box and
once you have those on your form just
double click on the button so in
previous tutorials we looked at the bit
converter class and the bit converter
class um mainly handles bytes and we're
on we're going to want to be looking at
other variable types so we're going to
use the convert class so in order to
access the methods inside of the
converter class but it's going to type
convert and then use the dot operator
and since all the methods inside of this
class are static we don't need to create
or we can even create an instance of
this class so first like I said we're
going to be looking at converting a
string into an integer so we're just
going to use the two and 32 method and
then as you can see it calls for where
all this method is heavily overloaded
meaning that you can pretty much type
any variable type inside of here and
we'll convert it into an integer or it
will be stri 2 so we're just like I said
going to be converting a string into a
and 32 so we're just going to type text
box 1 dot X because it represents a
string and basically what this will do
is it will convert whatever is in
textbox 1 dot text into bending 32 and
if it cannot do it if there's like
letters in there or something it will
throw an error so first what is going to
create in to set equal to and then we're
just going to display that integer in
the message box probably have to do dot
to string all right so basically what it
does here is it takes whatever is in
textbox 1 dot X and it converts it into
an integer and then it sets whatever it
converts it into equal to this integer
right here and then it displays this
integer in the message box so now let me
be bug here we just type any number in
here and we'll display in a message box
type in 4
we get four type in ten we get time well
if we try to type in like letters or
something like hey those it's going to
get an error yep input strings not in
correct format just meaning you can't
convert letters into it
I need 32 so we can also do many things
with this like we can treat it just as
if it was like a number or something
like losing a bad like an add 2 to it or
something if we don't have to be a bit
like that and we can treat it as if it
was just a number or a variable so we
can just add 2 to it like them like
times you get 12 yep so yeah alright so
there are many different methods inside
of this mover class like I said you can
convert pretty much anything into
anything like convert to character like
if we wanted to do whatever character is
in text box 1 text then we just want on
a display is character in a message box
we can do that type in like half right
here yep
try to type them like a string or
probably getting in there yep string
must be exactly one character long and
it wasn't I don't know like five or six
there's other methods as well there's
two boolean where you can just convert
it into a boolean and some of these you
may say you're probably never going to
use them like this to boolean but you'd
be surprised I thought I would never use
this to boolean but I ended up using it
like a few weeks back so anyways just
convert Xbox ones text and your boolean
so I equal to that display the message
box
so I'm type in true here we shouldn't
get an error type and false we shouldn't
get an error no but if we try to type in
like anything decides true or false
we're going to get an error we just type
in that
yeah string was not recognized as a
valid guru so it's not a bad idea to put
a try and catch statement around when
you're converting things because
sometimes it won't work out or like if
you're pretty shape if only some of the
time it's going to convert I would
recommend putting a try and catch
statement around it so your application
doesn't crash and then you can always
just put less box here saying like
version failed and then you just know
that there's a problem with your
conversion and then you can just keep on
converting or have your application keep
on going so if we wanted to do like true
we're fine but if we try to type in like
anything else now we'll just get the
conversion files instead of our
application crashing which is always
good so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on the convert class but I
didn't go over every single method
inside of it because it's pretty
self-explanatory like used to convert
dot and then whatever you want to
convert it to like you want to convert
it to an 64 then you just set equal to a
long or something like that so yeah
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
