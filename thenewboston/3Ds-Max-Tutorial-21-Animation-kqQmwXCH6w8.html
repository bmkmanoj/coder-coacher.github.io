max
toriel and in this tutorial we're going
to be getting into the good stuff I'm
talking about animation so we're going
to be learning how to create movies
making things move around automatically
and what we're going to be going over is
something called keyframe animation now
if you're familiar with movies or
anything like that you know that each
kind of movie is made up just of a bunch
of still pictures and they're put in
there like slightly different from each
other and when you put them all together
and look at them real quick it creates
the appearance of motion so those still
pictures are called frames and we're
going to be working with is keyframes
now what keyframe is is pretty much
certain points of time they have to
define and once you define a point like
right here would be a keyframe and then
you could vine another keyframe let's
say over here in that once you define
this one in that one your ball would go
in between those keyframes automatically
and create the appearance of the ball
moving from here to over here so it's a
lot easier done than said yeah I said it
so let's get right into it now now that
I differentiate between frames and
keyframes we can figure out what this
time slider means right here you see two
numbers on this time slider and
everything down here by the way this is
all your animation buttons right here so
you see 0 and 100 right now the zero
button is the current frame you're at
zero here at the beginning of your
animation now there are a hundred
different frames in your animation so it
goes from all the way to zero to 100
being the end so that's how many frames
or that's the length of our animation
that we have to work with so now that we
know that let's go ahead and go over
some of the main buttons now the main
animation buttons you're probably
familiar with are these ones over here
you can go to start go
to end play previous frame you can go
through em one by one the most useful
button right here is probably this one
this is a time configuration for now I
want to leave everything is default but
this is pretty much a frame rate and
frame rate means how many frames or how
many pictures are in a second time
display don't mess with this playback
you might want to change if you want
what real-time means is playback in real
time and not lag or anything active
viewport only only means instead of
playing your animation all these
viewports only play in the active one
which saves a little bit on your
computer loop means play over and over
again this is a speed if you want to
play in slow motion or super fast or
something we come on play forward
reverse or ping-pong which means back
and forth and this is all this other
stuff is pretty obvious start time and
time and stuff like that but for now
just leave it for default I just want to
show you what was in here and what to do
with it so now that we got that under
control I guess let's just go ahead and
start animating something so you guys
can actually see what I'm talking about
now there are two different types or two
different main ways you can animate and
that's Auto key and set key while Auto
key means is anytime you move this on
the screen it creates a key for you what
set key means it gives you a little more
control and what this means is anytime
you have set key selected and you want
to make a keyframe you have to click
this little key right here and that'll
set a key for you so we're going to be
probably going to be doing one in this
tutorial but we'll do both if we have
time so let's go ahead and click Auto
key and make sure you're 0 100 so now
once you see you click Auto key and move
this anywhere on the screen a key is
created and now if you go ahead and go
to I don't know 15 and move this over
here you'll see that another key is
created so now we have a key between 0
and 15 so now let's go ahead and
move this somewhere like 255 and move it
back here and up a little bit and then
we'll move it to 90 and we'll move it
down over here and we'll also move it
down a little bit so narrow our ball has
four key frames one at zero one at 15
one at 55 one at 90 and from 90 to 100
it doesn't do anything it just stops for
a little bit so now we have four little
checkpoints that our ball has to check
in with so it goes from well let's just
play and I'll show you so now our ball
goes from there to there to there to
there and then checks in with all those
key frames that we selected so key
frames as you can see are pretty much
points that we want the ball to hit in
those periods of time so now if you want
to stop this just go ahead and click
pause and now to get rid of our key
frames for now let's just highlight them
and delete them and also delete this
first one and now let's work in set up
auto key with set key so go ahead and
click set key and now you can see that
set keys red and set keys a little bit
different now let's go ahead and back to
zero and go ahead and move this ball too
far away oh you can move anywhere you
want it doesn't really matter now
anytime you click set key you have to
set your key frames on manually so go
ahead and at zero zero three go ahead
and hit this key button that's going to
set a keyframe now let's go ahead to
something like 25 and move your ball
forward a little bit and up and now as
you can see unlike Auto key it doesn't
create a keyframe automatically with set
K we have to click this set key again
and that's going to create a keyframe so
now let's go ahead and move to 50 and we
can bring that a little bit closer and
down and why not move it over a little
bit
and right about there and we'll create
another keyframe by hitting this key
right here and at 75 or actually we'll
put it like 94 the end of our animation
will just go ahead and move our ball
over here and I don't know up a little
bit and set our key so now our ball goes
from this corner to the middle to over
here to over here so if you play our
animation we get down over there over
there in it as you can see just like the
other one um it hits all of those
keyframes that we determine and
keyframes are again they're just points
or locations that the ball goes and from
keyframe to keyframe all of the frames
in between are filled in by what is
expected of the ball do so for example
if you have one keyframe up here and you
have one keyframe over here then the
computer knows all right between your
keyframes I'm going to move the ball
from here to here and that's going to
give the appearance of animation so once
you play around with it a little bit
you'll understand the basics of key
framing and as long as you understand
the basics of key framing and what they
are animation is going to be a piece of
cake and if not then keep watching my
tutorials and you'll figure it out so
thank you guys for watching hopefully
you understand at least the basics of
basic animation so again thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
