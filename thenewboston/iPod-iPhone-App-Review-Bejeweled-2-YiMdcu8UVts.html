welcome to another app review in this
review we're going to be going over a
little game called bejeweled now
bejeweled is like a puzzle game and it's
one of my favorite games for the ipod
touch so let me go over here and
actually that bejeweled - I never got
the first one because this is the most
recent one so that's why so it loads up
in the first thing you're faced with is
four little options classic is pretty
much a regular game action is the same
thing but it's timed endless means I
mean in the classic version you can lose
in an endless it just keeps going
forever and then blitz is if you would
like one again on Facebook and connect
with your friends but I don't have any
friends so I'm going to go ahead and
pick classic and I'm gonna go ahead and
pick a new game I already have a game in
progress but I'll show you guys from the
start now the point of this game may be
our hold it a little closer like that
the point of this game is there are
different types of gems there code the
point is to get three gems in a row
either left or right or up and down now
for example I have this red gem right
here at the top that it's pointing to
and I have two other red gems right here
all you need to do is hold this red gem
and slide it over and you see it clicks
and make a little noise now let me move
this red gem right here maybe this is a
little easier see in a aside from
sliding you can also tap it and tap the
place you want to change it and that
will change it too so that's pretty much
the point just to slide gems until they
make three in a row and another thing
you want to look out for anytime you get
four in a row they create something
called a power gem now what power gem is
going to do is explode all the gems
around it and if you ever get five gems
in a row it's going to do something
called create a hyper cube and what a
hyper cube does is it blows up or excuse
me
what a hyper cube does is save this buek
blue cube is a hyper clue cube you can
slide it into a gem next to it let the
yellow gem and it's going to destroy all
the yellow gems on the entire board so
again try to get more than three in a
row if you can but if you can't then
just three is fine in this little green
bar at the bottom this is your lever
level bar once you get enough points
you're going to go to the end of the bar
and that's going to take you to the next
level now the next level is going to
require even more points but it's
essentially the same thing and if you
ever like say you slide this cube in
here and make three in a row if that Q
makes two sets of three in a row then
you get even more points so that's
pretty much the basics of the game just
slide in cubes into each other and it
actually gets incredibly addictive so
that's why I'm going to write this game
like I do every game I'm going to give
this game a nine out of ten because it's
so addictive and even though it's kind
of the same thing you can keep playing
it forever and ever and you pretty much
will never get bored because you keep
getting better at it so that's all I
have for this review again bejeweled in
my opinion is a 9 out of 10 game do I
recommend getting it yes I do it's
awesome and very addicting so that's it
for this a preview thank you guys for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
and let me know if you have any more oh
here's a hypercube right here I'll show
you this hypercube say now that I have
this type of cube I want to get rid of
every green one pretty cool huh in
anyways like I was saying don't forget
to subscribe and if you have any other
app you want me to review then just
leave a comment in this one and I'll try
to review for you and now here's power
cube but I don't got it in a row but
that's what it looks like right there
but anyways that's enough for this
review I hope you guys enjoyed and don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you next
