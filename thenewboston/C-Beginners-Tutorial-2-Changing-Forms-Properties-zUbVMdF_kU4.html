the toilet I'm making for London Boston
and in this tutorial I'm going to show
you how to change properties of your
form plant controls so first let's just
change the size of our form for it like
if we don't like the size of it ever
want to make it bigger or smaller all
you have to do is click on your form and
seems a little like boxes right out here
if you're just going to hover your mouse
over one of them and then just click and
drag and you can make your form any size
you would like I'm gonna make it about
that size though because that looks over
here the next thing is adding in trolls
to the one and what a control is is it's
anything that I do by user can interact
with or any things I perform for example
bought-in or checkbox or a label or
anything like that those are just common
ones so in order to add a button to our
form you just don't want to go over to
the toolbox and click and drag on the
button and then just release it out over
your form and it will be there another
way to add a control to your form is to
simply click it and then go over to the
form and love dragging and now you
should see if your cursor should look
something like this and then you can
just go ahead and click and drag and you
can draw the control to whatever size
you would like once you have placed your
controls you can move them you don't
have to like if you're not there you can
go ahead and just click and drag on the
control and you can move them around and
as you can see there are these little
lines around your control when you use
it and what that means is that it will
help you like align your control with
other controls so if we wanted to make
you feel like right next to each other
like that so it looks like cleaner then
we can just release and it'll be like
right aligned like that
or if we want to make it like a certain
like distance away from side it'll
always be like like when the arrow when
they're like the same like lined like
that that means you're like they're the
same distance away if you don't want to
do that you don't want you can like form
or your control to get like stock when
you're moving it all you have to do is
hold down alt and you can move it the
slightest bit and you
anywhere you want like those lines are
not there many penis release also you
can resize your control in order to do
that you're just going to go ahead and
hover your mouse over these little boxes
around your control and click and drag
you can make your control and your size
that you like
similar to the form if you want to
change the properties of control for
instance like the text or the color you
can want to go over to the properties
panel with your control selected in our
case it's a button
so we're just going to go to properties
panel and go out into text and we're
just in terms of text we're going to
click me and to just make the text that
just cannot click away
and as you can see now it is clicking if
you want to change like the color of the
control you can go over to the
properties panel again and select the
back color and just change that to
anything with like just click this
little drop down arrow right there and
change it to black I guess or I can't
really see the text so that's not really
good
but yeah so there are a lot of other
controls here I encourage you to like
mess with them because I'll just help
you get more acquainted with sharp um
another thing that you can do is debug
your application and what that means is
it will build your application I'm going
to run it which means that it will check
to see if there are any errors and it
will like create your application so so
P block all you're going to want to do
is click the green arrow right up there
or you can click f5 and that will be
blog and as you can see now we have our
application right here and it has all
the properties that we did we have our
button or the white color for the
background and we have a rubber button
and if you click them nothing will
happen yet we haven't coded for that for
anything yet but if you decide to stop
you you can either click the
both X button on your application or you
can click back to C sharp and click
shift f5
and that will stop debugging no matter
what no matter if your application is
frozen or anything like that so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial in the
next tutorial we'll get into actually
writing code so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
