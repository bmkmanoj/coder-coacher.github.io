back and if you made it this far then
you are in luck because this is where
things are gonna start getting really
good because starting with this tutorial
I'm gonna show you guys how to use UIKit
dynamics and what that is is essentially
a way that we can apply real-world
physics to objects on our screen which
makes it really awesome whenever making
games and a few things that you can do
with this are like I don't know say you
have like a character or just a shape on
the screen you can apply gravity to it
and collision detection between like
characters or objects and that's really
useful because if you ever tried making
a game and trying to like add gravity or
even collision detection on your object
it's like it's a pain in the butt
writing all those formulas and see if
seeing if the pixels overlap and oh my
so what iOS did is they pretty much made
a class where all this is built in and
you can of course customize it a little
bit but it's really easy to make in just
a few lines of code so pretty stinking
awesome let's go ahead and get started
so the first thing I did is I created a
brand new blank project nothing new and
I'm gonna hop right over to my view
controller and clean it up a little bit
so instead of let me delete that instead
of dragging any objects on our
storyboard what I'm gonna do is I'm just
going to create everything right through
code so it'll be a little bit easier
alright so for this example I'm just
going to create two very simple shapes
and we already know the basics of
creating shapes and animating them so I
wrote I won't really spend too much time
but I will add a comment I'll say uh
creates two shapes and I'll just make
like two simple rectangles so VAR I'll
name this one green square and of course
it's a uiview object and I'll make
another one and this is of course I want
to make too because eventually I'm gonna
be showing you guys how
collision detection which means whenever
they bump into each other in the real
world they wouldn't like blend into each
other or like overlap they actually
would act like real world objects and
kind of you know move each other or just
smack into each other and kind of behave
like we would expect them to so I'll
make a red one since we'll be easy to
differentiate alright so now we actually
should probably actually create these
since we have a reference to them
alright so we had another one create the
shapes so I wanted to add variables
outside because later on we're gonna
build additional methods and we need
them as well so now in the viewdidload
is where you initialize them in other
words create them so in order to create
these rectangles we need to give it
parameters in other words when your app
first starts out where do you want these
shapes to appear and also how big are
they simple enough so I'm just gonna
make a new variable called domen for
dimensions and of course any time you
want to make a rectangle at cg rekt make
make a new rectangle now the first two
parameters are the coordinates so I'll
put this one at like a 25 25 and the
last two are just the width and the
height of it and I'll put a like at a 60
60 so this will be a square that's 60 by
60 and it appears somewhere in the
top-left corner
25 over and 25 down so those are my
dimensions now after this I'm gonna take
that Green Square and I'm gonna call UI
view and the frame of this takes as you
see a CG direct and those are just the
dimensions the parameters of how you
want to make your rectangle so after
this we have a rectangle made but these
are just pretty much the outlines of the
blueprint we don't have any color yet or
it's pretty much this invisible
rectangle right now so if we take that
invisible rectangle and called
background color on it then what we can
do is we can set that to a UI color and
what was this green square so I'll say
green color so this sets up the location
and the size of it and now we added some
color to it so we can actually you know
see it so now if I just copy this I can
pretty much do the same exact thing for
the red one now of course for dimensions
I don't want to create that variable
again but you can use the same one to
overwrite it all right so I'll put this
like I don't know how big is it 25 all
right so like 130 across in 25 down and
the size of this will be a little bit
bigger it will be 90 by 90 so again the
first one is gonna appear 25 over and 25
down it's gonna be kind of small and the
other one the red one is going to appear
130 pixels over 25 down so they'll be at
the same height but this one would be a
little bit bigger and this one is of
course code Red Square and this is all
good
make a Red Square view object with these
dimensions now for the background color
it's just going to change this to red
color so it is a different color simple
enough so now we have two objects in
memory but in order to add them to the
screen so they actually display what we
need to do is we need to take self view
which pretty much means this view the
main screen and we want to add a sub
view which means add a sub view object
obviously and what was that first one
green square and do the same thing for
red so pretty much means add two objects
to the screen Red Square
alright so simple enough so this if we
go ahead and just run this it's just
going to create the objects in that
location of that size it's not gonna
apply any physics to it or anything like
that yet because we didn't actually use
uikit dynamics yet we just created some
objects put them on the screen and
they're good to go
so obviously you look at these things
they look like they're begging to be
dropped so in the next tutorial I'm
going to show you guys how to add
gravity to your screen and whenever we
do it's going to cause as soon as the
screen loads these objects to start
falling towards the ground it's gonna be
pretty sweet so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
