and thirtieth Android tutorial what
we're going to do is we're going to
obtain a API key for Google Maps we need
to obtain one of these every time we
develop an application with Google Maps
in it so you guys want go to this
website code.google.com
Android for don's forward slash Google
- api's forward slash map key dot HTML
and that's going to basically help us to
walk through setting up a Google Maps
project and over here you can get the
overview we've kind of done everything
so far all we need to do now is get the
AP air that get the Maps API key so
we're going to click that and I thought
I would have taken us to where we were
okay yeah and then it brings us here
then we can click obtaining Maps API key
and they kind of walk you through
everything first we're just going to get
a debugging key so you guys can follow
along easier but when we sign our
application we're going to have to get a
specific fingerprint for our application
for it to work on you know on the
marketplace but as for now we're just
going to work with the debugging one and
the first thing that we have to do is we
have to find basically where this debug
keystore is located and also you guys
want to open up your command prompt by
on Windows you just hit the start button
and then type CMD into into the search
and hit enter and then run your command
prompt on Mac you guys want to go to
your terminal which I believe is which
is your your applications and then your
utilities and then your terminal so open
that up now what we need to do again is
we need to find this resource so we're
going to do is we're going to go into
eclipse and for Windows you want to go
to the windows tab for mac you want to
go to your clips tab and then click
preferences once we open up our
preferences we're going to go to the
Android folder and then to the build
path and as you can see here
where my path is located so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to copy this
this debug keystore path that we're
going to use later when we work with
command prompt or the terminal so just
make sure you have that copied and there
we go and now what we're going to do is
we're going to open up our command
prompt and we're going to basically type
what is right here so pretty simple so
what you guys want to type out is a key
tool - list - alias Android debug key -
key store whoa
and then we paste our file path which
guys just copied so we have this key
sort here and then we just say - store
paths and password is Android or say
I've setup and then also our key pass is
Android as well we hit enter and it
gives us this unique fingerprint so
we're going to copy this just ctrl copy
and then what we need to do is we need
to register that fingerprint you need to
go to the signup page here and then we
have to print our fingerprint and you
guys will probably have to have a Google
account a gmail account or something so
we just paste that there yeah yeah you
can read this it's all that good stuff
and hit generate API key and here we go
here is your unique key and all the
seller good stuff that we can reference
later so just make sure you save that
and then watch the next tutorial where
we actually use this and you guys
understand what's going on here so
thanks again for watching guys and hope
it wasn't too confusing I'll see you
guys in the next tutorial peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
