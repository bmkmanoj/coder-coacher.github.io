what is going on today we're going to
learn how to transform our objects in
Illustrator cs6 and we're going to do
this by using the bounding box and this
is the easiest way you can transform
your objects and with the bounding box
you can quickly scale you can reflect
and rotate an object and pretty much you
have some cool things that are going on
and I'll show you how to do them so just
go ahead and click on your object make
sure you have the selection tool
selected and we'll go over scaling first
now if you want to scale along to axises
you're going to drag from a corner
handle like this if you want to scale
from one axis you're going to use a side
handle see and you can't move you can't
scale it up or down when you're doing it
this way it's just going to make a
fatter if you're scaling from side and
for my top one is this going to make it
taller or shorter now if you're dragging
from one of these and say you're
dragging from the corner here and you
hold shift you're going to dry you're
going to scale proportionately and it's
not going to get all skewed or anything
like that like I could do if I wanted to
skew this I could drag it like this or
something like that and the other thing
that is if you want to scale from the
center you're just going to hold alt
when you scale and that's gonna as you
can see here it's scaling from the
center and if I hold shift and all its
going to scale proportionately from the
center which is pretty cool alright the
next thing I wanted to do is show you
how to reflect something and this is a
neat little trick if you grab from one
of the sides and you move it completely
to the other side it's going to reflect
it
that'd probably work a little better
with something like this where you can
see the actual difference all right
there we go and actually reflected it
now if I go and drag the handle across
and then I hit shift it's going to flip
it like that the next thing I want to
show you is rotating if you go to the
edge corner here and move a little bit
past the handle the cursor will turn
into this double a curved arrow here and
you click and you just drag and that
starts rotating it for you and that's
easy enough now if you want to rotate
something exactly 180 degrees just drag
it right across so that's easy enough so
we can come to the side here and that's
the rotating of 180 degrees that I was
talking about use your snap to guide to
know that you're right on target and
there you go that's 180 degrees let's
talk about use the side ones to rotate
if you want to do a 180 degree turn so
if you want to transform an object but
you need to use exact values or
percentages you can also do that too and
that's in the transform panel so let's
go to window and then go to transform
now we have the transform window here we
can put in exact movements here these x
and y are for moving it along the
artboard the width W and H are width and
height and that's for scaling this it
looks like two magnets coming together
that constrains the width and the height
so then when when you put in another
value you can watch the height is going
to stay with it
or the height is going to change also
and it's just going to stay in the same
area if I uncheck this actually it was
unlinked before now it is length so let
me do this let's go to 180 and now you
can see that the height also went up
with it we've got different angles for
rotation as well so if I just want to
rotate the 60 degrees there we go and
then this one is here here is for
shearing and if i'll just tell you what
sharing does what's goes 3 and just kind
of like skews it and gives it a
different look so that's a all about
transforming the object and this is with
using the bounding box so that's all i
wanted to show you on that pretty much
if you don't see a bounding box you want
to go up to your view menu and you want
to make sure that bounding box is on so
right here I have you can click on hide
bounding box to hide the bounding box
but if it's not showing up then you want
to click here where it will say show
bounding box you show bounding box just
in case you can figure it out so thanks
a lot for watching this one i'm all done
with talk about transforming objects
with the bounding box and give the video
a thumbs up if you liked it have a good
one everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
