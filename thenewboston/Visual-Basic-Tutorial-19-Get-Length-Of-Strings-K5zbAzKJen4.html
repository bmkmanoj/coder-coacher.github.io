slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taken to another look at strings now we
looked at strings in the last tutorial
and for the next couple upcoming
tutorials we are also going to look at
some other stuff that you can do with
strings so let's go ahead and get
started now we're going to come up here
and we're going to declare a variable so
let's go ahead and dim a username as
string so now what we're going to do is
we're going to prompt the user to enter
in their username so we'll just do
console dot write line what is your
username now username is going to be
equal to console dot readline so
basically just get what they typed in
now what we're going to do is we're
going to test to see if their username
is a certain length so we're just going
to make a simple if statement so if
username and now we're going to do is
we're going to add a period so if
username dot and you can see here that
intellisense pops up with a whole bunch
of stuff that we can do you can copy you
can do dot contains there's a whole
bunch of stuff that you can use with
strings and this is very useful so what
we're going to use is username dot
length and now if you read the
description for this it's going to say
gets the number of characters in the
current system dot string object so if
username dot length equals 10 then go
ahead and do something so we'll just do
console dot write line you have been
granted access
now what we're going to do is we're
going to add consult read line so that
our program won't close right when we're
done so now I'll say what's your user
name and if I type in something that's
10 characters long so let's just say 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 if we press ENTER it
will say you have been granted access
now if we type anything else that's not
equal to 10 so let's just do something
more than 10 it's not going to say
anything so let's just go back in here
and add a simple else now what we're
going to do is we're going to do console
dot write line your username is not the
right length
so now if we run this it'll say what is
your username so if we type something
that's not ten characters on it you'll
say your username is not the right
length now what we can also do instead
of using if username dot length equals
ten we can just go ahead and do if user
not user name dot length dot equals and
the inside of the arguments for equals
it'll ask us for an object as an integer
so we'll go ahead and do ten right there
now this is just another way that you
can test the length value of username
and dot equals can be used for a lot of
other other things in Visual Basic so if
we run this it should work so one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
and it'll say you have been granted
access now this is a really simple
simple tutorial and you shouldn't have
to practice it and go ahead and stay
tuned for the next tutorial and thanks
