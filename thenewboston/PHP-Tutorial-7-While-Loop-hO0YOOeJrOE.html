tutorial and this tutorial I'm going to
be teaching you guys how to use loops
now what a loop allows you to do is
repeat an action many times depending on
what your condition is and it performs
this action while it's true and once it
becomes false it breaks it or stops
doing it so let me just show you guys
what I'm talking about
I'm going to go ahead and create a
variable called num which stands for
number and I'm going to set it equal to
one now to do the most basic loop is
called a while loop and to do this you
just simply type in while and then you
enter a condition so I'm going to say
while the variable num is less than or
equal to we'll go 5 so while the
variable which is 1 is a less than or
equal to 5 we want you to and this is
going to have a punch line so just put
your curly braces in now
so while that we want you to echo
the number so it's going to spit out the
number one right now and then we're just
going to enter a break tag and if you
don't know any HTML or XHTML this right
here just means go to the next line so
we don't have it all bunch together and
then after that we want you to take the
variable num which we call it and
increase it by one every time so here's
what this all means while the number is
less than or equal to five we want you
to echo the number which means just
print it out on the screen and then this
means add add add a break while I said
that a bunch of times at a data break I
want you to add a break which means go
to the next line and we want you to
increase the number by one and do this
whole thing again while it's less than
or equal to five so let's save this and
see what it looks like as you can see
one two three four five
and that's the while loop so what this
does is first it gives number one and
spits it out since it's less than or
equal to five and then it adds another
one to it now it's two now it spits it
out since the left center you go to five
and then it adds another one three and
once it gets the five as you can see in
our condition right here the action
stops what you did right here so now
that you know how to do a basic while
loop in the next tutorial I'm going to
be going over some other more useful
loops Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
