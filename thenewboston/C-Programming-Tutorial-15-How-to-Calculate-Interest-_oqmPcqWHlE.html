video what I want to do is I want to
teach you guys a nice little shortcut to
when you're right in certain equations
you can use this and also it's good for
things like I know you can't you see
with a web programming but like to
increment pageviews or maybe you're
making a program to calculate compound
interest or just basic interests
anything like that so what it is is I'll
do it the old-fashioned way and it's not
the old-fashioned way I mean it works
but then I'll show you guys a better way
so say we wanted to calculate views for
website so we'll put int pageviews and
might as well just set this to zero at
first because of course when our website
is first created we don't have any views
and of course pageviews is equal to
pageviews plus one so what's going to
happen is every time we get a new page
view we basically want to add 1 to the
value so 1 2 3 so on and so forth so
what this is basically saying is take
the old value of pageviews which is 0
and add 1 to it so now the new value is
1 so again the one on the right-hand
side of the equal sign is the old value
and the new variables value is whatever
this equation is so it's now 1 so what I
want to do now is just print F and we'll
just verify this a couple times so page
views and then we'll put % D and bump it
to no line and I probably need
quotations around the day wow I can't
freakin type the day alright and of
course for % d what do we want to use
page views and actually I'll copy this
few times so it's actually not stupid
now let's go ahead and run this bad boy
and we can see the first time it prints
out is 1 then 2 then 3 and again the
reason it doesn't start at 0 even though
we set at 0 or even though we set it
equal to 0 up here as well I was trying
to say is because it ran this equation
and set that equal to 1 and this was a
spot where it printed out for the first
time so we know how to make a little
incrementer but there's a faster and
easier way so instead of actually using
page views because that doesn't even
apply to see because it can't you know
you see for website let me go ahead and
make like a interest calculator so let's
go ahead and make a balance for a bank
account and we'll set it equal to 100
actually you know what this is our money
set a with a thousand why the heck not
so what you can do and oh you myself a
little space to work with so what you
can do instead of having balance equals
balance whatever you can actually do it
all in one shebang so if you hit the
asterisk which of course is multiply and
hit the equal sign then what this is
saying is well actually I'll type in the
equivalent line of code equals balance
times 1 point 1 so this is pretty much a
shorthand way of writing this these do
the exact same thing and I know that
this is kind of awkward to look at but
once you do it a couple times it's going
to become like second nature so
basically like I said this is taking the
old balance multiplying it by 1.1 and
then returning that new value in the
variable so now we can just go ahead and
print let me steal this from up here
outputs
balance is percent F and of course
that's the balance so if we wanted to
make a program like I said to calculate
if we had a thousand dollars and we'll
say that um I don't know ever every time
we print this out it's like one year or
something so after three years
what would our balance be anyone want to
guess
too bad going to run it so alright so
after the first year we have much
interest if you earn a hundred bucks
after the second year or excuse me
our total amount is one thousand two
hundred and ten and after third year
1331 we are becoming rich how freaking
awesome is that so again that is a
quicker way to do it and eventually when
I talk to you guys about these thing
called loops they're pretty cool I'll
show you guys an even faster way to do
this so our skills are just getting more
and more efficient but for now I think
you guys need a break so I'm going to go
ahead and feed pussycat another bagel
and I'll see you guys in next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
