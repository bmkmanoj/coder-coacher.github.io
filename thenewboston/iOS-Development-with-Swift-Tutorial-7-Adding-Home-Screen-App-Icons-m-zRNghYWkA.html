awesome app developed the next thing I
want to show you guys how to do is add
an app icon so if you run the simulator
dundun to do all right there it is now
if we want to see the icon then what you
normally do is you just normally press
the home button on your iPhone but of
course the simulator doesn't have all
the hardware controls so what you can do
to resemble that is go to hardware home
and this will resemble clicking the home
button takes you right there now of
course the default icon for this is just
a stupid one that iOS gave you it kind
of looks like a weird grid to look in
spider web we obviously want to design
our own custom app icon so what you
typically want to do is you want to
design this in any photo editor program
program Photoshop anything like that and
you want to make it square and you want
to save it as a ping now if you want to
go ahead and do that right now with your
own custom logo on it go ahead but what
I did before this tutorial is I just
uploaded a bunch of default ones on my
forum to save you guys some time so if
you go to my website and go to forum and
then you go down to a section called iOS
development swift what I did is I put
them all in the start called example app
icons from tutorials so you can click
that and here they are so again I said
make sure that you have all of your
designs as a square and the reason that
I say this is because some people try to
develop them like design them with
rounded corners but your iOS system is
going to round the corners by default so
it's going to look weird if you round
the corners and then it rounds them too
it looks like um distorted and messed up
now another thing you're probably
wondering is okay why did you give me
like five different ones right here all
of different sizes well you need
different sizes because devices the
different Apple devices iPad the
different versions of the iPhone they
all display different resolution icon
and of course the higher resolutions are
with the newer models so Apple makes you
um pretty much add very specific sizes
and you can just copy mine 181 2087 80
and 58 these are all the pixels so there
you go you can just download all mine or
make them your own and another thing I
want to mention before I'm going kind of
off on a tangent here but if you guys
have any questions about anything
iOS related or if you just want to you
know discuss look for tips then you can
go ahead and post them on this forum and
also all of the source code from these
tutorials whenever we start coding I put
it on the forum for you guys so you guys
can just watch this tutorial and copy it
if you want and another thing this
drives me nuts whenever you're making a
new post be like okay question about iOS
in your posting source code please use
this button and post your source code in
here when you just post it regularly it
looks really dumb so this is a source
code button posted in there alright so
go download all of those images and what
was I talking about now that we have
them downloaded how do we add them to
our Xcode project well what we need to
do is we need to open up this file right
here images dot X cassettes whatever
it's called now once we have that what
we need to do is in the Select column
select app icon now if you're looking
and say okay these are all the spots
obviously where I have to drag in those
icons that I just downloaded I have mine
open right there but look at this if I
select one of these it says twenty nine
point forty point sixty point oh crap I
just developed out of mine and pixels
how am I supposed to convert point two
pixels well it's kind of stupid that
they just write the point value instead
of the pixel value but if you ever want
to know how many pixels belong in each
one and this is I don't want to say it's
a fun game but it's no it's pretty fun
you take the points
which is 29 and you multiply it by this
little on the range so 29 times 2 is 58
so 58 pixel by 58 pixel icon goes in
here and we won and if you ever try to
drag one that doesn't fit for example if
you ever tried to like arm 29 times 3 is
obviously not 58 so if you try to jam it
in there you're going to get this little
error right there so now we can just go
ahead and say remove selected items
what is 29 times 3 well it's 87 what
about this one 40 point times 2 means
you need to 80 pixel by 80 pixel 40
point times 3 means that you need 120 60
times to 120 and 60 times 3 180 so now
we have all of those designs and this
should look good on every device we now
have a cool little icon for it
so if we want to test it out then what
we can do is we can go back actually we
don't even need to go back but I'm going
to go back to my main storyboard and
just run this bad boy again
and there's my simulator so now we can
go to Hardware click the home button and
check it out so again this is going to
work on every device and well that's it
so thank guys for watching don't forget
subscribe it and like I said if you guys
have any questions about any tutorials
or if you want any of the source code in
the future go to my forum and ask I'm on
there all the time so yeah see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
