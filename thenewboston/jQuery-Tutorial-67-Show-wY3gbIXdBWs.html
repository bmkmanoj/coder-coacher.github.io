with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in the last video we looked at the hide
function in jQuery the effect in jQuery
and we successfully hid an element by
clicking a button so we clicked hide and
this text disappeared we then used a
callback function to tell the user the
the element had been hidden and I
explained a bit about why we were why we
would use callback functions in this
tutorial we're gonna look similarly at
show so if we go ahead and change hide
here to show nothing will happen at the
moment because the element is all
automatically shown by default so when
we show the element we don't really show
anything because it's already been shown
now this show function applies to
elements that have a visibility of
nothing so for example if we were to
come into our div here and type style
equals and create some inline CSS we
could actually hide this element by
default so when the page loads we can
hide this element by default so for
example I would write display:none now
when I let's just modify this button as
well so it says show if I was to refresh
now when I click show this element is
shown and then we have our callback
function with element hidden but
obviously we've shown our element that
was just wiper in here so it's just
changed that to shown okay so what
happens if you want to eradicate the use
of CSS but automatically make specific
elements hidden by default and then be
able to show them now in side-effects
jeaious we can use the document.ready
functionality to hide any elements we
want and then allow this click event to
actually reshow them so let's go ahead
and say document dot ready
and inside here we need a function we
need our function block and we're going
to pull that down so we can write our
code in here so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to choose the element a
underscore div you remember using the
hash the dollar sign outside of these
parentheses and I'm gonna say dot hide
and that's it
so we've automatically hidden this when
the page is loaded so we're not using
any CSS styling but we're using jQuery
to handle the fact that we're hiding
this element once the document is ready
what we can then do is use the button to
catch the event show this slow linear
and then use the callback function to
alert that the element has been shown
let's go ahead to our browser and test
this out now you can automatically see
that the element has been hidden despite
the fact that we haven't used any CSS to
do so
so when we go ahead and click show we
get the same functionality we have some
text inside here and then we have
element shown so the two functions hide
and show both both work in opposite of
each other where the hide actually sets
the element visibility to none and the
show removes this element or removes
this visibility set to none so this is a
problem because obviously we can only
show and hide with one set of function
however there is a toggle function which
we'll be looking at a bit later on that
allows you to simultaneously hide and
show elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
