tutorial and in this tutorial i'm going
to show you guys how to use animation
and how to make things move around on
the screen now we already moved around a
couple things with like the keyboard and
the mouse but I want to show you guys
how to move it around just on its own so
if you ever worked with Ajax before you
probably know how to do this but anyways
I'm gonna show you how anyways so I got
my basic um background image file and
mouse image file with using the
background in the ball and I also
converted it to our background and ball
so there you go so that's what we have
to start out you should know what those
things are already but now what we need
to do is go ahead and put those things
on the screen but before you do that I
want to make a variable that's gonna
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
change the x-coordinate of the ball so
if we're gonna change it we probably
need a variable for it so just set X
equal to zero right now and I know you
don't know what does but you will soon
enough so now that we have X equal to
zero and hopefully you have the rest of
that stuff what we need to do is go
ahead and blit the background onto the
screen so screen blitt and for our
parameters click background or whatever
you named yours press your name and
background actually and you want
position this is zero zero zero zero so
it fits on the screen perfectly so
nothing new with background what we do
want to change is that ball so what we
want to do is when we've lit this the
excuse-me ball to the screen bullet look
that aren't you know we were gonna do we
want to blitt the ball and we want the
position to be not fixed we want to be
the x-coordinate is variable so x and
then 160 further y so its y-coordinate
is never gonna change but the x is going
to change she was saying all right then
make a change well all right then I will
X plus equal one so now what we're going
to do is every time this
Loup refreshes which should be like
every fraction of a second then we're
going to add one to the x-coordinate so
it's going to start out is zero and then
it's going to go the coordinate is going
to go one 162 163 164 165 160 and as
these coordinates change your ball is
going to give the appearance of going
the left and right across the screen so
again if we did this it would do it for
a fraction of a second and then go off
into like a million 160 off the screen
but what we want to do is just for
viewing purposes we want to say all
right when you get to the edge of our
screen which is 640 pixels wide we want
you to start over again at 0 just so we
can see what's going on so let's write a
simple if statement if X is greater than
640 which means if it goes off our
screen what we want to do is reset the x
coordinate to zero and what this is
gonna do is every time the ball gets to
the end of the screen and reaches 640
it's gonna pop up back to zero again and
this is all gonna happen real fast just
because python runs really quick but
you'll see why this is useful so now you
see our animation which our ball keeps
going on screen left and right and if
this is too fast for YouTube it's too
fast even their own program in it but
what this happens is the ball starts out
at 0 160 and travels across the screen
until it gets the 640 160 then it pops
back so I know this probably looks weird
on YouTube because of the frame rates
and stuff but this is actually going
left to right left to right then hopping
back so that brings me to another
problem that this has gone too fast that
we can even see and there's a way to fix
this so you can see it perfectly and
this is give you your animations you
want time exactly how you want whether
it's slower in that or god forbid faster
than that so that's where we're going to
be going over in the next tutorial but
for now just make sure you learn how to
animate simple movement using a while
loop and how to change one of the
coordinates dynamically and this is just
useful so it goes back and you can view
over and over again
and this doesn't go off the screen till
forever so thank you guys for watching
that tutorial don't forget to check out
my next tutorial where I show you how to
time it better so you can actually view
it instead of giving you a seizure so
again thank you guys for watching and
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you next disorder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
