the spry validation form input boxes and
everything that has to do with forms
tutorial hopefully you've been watching
each of my tutorials and if you have
been then you understand exactly how
forms work you understand each
individual piece of forms and how to
validate them this tutorial is going to
wrap up with the spry validation of a
radio group so to get started we click
on a spry validation radio group over
here to the left and you can see it pops
up with some options for us to tell
dreamweaver exactly what we want to put
inside of our right our group and in
this example we're going to we're going
to create a radio group that has a list
of different shipping companies so usps
usps fedex and UPS and what what the
validation of a radio box is good for is
a few different things if you want to
make sure that the user is inputting or
is selecting a a choice that we have
given them inside of our radio group so
basically it's it's used to require that
the user actually selects something that
we have created inside of a radio group
so now that we've done that you can see
that it created our radio group for us
you're clear on page properties and say
ok and now we can see that inside of our
properties tab we have the spry radio
group and we don't have very many
options here this one is very similar to
the spry validation of a checkbox group
we have the empty value
the invalid value which basically says
we can say that an empty value could be
one that has a value of ups even though
that's not an empty value but i'm just
going to show you that if you do type
ups inside of empty value and that's
just saying that anything with value UPS
is considered empty and i'm going to say
that fedex is an invalid value just so
we can be sure that these are actually
working so i'm going to go ahead and
save this and i'm going to run it and
remember that this should not submit if
empty value or invalid value is selected
so we have ups and that doesn't count
because it's in the empty value and then
we click fedex that doesn't count
because that is an invalid value so the
only thing that is going to count here
is usps so that's all there is to it for
working with a span radio group usually
you're not going to I can't think of a
case where you're going to have a n
empty or an invalid value because the
things that you're creating are things
that have to be selected so if you do
need to to use an invalid or n empty
value now you know how to but basically
that is it for the radio group spy
validation so in the next tutorial I'm
going to basically do an overview of
everything that I've talked about that
has to deal with forms and spry
validation I'm going to create an actual
more more of a usable form for grabbing
data for signing up for service and you
will see how all this ties together
in a real workable form so make sure you
guys stay tuned and come back from the
next tutorial make sure you guys
subscribe and I'll see you in the final
forms tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
