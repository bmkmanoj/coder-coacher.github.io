video we're finally gonna start learning
some cool functions the very first one
let's just go ahead and jump right into
it is today
so anytime you want to insert the
current date hit equals today it pops up
when you start typing in it takes no
parameters and hit enter now of course
today is 11 5 14 now actually I got a
story to tell but first before I tell
you guys this story I want to mention
this this date function right here it's
dynamic and whenever I say that I mean
whenever you close whenever you save
this program and open it up tomorrow
it's not gonna say 11 5 it's gonna say
11 6 so just remember that for this
function so it's not really good let's
say you like wanna log when you're
employees came into work don't use today
because it's not gonna work properly so
when would you want to use this say
you're making an invoice and every time
you print it out you want to print the
current date that's a good example of
when you would use this function so now
that we've got that boring stuff out of
the way let me tell you about my story
so today is 11 5 it's 3 a.m. it just
turned on the 5th but yesterday was
Election Day and I didn't know it
because I really hate politics and I'm
not I don't know I probably should worry
about that stuff but I got other stuff
to do so I wasn't really paying
attention to what day it was because I
really didn't care and I went to get
Chinese food and the guy um the guy I
picked up my food and he goes happy
erection day I go erection day what uh
and I walked out I'm like ok and then I
saw someone um on Bucky's room talking
about Election Day I'm like ok thank God
he wasn't I can actually go back and get
Chinese food but you know what do you
guys care about my Chinese foodie and
experience you guys just care about
Excel so let's talk about looks out a
little bit more now any time you want to
autofill dates you can do it the same
way that you autofill something like
numbers
so actually if we copy this then it's
just gonna copy the same date because
it's copying the formula I'll show you
guys real quick but whenever we type in
the date manually so say we manually
type 10115 2014 and then we try to fill
in some more cells what it's going to do
is it's gonna increment by one day at a
time so the increment of one day is the
default increment but sometimes we don't
want to auto fill by one day we want to
increment by like maybe a week or maybe
one month so twelve five and then which
would be the next month was one five
2015 so how do we change the increment
well one cool thing that we can do
instead of a dragging with the left
mouse button if you actually hold down
the right mouse button and I know I this
is gonna look the same but I'll click
the right mouse button start dragging
and then release whenever you release
it's gonna give you a new pop-up menu
fill days this is how it filled by
default before fill weekdays fill months
and fill years so I'll go ahead and
select fill months that sounds like some
guys named fill months that'd be a
pretty cool name if you know he was in
Excel so man my jokes are just getting
worse aren't they but anyways whenever I
select that then it says okay you want
to increment by months instead and of
course if you select another option
it'll fill by whatever you selected but
I don't need to demonstrate that now
another thing that I want to actually
demonstrate is this so let me type in
like I don't know um 4:8 1990 I'll say
that's Jim Randle day and of course
today's they might as well use 11-5 2014
so let me go ahead and say that I don't
know so I was calculating someone's age
and they were born on 4 8 1990 actually
let me
say this is birthday and this is today
alright so say that we wanted to
calculate the age of this person so of
course what we to do is we would pretty
simple make an equal sign for a formula
okay so this is his birthday and of
course to get the age you just subtract
so okay birthday - today gives you the
age hit enter okay so he is eight
thousand nine hundred and seventy seven
days old but we have a little problem
here and that is whenever of course we
work with time since Excel is converting
this to a number behind the scenes it
gives us a negative number now we the
know that time can't be negative so
anytime you try to subtract dates and
get this problem you actually want to
use the absolute value function and that
is this ABS and I actually don't even
know if I told you guys about this
function yes yet but this gives you the
absolute value of whatever calculation
is inside the parameters so even though
this calculation turns out to be a
negative number whenever we throw in the
absolute gives us a positive a number so
make sure you always use absolute
whenever you're subtracting dates just
to make sure and another cool thing is
this if you ever just want to get um the
actual kind of the age that human beings
think of it instead of just a stupid
Excel format like for example how many
years old is this guy instead of like we
don't care how many days he is who talks
in that language what we can do is this
make a new formula instead of equal to
Year of the first date - year of the
second date and what this does is it
basically this this functionary here
year it takes whatever day is in the
parameter and it extracts the year from
it so it's pretty much saying 2014
- 1990 and that would give you a date
that you more expect you know kind of
more humanized year so what's another
thing that I can teach you guys um this
is actually going to come in handy a lot
whenever we have I'll just show you guys
the basics of this right now and it's
not really gonna make sense right here
but we're typically gonna do it whenever
you reference other cells but what we
can do is toss in three values in this
date function and it's gonna convert
those values or integers to a date so
say 2008 um I don't do something like 12
3 what it does is it takes three
integers hit enter and two converts it
to a date
now again instead of just typing the
values in because if we were going to
type something in we might as well just
you know add the forward slash and make
it a date this is gonna come in handy
whenever we have cells with three
integers in it say someone who's filling
out a form and this is our data is
formatted we can just reference those
other cells so something like this date
you won now hit enter and check it out
so that's when it would come in handy
again that's the date formula so holy
crap this videos again kind of long what
oh yeah I wasted all that time on the
stinking chinese-food story where it
ever alright so I'll save the rest of
the dating time functions for the next
tutorial and uh well yeah see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
