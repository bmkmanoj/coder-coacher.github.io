going to happen is these electrons are
gonna be passed right into the nadh
dehydrogenase which is the first main
protein and again it's embedded right in
your inner membrane of the mitochondria
so basically as electrons are
transferred to your NADH dehydrogenase
hydrogen ions are going to be pumped
from one side the side that they're on
now to the other side of the membrane so
basically you have two electrons that
mean that two hydrogen ions I'll draw
these right here are going to be pumped
through the NADH dehydrogenase to the
other side so just remember that the
first step is that NADH is going to give
its electrons to this molecule called
NADH dehydrogenase as that happens to
hydrogen ions and these if I write H
might be a little bit easier two
hydrogen ions are going to be passed
through from this side to this side so
there are two little you know hydrogen
ions right there h+ h+ so after this
what's going to happen is since this is
called the electron transport chain
these electrons are going to move down
to the next step so let me pick I don't
know orange I guess this is good color
so the next thing that they do is their
can be transferred to a molecule called
ubiquitin so this you so this is
ubiquitin right here and I'll draw the
electrons from here so basically so far
our electrons went from the NADH where
they started to nadh dehydrogenase to
the Ubiquiti
now the abit Kunene is basically like a
bus in the electrons are its passengers
it's going to take it from the nadh
dehydrogenase to another molecule and
this new molecule is called cytochrome
bc1 so let me go ahead and draw this
weird look in they don't really look
like this i just want to draw them all a
different shape and this is called
cytochrome B and this is how you write
it B C with a 1 so now of course our
electrons went from NADH dehydrogenase
got shuttled over by ubiquitin and now
they're in a molecule called cytochrome
bc1 so what did they do in cytochrome
bc1 well the first thing that they do is
before they go to the next complex we
need to take note that as these
electrons and I might as well draw them
as these electrons right here are about
to go on to the next step right here
your hydrogen ions are going to pretty
much do the same thing that they did in
the first thing because your hydrogen
ions are want to be paired with your
electrons so what's going to happen is
that one hydrogen ion for each electron
is going to be attracted to this and
then once it leaves it's going to be
shuttled through to the other side so
again just remember that two more
hydrogen ions if we're working with two
electrons it's going to be one hydrogen
ion for each electron is going to be
pumped to the other side so h plus h
plus and actually we end up with a ton
of hydrogen ions over here because you
know in ourselves there aren't just two
electrons there's actually a lot of
electrons but basically remember that
now your electrons are in the cytochrome
bc1 well what's the next step well the
next step is that they need to get
shuttled to over to another complex
called the cytochrome oxidase and let me
go ahead and draw that right now
I'll draw this dark red I get no no no
can't draw a dark red purple that's what
I'm looking for so this right here
actually let me draw it down a little
bit further I want to make this diagram
freakin perfect so this right here that
looks like a purple hotdog bun is
actually called cytochrome oxidase so
see
nice em and this is the next molecule
that the electrons are headed over but
how do they get over there from the
cytochrome bc1 to the cytochrome oxidase
well what they do is they need to take
another bus and this bus is actually
called cytochrome C and I'm running out
of colors here so this bus is actually
called cytochrome C a little arrow right
here and again you see how ubiquity took
two electrons at a time or multiple
electrons cytochrome C isn't as a
sophisticated bus as ubiquitin
cytochrome C can only handle one
passenger at a time one electron at a
time so it's basically gonna go back and
forth between cytochrome bc1 and
cytochrome oxidase and pick up one
electron at a time and shuttle them over
to cytochrome oxidase so now we have all
of these electrons in cytochrome oxidase
what happens next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
