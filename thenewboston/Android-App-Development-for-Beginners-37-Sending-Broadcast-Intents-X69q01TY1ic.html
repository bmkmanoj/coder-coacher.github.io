where I'm going to start talking to you
about broadcast intents and broadcast
receivers now it's a little weird
concept to understand the first but
essentially what a broadcast is is when
your app sends out a system-wide message
kind of like a radio broadcast it
doesn't really have any specific target
it's just sending out this really broad
message now the reason that this happens
is because you can make other things
called
broadcast receivers and whenever your
broadcast receiver says oh look at that
that message is something I want then
you can make your app do whatever I
don't know like whatever functionality
you want so what we're going to be doing
in this example I know it's kind of like
hard just for me to like talk talk about
and explain it but in this example what
we're going to be doing is we're going
to be making two entirely different
Android projects and these projects are
going to essentially communicate with
one another so how cool is that before
of course we could do things with
different classes and stuff but never
before have we created two entirely
different projects and have them be able
to communicate with each other so go
ahead and start a brand new project this
is going to be our first one and I'm
going to name this one um send broadcast
so one of the projects is going to act
like that radio tower it's going to be
responsible for just sending out that
system-wide broadcast in their other
projects it's going to be like hey I
actually want to do something whenever I
got that message so you know that's
what's going on so click Next
that looks good right there next we want
to set this one is a blank activity
suite alright so for the activity name
um we can just leave as main activity
right now it doesn't really matter
alright so here is our very first
activity and our very first project so
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to add one button to the screen and
whenever we click it it's going to send
out that broadcast to the entire phone
- anything that's listening for it and
in another project we're going to set up
it's something called a broadcast
receiver it essentially is just going to
listen for this specific broadcast and
then we'll just I don't know like print
out some text on the screen or something
so the first thing I want to do is just
add a button and I'll change the text of
this button to send broadcast I also
want to change the ID of this to send
button and the last thing I want to do
is I want to add a real quick quick on
click function and this function will
just call it send out broadcast broad
cast all right so three attributes and
again this is an alternate way to
essentially add this right here so again
whenever we click it it's going to call
this method send out broadcast in this
method it isn't included we're going to
have to write this in just a second but
essentially like I said what it's going
to do is it's going to send out a
system-wide broadcast to your entire
phone whatever's listening can perform
some kind of action so now let's hop
over to our main activity and let's just
go ahead and import all the stuff we
need import so in droid dot content
that's intent and I spelled Android
wrong so make sure you don't do that and
of course import Android view dot view
all right so the only thing that we need
to do here is we need to build one
method and that method is send out
broadcast because that's the only thing
that this activity in this project
essentially is going to do so public
void send out broadcast view view so the
first thing we need to do is we just
need to make in
tenth so intent I decide equal to new
intent now remember before I said
whenever you make an intent intent
generally what you do is you put some
kind of class in here and then it looks
for that class for example remember we
had that baking class in the last
tutorial and it just pops it up into a
new screen however this is a special
kind of intent because it doesn't have
an explicit
class or another screen that it's going
to call it's just going to kind of
broadcast a weird message to anyone
that's listening so that's why we don't
need to throw a class right in there so
after this what we need to do is take
that intent and call method on a called
set action now for right now just copy
this package name right here and throw
it in here as a string now the reason
that we need to set action on all of our
broadcast intents is this say that you
have a bunch of different programs on
your phone and they're all sending out
these broadcasts well maybe we want to
make a program later on but it only
wants to listen for broadcasts from this
application so again if we have like a
hundred different or one hundred that's
unrealistic if we have like ten
different apps and they're all sending
out broadcasts well we don't want to
listen for all of those we only want to
listen for this broadcast for this
intent so the set action is essentially
a keyword that I don't know it's like
this is the keyword for this broadcast
as essentially what it does so another
thing that I want to do real quick is
something called add flags and intent
flag include stopped packages now you
don't really need to memorize this just
make sure you have it in there every
time it's just because they change the
Android operating system and just to
make sure that this intent broadcast is
compatible with all versions of Android
you need to have this so you know that's
kind of their fault
nothing that we did so the last thing of
course in order to send that broadcast
you just send it out just like that
so now as soon as we click this button
what's going to happen is it's going to
call send out broadcast and what send
out broadcasts does is is just going to
say okay I'm sending out this broadcast
can anyone hear me this broadcast is
going out to the universe I'm sending it
out so of course that's what it does in
in the next tutorial what we're going to
be doing is we're going to be setting up
something called a receiver in a
brand-new project and it's going to
accept this or wait for this to happen
and then we'll just make something cool
happen whenever it occurs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
