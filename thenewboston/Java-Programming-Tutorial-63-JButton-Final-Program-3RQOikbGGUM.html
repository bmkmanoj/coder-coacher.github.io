tutorial and in the 60 second Java
tutorial we made two buns and put them
on the screen one right here and one
right here so now in this story where
we're going to be doing is building um
some kind of handling events so when we
click the button something actually
happens so we're actually going to be
building a whole new class called well
we'll name it something like handler
class but for now we're just going to be
creating the object for it so let's go
ahead and put handler class and we're
probably going to be getting an error
right there and we'll name a handler
object equals new handler class and why
we getting error because we didn't
create a class named Henry alert class
yet but trust me we will so now let's go
ahead and add some action listeners so
Reg which is the name of the first one
we'll just go ahead and add action
listener right there and for the
parameter it takes the object handler so
that's why we needed to create a class
before or excuse me an object before we
created that class Handler and let's go
ahead and just add the same thing to our
other bun which is named custom there we
go right there and what this pretty much
does add action listener is pretty much
the beginning of adding a pretty much a
handler for our buttons so anyways we
are let's see I think that's everything
we needed to put in the constructor so
this whole thing right here is your
constructor right here so we want to
build another class called handler class
but let's build it outside of the
constructor so and your parentheses and
outside of your constructor now let's
add some space right there let's go
ahead and type private class handler
class and we need to name it handler
class because we name this Hanover
Clause right here if you name something
different up here create it a create the
same done here and yes we are putting a
class inside this main class we are
allowed to put classes inside classes so
you know just letting you know we can do
that why because we just did and we'll
have this implements there we go
did I spell there implements action
listener and when a class implements
another class what does that mean when a
class implements another class like
we're implementing did I spell that
right I was wondering I was getting line
when we have a class in the implements
action listener
what does implement means I had a couple
of questions asked me on the other
tutorial what implement means in a
nutshell is we're saying to action
listener all right we want to use your
class in your method an action listener
says all right if you implement me I'll
let you use my methods but you have to
over write every single method in my
class and we're saying alright we're
going to inherit air all your classes
from you but we promise we're going to
overwrite it and it's a little more
complex than that but in a nutshell
that's
basically what it means so now any
method that's in the actionlistener
class we're going to have to overwrite
it and create one or so lucky for us
there's only one method in the
actionlistener class and this is called
action performed so lucky for us we only
have to create one method and it's going
to overwrite this action performed
method so let's go ahead and do that
right now we'll set it equal to public
void action performed just like this and
as a parameter it takes action event
event so that's all we have to do and in
the method body what we write in here is
what we want to happen when one of these
buttons are clicked so since we added
the functionality of add action listener
class to handler it pretty much whenever
we click this button this happens and
that's where we're going to create right
here to functionality for it so whenever
we create regular this is going to
happen whenever we create custom this is
going to happen so enough talking let's
just go ahead and do it what we want to
happen is we want J option pane to pop
up which is pretty much a separate
window and we want to show message
dialog and I didn't feel like typing it
because I was lazy so I just did that
and this takes a couple of parameters
itself and that is null and that's just
positioning and let's just go ahead put
string format put some text on the
screen first one will be nothing fancy
just % s and the second argument will
pretty much be event and you'll see what
this does later on myself press for you
get action command just like that and
now I just got to make sure I don't have
any errors and now with that we don't we
can go ahead and we can call this main
pretty much class so go ahead to where
your main method is for the whole entire
program because that's where we're going
to be doing
now as you can see you need to import
Java X swing jframe and this pretty much
lets you use windows i already imported
it because i didn't want to have to
forget so now we can go ahead and make a
GUI object so GUI or whatever you name
this class I'm going to name my GUI
object geo for GUI object equals new GUI
doesn't take any parameters in the
constructor and now just put go set
default close operation and you
definitely need to have this or else
your program is going to be able to
close and then you need put in here J
frame dot exit on close so make sure you
have that it's pretty important if not
that I spell something wrong is oh here
we go is undefined for the type of GUI
set default close per patient there we
go
spelling its key kids it's key
definitely need learning that skill in
school unlike me so the next thing I
want to do is pretty much set the size
for our window do we do this with a set
size billon method and you can set it to
anything you want I'm going to set mine
by 300 by 200 and the last thing is you
need to make sure it's a visible so go
dot set visible and it's boolean value
just set equal to true if you set it
equal to false and won't show up and we
do want to show up so let's go ahead and
run this right here and here's what we
see we see a regular button right here
that when we click it it says reg button
and we see a custom button that when we
hover over it the roll over changes and
when you click it it says custom okay
regular bun custom wow this is an
awesome program we should definitely
market this try to sell it to Microsoft
or someone because they could use this I
mean look this flawless no bugs or
anything that's amazing so now let me
see
time I left have left on my tutorial two
minutes I'll give you guys a quick
little walkthrough of how this works
again I'll just give you guys the meat
of the tutorial we created two variables
and those we're going to be the store or
buttons next thing in our constructor we
added a title to our window we gave our
window a layout which is pretty much
default layout we added a regular button
as you can see here and then we made two
images and we store them in objects B
and X and then we pretty much in added
another button a custom button with the
image B by default and when we roll it
over it we got the image X and we added
it to the screen lastly we created a new
class which pretty much was the to
handle the events when we clicked our
button we set our right for this regular
bun we want to have an event when we
click it and for this custom button we
wanted to have an event when you cooked
it so they just weren't pretty much
playing on buttons just sitting there do
nothing and then since we said our right
we want some functionality we actually
had to make a class to add some
functionality to it in this event get
action command this pretty much just
gave you arm the name of the button so
that's pretty much all that did um real
basic stuff here and the next tutorial
we're going to be going over some other
stuff for gooeys as well we're probably
going to be focusing on seong-gu ease
and event handling for a little bit
since you know it's pretty much one of
the coolest things in job what we can do
so thank you guys for watching this
tutorial don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
