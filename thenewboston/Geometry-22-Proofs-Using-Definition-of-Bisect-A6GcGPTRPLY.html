more proofs and specifically we're going
to use the definition of bisect to prove
things so first you have to remember
what bisect means so if you bisect
something you split it into two
congruent parts so if I said Point D by
six
well not point D if I said line CD say
it was this line right here bisects this
line a B that means that a B or say at
Point M am is congruent to M B now that
works for lines as well as angles so if
I said that this Ray Ray's see if Ray BC
bisects this angle that means that angle
ABC skin.we congruent to angle CBD so
using that information we're gonna do
some proofs so given that a ie bisects
ke V and that ie bisects K angle KIV
prove that ke is congruent to V E and K
are excuse me ki is congruent to VI okay
so first we're gonna write down our
given I bisects angle ke V and angle
okay I and that's given okay so what I
just said remember was when you went an
angle whenever excuse me when
a segment by sex and angle it splits it
into two congruent parts so if this line
bisects this angle that means that this
angle is congruent to this angle so
angle II sorry
angle n EK is congruent to angle and Evi
and we can do the same thing down here
because if this bisects this angle that
means this angle is congruent to this
angle so angle ni k is congruent to
angle and IV
so if bisect and angle split into two
congruent angles so next so we have
these two we have two pairs of congruent
angles and we're trying to prove that
this is congruent to this and this is
congruent to this so the best way to
prove that is to make these try to prove
that these triangles are congruent and
if you look we have an angle a shared
side right here which is congruent to
itself and another angle so the best way
to do that is say that triangle e ki is
congruent to triangle e VI and oh I'm
sorry I almost forgot a step first I'm
just gonna insert this right here this
will be two point five first we have to
say that E is congruent to e I and
that's reflexive property
and now we can say that the triangles
are congruent by angle-side-angle and
now that must mean that ke is congruent
to ve and K eyes congruent to VI
because if triangles are congruent then
the corresponding parts are also
congruent so that's all we're gonna do
today with proving things using the
definition of bisect but make sure you
come back and watch the next video
because in that video we're gonna talk
about using the definition of bisect to
prove that lines are perpendicular so
make sure you come and check that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
