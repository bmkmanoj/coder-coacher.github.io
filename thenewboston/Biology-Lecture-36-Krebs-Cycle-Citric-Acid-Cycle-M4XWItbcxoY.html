video and in this video I want to start
talking to you guys about the krebs
cycle now in the last video what I did
is I showed you guys how pyruvic acid
which was the ending molecule we had
after glide kosis becomes acetyl co a
because we need the molecule acetyl co a
to enter the krebs cycle and if you
don't know how you know prove a gas it
becomes acetyl co a please watch the
last video now the reason that I didn't
include that in this video is because
the krebs cycle as the name implies it's
a chemical process that repeats itself
in a cycle now the last video was kind
of a preparation intermediate stage
between glucose as' and the krebs cycle
some people include that preparation of
you know the perova Cassatt into the
kreb cycle but I like to keep them
separate if you know you have that
preparation stage in the Krebs cycle and
that's okay whatever floats your boat
but anyways let's go ahead and get
started with acetyl co a so this is what
we left the last tutorial with acetyl co
a and what this does is the very first
step in the crêpes lipoma might as well
a right step one over here by the way
they there are eight steps in case
you're wondering what happens is this is
a two carbon molecule to carbon acetyl
co a and what this does is it combines
with a four carbon molecule so just like
four carbon molecule and the four carbon
molecule is called let me spell it first
o X a ello acetate
oxaloacetate and of course whenever we
have a two carbon molecule and it
combines with a four carbon molecule we
end up with a six carbon molecule in
this new and improved six carbon
molecule is actually called citrate or
citric acid so that's why also aside
from the krebs cycle some people
actually call this the citric acid cycle
because that's the most famous molecule
in this process the reason that some
people call it the kreb cycle is because
a dude with the name of krebs was the
one who discovered this process so if
you want to call it the citric acid
it's acceptable kreb cycle also
acceptable but the key to takeaway is in
step number one of the krebs cycle we
start with acetyl co a which was a two
carbon molecule it combines with another
four carbon molecule to form citric acid
so now we can go ahead and take that
citric acid and enter it into step
number two so step two so of course we
have citric acid and step number two is
actually one of the easier steps because
all it does is basically take this
molecule citric acid and let me go ahead
and draw this molecule C so of course
this is a six carbon molecule like we
said and again there are other things
that are going to be bonded onto this
but I'm only going to draw the part that
I want to discuss right now I'll draw it
in a different color and let me go ahead
and draw in green o H bonded to this
carbon and a hydrogen bonded to this
carbon now of course we have stuff
bonded onto here here here all around
but step number two is only basically
ice or ice so I can't say this word I so
myrrh is a ssin basically this molecule
is going to get rearranged it's not
gonna have any more atoms added to it
it's not gonna have any atoms you know
taken away from it basically what's
gonna happen is this hydrogen is gonna
switch places with this o H which is
called a hydroxyl group and we get a new
molecule which looks like this again our
carbon backbone right here which is five
carbons and your sixth one is attached
to this middle one and that doesn't
change however you see how this oxygen
or this hydroxyl group is in the middle
right here this is actually going to go
to your fourth carbon so that Oh H goes
down here and your hydrogen goes up here
so basically this and this change place
so just to recap one last time that's
all step number two is a molecule
becomes an ice
of itself or in other words it's
molecules get rearranged so the original
is called citrate or citric acid and
again like I said other molecules are
going to be where other atoms are going
to be bonded onto these carbons but I
didn't want to confuse you guys and
write out the entire citric acid
structure and the important thing is
these other molecules don't change the
only part that changes are these
molecules right here this hydroxyl group
which is o H and it's hydrogen right
here they pretty much change places now
the last thing I want to say is that
this new molecule is no longer called
citric acid it's called ISO citrate so
at the end of step number two we have a
molecule called ISO citrate and it's
structure is this right here
with a couple other hydrogen's and
oxygens bonded onto it so in the next
video what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
start with isocitrate and we take that
molecule into step number three of the
kreb cycle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
