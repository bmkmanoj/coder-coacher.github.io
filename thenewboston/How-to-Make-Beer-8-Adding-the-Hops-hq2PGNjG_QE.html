several different types of hops this one
came with Willamette hops and Cascade
hops now people ask how long do i boil
each hot for or how do I know well for
that you need to look at your recipe the
paper that came in your kit and as you
can see this one says add basically one
ounce which is the entire pack of
Willamette hops which is this and boil
for the full 60 minutes so during the
whole duration when the wort is boiling
these hops stay in there the whole time
now if the line under that as you can
see add the 1 ounce Cascade hops which
are these one they say 15 minutes before
end of boil so at 45 minutes or 15
minutes before the hours up go ahead and
add those hops so again if you you know
are wondering when to add each hop just
go ahead and look at your recipe and it
has all the answers all right so now my
work is boiling I went ahead and I
already set a timer for 60 minutes this
entire solution is going to boil for 60
minutes and of course I'm going to go
ahead and add my Wilmette hops right now
just go ahead and dump those in and stir
them now another thing that I want to
mention too is whenever we add anything
to this whether it's your extract or
your hops it's more likely that your
wort is going to boil over the more
things you add to it and of course if
you have a boil over everything is going
to get sticky and messy so if you see
that your wort is getting really foamy
and about to boil over go ahead and
reduce the temperature a little bit or
you can just go ahead and keep an eye on
it so again add your hops when you
should and watch for boil overs
all right now that 45 minutes have
passed we can go ahead and add the other
hops and I remember these have to boil
for 15 minutes so once these are done we
are ready to start chilling the warm
now once your 15 minutes is up you can
go ahead and turn off the heat and move
this up the heat now what we need to do
is we need to chill or so I'm going to
go ahead and show you guys how to hook
up the wort chiller and we can go ahead
and cool this baby down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
