add images to the screen gonna be
awesome all right so of course the first
thing we need are a couple images I'm
just going to be using my logo which is
a ping and my face they're both about
like 200 by 200 I think many ways go
grab any images off the internet or if
you have someone in computer you can
just use those make sure that they
aren't too big because you know you
don't want them taking up your entire
screen somewhere around like 200 by 200
is fine and now you can copy them and
paste them but the easiest way is just
to take them and drag them from your
finder to this folder right here the
supporting files directory in a release
and finish and check it out so you now
have the files there you go there's
picture my face and here's a logo I'm
working on I don't know if this is the
one that is going to be the final logo
I'm thinking about having two of these
because like if you are used to like C++
or anything you have two little arrows
but I don't know anyways that's
irrelevant so let's go ahead and learn
how to take these and print them out on
our iPhone screen so go back to your
example and I deleted everything except
this context because like I said you
always need that context and again we're
going to be writing all of this in the
draw rect nothing new there so the first
thing we need is just pretty much a
reference to these files right here
reference to this in a reference to the
and let's go ahead and do that right now
so the first one in my face I'll just
called
Bucky's face anytime you want a
reference to an image you can just call
UI image and the parameters for this is
named and what is your image named well
my face is what is it Bucky JPEG so
Bucky dot jpg and I might as well create
one for that logo as well so I'll just
write like logo image and that is a logo
dot ping all right so now we can
actually use these variables or
constants instead of just the file names
or anything like that so you need to
turn it into a UI image object before
you can print it out using this draw
rect or any of these cool core graphic
functions so now that we got that taken
care of the next parameter that we need
to set is now that you have an image
where do you want to print it out on
screen top right bottom left you need to
give me some coordinates here so for the
coordinates it's always good to make a
location and for this you actually use
CG point make and of course these
coordinates just like your rectangle is
where do you want to position the top
left of your image so I'll just put this
at like a 25 25
so it'll appear in the top left corner
and now once we got all that taken care
of we need to actually draw this image
and what one we're going to use we'll
draw my face first so take this and this
is how you draw on the screen so that's
the image and put a question mark after
it and that just checks if it's nil or
not and we want to say draw at point so
you want to draw this image at what
location well how about this one right
there and you see how the parameter
takes a CG point well how convenient
we'll just use that so that's actually
all that we need to do so now if I go
ahead and run this mMmmm
check it out alright so what it did is
got a reference to my face and it went
over 25 down 25 it says okay I'm going
to draw the image right here now a lot
of people like doing this but another
really cool useful thing that you
can do with images is you can make them
a background image and I know for right
now this would be the worst background
image you usually would want like some
kind of texture or something really
popular now is if you take a photograph
of something and make it really blurry
then it gives you kind of this cool
color blending together effect and they
make really good backgrounds but just
for this example I'll use this which
whenever we stretch it out as a
background it's going to look really
dumb but you know it'll demonstrate what
I'm trying to achieve so let me just cut
or come in this out and I'll just have a
comment like draw normal so anytime you
want to just draw a normal image or add
a normal image to the screen there you
go and I'll make another one called fill
the screen so this of course I'm going
to show you guys how to take an image
and fill the entire screen other words
at a background so I'm just going to say
let entire screen equal this so the
first thing we need to do is we're going
to get a reference to the screen so why
do we want to do this why don't we just
want to figure out you know look up how
big iPhone 5 is and then stretch your
image to that size well because whenever
you're making a background image you
don't know the size of the device are
there using iPhone 6 and iPad iPad Mini
what the heck so it's always good to
pretty much get a reference in other
words get the dimensions of the screen
dynamically so if you go you ice cream
and you call main screen this is your
screen and the property called bounds
let me see if that pops up bounds the
bounding rectangle of the screen
measured in points in other words what
this is are the dimensions or the size
of their screen so now we have that size
in the variable entire screen and we can
say okay now draw image how big do you
want it to be well how about that size
entire screen so let's actually do this
with logo image
I probably should have got you know some
cool-looking background online but
whatever and we'll just say draw in rect
because instead of dry point which
pretty much you give a point and it
draws the image right there we want to
draw in rect in other words we're making
a rectangle of some size and we're going
to fill this image in that rectangle and
our rectangle is the screen itself so
entire screen so that is the difference
between those two and now check it out
so like I said it makes a really dumb
background for this but of course yours
is going to be either a cool-looking
texture or you know maybe something
actually check this out like even a
background like this that would be cool
but anyways now you know the basics of
it I will leave the artwork and
creativity up to you guys so yeah I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
