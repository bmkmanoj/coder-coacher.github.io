to show you guys how to manipulate some
CSS and has some special effects using
jquery in this tutorial so let's get
started oh one thing i want to say
before i start this and has nothing to
do with jquery but i went back through
some of my tutorials i notice that it
was kind of annoying when i watch Sam
tutorial over and over one of the same
tutorial by the same series and I keep
saying things like what's up guys or
what's up or you know the same thing
over and over so try and be a little
different when I start out the tutorials
that way well it gives us more for me
because it was kind of annoying but
maybe you guys thought the same thing if
not well whatever so all right I'm going
to start by adding in some CSS style
type is text CSS close that and then I'm
going to add a class to the anchor call
tests and I'm going to give it a
property of having some font weight of
bold there we go just like that and you
can see how I'll dreamweaver helps you
out with CSS is really nice so if you
are following this series you have
already completed the first tutorial and
so you have seen this code right here
already and so i'm going to go ahead and
I'm going to delete the snippet from the
last tutorial I'm going to add in
something called an ad class
call to the script so here is how we add
class to an anchor without having to
actually go inside of the anchor and
type in class this is we gotta test it
is test so this is sort of an
alternative to doing things like this
class equals test so that's how you add
a class in jQuery want to say that I'm
going to run it so you can go check it
out we go see me you tell that a turn
bold and we can also remove a class
using the removeclass call just like
this so whenever the documents ready we
add a class test to this anchor element
and as soon as we added it we also
removed it so I'm going to go ahead and
run this again so you guys can see that
should happen as this bold should turn
to regular type there we go and did
exactly that the next thing I want to
show you guys in this tutorial is in
jQuery there is a lot of different
effects that are very easily they're
very easily added to the document object
model using jQuery so I'm going to get
rid of what we just created there and
I'm going to say actually want to edit
undo so we get back to the click call on
the there we go
so you can do the same thing you edit
undo if you've been following me and
come back to this click call on the
anchor and i'm going to leave the event
dot preview default because what's going
to happen is we're going to click on
this jquery text and we are going to
make it go away by using the hyde effect
so i'm going to say this dot hide and
we're going to slowly hide it whoops
just like that so what this is saying is
it's saying this which means this anchor
method since it's inside inside here
saying this dot hide slow and this if
you will if you've been watching the
Dreamweaver cs4 tutorials this is going
to look really similar to some of the
surprise stuff that we were doing
earlier some of the i think we had like
a collapsible panel that we were
checking out this this reminds me a lot
of that so you couldn't you see how that
goes away whenever you click on it
reload and do one more time remember
it's clicked it just hides so that's
just one effect that is available inside
of jquery let me go jquery so we can
find some other ones if you noticed i'm
looking at steve nash's youtube channel
and actually Steve Nash is pretty funny
guys check out his is YouTube channel if
you have a chance but I want to go to
the jQuery documentation and if you're
going to start following these jquery
tutorial this is a place where where you
are going to want to spend
a lot of time because there's a lot of
really in-depth documentation on jQuery
that really help you out and it's free
and that's awesome because you can go
here and you can look at all of this
stuff but for now I'm just going to
click on effects and you can see like
there is a lot of well not a lot I mean
there's about 10 or 15 different effects
but you can see that hide is one of them
i'm gonna click on hide and you can see
that here's the target hide and it
should show us the different different
ways that we can hide it like slow or
fast i don't see that so I'm kind of
disappointed but go through this I'll
hear this the strings fast and slow
right here can be supplied and you can
actually give it a time it looks like
but um this is sort of sort of
continuing an introduction to jquery and
continuing an introduction to what we
can do with jquery so now you know how
to get to the documentation and you've
had a little more exposure to how to
manipulate how to add classes two
anchors and to div tags later on so
hopefully you your eyes have been open
up to a few more new things about jQuery
and in the next tutorial I'm not sure
exactly what I'm going to go over yet
but I guarantee you you're going to
learn something new and it's going to be
awesome so keep watching and make sure
