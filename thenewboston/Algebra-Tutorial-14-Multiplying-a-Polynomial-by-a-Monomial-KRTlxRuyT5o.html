subtracting polynomials but today we're
gonna start with multiplication and
we're gonna start it off a little bit
easier and start with multiplying a
polynomial by a monomial now if you
remember polynomial is an expression
with many terms and a monomial only has
one term so we've talked about this
property before that's called the
distributive property and that's how we
are going to multiply the polynomial by
the monomial so when we learn our order
of operations we learn that you have to
do what's inside parentheses first so if
I was to combine all this and then
multiply it by this the distributive
property tells me that that is the same
thing as taking this first term and
multiplying it by every single term
inside the parentheses now we've used
this before when subtracting polynomials
in order to distribute that negative to
each term so we're gonna do the same
thing so I'm gonna write it out the long
way first but you don't have to do this
every time this is just for practice so
I'm gonna take this term times 9 plus
negative 2 8 squared times negative 8
times negative a excuse me and then
negative 2 a squared times negative 4 a
squared so we're still gonna have the
same amount of terms that we started
with we're just gonna have different
ones so negative 2 times 9 is negative
18 so we have 98 of 18 a squared plus
negative 2 times negative 1 is going to
be a positive 2a
cube because you remember when we
multiply powers we add them so this is
if you remember and understood one up
here so we take two plus one and we get
a to the third and then plus negative
two times negative four which is gonna
be positive and two times four is eight
8 to the fourth
now remember I got eight to the force
not by multiplying two times two but
adding two times two plus two so this is
our new expression so we're gonna do a
couple more examples until you get the
hang of this so now I draw the arrows
just so that you guys see exactly what
I'm doing but you don't have to do that
every time you do this if you just know
what you're doing that's a that's fine
so this time I'm not gonna write out
each term multiplied I'm just gonna
multiply them so 2 times a 1 gives us 2x
squared times X to the third gives us X
to the fifth minus 2 times 2 is 4
X to the fourth plus 2 times 8 16 X to
the third minus 10x squared gonna do the
same thing down here now if you notice
this time our monomial is on the left
but that really doesn't change anything
at all because we're still gonna
distribute that negative 3 the same way
we do and when it's on 2 on the right
but what I'm gonna do just because we
always do our math right to left I'm
going to start with this 6 X you can
start with the a that's fine you just
have to make sure that each sign goes
with the correct thing that it's
supposed to go with so negative 3x times
6x is going to give us a negative 18x
squared because 1
one is 2 negative 5 because remember
this is pot plus a negative 5 negative 5
times negative 3 is going to give us a
positive 15 and I know that looks like
Oh X but or that looked like a y but
it's supposed to be an X x squared plus
X to the 1 or times X to the 1 is given
they give us X to the third minus and
it's - because a negative times a
positive is a negative so negative 3
times 8 is gonna give negative 24x maybe
one more example we're gonna do okay so
this one you might get a little scared
about but it's the same thing that we
did before we're still gonna distribute
the only difference is that we add the
like powers together so I'm gonna write
this out just because this one's the
first one like this we've done so times
8 cubed plus negative a B squared no
sorry
times negative 2a squared B okay so when
we multiply these two we're going to
multiply the each little similar term
together so what we multiply it is we're
going to multiply that negative 3 but it
understood one out in front of that a so
you can still get negative it 3 and then
we multiply a by a cubed so a to the
first times a cubed it's gonna give us a
to the fourth + B squared times B
squared is going to give us B to the
fourth and this is gonna be plus we have
negative 3 times negative 2 is going to
be positive 6 a times a squared
a to the third B squared times B is B to
the third so when we do when we have a
monomial that has more than one variable
in it we just make sure that we add the
right exponents together and say that
this had like a a plus B and we had to
do negative 3a B squared times B we
would and of course this would be inside
the parentheses all we would do is we
would keep the negative 3 and a because
there's no other way to multiply it by
and this becomes B to the third so
that's all we have to do with
multiplying today but make sure you come
back and watch our next lesson because
we're gonna kick it up a little bit and
multiply polynomials together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
