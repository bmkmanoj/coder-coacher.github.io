video is the default behavior for nodejs
is this
anytime you export an object from a
module that object gets shared among
every other module now that's going to
be great in a lot of cases but not in
this example where we actually want to
have Emily have her own movie her own
favorite movie Bucky has his own
favorite movie and every other user can
have their own favorite movie and not
have just one that is shared among them
all so anytime you want to create a new
object we actually need to export a
function that creates a new object
sounds kind of weird but this is what an
object Factory is it's basically an
object that's that creates another
object sounds kind of weird so let's go
ahead and take a look at it so instead
of setting equal to just a plain object
like before we actually set this equal
to
kinetise Pail function function just
like that oh yeah my semicolons alright
so what this function is going to do is
actually return a new object every
single time and I'll just put like fav
movie so again everything inside here is
just like before except now we're
throwing it inside a function that
returns it so this is what an object
factory is essentially it's an object
module exports but what this object does
is it creates other objects by use of
this function simple enough so now what
we can do is we can hop back in to Emily
and just clean this up actually let me
clean this up too all right so again
they're both going to require this
module still nothing new there so
anytime you want to use this the first
thing you need is some octave like Emily
will cut Emily's movies and you set
equal to movies so now this is an object
and you can use it to pretty much call
anything inside here for example we'll
just set her favorite movie Emily's
movies
fave movie set equal to the notebook so
just like you know the behavior you
would expect so now if we just take
console.log what we can do is we can
print out like before please
River movie is these movies that's fav
movie and we'll do the same thing with
Bucky except we will say Bucky's movies
and we'll actually just won't even set
Bucky's favorite movie so you guys can
clearly see so Bucky's favorite movie is
and this will just be blank so now if
you run this check it out Emily's
favorite movie is the notebook
Bucky's favorite movie is blank and of
course if we want to give him a favorite
movie then we can do that as well might
as well just do that so
Bucky's favorite movie equals Good Will
Hunting so now as you can see each
module can have their own copy of
anything that we want so again this is
called an object Factory
and essentially what it is is an object
that is responsible for creating other
objects why would we do that well then
we don't need to share this entire bit
of code among every other module they
can each have their own custom copy so
there you go thank you guys for watching
and well see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
