Blackford here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and let's jump right in
today we're going to learn about
transforming our images so what we're
going to learn today is using the free
transform and then the transform menu
selections let's go over here to edit
and then you can see down here where we
got the free transform and the transform
button now all you really need to follow
along is just any picture and put it
over top of any background that you want
this background could be just a it could
be nothing like this but this background
kind of makes me have like optical
illusions in my eyes like it's moving
around for some reason so I never really
use it it may be just my eyes are effed
up or something like that but oh well so
I'm going to put it over top of this
just regular beach background and I'm
just going to be working on layer one
down here which is a smaller picture so
let's start off with free transform
let's go to edit and free transform and
notice that ctrl T is the hotkey you
want to learn that and remember it
because you use this a lot now you can
do a few things with the free transform
you're able to move it around like this
you can come to the corner and a drag
out to expand or contract and if you
hold shift it will do this
proportionally if you hold ctrl it'll
skew the image from the corner so
remember that this is holding ctrl and
you can see that you can see the
different angle to the right of my
cursor so then I've got the different
skews there when did that a little too
long oh well now you can just do it from
the sides if you want to expand like
this I'm hitting ctrl Z to go back when
I do something so it doesn't stay all
like screwed up looking so you can do
that and then if you come out past the
lines here to where this turns into a
double arrow that's bent you can
rotate and the rotation takes place
along this middle icon here which is the
anchor point you can click on the anchor
point and move it and now the image will
rotate around the new anchor point so
now I'm just going to hit enter and I'm
going to go back to edit and that was
our free transform and that's what you
can do with the free transform you press
ENTER to apply the transformation after
you're done so let's go to transform and
then we've got some new items here that
we can use to just individually do
things quickly or you just want to work
on ones parameter or something like that
so we've got again here and all again
does is like to repeat the previous
transformation so if I scaled and I did
my scale here now you can see when I
click on scale I'm not able to do like
the rotation or anything like that so
this is scale so if I scale this up and
hit enter and then I go to edit
transform and I go to again it's going
to scale up by that much again so that's
what the again button does now I don't
think I have to go through everything
rotate allows you to rotate it skew
allows you to skew the edges just like
kind of like if you were holding the
control button so let's go to edit
transform and here's distort which
almost the same thing but it just just
distorts the picture a little more and
like kind of like looks like it's
bringing it forward or backwards so um
actually when you hold down control it
actually does the distort when you're in
the free transform and not to skew so
just remember that it does a this store
always click on image first for some
reason transform and we've got
perspective
um it basically just lets you change the
perspective of the of it so you can see
how this works out as I'm just moving
this along and we can see the different
perspectives that we've got here so I'm
moving from left to right with my mouse
I move up tit down it doesn't really do
anything
control-z and then this way you can see
which way you can move by when you hover
over one of the squares or a line it'll
show you all left and right arrow means
you move your mouse button left and
right and this one I move my mouse up
and down so hopefully that makes sense
don't just click on the I just put in I
clicked on something that made my
Camtasia do all this goofy stuff I don't
want I to so I'm going to pause for a
second oh and I'm Beck wants me to draw
my screen like that awesome thanks
Camtasia it's not what I wanted to do so
I fixed whatever the hell was going on
with my Camtasia and let's keep going
Camtasia is a screen screen recorder my
accidentally hit screen draw somehow by
pressing a hockey that I didn't even
know existed so let's get going back to
what we're doing so the next thing that
we were on is transform and warp and
warp gives you like a little grid and
you can pull the different points here
and move around like the image and
stretch it out and warp it around now
we've got a couple images that are a
couple things that are going on here
we've got our grid here where you can
click on the different points and warp
those points around we've got custom
here you can select different types of
warps to do if you would want let's go
to none to bring it back to what it's
doing and that's basically how you're
going to warp things so let's go back to
our transform menu we've got a couple
here I mean these are self-explanatory
rotate 100
80 degrees so that's what that does and
then you got rotate 90 degrees clockwise
and 90 degrees counterclockwise then
you've got the ability to flip the image
over the horizontal line or flip it
vertically so let's just flip it
vertically right now and that's what
basically it does rotate 180 degrees
pretty much so those are what you can do
with your transform so there's four
corazon total to make it look like it's
going the other way that's it for the
different transform menu items all those
remember we're located under edit and
then free transform or transform and
remember ctrl T for free transform
because you'll be using that a lot free
transform has a lot of the things
already within it the only things that
doesn't have our skew perspective and
warp so if you ever need to use those
three just go ahead and use a transform
menu and such and such so thanks for
watching this tutorial and I look
forward to seeing you guys in the next
tutorial where we're just going to be
learning how to use the crop tool so see
you guys in that one have a good one
goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
