name is buddy Blackford and today we're
gonna be going over the threshold
adjustment in a Photoshop cs6 now what
the threshold adjustment does is it
reduces an image to only black and white
pixels and it bases it on the brightness
levels it's good for locating the
highlights or the shadows of an image or
for create some cool look and special
effects so one of the special effects
that I want to show you
takes the adjustment a bit further and
add some more layers of depths to your
image along with color so this is the
image or this is the effect I wanted to
show you how to do it's basically just
the layers of the threshold option on
top of each other like this so you can
see where that's going now let's go
ahead and get started
and the first thing I want to do is add
the threshold to just a layer now you
should probably to follow along with the
tutorial bring in an image that's
probably just like a person or an object
with multiple like shades of light and
dark in it so that's why I picked a
person they've got shadows they've got
and they're easy to see like the
different facial features and everything
that we can pull out and things like
that so let's go ahead and add the
threshold adjustment and you can see
that it puts everything to black and
white the threshold level here means the
point that which the color is black and
then the color is white so anything too
left here is it's going to be more white
so the white point has been lowered so
more things are more white if you move
it to the right things are gonna become
more blank the black point has been
lowered so now things are going to be
from noir black so that's how the
threshold are that's all that's how
threshold works so I'm gonna cancel now
what I want you guys to do is for this
next special effect I'm going to show
you
gonna create we're gonna actually cut
this guy out of his image so that it's
just him on an empty background now I
mean you can I'm not going to show you
how to do this because I have in other
tutorials but I just took the magnetic
lasso tool went around and then I
refined the edges so that they looked
good and then I cut them out so now that
we have this person cut out I'm going to
delete my other layers so I know that's
good for now now you can create a new
layer and we can make this a background
layer and I found that the good
background is a really dark color of the
color that you want to use for your
person so I used dark blue so my colors
are all just gonna go along this edge
line right here and those are the colors
that I'm picking for mine
so it's they're all gonna be blue so
okay let's go ahead and duplicate the
main layer four times one two three and
four all right now we want to work on
each layer alone so we won't only want a
solo each layer so hold alt and click on
the eyeball of a layer and that'll solo
it make sure you had the layer selected
and now we're gonna add the threshold
adjustment and we're gonna start out at
something low like 50 50 - sounds good
we've got some eyes and then we got some
features here and we've got this whole
dark area so this one is going to
highlight the shadows and it's always
going to be black we're not going to
change it so name that 52 because that
was a threshold that we had well it's so
little this layer we're gonna add the
threshold adjustment again and this time
we're gonna come up a little higher and
I like coming on to these like little
Peaks and stuff like that so I'm gonna
bring it up to 92 I'm gonna hit okay
and then name this one 92 solo this
woman add the threshold adjustment and
this one I'm gonna keep at 128 because
it's right in the middle I'm gonna hit
okay and that's 128 and the last one
here we're gonna pretty much make almost
all the way black so image adjustment
threshold and let's Jack this one way up
over here something like 190 okay now if
we ever need to add any more shades in
there we can always duplicate our layer
one here and then make another shade
that's a in between 128 and 90 depending
on how it looks when we get one or when
we come out so the next thing that we're
gonna do is get rid of all this white so
make sure you solo your top layer let's
go to the magic wand tool you're gonna
want to set the tolerance to zero and
uncheck contiguous and then when I click
on the white it's just gonna select all
the white that there is and all I got to
do is hit delete and that's gone so
deselect now control D is to deselect
and then solo your other layer select
the white delete deselect and do this
with the rest of your layers
and delete that oh and now we have a
bunch of layers that are just black
parts we just have black in our images
so the first one we have here is 52 that
that's gonna stay black the next one
we're gonna work on here 92 we're gonna
change that to a new color so this color
is going to be let's actually start with
91 90 here because this is gonna be our
darkest color so let's work from there
what's work from darkest up because I
already have my background set to pretty
dark alright so go ahead and ctrl click
on the thumbnail image it'll turn into a
like a little selection box there and
I'll select all the black now go ahead
into your color swatch and pick C I'm
gonna pick a pretty light color here so
this is probably good because this is
gonna be at the bottom of all your
layers so we've got our light color here
we'll just go to our paint paint bucket
here I'll check contiguous and go ahead
and paint in there so make sure your
contiguous is unchecked or else it's
gonna FF anything's broken apart it's
not gonna fill it all in so let's go
ahead to our next one here deselect what
you had selected before and now I select
hold alt to select this a um image for
some reason mine doesn't want to do
select that's because I was holding alt
instead of control all right we got that
now let's make this a little darker and
add that in go on to our next one
and this one's gonna be fairly dark as
well and then this one here we're just
gonna leave this black and now we could
turn our layers on and turn our
background on and now we've got our
pasteurize image and if you want to add
more detail to the face or anything like
that go ahead and create a new layer add
it to the posture posterize it or I mean
threshold it
sorry not posterize we add the threshold
and to the part where you can see more
facial features that are turning black
and some of our white in the face and
that way you can grab more facial
features now if you want to you could
turn on the bottom layer layer one and
you can add white into your image and
this the only thing that it's going to
show is the highlighted areas the things
that are going to be white because
that's what we cut out during the
pasteurizing effect so that's all you're
gonna see there so it's up to you what
you want for the background but I think
a dark background that is the in the
same color area as the color that you
picked for the person would be a good
idea so that's how you do this tutorial
and this is using threshold to create a
new layered threshold effect so thanks
for watching everybody and have a good
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
