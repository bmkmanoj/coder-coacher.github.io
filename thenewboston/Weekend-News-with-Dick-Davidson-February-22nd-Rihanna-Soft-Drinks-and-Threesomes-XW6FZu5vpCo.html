come forward to try to claim the rights
to their baby daughter followed by 13
year old Alfie Peyton report suggests
that the 15 year old mother could have
been sleeping with eight boys at the
time the 16 year old Richard goosal has
also come forward to trying to claim the
rights to his baby daughter saying that
he would like test results to come
forward for DNA from the final test
though you have to check him to the
morgue polka show later this year my
picture of Rihanna has been servicing on
internet from by the beatdown Chris
Brown after the Emmys let's take a look

little beat up and bruised but I still
hit it literally speaking of other women
beaters Jackie with narrow fayetteville

first-degree assault with a deadly
weapon this past week after he threw i
can drink at a woman striking her in the
head causing multiple cuts and bruises

drink with the deficit over 15 billion
dollars some California legislators have
considering legalizing marijuana saying
that the crop could bring you in over 14
billion dollars a year in other news
