to your 21st tutorial and like I said we
are done with the CSS so now we get to
hop over in the HTML file and start
actually making the crap that makes this
stuff work so what we did is we already
linked to the CSS file so we pretty much
just got to go in the body and code all
the HTML tags and let me show you guys
how to set it up now if you remember the
very first thing we need to do is we
need to make a div and we need to give
it the ID of footer div and remember
this is just your overall footer pretty
much says says that this thing is going
to stick to the bottom of the webpage
it's not going to be floating in the
middle of the webpage or anything and
you know all your basic settings so
that's what the footer is and usually I
like to you know embed my tags right
here but for the sake of this tutorial
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually going
to make the unordered list right here so
unordered lists unordered list because
if I start embedding too much stuff like
here then right here I'm eventually
going to be off the screen soon so in my
unordered list
remember this entire footer is an
unordered list in each of these buttons
the home button account profile two
columns it's a list item so in your
unordered list we gave this the ID of
footer menu I think it was now the
footer menu if I could find it where are
you all right now the footer menu we
pretty much just did some housekeeping
stuff and we said okay reset all the
margins and padding in width to zero and
also we pretty much set it up so it
isn't a regular unordered list because a
regular unordered list would be like a
grocery list where you have tuna bacon
one item right under each other but in
this unordered list of course it's going
to be a little bit different we want our
items side-by-side so we're basically
setting the framework there
now that's all you need to do to set it
up pretty freakin sweet huh
so now what we can do is we can start
creating the individual buttons now
these are very easy like I said each
individual button is a list item so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you guys
how to create these item by item each
one is actually a little bit different
especially the first one so the first
button on our toolbar is this home icon
now in the source code in the source
code is on my forum T&amp;amp;B forum comm link
below you can get all the images and
everything for the home button I'm
talking about but anyways the list item
will just go ahead and end it right now
alright so the list item basically
consists of a class and we named that
class home button now remember in the
CSS file what we did make sure I don't
hover over it home button home button
home button home on where yet where yet
come on big money bugging money I
probably owe here we go what we did is
we basically said okay whenever we have
a link in the home button don't just add
normal text to this link we want it to
be a special link on this link we want
it to be a picture and when you hover
over it we want it to be another picture
and the reason that we have two
different pictures is look at this
little icon right here whenever you
hover over it I don't know if you guys
can see it but it turns from grey to
white so that's what we're doing and of
course in our HTML file what we need to
do is we need to add a link so a href
and usually whenever you're making this
website let me just finish this real
quick what you would want to do is you
would want public index.php or
index.html for the home button but since
I don't know what you know you guys are
gonna do with this code I'm just gonna
put a hash tag there and that just means
okay put a link here eventually
but anyways whenever you make a button
and you give it the class home button
then your icon of a little house is
going to show up so everyone knows it's
home and by the way if you want to use
images
aside from home then just go over in
your CSS and you only need to change the
bed
korone right here so now you guys know
not only how to style it in CSS but also
how to add it to your HTML file so that
button is actually that's all we have to
do for that how frickin sweet is that
that's like the easiest thing you guys
probably have ever done now for the next
button right here it's the account
button now the account button is a
little different now this account button
has Stream messages and it has a couple
of things we want to take note of first
of all these main header links are read
in there a little bit bigger text and
you also have your normal links like
links employment education and you also
have I want to call them like
notification links that are special
links as you can see whenever you have a
new inbox message or a friend request
you can easily point them out because
they are bold in their white so let me
go ahead and show you guys how to do
this and actually what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna show you guys how to do this
in the next video because it's gonna
take some time
so anyways thing guys for watching and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
