talking about prisms to talking about
the right circular cylinder now we're
going to go over volume lateral area and
total area of a right circular cylinder
today so volume of a right circular
cylinder is equal to PI R squared times
height which makes sense because if you
think about it the area of a the area of
a circle is equal to 2 PI R squared or
excuse me it's just equal to PI R
squared and then if we multiply it by
the height it'll give us volume so the
volume of this cylinder is equal to PI
radius squared times 12 so this is equal
to this is equal to 49 pi times 12 and
those are kind of big so I'm going to
put those in the calculator 49 times 12
so 588 PI I'm just going to leave the pi
like that so that we give it more exact
answer okay so now we're going to talk
about lateral area so when we find
lateral area of a cylinder we're finding
the area of this part that wraps around
the cylinder the soup can that wraps
around or the soup label that wraps
around the soup can
so that area corresponds to this
rectangle right here and if you look
this height of this ring rectangle is
going to equal to the height of this
cylinder so that's why it's 8 right here
the width of this rectangle is going to
equal the circumference of the circle
because if we unwrapped it we'd have a
width of 2 pi R so that's why when we
find lateral area its equal to 2 PI R
times height so the lateral area for
this is equal to 2 pi times our radius
which is 4 times our height which is 8
so 2 times 4 is 8 times 8 is 64 so this
is 64 pi centimeters squared this area
is always centimeters squared
all right now we have one last thing
we're going to learn its total area and
we find when we find the total area of a
cylinder we are finding the surface area
of this entire can we're finding all of
this that's why when we find our total
area we take our lateral area which is 2
pi RH plus 2 PI R squared this part
gives us the area of both of these bases
or I'm sorry this part gives the area of
the bases this part gives us the lateral
area and when we add them together we
get total area so we have 2 pi times R
which is 5 halves times 13 plus 2 PI R
squared so 2 times 5 halves just leaves
us with five because the two can choose
cancel so we have five times 13 times pi
plus 2 pi if we square this fraction
remember we square the top and the
bottom so we get 25 over 4 so
five times 13 is 65 pi plus if we cancel
these we get plus 25 halves pi and I'm
going to get a common denominator so if
I get a common denominator this is going
to be 130 PI over 2 and this is 25 PI
over 2 so then we get a hundred and
fifty-five PI halves inches squared
because area is always squared units so
that's all we're going to do with the
right cylinder today but make sure you
come back and watch the next video where
we're going to go into some formulas for
pyramids</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
