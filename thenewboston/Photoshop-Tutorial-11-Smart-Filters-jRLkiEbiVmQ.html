your eleventh Photoshop tutorial and I
know I haven't made a Photoshop
tutorials in quite some time but guess
what I'm making them now so take it easy
in this tutorial we're gonna be going
over something called filters and before
I do that let me just tell you guys what
just happened to me I was uh making some
spider-man mac and cheese and I actually
tried to scrape a piece of mac and
cheese or actually just macaroni off the
bottom while it was boiling in my pot
and because it was stuck to the bottom
and I was scraping the scrape and I
couldn't get it and then his son just
popped off and a bunch of hot water went
on my belly button and I just burned my
stomach so uh I just want to tell you
about that I thought you guys would like
to know you know you know let me ask you
this before you start do you think like
the shapes like spider-man and spongebob
macaroni and cheese taste better than
just in noodles because I do I really
think they do but anyways to our
tutorial like I said in this tutorial
we're gonna be going over something
called filters now what a filter is if
you go ahead and select a layer it's
pretty much a special effect or
something like that that you can add to
an image now filter who's got their name
because people who use filming stuff
like uh what's it called people who hold
camcorders I don't know who ever hold a
camcorder you can put a filter over the
lens to uh like change the color or
something like that and these uh I guess
they can change the color but they can
do some other cool stuff too so let's go
ahead and apply a filter just show you
guys what it can do so for example if
you go to distort and then go to like
glass you can apply this nice glass
filter and there's a bunch of settings
but we'll go over it later and as you
can see now my image has a new kind of
looks like foggy little church glass or
you can apply another one like filter
stylize where you
Edge's and this gives it kind of a 3d
not 3d a retro looking glow and this is
how you can apply filters to your image
but you usually don't want to do this
and a lot of people don't know there's
something called a small smart filter
now the problem with this what we just
did I mean they look how we want to look
and we can edit the different settings
but whenever we're on edit edit the
filters it's really confusing to do and
anytime we want to edit one that we did
in past we have to go edit undo edit
step backward and yadda yadda yadda we
don't really have a lot of control over
the filters so if we want to have more
control over the filters what we need to
do is turn this layer into a smart
object so we can apply smart filters to
it and this will pretty much give us
complete control over every filter and
this is the only way to do this so
that's how I'm gonna start you guys out
teaching you about filters because
that's how you should apply all your
filters unless you know it's gonna be
permanent one-time deal but usually you
don't so here's what you do select the
layer you want to use in this
checkerboard is layer one so I'm gonna
be working with layer one and then go
ahead up to filter and click convert for
Smart Filters who would have guessed it
then go ahead and click OK I never read
that before I don't even care what it
says but anyways after that we need to
do is you have to apply filters to the
way you just did and you know that you
turned it into a smart object or a smart
filter cuz there's this little um what's
it called like a thumbnail I guess you
could call it icon right on your layer
as you can see this layer doesn't have
on this layer doesn't have one but this
one has this little thumbnail that's how
you know it's a smart filter so now what
happens if we go and apply our filters
well select our leg and put filter
stylize we'll use same ones glowing
edges okay
and filter distort glass now okay and
now you can see instead of like last
time we can actually edit or view the
visibility of all these filters
individually so unlike undoing like last
time all you have to do is click glass
off and bam look at that or we can keep
glass on and turn glowing edges off BAM
look at that or if you got really
excited you can go ahead and turn them
both off by using this master Smart
Filters toggle and if you don't wanna or
if you want them back
BAM just click it again so that's a way
where you can do that and you couldn't
you didn't have that control before by
just applying a naked filter right to
your layer and this is also useful if
you have a series of filters and you
want copy them from one layer to another
before that was impossible but now look
at this let's go ahead and bring up our
cow layer I got my three cows right
there looking good guys looking good WTF
is this thing though right in the chest
it's like a bulge popping up you preggy
very good yeah anyways anytime you want
to copy a set of filters to another
layer all you have to do is select the
filters right here
well you don't select them actually you
hold down alt on your keyboard if you
got a Mac I don't know probably Apple
sign probably not I have no idea what
you need to do is hold down Oh hopefully
you're working with Windows and grab
your filter using the left mouse button
which is the regular mouse button and go
ahead and just drag that oh I forgot one
thing any time you want to copy filters
to another layer we need to do is turn
that layer into a smart object for it so
go ahead and click on layer 2 and click
filter convert for Smart Filters now
this cow layer is ready for Smart
Filters now you can go ahead and hold
down alt on your keyboard and go ahead
and drag those filters over to layer two
now look at that
if we do this we now got all of our
filters on our layer to the cow layer so
how awesome is that and again just like
the other ones we can turn off the glass
not bad
turn off the glowing edges not bad or
turn off them all so that is like an
incredibly easy way to use filters using
smart filters and remember any time you
want to do this and get a layer ready
for smart filters it's kind of hard to
say just go to filter convert for Smart
Filters and then that's pretty much what
you should do with any layer that you're
gonna use filters on instead of me
applying the filter right to the layer
so that's it for this tutorial
in the next tutorial I don't know what
we're gonna be going over but uh yeah
I'm gonna let my burn wounds on my
stomach heal and make sure to wash it
and play around smart filters and I will
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
