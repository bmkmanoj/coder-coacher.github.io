because when we refresh we get this
functionality you can see that it's
scrolling down the page now we've
essentially achieved the effect but
we've set the CSS top value to the
absolute position that we've scrolled
down and therefore it's a present where
it's present is at the top obviously
this is connecting to here so at the
start we have this set to 10 pixels from
the top however when we start to scroll
we snap that to the absolutely scrolled
position so we want to go ahead and plus
10 now we're going to be modifying this
slightly later on to make it more
efficient like I said if we were to go
ahead and change top to let's say 20 and
we had this start at 20 pixels from the
top when we then scroll it will change
position we don't want it to change
position we wanted to stay in exactly
the same place so let's change that back
to 10 we've got this added to 10 so now
we have the effect that we're looking
for it will scroll with 10 pixels from
the top okay so now that we've done this
we want to go ahead and actually modify
this so it will take the value that this
scroll is already at or this div is
already at and then apply it added on to
here so just up above here we want to go
ahead and actually retrieve this value
so I'm going to create a variable called
current top and that's going to equal
the follow div so again selecting the
follow div and we're saying dot CSS and
we're only supplying one parameter and
what this will do is it would return the
value that we have placed here now the
only problem is it will return the whole
value including px so we need to pass
this value to an integer and that will
just take away the px part of it so we
say pass in and we wrap that in that
this pass int function so now we have
the current top position we can go ahead
and substitute that in there so current
top let's go ahead and refresh the page
and you'll see it works as normal as we
have already seen however let's go
and changed the left and the tops values
to 50 by 50 for example 50 now when we
refresh you can see it starts at a
different position however it always
stays in the same position whereas if we
didn't have over here current top and we
just had plus 10 we would have to go and
change this value every time we updated
this top value here so let's go ahead
and check out how that doesn't work
because it snaps back to the top at 10
pixels we would have to go and change
this to 50 in order to keep up with the
you know the value that we've defined in
style.css so we keep this at current top
just to make our code a bit more
efficient so if we were to go ahead and
modify style CSS it would keep up with
this value and that's a good note to
think about when you you know for
example if you included this as part of
a template and this was part of a
functionality of a template you would
wouldn't expect to allow your user to go
and have to change this and then have to
go and change your code as well so it's
always best to keep the current values
in there so obviously we we keep this
dynamic and running through you know
whatever we change and star dot CSS so
that's the end of the tutorial we've
created a div that follows down the page
quite simply with this code it's an
extremely simple way of obviously
creating it I have actually forgotten
one thing which is clicking this to get
rid of it so at the moment we can't
click it to get rid of it when we click
on it nothing happens so what we can do
is after the fade in we can append on an
event handler and that is dot click so
once we've appended on this event
handler we can then create a function
inside of this and pull that down to
actually hide this div so we say this
dot fade out fade out and we say 1000
now that will actually you know when we
click on the follow div we will fade out
the div that we've obviously clicked so
we click that and it fades back out
again now this is more of like a sort of
a penalty thing but you might want to go
ahead
and save our speed equals 1000 and then
go ahead and substitute this in here and
again this will allow your user to
change speeds if they do want to modify
this script and obviously you could
again probably past this you know with a
function if you wanted but for now
that's the little scrolling div in
jQuery and how it can follow you down
the page and you can hide it by clicking
on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
