video in in this tutorial we're gonna
start learning about SQLite and by the
way I just watched a movie gone girl
it's a pretty decent movie and also if
anyone has any really good movies that
they would recommend looking for like a
good sci-fi movie my favorite ones of
all time are contact and there's this
movie called surrogates it's a really
good movie I would recommend it so what
are we talking about
SQLite so what this is is a way to save
information on your phone so if you ever
had like a computer game and you wanted
to save the high scores or maybe you're
making like a checklist app and you
wanted the user to be able to turn off
your phone and turn back on and have all
that stuff safe saved for them well then
this is a tutorial for you so before we
get started
forewarning you do need to know SQL or
at least the basics of it if you don't
then go watch my tutorial um it's called
MySQL databases if you go to my website
click video and tutorials MySQL
databases and they will teach you the
basics of SQL so with that being said
let's go ahead and get started well I
did in this video is I made a brand new
project blank activity we just got those
two default files right now and I'm
gonna drink some gauge or Powerade
actually flavor is it lemon lime not bad
alright so let's go ahead and delete
this textview and again this example is
just gonna be for creating a really
basic database it's actually just a file
that you can save stuff to so I'm just
gonna have somewhere that the user can
type something in and they can either
add it to the file or delete it from the
file and whenever we turn off the app
and turn it back on it's all going to be
safe for you so pretty simple examples
so let's go ahead and get started so
again the first thing is just a plain
text drag that somewhere in the top
middle and that's really tiny right now
so change the width to like
it's 300 DP and change the ID of this as
well and I'll just feel like Bucky's
input so this is where the user is gonna
be typing stuff in and let's add two
buttons right there and let's add
another one right there so this first
one is gonna be if they want to add
something to the file then they're gonna
type it in and click this button so
let's change the text on it so they know
what's going on
we'll say add simple enough and let's
give it an ID of add button yes now on
click what do you want what method do
you want to call add button click so
this method is where we're gonna be
writing our functionality to actually
add whatever they typed in to the
database file so we can save it so that
looks pretty good now let's do the same
for this button so let's change the text
first just change it to delete so
whenever they click this it's going to
delete one of those items we'll say that
this is I don't know just storing
different items whatever they type in
mmm on click we'll just write like um to
leap on clicked and for the idea of this
of course we'll just name it
delete button so again what I want to do
is we can just make an example that can
save all your data in the background and
typically that's what you want to do
however just so we can see what's going
on in the real time I'm going to drag a
large text in the drop middle of the
screen right there and I'm gonna change
the ID of this to Bucky's text so again
all of the contents of the file are
going to display in a real time right
here so whenever we add it's going to
display in real time as soon as we
delete something you get you're gonna
see it visually being
deleted now of course you would only
want to do this whenever they like
finish the game or whenever they add a
new item to their checklist but for this
example it'll work out just fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
