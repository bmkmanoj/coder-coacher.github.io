going to do is I'm going to start
talking about Android threads now as you
guys know threads not only can help
speed up the performance of your app but
they're going to be used in a lot of
different things in you know concerning
Android development later on so it's a
pretty important concept and I'm sure
that everyone already knows about
threads for my Java tutorials but just a
real quick explanation as you guys know
computer programs they run from the top
down and they run pretty much in a nice
order a then B then C you give it a list
of instructions and it does whatever you
say now the only problem with that is
say that you have three instructions a B
and C and B that metal instruction is I
don't know maybe the user clicks a
button and your app is going to perform
some weird long calculation well since
your program is performing in a nice
order a B and C that means that C has to
wait for B to get done so if the user
clicks a button and it's making some
calculation then your app is going to
appear to be frozen and the user isn't
going to be able to move anything around
or switch activities or clicking
anything until it's done and what's
going to happen then they're probably
going to get ticked off close out of
your app rate at a 1 on Google Play your
app career is going to be destroyed and
you know you're just going to have a bad
day so that is why we're learning about
threads because I do not want your life
to be destroyed alright so what I did is
I created a brand new project and I just
chose all the defaults of blank activity
nothing weird or anything like that so
this is where I am right now so the
first thing I want to do is get rid of
this textview
and I'm going to drag a large text in
the middle of the screen and what can I
write actually let me drag a button too
so essentially what this program is
going to do is we're going to click this
button and first I'm going to show you
guys what happens when you don't have
threads it's essentially going to try to
make some calculation freeze up and
pretty much I'm going to be breaking the
app on purpose and then I'm going to be
showing you guys when you use threads
how awesome it is so for this button
will just very something stupid like
click me will say touch me that's a
little bit more pervert maybe touch me
baby there we go
so touch me baby and this text um
okay say hello
not that perverted but whatever alright
so for this textview just give it an ID
and i'll just name it
Bucky's text and for the same thing for
the button I'm just going to give this
an ID of Bucky's button alright now the
last thing I want to do is for this
button make sure you have it selected
and go down to on click and I'll just
try something like we're going to call a
method called click Bucky's button so
that way we don't have to set up a
listener or anything weird like that and
of course if you want you can take care
of your string resources right there but
I'm not really worried about it aka I am
a lazy so hop over to your code right
here and the first thing that we're
going to do is we're just going to
create this program without using any
threads at all the improper way so
another thing is make sure that you have
your emulator started boot that bad boy
up and okay let's go ahead and import
Android dot view dot view in import
before Android that widget dot text view
so actually how can I do this alright
now under here let's go ahead and
implement that method whenever you click
the button so public void what was it
like click
Lucky's button I believe throw your
views in there and the first thing I'm
going to do is this is going to be the
dumbest program ever because we're just
going to have a button in the middle of
the screen and again this is for
performing large calculations but I
really don't want to make any worthless
calculations so all I'm going to do to
take up a bunch of time is I'm just
going to have the system wait pretty
much just wait and do nothing for a
certain period of time and this is just
going to simulate I don't know maybe
like going to data base and gathering
some data or maybe figuring out some
high score or something or any
calculation that takes a considerable
amount of time it's what it's going to
simulate so the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to get ten seconds into
the future so if you just make a
variable called future time you can do
this by going system dot current time
and this of course is the time right now
well not right now whenever you run it
it's going to get the current time and
we're just going to add 10,000 to it now
this is 10,000 milliseconds so that
means that future time whenever this
program runs is going to be 10 seconds
in the future so now we're just going to
make a real quick while loop and we'll
say well system dot current time
milliseconds is less than future time
what do we want to do well the first
thing we're going to do is called
synchronize and I don't know if um I
tell you guys about the synchronized
keyword in my java that swirls like I
made those like a few years ago but what
synchronize essentially does is it
prevents multiple threads from bumping
into each other or essentially trying to
do the same thing it uh kind of
synchronizes its pretty good keyword I
actually think I did teach this because
I remember it but um again we don't
really need this for right now since
we're not using threads but later on
we're going to have it so I figured I
just might as well write it right now
now inside here we're just going to have
the easiest try block ever
and check this out all we're going to do
is wait and we're going to stick future
time - system current time milliseconds
and it's giving us error because we
didn't catch anything
so we'll just catch an exception and we
won't do anything with it because I
really don't care all right so all this
code does right here essentially is it
just waits 10 seconds and you if um your
emulator is running a little slow or
something you can change the time of it
right here but 10000 means 10 seconds so
again this would obviously be some kind
of calculation you would never want to
write this actual code in your app just
to wait and do nothing but for
simulating some kind of calculation or
background process it's perfect so after
10 seconds after the user clicks the
button and waits 10 seconds what we can
do is we can just change this text field
right here so textview buckey's text set
equal to textview ib r dot e dot
buckey's text uh-huh and of course once
we have a reference to that text field
we can just change the text on it using
set text and I'll just write like nice
job hast whenever they click the button
so now let's go ahead and run this bad
boy
and again this is what's going to happen
let me kick this get this started first
so the user is going to click the button
and they won't be able to do anything
for 10 seconds because it's trying to
perform this bit of code first that
means that the button is going to be
frozen
they aren't going to be able to switch
activities nothing is going to be
allowed for the user to do hardest noise
may look at this app I just got it saw
it says app and you touch the spot in
mine and it changes the text right there
I mean this technology is incredible so
let me just touch it's fun yeah huh
looks like it's frozen and it ain't let
me do anything mate I'm just waiting
here for 10 seconds you know I can't
click it again or do it oh well there we
go
that was kind of a pain so I guess I'm
installing that rating at once start on
the App Store and whoever developed it
it's probably going to be fired from
their job oh now we got this thing o M G
all right so this is another problem you
got whenever your apps making a long
calculation in the background says it
isn't responding do you want to close it
you know this app sucks completely it
takes too long it freezes up so what
we're going to do is if you want to
learn how to fix all of these issues and
watch the next tutorial where we are
going to be taking this program and
making it work beautifully</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
