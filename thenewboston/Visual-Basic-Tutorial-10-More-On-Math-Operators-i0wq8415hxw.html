slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and this tutorial we're going to take
another look at math operators and some
other things that you can do with it
and stuff that I left out in the last
tutorial so let's go ahead and get
started here's our main cell right here
inside of our module and we're just
going to start off by creating a
variable so we'll use the dim keyword to
say that we're going to create a
variable we'll give it a name which is
my double then we use the add as keyword
which tells the compiler that we're
about to tell it what kind of data we
want to use and we'll just do double now
we'll set it equal to 11 now if we do
console dot write line my double well
this is going to do is just just going
to print out the value 11 now if we come
down here and change the value of my
double we'll do my double equals my
double plus 23 then we'll do console dot
write line my double now if we run this
we're going to get the values 11 and 34
but if we just take this line out right
here hey let me copy this okay so if we
take this line out right here and add
the plus 23 into the arguments of
console dot write line well this is
going to do is it's going to print out
11 and 34 but the value of my double
isn't actually changed so if we write
out console dot write line my double
again we're going to get the values 11
34 and 11 because we never changed the
variable you can see it right there okay
so now what we're going to do is I'm
going to cover a bit of shorthand math
so here let's type my double equals my
double plus 23 which is what we just did
now there's an easier way to do this
whenever you want to add
you to a variable that you have all you
have to do is do this let's comment this
out we'll do my double plus equals 23 so
this tells the compiler that we want to
take the variable my double and we want
to add the value 23 to it and now if we
just print that out again we're going to
get the value 11 and 34 now let's go
ahead and make a short little simple
program here that's going to take our
variable and it's going to track it
throughout the changes that we made so
let's take this line out right here and
what we're going to do is we're going to
use a string inside the arguments of
console dot write line so we'll type
initial value 11
and then we'll type new value and now to
combine these two together we're just
going to use the + sign so what this
does is it takes the string that we've
made and then it adds my double to it
and what this is going to do is on the
console what we're going to see is this
these letters right here it's going to
say initial value 11 new value 11 but
since we don't know what the new value
is going to be we're just going to use
the + sign and print out my double which
changes whenever we change it throughout
the program and we don't have to know
specific specifically what it's equal to
so we'll just copy this string right
here
and we'll do one more action let's go
ahead and do my double x equals 126 now
whenever you do this right here you can
use it with any other math operator you
can divide you can subtract you can
multiply you can add whatever you want
so let's do console dot write line and
then we'll take this right here we'll
add it to the argument and then we'll
print out my double with it so now if we
run this we're going to get initial
value 11 which is the initial value of
my double the new value is 11 because we
hadn't changed it yet in the code and
then in the line down below that it's
going to say initial value 11 new value
34 and then below that again it's going
to say initial value 11 new value 4200
84 so that's just a simple program that
will track a variable when we make
changes to it and if you have any
questions feel free to comment them I
will be monitoring these videos and
thanks for watching stay tuned for the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
