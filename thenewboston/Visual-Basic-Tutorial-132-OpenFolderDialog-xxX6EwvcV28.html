slash on live camera for the New Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
talking about the open folder dialog so
just like the Open File dialog the open
folder dialog opens up a window that
lets you browse through the folders and
select what you want but instead of
selecting a file you're gonna select a
folder which is let's say a folder to
save something to if they're not saving
a particular file at that moment so
let's go ahead and create a new project
and I'll show you how to use it so we'll
select the windows forms application and
we will call it folder dialog go ahead
and click OK and wait for that to load
ok so once it's loaded we'll resize the
form some let's come into our tool box
and we will add two buttons we got
button 1 + button 2 now for button 1
we're going to set the text to right
file we will set it to button right and
now for button 2 we want it to the name
to be button folder and we want to set
the text to change folder okay so now
I'll come back over here to our tool box
and we will add two text boxes so we've
got text box 1 and text box 2 so text
box 1 is going to be the title of our
text file and the text box 2 is going to
be the contents so we'll set the name of
text box 1 to text title and for text
box 2 we want text contents so now we're
going to add a folder browser dialog so
we'll go ahead and add that right in
there and you can see it creates an
object of it for us and we can change
the name of this if we want so let's go
ahead and double click on change folder
and so now that we're in our code for
form 1 what we need to do is let's just
make a variable
that can store the path of the selected
path that they got from the folder
browser dialog now you can access this
directly from the folder browser dialog
one but I like storing it in another
variable
it just makes it a little bit easier so
we'll just type folder browser dialog
one dot show dialog and after they've
shown the dialog or once they click OK
what we want to do is get what they
selected so we'll do a string path it's
going to be equal to folder browser
dialog one dot and you can see here that
we've got a whole bunch of stuff that we
can use we just want to use selected
path so now that we've got the path
where they want to save their files
let's go ahead and double click on write
file and we will just write the files
for them so we'll type system dot IO dot
file so we're going to use the long
version of this so that we don't have to
import system dot IO and no one want to
do is write all text now for our first
first argument it's going to be the
string so we're just going to use string
path now we're going to have to specify
the name of the file so we'll just add a
backslash and now we'll add the title so
text title dot text so what this is
going to do is going to get the path
that they selected add a backslash to
just separated because everything is
separated with the backslash folders and
then if you select a file on that it's
got the folder name backslash the file
name and then we're gonna use the title
of what they selected and then we're
just going to add an extension to the
file so we'll make it a dot txt file so
now for the contents we're going to use
text contents dot text so it's going to
write all the text from this text box
right here to the path that they
selected from change folder and it's
going to use the title that they used up
here so let's run this and hopefully we
won't get any errors now let's go ahead
and change the folder I can see that
this is a little bit different
or a lot different than the save file
dialog or the open file dialog but it
works essentially the same way let's go
ahead and open up computer will drop
down
Sam's extra external hard drive and
we'll just go ahead and select that go
ahead and click OK so now I'll type will
title it apples will add some stuff in
it so and now we'll just go ahead and
write the file now we can also write
this a couple more times
so we'll just title it YouTube and then
we can write the file again now I'm
putting come in here into my computer we
can open up my external hard drive and
you can see that we got YouTube and
apples and this is my file from a while
ago we can just delete that and if we
open up apples you can see that we get
nvidia intel and AMD the stuff that we
added it'll be open up YouTube we also
need the same thing because we left it
the same inside the text box so go ahead
and practice a little bit with open
folder dialogues and once you got
familiar with them and you're not going
to forget how to use them go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
