30th tutorial and Java game development
and now that we learn how to handle
something when the user presses down the
key on the keyboard we made two other
promises to our key listener class right
here so since we implemented from it we
said all right we're going to tell you
how to handle key presses when they
press down button and we're also going
to tell you how to handle when they
release a button so let's go ahead and
make that method right now this is a lot
easier than the last one so let's just
same key arm release like this
nothing fancy I was going to write a
little description but I'm a little lazy
tonight and the name for this method is
public void and it's key released how
cool is that so now it takes an event as
well
key event E and the e is pretty much
what button you're released so the first
thing we want to do is get the key code
key code of that button and that's equal
to the event which is the button get key
code just like that so now key code
equals the button so what we want to do
here is when you release it we want to
change the message so this one was
pressed at this well let's just go ahead
and copy that and when you release it
let's just go ahead and change your
method to or message not method to
release adds key event get key text key
code well too easy and then after that
of course you want to take the button
and eat it up so it's not waiting for
another button or anything like that so
as you can see this was a lot easier
than last one because it doesn't have
this you don't have to handle the escape
since once you press down the escape it
stops and therefore you never have to
wait for it to release in the last
method we need to do is a method which I
should have an error right here it says
well you'll see in a second it's last
method from interface and this is public
void key typed now I'm not even going to
tell you guys what this does key event e
because all we're going to do is consume
right there just eat it up and what this
means is pretty much just handle the
button and don't do anything with it
this key type is pretty much useless for
what we're doing right now all we want
to know is when you press down the
button and when you let it go you never
use this key typed in games you never
really use it anytime so that's why
we're doing that so the last thing that
we need to do is draw the message on our
screen and remember our draw method
right here
has nothing in it so we need to override
it and we will do this by adding a
comment and public synchronized void
draw and remember synchronized means
this method can only run and no other
methods can run at the same time so
graphics 2d just name it G you always
name it G always and now let's go ahead
and put window get our window object and
set this equal to s dot get full screen
window so now our window is equal to our
screen and we'll just put G dot set a
color so our drawn color now is going to
be equal to the background so W dot get
background and if you can't remember
that screen and what do we want to do
now well now that we're drawing with
green let's just make a big background
so G dot fill rectangle and if you can't
remember all rectangle does is draw a
rectangle so where do we wanted to start
0 0 which is the top left for a screen
and that way you can cover everything
how why do we want it the width of the
screen so get
with remember that method should be in
your screen class how Todd we want this
rectangle as tall as the screen is so s
dot get height so we want a rectangle
starting at the top left that's as wide
as the screen and tall as the screen
easy enough so now let's go ahead and
change our color because if we try to
green on green we can't see anything so
G dot set color and we'll go the window
dot get foreground just like that
and if you can't remember the foreground
of our window was white and all we have
to draw is G dot draw string and I don't
I know it was going to give me all those
parameters for our string what do we
want to use that little message and
what's the message well it starts out is
nothing but when you press a button it
is going to say pressed like L and when
you release it it's going to say
released L so that's what the message is
that what we're drawn where do we want
it let's just put it like 30 30 or
something like that so now that is our
entire program and I'm going to run this
and even though you guys can't see I'm
going to show you guys what happens if I
don't get any errors so now my screen is
green and on the top left that says
price press escape to exit now I'm going
to press the H button and hold it down
and it says pressed H now I'm going to
release it right now and it says
released H and I'm going to press down I
and hold it in and it says pressed I now
I'm going to release it and it says
released I and now I'm going to go ahead
and hit the Escape key right here and
look at that it stops my entire program
and takes me out of full screen so I'll
make sure my screen record is still
working and I don't think you guys need
to go over this code one more time but I
will just for fun now again when we
extend it from core we inherited all the
methods in public variables from core so
now we have access to all of these even
though you can't see them then we
implement a key listener and we did this
because this is the only way you can
accept
input from the keyboard some important
things we did is we call this
superclass's initialization function
which is this class we set the window to
the key listener which means whenever
something happens on my window this is
what I want to listen for so whenever
you press a key that's just you need to
add a listener to something and then we
needed to make three methods from the
key listener class and those are key
pressed and this is how you handle a key
when they press it down this is key
released and this is when they finally
read let go of that key what do you want
to do and keep typed is not important
we're never going to use it and the last
thing that we did is we drew a message
on our screen and that message was
dependent on whether we press down
button or whether we release the button
so that's how you do that those are the
basics to how to handle keystrokes and
key releases from the user so now what
can you do this and why would it be
useful in a game for example if they
typed in their name or if they use the
right left up or down to jump and move
around the character or if they even use
the keyboard keys to move around the
character this is how you would do that
so for now I just want to thank you guys
for watching and the next tutorial we're
going to be going over how to get input
from the mouse instead of just the
keyboard because once we have a keyboard
and mouse then the world is pretty much
open to us so for now I just want to
thank you guys for watching it don't
forget subscribe and I will see you next
