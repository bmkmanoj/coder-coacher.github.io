more tutorials tonight because I am
going to see American sniper hopefully
it does not suck and if you guys know of
any good movies in theaters right now
let me know I love watching movies um no
superhero movies I'm not really into
those you think I would be for all the
effects and stuff but uh yeah not really
my thing I know there's just too many of
them so let's uh focus here Bucky what
I'm going to do instead of pretty much
copying all this code and pasting it for
each new tutorial in the forum so to
make it really easy for you guys I'm
going to add a comment on each little
thingy I drop and that way whenever I
post this in the forum um you guys can
just copy this code or uncomment it and
while you guys are going to see in just
a second so everything that I'm going to
draw in these upcoming tutorials what I
need to do first is I don't want to say
everything but most of the stuff I'm
going to get the context which is that
fancy paintbrush I'm going to add some
settings to it and then I'm going to
draw the shape and it's going to be
different for every shape and then I'm
gonna call this method to actually draw
on the screen so this is the only part
that changes so again that's what's
going on in case you guys were confused
so in this tutorial what I want to do is
I want to show you guys how to create
custom shapes so the first thing is this
CG context move to point and of course
just like before let's say that we
wanted to create like um a stop sign no
not a stop sign I'll just create
whatever shape pops into my head so
let's go ahead and start it like 50 50
somewhere near the top left of the
screen now just like before I'm just
going to copy that so I don't mess
anything up we're going to call the
method CG context add line to point so
this isn't just for drunk straight lines
you can also draw entire shapes with
this so let me go from 50 52
99d she let's go 90 130 we'll see where
that brings us and let me uh so now we
have another line that looked just like
before and this will be the bottom and
this will be the point on the left and
the last line is just going to connect
it back to the original starting point
so 5050 there you go
so from 90 130 which would be like
somewhere over here let's go down more
so 180 and we'll also go back a little
bit so 100 and then we need to go to the
left
so we're going to go up to 90 and to the
left which would be like 60 and all
right so let's see how this baby turns
out and it was WOW that is the ugliest
shape I've ever seen that is not at all
how pitch I pictured it like a diamond
in my head and look at this thing but
I'll explain you guys what's going on
all right so this is the very first
point we went over 50 down 50 now the
next point if you go over 90 down 130
you get to that point looking good so
far so from there we went over 180 down
a hundred and I don't know if you guys
can see it but this isn't a straight
line from here to here we have one more
other point puts a little kink in it so
we went over 90 to 60 and then back to
50/50 to end it now this just creates a
path an invisible path right there and
then this of course like before creates
the ugliest shape in the world so all
right very nice very nice so now let me
go ahead and copy this and I'll show you
guys what I'm doing
so I'll just say ugly shape so when you
guys around the forum you will know what
it means and whoever runs this code and
it wasn't watching this tutorial they
will soon find out that this is indeed
the ugly shape ever but now what I want
to do is I actually want to show you
guys how to create a rectangle because
if you're like alright should probably
learn how to create basic shapes this is
actually really easy or at least a lot
easier than you know making your own
weird custom shape so by default it
gives you methods to make simple shapes
like rectangles circles or ellipses and
of course you can make squares because
the squares just uh you know like an
even a rectangle so let's say say will
let rectangle equals and the method is
it's only one line of code cg rekt make
and this is actually two lines i lied so
cg rectum egg the first parameter is
alright you know this is probably easier
if I just show you guys but it says
where do you want the top left of the
rectangle to be the top left corner and
we'll just say we want it to uh let's
put this it 50/50 again so the top left
of the rectangle is going to be it 50/50
now the width and height of course are
just the width and height of the
rectangle so we'll make this a square
and we'll make it 200 by 200 actually
let's make it 200 by 400 might be a
little easier to see visually and now
when we want to actually add this to the
screen we use CG context add rect now
the first thing is what paintbrush are
using and the second one are give me the
coordinates of the rectangle and that is
rectangle right like that so now if I
run this check it out alright so we have
our starting point is 50 over and 50
down and now the width is 200 and the
height is 400 so these aren't the
starting points and the ending points
arm a lot of people get that confused so
there you go that is how you make custom
ugly shapes and rectangles so I'm
actually going to come
all this and put it on my forum and in
the next tutorial um I don't even know
what I'm gonna be showing you guys but
it's going to be sweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
