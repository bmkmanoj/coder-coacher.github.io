illustration cs6 video and today we're
gonna learn how to work with OpenType
fonts and an OpenType font is just a
different type of actual font that you
might even not notice but it has a
different some different properties that
are able to be changed in them so let's
go ahead and figure out what's going on
by jumping into illustrator here and all
I did was just type a or took a piece of
text out from the internet so I could
use it to show you guys what's going on
and first thing I want to show you is
let's go to type and then let's go to
font and if you look at our fronts here
the one I have is myriad for pro so I'm
just gonna click down here for a little
while till I get to it come on you can
do it this this way of getting to tech
they're two different fonts on yours
just alright here we go
so here's myriad Pro and if you look to
the left you've got this little oh right
here that's gonna say tell you that this
is an OpenType font if you look at these
ones here they have the t's that's a
true type font so if you want to work
along with this make sure that you have
an OpenType font and usually with the
OpenType fonts you're gonna be able to
have all these different kind of styles
here with it so let's go ahead and do
that I'm gonna stick with myriad Pro and
let's start so we want to get to the
open type panel so we can start working
with our OpenType fonts so we're gonna
go to window type and we're gonna go to
open type here we go we've got figure
position and then we've got a bunch of
other attributes that we can work with
here so figure it's just gonna select
the figures style let me make sure I
have stuff selected
and it looks like the figure style isn't
really doing too much here I usually
always keep it these two on the default
we've got our position
we've got superscript and subscript
numerator and you can see that these do
a little a couple different things you
can see numerator put some of the
punctuation in the middle denominator
doesn't or puts it down there but I
always just usually stick with default
position because that's what you see
most of the time and down here we've got
our attributes
the first one is standard ligatures and
if you're not sure what ligatures are
it's pretty much written right here
because say you've got something like
the letter F and F twice like in the
word waffle well with the two F's they
have that little thing in the middle in
the middle of the letter that goes
crossways like a like a plus sign in the
middle of the letter to signify the F
well when those two come together in
text sometimes they touch and that's
called a ligature so maybe if I tell you
let me see if i type in waffle here you
can see it right there
the fnf are next to each other and they
are actually touching and sometimes you
don't want that so you can hit this and
you can see how they aren't touching it
anymore every time I hit this so that's
handy
that's something that you might want to
use this depends on what how you want
your stuff to look like and then you got
some other things you got contextual
alternatives which formats script text
and then you've got discretionary
ligatures which is next and sometimes
with different texts some words will
stick together like F and T or s and T
we've got swash which are the
exaggerated parts of the characters like
these edges that come off the a and
stuff we've got a stylistic alternatives
and if I click on that let me
get some let's see if this has a
stylistic alternative no this one does
not so usually if you click on that then
it's going to create an aesthetic effect
but it's not doing it on this one and
then we've got the next one here is
tilting alternatives and and that
formats stuff like titles that helps you
with that the next one is Orioles or
ordinals and formats numbers with
superscript or subscript characters and
fractions separate the numbers by a
slash so that's pretty nice but that's a
pretty much there is all there is to
working with OpenType fonts and I would
suggest that you might want to go in
with some different characters are
different fonts and test out these
different attributes and see what they
do so you can see that some of these
aren't open and it would take a long
time to just go through and find out
which ones work with what to show you
everything else but it's more helpful
sometimes to show you where everything
is and then let you mess around with it
you'll catch it more with it in your
brain when you're actually doing it so
