physics lesson and in this lesson well
before I go on with this lesson I
probably want to mention this my guess
is that you watch the last video and you
remember me talking about force pairs
and you now understand the concept
behind a force pair how you can have an
object and they can have two forces of
equal magnitude but opposite direction
thus causing zero acceleration pretty
much the object doesn't move at all so
that kind of makes sense to you but then
you thought of whenever I said this you
know I said that Newton says that if you
are standing on earth that gravity is
pulling down on you with the equal force
that the earth is pushing up on you and
you said okay I'm not moving must be
force bear gravity of course I
understand that force I know that is but
how in the world can earth be pushing up
on me that doesn't make sense well it
doesn't make sense to a lot of people so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to try
to explain this without the use of a
watermelon tree so the first thing I
want to do before I draw my lip diagram
is let me just go ahead and write this
equation force equals mass times
acceleration now I want to write that
just because I'm going to refer to it a
couple of times but imagine this say you
were sitting in science class in the
teacher brought out two Rolly chairs and
these Rolly chairs obviously look a lot
like boots now of course the Rolly
chairs are the ones that you probably
have at your computer desk
with three or four wheels on the bottom
now these weren't ordinary rolling
chairs these Rolly chairs were facing
back to back and they're connected by a
spring now you were sitting in one chair
here's your little arm in your head like
that
let me draw your head a little bit
bigger you guys are smarter than that
and in the other chair your teacher
picked the fattest guy he could possibly
think of in the class
so here's him and here's his arm he's
probably eating like a cheeseburger or
something already
let me draw his eyes I'll get in my
mouth so it's you right here skinny mini
and over here huge humongo fat guy so
again everything else is the same except
obviously the weight aka well let's just
say the mass even though mass is related
weight as you already know so now you're
just sitting in these chairs and your
feet are off the ground both of yours
and some dude walks in the middle will
just say this is your teacher and he
pushes both of these chairs away from
him he pushes both chairs in the
opposite direction so like this he
pushes you to the left and fatso to the
right and I know it sounds mean but guys
I'm trying these physics here so what
would happen in this case well obviously
what would happen is you would go flying
and this guy right here he would move
but he would really only move a little
bit so why would he only move a little
bit and you would move a lot well that's
because the force is the same but the
mass is not the same you are so much
more or less massive than this guy over
here that you have greater acceleration
with the same force so why am I talking
about fat guys in you sitting in chairs
well this is exactly what happens with
you and the earth even though you guys
have the same force aka he has the same
strength in each arm to push you guys
away this occurs on earth not with a fat
guy but with earth so just imagine that
Earth is a really fat friend fatter than
this guy could ever be if he ate all the
cheeseburgers in the world basically
what happens is like I said earth is
really fat friend and since this fat
friend is so massive any changes in its
acceleration is so small that it's
almost unmeasurable but that doesn't
mean that it doesn't exist the force is
so still there even though when it
pushes you it's very easy and apparent
to see but whenever you have a force you
like you jumping on the earth you move
it
and you indeed move it but it's so small
that no instrument that man can ever
make will probably ever be what's it
called accurate enough to measure it so
like I said earth is just a really fat
friend
so hopefully you understand now and if
you don't don't get all upset because
the truth is physicists don't really
understand totally how gravity works yet
and if you're saying oh yeah they do
they know how to calculate it they even
know that you know more massive things
can cause you know more gravity such as
Earth can cause more gravity than the
moon well yeah they know that stuff they
know how to figure out equations and
they don't has to do with mass but
physicists still don't know why gravity
works kind of weird to say but it's
still one of the big mysteries they
think it has something to do with
something called graviton or excuse me
graviton x' which is supposed to be the
subatomic particle that we can't even
see many ways I'm getting way off topic
here I didn't even mean to talk about
that but if you guys don't understand
still then that's probably because no
one does gravity is one of the biggest
mysteries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
