welcome to your 27th I think
let me check real quick 27th Java
tutorial and in these next couple
tutorials we're going to be going over
user interaction for example whenever
the user clicks like up on their
keyboard or presses escape you want the
either character go up or quit the game
or to move around or something or a
number they click a mouse or move it
around you want the person on the
computer to aim a gun or something like
that and this um kind of needs user
interaction for this boat before we just
jump right in the user interaction if
you haven't noticed in the last couple
org is pretty much all of the tutorials
there is kind of this core bit of code
that we need to type over and over and
over again
a lot of the same methods like run on
the main loop the display modes and
we're going to have to keep typing this
code over and over again unless we make
a class that stores all the core
programming and methods so we can just
make an abstract class and then we won't
need to keep typing it over and over
again because it takes up a lot of time
in these tutorials so for one last time
we're going to type it like I said one
last time in an abstract class and that
way we can just inherit from it and we
won't have to cover it over and over
again we just keep learning new material
so let's go ahead and do that right now
so this is going to be one last
refresher and this is what you need to
put in your core coding class so
actually make a public abstract class
and name it whatever you want in my core
because they don't know what it is
private static display mode name it
modes is going to be your display modes
and let me go ahead and end that right
now and put new display mode and the
first one will be 800 by 600 32-bit hit
0 refresh
and that's a common another semicolon
and let's just go ahead and copy this
three times and these are going to give
you your display modes so this is going
to be 24 and 16 and let me go ahead and
copy this one and this is going to be
the same thing but 640 by 480 and it's
going to be 32 and of course like before
24-bit and 16-bit depending on what your
graphics card is in the mood for and we
need two more variables private blue
lien running and this is either going to
be true or false true if your game is
running false oh it's not and that's
going to do the never-ending loop which
only ends if you call stop method but
anyways protected screen manager s and
there we go looks good and now we can go
ahead and build our stop method just
public void stop and you're going to
call this oops stop method looks good on
Hoss public void can I type every word
walk wrong embarrassing public void stop
and you're going to call this whenever
you want to stop your entire program and
what's going to do is take this running
method which is going to be set to true
initially it's going to take it false in
we're going to have a while we're
running so it's going to be true and
this is going to break you out of that
main loop so let's go ahead and make our
call in its and our run method so public
void run and what this run myth is going
to do is try to call make our catch
actually it's going to be finally so try
init and we're going to build these
methods and
game loop right like that and then after
it's done running both of those finally
is going to restore your screen so s dot
restore screen just like that to exit
full screen so now we have to bolt build
this init and game loop and then just
two more methods that pretty much do
nothing so let's go ahead and build
first let's go ahead and build in it so
pretty much sets to full screen and do
something with the variables so public
void in its no parameters and what this
does is it's going to set your screen
manager object so s equals new screen
manager just like that if I remember to
put these in and I just have a little
thing for putting the equal sign just
like that so now it's a going to get
your display mode set equal to DM equals
s dot fine
first compatible display mode of modes I
already filled it in for us
how kind thank you sir your judgment in
the scholar and s dot set full screen
with DM wow this is a little too easy
it's filling everything in for me that's
the joy of building our methods the same
name as your variables awesome so now
let's go ahead and better a window
object window w equals s get full screen
window look at all this stuff just
filling in for me W set font and my
fonts going to be new fonts and it's
going to be just put it Arial nice and
simple font plain with size of 20 nice
viewable and go ahead and end that and
now what we need to do set background
and foreground so W dot
it's back around right there and we're
going to set this equal to the color dot
green because its first color I thought
of and W dot set foreground and this is
going to be color dot white so our text
is going to be white on a green screen
but not a real green screen just our
computer is going to look green and now
we're going to set running equal to true
to begin with because we need to set it
equal to something or else it won't know
so now after in it let's just go ahead
and make our main game loop if we have
time main game loop and remember name it
whatever you named it up here and I'm
going to name it public void game loop
I'm going to take any parameters and
this is going to pretty much keep your
game running so long start time equals
system dot current time in milliseconds
and now long come time equals not minus
equals start time and this should be
capitalized of course and now let's go
ahead and make our loop while so while
true to begin with what's going to
happen long time past set it equal to
system dot current time milliseconds -
cumulative time and why am I getting oh
right there
- embarrassing time past it was that
come time plus equal time past update
time and we're going to be building this
update method in just a bit so that's
why we're getting air so graphics 2d
just name a G equals s dot get graphics
and draw G of course to draw what's ever
on the Wow look I suppose draw that's
embarrassing
and when you're trying to do a finger
off s G duh
dispose good housekeeping and s dot
update right there and now the last
thing we need for now is to try to make
our thread go to sleep so give our
computer a break thread sleep for let's
go 20 milliseconds that should be plenty
of time and catch any errors but we
shouldn't since our code should be good
so catch exception e X and do nothing
with it so now that we have all that we
just need to build an update in your
drought which we will do in the next
tutorial and everything else looks good
to go so in the next tutorial we're
going to be finishing up this and also
going over well we actually came here
for and that's how to test keys and get
user input because if you ever play the
game without user input sucks it's like
reading a book but worse so thank you
guys for watching in the next tutorial I
promise you'll be learning something new
and something very awesome so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
