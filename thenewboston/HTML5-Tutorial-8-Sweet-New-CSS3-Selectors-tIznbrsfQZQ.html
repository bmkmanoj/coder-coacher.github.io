eighth html5 tutorial and in this
tutorial I want to talk to you guys
about some new css3 selectors
now the first selector I'm going to be
talking to you guys about is the greater
than sign now the greater than sign
pretty much affects the second element
where the first element is the parent so
what am I talking about well let's go
ahead and let me show you guys an
example so if I write something like
this where it looks like that pretty
much this whatever rule I type after
here it's going to affect any paragraph
that has a div as its parent so if we
look all of these paragraphs have a div
called mommy as their parent so let's go
ahead and apply rule I will go ahead and
color this green so now if we go ahead
and save this and refresh this page now
all of these paragraphs since they had a
div as their parent get colored green
never saying okay well does that work
with a grandparent as well because check
this out the div is its parent in the
body is its grandparent so let's go
ahead and exchange the four body and see
what happens we go ahead and refresh
this and nothing gets affected that's
because the body is not the parent of
the paragraph the body is the
grandparent of the paragraph and this
symbol right here means only affect the
paragraphs where body are the parent
make sense good so now with that saw
'real or excuse me not that or that
isn't the end of the story so now with
that rule taken care of we can move on
to the other rule which is the plus sign
now the plus sign is another new
selector that we got with css3 and it
pretty much means effect the second
element when it immediately follows the
first so that's kind of weird and
another thing is that they must have the
same parent so what the heck am I
talking about
say we have a paragraph that belonged to
the class of Bucky now all of these
paragraphs belong to the class Bucky so
I'm just going to go ahead and write
Bucky plus paragraph so this is saying
okay
and what color cannot make this did I
make the last one green I'll make this
one blue so this is pretty much saying
okay whenever we have a paragraph that
follows another paragraph with a class
Bucky turn it blue so let's go ahead and
save this refresh it and see what we get
we see that every paragraph turns blue
except for this first paragraph right
here so why did that first paragraph not
turn blue well if we look at the rule it
says only apply this rule to paragraphs
that immediately follow other paragraphs
with the class Bucky and since nothing
was before this first paragraph that's
why it started at the second one because
this one follows a paragraph with a
class Bucky this one does too this one
goes through and this one does too
this one however follows a div tag so
that's why that isn't affected and
another thing is whenever we have a rule
using this plus selector they must have
the same parent so we can't have you
know a paragraph right here in another
paragraph right here and expect it to be
affected they must share the same parent
which is the div tag in this case mommy
so let me just go ahead and save that
and the last rule I want to talk to you
guys about is this little thing right
here now I don't even know what it's
called I think it's called a tilde or
something but basically it's very
similar to the plus sign except I make
sure you don't have any extra spaces
there it's very similar to the plus sign
however it doesn't need to immediately
follow it like it did with the plus sign
for example if we go ahead and we
refresh this right here we see that the
same effect is happening however if we
go ahead and add a span somewhere in the
middle here let me just go ahead and add
a random span with Hello hamster kind of
spelled that wrong but it doesn't matter
for this tutorial say we added a span
right there now if we look this fourth
paragraph right here it isn't
immediately following this third one
there's a span in between however if we
go ahead and save this we see that the
fourth paragraph is still colored blue
why is that well even though there's a
span in between this little tilde here
said okay as long as it follows a
paragraph with Bucky it doesn't need to
be immediately following it there can be
some stuff in between however if we
change this to the plus sign that's
where we can see the difference take a
look at this here when i refresh it now
this fourth paragraph right here turns
black and it doesn't get styled because
it's no longer immediately following
this paragraph right here it's now
immediately following the span so that's
the difference between the plus selector
and the tilde selector the toad a
selector is the exact same but it
doesn't need to immediately follow what
was before it so that is the three
selectors that I wanted to go over and
yeah I guess that's all there is to say
what's it what's the force come saying
and that's all I got to say about that
yeah so any that's probably the worst
Forrest Gump impression I've ever did in
my entire life but anyways thank you
guys for watching uh yeah I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
