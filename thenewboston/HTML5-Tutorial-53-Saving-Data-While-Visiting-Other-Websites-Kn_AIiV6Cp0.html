tutorial in yeah I think it's time to
finish this bad boy up so let me go
ahead and explain the last line of code
in case you guys were just like cheating
and kind of just picked up on this story
what I did in the last line of code is
basically I got the name of the item and
I stored it in a variable called a so
now that we have the name of the item we
can go ahead and get the value of the
item so let's go ahead and slow not bar
I got a gets got beer in my mind let's
go ahead and take the value of the item
and store it in a variable called B now
remember whenever we are setting an item
we use the variable term excuse me we
use the function set item whenever we
are getting the value of an item we use
the function get item now the function
get item basically returns the value of
an item which item you ask well we need
to pass it in a parameter so if we had
something like I don't know we had a
variable named Bucky and it had a value
of excuse me we had a variable called
people and we had a value of Bucky we
would pass people into here and it would
return Bucky so now a would be people in
B would be Bucky so now that we have the
name of the variable or item and also
its value we can go ahead and start
printing it out on the screen so let me
go ahead and in order to print it out in
the right box we first need to access
this right box right here and actually I
can go ahead and cheat grab this whole
thing CheY CheY so go ahead and grab the
innerhtml and i'm going to explain this
we can't just go ahead and set this
equal to you know a single line of text
like this because this is going to loop
through let's say 10 times at the end of
the tenth time it's going to say okay
set this equal to a and B so each time
it's going to replace the innerhtml so
instead of just replacing it 10 times
and ending up with a single line we want
the innerhtml to be 10 line
long so in order to do that instead of
just setting equal to one mind we need
to add that line on to this property
right here so then the first time it
loops through its going to be one line
the second time it's going to be two
lines and it keeps adding lines and
lines onto this property and at the end
you have you know hopefully a list of
like five or six different things so now
that we have that taken care of
let's go ahead and start printing out
these variables I'm just going to go
ahead and print out the name of the
variable which is stored in the variable
a and also the value of the item or
variable but I just don't want to print
them out right after each other what I
want to do is I actually want to add a
little one of these so you know it just
looks a little prettier and then just go
ahead and stick on the value of it and
after this since we're going to be
working with a bunch of different
variables I want each of these to appear
on a new line so in order to do that
just go ahead and add a break at the end
and this is going to make them appear on
a new line so let me go ahead and save
this and yeah everything looks pretty
good to go so this basically loops
through all the variables you have
stored and makes them appear on the new
line so let me go ahead and copy the
path to that and refresh it and check it
out we got all this crap because I was
testing it out in my last tutorial but I
want to show you guys how this works let
me go ahead and refresh this launching
Google Chrome and I'm going to go ahead
and store the variable a a save it in
there B B save it in there c c save it
in so instead of just storing one
variable and its value we can store a
bunch of different variables in their
value now let me go ahead and go to my
website the New Boston org o1 over its
happenin on my forum any active topics
looking cool oh you know this looks good
how old are you the ID odda
and now I got a you know what I think
I'm going to go back to that website and
check it out when we go back all our
information is still stored all of our
variables so if we were like on a
website like YouTube and we wanted to
keep a list of our favorites or
more likely you'd be building something
like a shopping cart and you want to
keep the users items and maybe they went
to a different website to compare prices
or something when they came back all of
their items are still stored for them
and say they wanted to add another item
to their shopping cart like tuna and I
don't know maybe it was like $12 well
you can store that in there too and then
when you go to you know another website
come back all that information is stored
there right for you so again before with
the JavaScript as soon as we left this
page then all of the users information
and data would get destroyed but now
what you can do is you can have the user
you know go to different websites check
out different prices build a shopping
cart and then whenever they came back
all of their information is stored for
them so we're saying okay so whenever
you're working with sessions does it
store it a day does it store it a week
does it store a month well whenever
we're working with sessions in html5 a
session lasts as long as you have that
browser open as soon as you X out of it
like I just did look what happens we're
going to go ahead and launch this in
chrome again and we get a brand new
session so let me go ahead and you know
store tuna for $4 and apples for $65
pretty expensive apples this information
is going to be stored as long as we have
our browser open so check it out but as
soon as I go ahead and close out of this
browser then the information gets
destroyed so that is how long a session
lives it lives as long as you wanted to
so now okay guys I'm done talking I am
you know my throat is parched I need to
go chug a milkshake or something so
anyways I hope you understand that
basically how to use the web storage API
and when it could be useful whenever
you're building things like shopping
carts and stuff of that matter if you
ever want to make a program where you
know maybe you want to store information
for longer such as like if you made
something like eBay where you had a list
of items and you
wanted it to be saved there for like a
month or YouTube like a list of favorite
videos then you would need to use a
database that would probably be your
best bet but anyways for simple shopping
cart applications and you know I don't
know I don't know someone think of
something else for me because I mind
around a blank right now this is your
best bet but anyways thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
