that I'm making for the new Boston and
in this tutorial I'm gonna be showing
you how to overload operators more so
for this tutorial are gonna need to have
is a button and item class and inside of
your item class just make sure that you
have public into your property doesn't
really matter what it's called mine just
happened to be called price and I also
have a code that we used in the previous
tutorial to overload the plus operator
in this tutorial we're going to be
overloading the equal equals operator
and the doesn't equals operator because
if you overload one you must overload
the other or else will throw an error
alright so let's just get right into it
and the first vector operator that we're
going to be overloading is the equal
equals operator so checking to see if
two items are equal or not so let me
type public and static because all
operators must be both public and static
and then the next thing that we're gonna
want our tight type is the return type
and since we're checking to see if two
items are equal or not it's going to
return a pool indicating whether equal
so if they're equal it'll return true if
they're not equal it overturn false so
we're just gonna take pool right here
and then we're gonna want to tell the
compiler that we're overloading an
operator operator and then we're gonna
want to type the operator that we're
going to be overloading and we're gonna
all be over loading equal equals
operator basically just check and see
two items are equal so there's gonna
type equal equals and just say for when
you're overloading the plus operator
right here the first parameter that
we're going to be typing is what will be
on the left side of the equal equals
operator so there's gonna like item that
we're gonna do comparing two items and
they're just gonna type I 1 I 1 and then
the second parameter will be what was
ever or whatever will be on the right
side of our equal equal sign I'm just
going to type item and I'll call it AI 2
all right so now we're basically is
going to compare these two items prices
and if the two prices are equal then our
going to return true if they're not
equal above them to return false and
since we're dealing with a pool here we
can just use the ternary operator
don't affect return and then we're gonna
say if I won price equals iTunes price
then we're going to return true if
they're different we're going to return
false
all right so now we've successfully
overloaded the equal equals operator so
now I'm going to Bob we're going to get
an error because we haven't overloaded
the doesn't equal operator as well
so yeah it says the operator equal
equals requires a matching operator
doesn't equals also be defined so you
must overload doesn't equals operator as
well so we're just going to say public
static because remember all operators
must be both public and static and we're
gonna save Google again because we're
gonna turn the bool indicating whether
the items are not equal this time then
we're gonna say operator again and then
this time we're gonna say not equal so
exclamation point equals and again to
support the parameters or I have a two
items queries because we're going to
keep comparing two items prices I'm just
going to call this I 1 and I'll call the
second item I - all right so basically
we're going to using the exact same code
up here only we're going to be checking
to see if they're not equal not if they
are equal so let's think use that to a
not equal sign so if they're not equal
it will return true indicating that they
are not equal and if they are equal then
it'll return false indicating that they
are equal
all right so now that this is all good
right here
that's just bill to get rid of this
right here that squiggly line
all right build succeeded now we can
actually use this so we can create two
items here almost call this item one
instead of equal to a new item and I'll
say this items price is five and then
I'll just create another item in here
and I'll set its price to five as well
so two and I'll say I choose price
equals five so now we're just going to
check to see if these two items are
identical we're going to say if
item 1 equals item 2 that I'm going to
eat a message box saying that these
items are the same all right so now if
these two items are equal which they are
we're going to get a message box saying
these two items are the same and it says
these all right so now I need you bug
you click this button we should get
these items are the same because these
items are the same both their prices are
identical yep these items are the same
and since we overloaded the doesn't
equal operator as well we can check that
out so if they're not equal and all this
change this items price to 6 then we
should get a message box saying these
items are different quite different
right here all right so since item once
price is 5 cheese price is 6
we're going to get a message box saying
these items are different because we use
the doesn't equal operator right here
yep these items are different all right
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial on overloading the equal equals
operator and overloading the does of
equals operator so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
