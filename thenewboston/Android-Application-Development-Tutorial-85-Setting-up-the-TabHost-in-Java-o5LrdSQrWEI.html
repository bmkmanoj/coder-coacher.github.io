enjoy tutorial for the new Boston what
we're gonna do in this tutorial is
basically you know get rid of this
garbage right here and set up our
application actually be running properly
so we're gonna do is we're good um again
just a to highlight we're going to use
the tab host which we gave the ID at +
ID tap house so that's mainly the most
important one that we're going to refer
to as well as the specific layout here
within our frame layout we have those
ideas as IDs as tab 1 tab 2 and tab 3 so
that's kind of an important thing to
realize or remember what those those
references are in Joppa but let's just
get started the first thing we're going
to do is create a tab host called tab
host or th short for tab host and then
you import tab host then we say tab host
like this as well find view by D nothing
new for the most part I mean it's a tab
host so that's a little bit different
but an r dot ID dot tab host so we set
that up now now the first thing we want
to do is alright the first thing that
man I just didn't spell that correctly
at all first thing we want to do is set
up our tab house because again the tab
host kind of organizes everything and
once we say th which is the tab host
that we set up here we can use dot setup
and that's just going to basically know
get the initial initialization going on
kind of set up the basics and now we can
actually add our tabs we can kind of
organize it organize what we want our
tab to be what kind of content we want
the tab to have or hold again the
content being our layouts or linear
layout so all we have to do now is just
say again our tab ho
or we're going to refer to the tab specs
which comes from the tab host class so
tab specs and we're going to call this
TS for tab specs and we got to import
our tab specs class here and then what
we're going to do is we're going to say
our tab specs is equal to our tab host
dot new tab new tab spec and basically
what this is going to give it is a
string reference or a name a tag of some
sort and right now I don't know exactly
if this has a purpose I think it's just
something Android developed for further
you know for for the future but at the
moment I don't think this tag actually
can be referenced of any sort but um we
do need to set it up still so we're
going to set this tag spec up to our tag
host and then give it a tag so now what
we want to do is set up our SPECT and
kind of define what we want are a
specific tab to be what we want to do
and what we want to hold so first we're
going to say our TS let's change this to
so it's a little specs we're going to
change that to specs just so it's a
little bit more descriptive there so
we're going to say specs and then we can
say Det dot set content as you can see
here again the content referring to our
our linear layout so we're going to say
our dot ID dot tab one again that's the
linear layout that we set up in and the
Java here or in the XML here and that's
going to hold our two buttons in our
textview so that's what that's referring
to and then we also want to say
basically give it the
have a name of some sort so we're going
to say specs dot set indicator and
basically that's the tabs name is the
indicator and then we're going to call
this first one stopwatch and that's
going to appear on our actual our actual
tab then the last thing that we have to
do is we just got to say our tab host
then we just say add tab and it takes a
tab spec within its parameters so we're
going to give it our spec that we just
set up so specs so there we go
we set up once one tab so far that has a
tag the content and what we want the tab
to actually include now all we're going
to do is just kind of copy and paste
this whole whole thing again so just
copy paste we don't need to redefine our
tab here or a spec so what we're going
to do now is just kind of define our
second tab as well so we can say tag tag
to for the new kind of tag and then for
content of the second tag we want to be
our tag I'm sorry
tab tag and tab alright I got it now so
we want our content to be our second tab
or our linear layout that's number two
and for that we're just going to say tab
to something like that and then again
all we do since we kind of redefined
what spec is here we're just going to
add that new tab as well and then let's
just paste it one more time get rid of
the specs here for a third tag for a
third tab with the name tag three and
with the content tab three and we're
just going to say add a tab
now we are yeah we are add a tab next
tutorial might not be that awesome but
that's what our third one is going to be
and now just quickly we save it so again
you kind of define the specs and then
you from the tab host you add the specs
to your startup or your oncreate method
and the only other thing we're going to
do real quickly I'm going to copy a
button from our first class or from our
first linear layout and paste it within
our third linear layout instead of this
textview and we're going to change this
to button add tab
and we're just going to save it and I
will catch you guys in the next tutorial
well actually let's run it real quick
make sure everything works
so I'm pin our tabs and we have our
three tabs so the first one we ever
start and stop second one we have our
textview and our third one we have that
added tab button so there we go um
everything looks pretty good so
hopefully you guys enjoyed that and I'll
catch you in the next tutorial have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
