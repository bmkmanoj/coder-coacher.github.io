23rd - ql tutorial and in this lesson
well actually before we begin I want to
mention this I updated the MySQL files
so if you guys want that new table go
ahead download the file you can get it
now there you go and if you don't know
it's a my website is T&amp;amp;B forum calm and
just go in the database section it's
right there for you guys but anyways
what I want to talk about in the soil is
outer joins but before I begin that I
want to mention something that I
probably should have mentioned last time
remember when we were talking about
column names and how you can have a
column and you can give it a nickname by
writing like as C or something and then
you can refer to that column as C well
you can also give tables nicknames so I
just wanted to show you guys a quick
example because I'm probably going to be
giving tables and nicknames in upcoming
tutorials and I didn't want you to get
didn't want you guys to get confused so
let me go ahead and type the whole query
because for these it's easier if I type
the entire query and then explain it so
I'm just going to go ahead and select i
dot seller ID and i'll give you guys a
couple I dot name and see da ID might as
well talk about different lines from
customers as C so you guys can probably
see what's going on already items as I
so basically what we did is just go
ahead and finish it super before I start
blabbing on seller underscore ID equals
and I'll just do C ID now let me run
this and make sure this makes sense
there we go no air is good so basically
like I said not only can we use the as
keyword to give a column a nickname but
we can also give a table a nickname so
whenever we do that just go ahead and
write your table name as and then give
it a nickname hopefully shorter because
you know if it's longer it's not really
a nickname and do that with any table
you want and then on your entire query
instead of referring to this as items
seller ID items name customers ID you
just go ahead and you use that nickname
so not only whenever you're referring to
the columns but also in your where
clause as well
so again like I said basically you can
give tables nicknames as well as columns
nicknames and it just makes your coding
a little bit faster maybe a little bit
easier to read many ways I'm going to be
giving nicknames in the upcoming
tutorials just didn't want you guys to
get confused but now we can get to the
good stuff the heart of the story which
is outer joins so what is that outer
join well let's go ahead and remind
ourselves what an inner join was an
inner join was basically when we have
two columns and we want to match them
together okay that's nice but sometimes
and you guys probably noticed this
already you're going to have these
instances where your rows don't line up
exactly maybe you have some items that
don't have a cellar ID or maybe you have
some customers or users for your website
who aren't listing items yet well that's
nice but what if our boss comes in and
he's like Bucky listen I'm going to need
a list of all the customers and the
items that they're selling for example
if Bucky's selling a tuna fish sandwich
and a Corvette and a life vest I'm going
to need a list of those so again the
name of the user and the items are
selling okay simple enough we'll just do
a simple joint should be on your way
then he's like oh by the way I also need
to know I also need the name of the user
even if they aren't selling any items
and we're like okay that might get
confusing so let's go ahead and try to
tackle this problem so we go ahead and
select customers dot name which is
basically like the username in items dot
name so basically the username in the
items that they're selling from
customers and items where remember where
is basically saying how are these tables
related so customers
customers dots ID should equal seller
underscore ID so we go ahead enter your
run this go check it out and we'll just
go ahead and sort it make it look a
little bit prettier we hand this to our
boss and he's like wow this is looking
pretty good wait a minute I could have
sworn that there are some more users on
our website what the heck happened to
them some people's names are messing up
well the reason that some people's names
aren't showing up is because they don't
have any items listed right now but what
if we wanted to show them anyways okay
that could get kind of confusing so
let's go ahead and rework this query a
little bit so of course we want the
customers in the items name and we also
want that we also want to use the
customers table but instead of just
going customers and items where like we
did before what we want to do is write
lists left outer join and I know the
syntax looks weird so I'm just going to
go ahead and type this query and then
tell you guys
so left outer join items so take note
that there's a table name here and then
your right basically join with this
table on and remember the on keyword is
basically saying how are these tables
related so customers dot ID in this is
basically the same condition is less
time equal seller underscore ID so let's
go ahead and run this and see what we
get we'll check it out not only did we
get basically the same list as last time
but as you can see it now lists the
users that do not have any items listed
as well so when they don't have anything
to associate it with when your
conditions aren't met and they don't
have any related data it still shows the
table on the left so basically this
query is different from a simple joint
because whenever you hit left outer join
it's basically saying that show all
customers with items even if they aren't
selling any items sounds weird in the
key word left what this means is you
know how that look at this syntax right
here you see that right there
there's a table on the left in I know
it's kind of like below it right now but
if this is one long line then this would
be on the right so customers is on the
left and items is on the right of the
syntax right here whenever you use the
keyword left you're saying left means to
include all the rows from the table on
the left
therefore the customers table no matter
what so include all the customers no
matter what no matter if they have items
or not if we were to go ahead and hit
write right here then what it would do
is it would include all of the items no
matter if they had a seller going with
them or not so let's go ahead and take a
look at that so as you can see now all
of the items are listed but say this
user went ahead and they deleted their
user name and they got banned or
something but the item was still on the
website well even though they wouldn't
have a user associated with that item
since we use that right outer join it
takes all of the rows from the table on
the right which is in this case all of
the items and it forces those to be
shown so even though it doesn't have a
customer associated with it
it forces those items to be shown so
that is the difference between the left
outer join and right outer join
basically do you want to force these
rows to be shown or these rows to be
shown so again that is what an outer
join is basically forcing rows to be
joined or excuse me
forcing rows to be shown different from
my regular join where both of the
basically they have to have related data
so there you go I'm going to be done
talking hopefully you guys understand
and don't forget to download the files
go to my website TN Bay form comm and
they're right there so thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
