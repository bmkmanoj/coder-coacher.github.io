video I am going to show you how to use
a tool called Hydra to access or routers
settings or configuration screen
whatever you want to call it so as I'm
sure you guys know whenever you go to
the IP address of a default gateway or
maybe a variation of it what it does is
it gives you this web page where you can
access your router settings and you can
change things like the default DNS
server this is where you set the pre
Chartier password for your Wi-Fi network
basically any settings that you can
perform on your router this is how you
get to it so if you click login or maybe
the forms right here then what it has
you do is it as you type the username in
the password now most of the time what
you need to do and this is incredibly
easy if you just look at the
manufacturer of your router and maybe
the model number we just close out here
then all you have to do is you have to
go to Google and say ok what is the
default username and password and it's
usually something really easy like user
user blank password admin admin you know
something really simple like that so if
you ever get to one of those screens
first just google it and see what the
default you know credentials are now if
you were smart and you actually change
your password like I recommend most
people do then maybe a few months later
you came back and you're like alright I
want to change I don't know maybe my
Wi-Fi password but I can't remember my
password that you know I changed my
router to well what you can do is you
can use a tool called Hydra and this
allows you to perform a dictionary
attack on your router and I guess it
isn't really attack it's more of a
recovery tool since it's your own router
but I'll show you guys what we're going
to do so and by the way I know that my
router before this tutorial I already
changed it back to default which is the
username is user and the the password is
also user so just remember that is a
user user to login but we'll do it the
cool way all right so before you start
doing this you're going to need to have
two files the first one is for potential
user names in the
someone is going to be for potential
passwords and they're usually going to
be a lot longer than this but this is
just an example so what it's going to do
is this tool is going to go through
every user name and for each one it's
going to try all of these passwords so
root with this password then root with
this password then if it can't hit any
it's going to go to admin admin with
this then this then this all the way
down here and it's basically going to go
through every combination until you find
the one that works so let's close out of
here and I'll show you guys how to use
it so if you just type hydro then after
this you need to give it the page where
it's going to login and I close out of
my browser but mine was login HTML so if
you go to http that was the protocol and
if you just type in the IP like you
would in a browser it gets a little
confused so you need to surround it with
square brackets so 192.168.0.1 and this
isn't the same ip for every single
router the IP of your router depends on
the manufacturer how your network set up
but for mine in a lot of people's it's
going to be this one or maybe one six
eight dot one dot one so just look for
your own you know there's a bunch of
different variations so my login page is
login dot HTML so this is pretty much
the page where we have to type the
username and password so after this I'm
just going to show you guys a bunch of
different parameters that you guys can
use these are a very helpful and I am
let's do them all the time maybe I
should just type all of these prayers so
V then minus T we'll do a four and it's
good for right now all right
so this minus E and s right here this
means that I'll show you guys if you let
me bring that back up usernames and
passwords so you know how I said that
what this is going to do is it's going
to look at every username and try every
password for it
well whenever you have the Annis flag
it's not only going to do that but it's
also going to try um so for this one the
password of root
so it tries itself as a password - and
also a blank password so this one is
going to try all these combinations plus
root plus a blank for the password this
one is going to try all combinations
plus admin plus blank for password so it
just gives you some more options and by
the way Oh like even my router the
username and password about the same use
your user and I see admin admin a lot so
this flag is actually really helpful - f
this means exit whenever we find a login
so as soon as we find the credentials
that we can that match that we can use
then this stops the program and it
doesn't you know no use continuing with
the rest we already found what we're
looking for this - V just says to
display the results in the terminal
verbose give me something to look at
this - t4 this says that this is the
number of tests that we're going to run
in parallel now you just don't want to
do like a hundred because some routers
won't allow it and even if they do you
know then it could probably crash it
so usually minus t4 eight or sixteen are
your options there and the last thing
that it needs is just the files for the
username and the password
now if you're using a list then you use
a capital letter if you're using just
one then you use a lowercase letter so
let's say that I just had a one username
I knew that the user name was admin I'm
going to do lowercase L admin now since
I have a list then I use uppercase so
that's the difference between those two
and mine is on desktop and what was it
top user names so top ten user names the
text and well it'll wrap so alright so
the last thing is of course the
passwords and same thing for password so
if you know the password is like bacon 1
2 3 then you can just use a lowercase P
but I'm just using a list of passwords
so I'm going to use uppercase P and then
that's on the desktop - and there is top
ten passwords text so there you go and
well now it's good to go I'm going to
hit enter and check it out look how fast
that was so it ran through all of the
route so as you can see it did a route
first and then blank and then it went
through the list one two three four five
six it did it for admin that didn't work
and then it did for user and once it got
to the login user using the password
user it says
dunt-da-daaaaa we finished we found a
valid pair this is a username and
password combination for your router so
now we can log back into a router and do
whatever we want to do to it change the
password DNS settings you know maybe put
some firewalls up whatever you want to
do follow your heart but there you go
that is the basics of Hydra and I
actually want to do like a little mini
series on Hydra because there are a lot
of different options and you know just
different settings you can use you can
do this for like MySQL and SSH and FTP
and well a bunch of different stuff but
I'm getting kind of ahead of myself but
there you go hopefully you guys enjoyed
go log into your own router and yeah see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
