is we set up our component to display
all of these videos but now what I want
to do is this I want to have it so
whenever the user clicks one of these
rows that the video appears at the
bottom right here so the first thing we
have to figure out is how do we just
listen for click events and the way that
you do that is this so we want to listen
for click events on the row so it
doesn't matter what commonly click we
just want to listen for it anywhere on
the row wherever they click so on this
row tag right here what we're going to
do is this in between parentheses go
ahead and right click so set this equal
to some attribute and this is how in
angler you can listen for click events
or any events so whenever a click occurs
on this row then it's going to trigger
whatever we type in here which is going
to be some method now we don't have any
here let me close out of all this extra
crap so in our class we don't have any
methods created yet but we will in just
a second and we can name this anything
we want I'm just going to name this on
select so whenever we call this method
we actually want to pass in this video
so that way it knows exactly what video
to display and again remember whenever
we're looping through these videos each
individual video is referenced as V so
there you go so again whenever you want
to listen for click events just right
click equals and then set it equal to
some method so now in here we can
actually go ahead and make that method
but check this out we actually need to
import this video class right here so
I'm just going to set it up to display
the video and before you even do that
before I actually output the actual HTML
code I'm just going to display some
basic information just to test things
maybe the title or something
so anyways whenever we're using this
video class we need to import
video from video all right so what did I
name that on select alright so on select
what we're going to do is this we need
to make a variable and I'll just name it
a I might as well just keep it V
actually let me name it bin so you guys
can see that it's actually different and
of course whenever you're working in
typescript you need to write what data
type it is so this of course is just the
type of video so there you go
and for this tutorial like I said
eventually what we're going to be doing
is we're going to be displaying the HTML
code but for now just so we can keep
things real simple and make sure that
this click event actually works is I'm
just going to print something out to the
console so console.log and jason
stringify that vid so all this does is
it takes whatever object
this is turns into a JSON string and it
just prints it out in the console so
this should work hopefully now we for
this to refresh and check it out and by
the way whenever it prints it out to the
console I'm not talking about this
console right here I'm talking about the
console in Chrome so if you want to open
that then you can either just open up
your developer tools or a shortcut if
you're using Windows is ctrl shift and J
so it'll pop open your console so now
let me just go ahead and click this row
and check it out all of the JSON
information prints out right there boom
boom boom boom looks like everything is
working beautifully
now again know whenever I click this
first one it is indeed displaying
information about that first video
whenever I click the second one it's
displaying information about the second
video so later on what we're going to do
is instead of just printing stuff out we
need to say hey actually pop up a video
right under here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
