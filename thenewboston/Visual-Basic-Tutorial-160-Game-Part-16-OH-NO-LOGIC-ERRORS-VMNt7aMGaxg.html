slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're gonna be
talking about a major logical error that
was in the previous tutorial now if you
remember for the enemy it's going to
access current enemy attacks at the
index of current enemy attack none now
you can see for each one the enemies we
have different attack array so we got
zombie attacks we've got villain attacks
and other stuff so what we need to do is
make all of these just attacks now you
can see that we're gonna get an error
because we already have attacks in our
enemy class now we can easily fix this
so since each of our villains only has
three attacks we can create public read
only attacks with three indexes as a
string and now for each one of those
indexes we're gonna have to add an
attack so attacks at index of zero it's
gonna be equal to eat brains
I don't know how I didn't notice this
you know in the last tutorial I guess I
didn't really look at the log very
closely when we were testing it so they
all said this one two claw and we'll do
attacks 2 is going to equal throw up
okay so now that we have the indexes in
our attacks what we need to do is make
that for each one of the classes I'll
pause and come back once that's finished
okay so now that that has finished you
can see that I've got the I've added the
items to the array in zombies dragon and
villain VB so now we can come into form
1 DB and let's see here we've got
attacks and then attack num and then
attack damage and you can see that we
made attack damage in the same way that
we did attacks now let's come back here
to enemy and we'll just take this out to
make sure that nothing bad happens so we
got public override herbal sub attack
and then you use your health so we can
do is we can just get rid of all of this
because we have overridden this sub in
each and every single one of our other
classes that inherit from enemy this
doesn't have to have anything in it it's
just there that so that we can use it so
let's say for example we have current
enemy of type enemy we wouldn't be able
to call current enemy attack if it
wasn't declared an enemy and because
it's over rideable and we've overridden
it in every single one of the classes
all we have to do is just leave an empty
sub in here
so it's there for us to use but it's
already overwritten so let's go ahead
and run this and hopefully we won't get
any errors and let's see here got event
logger
go ahead and shrink it down a little bit
so we can attack it says anchor throw
you can see that zombie has used claw
punch claw anchor throw eat brains for
10 damage anchor throw eat brains for
another 10 damage punch claw for 5 claw
for 5
and could throw for 15 another claw once
again we got eat brains kick and you can
see that Popeye has won so let's go
ahead and close out of this and we will
close out of that right there let's just
go ahead and make sure that everything
works fine so you see that we didn't get
any throw-ups here so let's see what
went wrong we need to make this with a
max value of 293 so that it will
generate 0 1 or 2 now let's just make
sure we've done that in each one of
these classes surprise I've never found
that error but we'll go into zombie
zombies fixed and we need to fix villain
here so apparently the whole time um it
hasn't been ever going to case 2 so now
that we've got all that sorted it out
let's go into form 1 now I know I might
get some comments from people not liking
that I'm getting errors and then I have
to fix them but other people especially
people from my channel that have washed
they said I like it when I find errors
and teach you guys ways to fix them and
how you can incorporate that in your own
programs okay so when the enemy attacks
if Popeye is lost let's go ahead and add
that to the log so new log dot add event
and we just want to say Popeye has lost
and just to make this more noticeable
we'll go ahead and do new log dot add
event and then we'll just separate this
from the rest of the stuff that is in
this log so copy this one more time you
can see that it's gonna say Popeyes lost
and it's gonna separate it from the rest
so we'll do that once again for button
attack and let's go ahead add that right
there and then new log dot add event and
then we'll add Popeye has one and then
we'll add this right here so going so
let's go ahead and run this you see that
here is our form 1 and our event lager
so let's go ahead and spawn a zombie so
go ahead and click attack says he use
anchor throw and then the zombie threw
up on me for a to damage you can attack
again anchor through it one more time
you can see that's logging everything
that's happening let's wait for Popeye
to win here
see it says Popeye has won and then down
here it adds an event to our log that
says Popeye has won so go ahead and
close out of that let's go ahead and fix
these logic errors that we have then
once you've done that and put all that
code in if you have any comments leave
them in the comment section and if not
go ahead and move on to the next
