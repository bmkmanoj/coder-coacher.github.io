tutorial what I want to do is I want to
show you guys one last piece of that
mysterious if statement and it's called
the else/if
kind of a combination of the other ones
because we know that the basic if
statement is good at testing one thing
now we know that the if-else statement
is good between choosing between two
decisions but what if we have more than
two decisions and an example of this is
of course let's say you own a t-shirt
shop like I said last time we're going
to have more sizes than just one or two
we're going to have like small medium
large extra-large so unless we wanted to
write just a bunch of if statement eight
but what is a statement statements which
can be kind of confusing we need a
better way of doing this so let me go
ahead and actually code a program right
now to explain this to you guys this is
actually pretty useful will say that arm
will make a program to give the user the
average of three test grades so of
course the grades that they have the
choose from is ABCD in F or e some
people have but we'll say float um grade
one and I'm going to copy all of these
float grade two and three so what the
user is going to do is we're going to
give them an area to enter three test
grades type it into the screen and we'll
store in floats so printf just tell me
what's going on enter your three test
grades and you might as well get my
little prompt take it to a newline scanf
and we don't need to give a prop for
everyone so for the scanf since it's a
flow of course we will use % F and
remember to add that space and this one
the first one they enter we can just go
ahead and store in grade 1
grade two and grade three so now we
basically have three numbers from them
and the only thing that we have to do
now is get the average so make a new
variable called flow average and of
course we know how to do this set this
equal to grade 1 plus grade 2 plus 3 and
once we have the sum of that go ahead
and throw over 3 and that is your
average so I guess the first thing we
should do is just print out their
average on the screen it says I'm too
lazy to type 5 little characters I
guarantee that copy and paste it takes
longer than if I was a just freaking
type it but oh well
don't feel like moving my fingers fat
little sausage fingers all right so %
point 2f in I don't know we'll just go
ahead and display to two decimal places
because why the heck not and of course
what are we doing we named it a V G so
right now we can actually run this
program and it should run fine unless I
mess something up and you're through you
test grades and we'll just make sure it
works by giving a nice easy average work
with 70 80 and 90 should be 80 average
all right so this works right now but
now what we want to do is we need to
take that average and print out a grade
for them something for the report card
ABCD or F so we need to test 5 different
criteria so the first thing we can do we
know how to do this let's go ahead and
work our way down from A to F so test if
average is greater or equal to 90 then
let's just go ahead and uhm do kick it
to new line already yep so printf will
just print I don't know something simple
like grade is a make sure you got your
semicolon now this is the part we were
running to where we would have some
trouble before because if we just wrote
else um I mean
we can okay that's kind of confusing
because we can't like a bunch of letters
to choose from so this is where the
tutorial comes in handy because we can
now use a new keyword called else/if now
what this is is basically another option
that it can choose from so it's first
going to test okay is your average
greater or equal to 90 if so just run
this code and boom your program is going
to go but what if it isn't well let's go
ahead and go to another option which is
this one and of course we need to give
this one a test because it's not just a
default so the test is of course would
just say okay well is it greater than 80
then and if so then we'll go ahead and
print out B and saying okay well what if
it's not even greater than 80 well this
can must be dumb so let's go ahead and
put it else if if greater equal to 70 do
see and almost look like it so you guys
get a stuck in your brain else if it's
not even greater than 70 then test if
their average is greater than 60 I don't
even know if this is the creating system
now but this case print out D now here's
the point where I want to take a break
and mention what's going on so basically
what's going to happen is our program is
going to test first if their grade is
above 90 if it is then it's going to go
ahead and skip the rest of this
statement because it only can choose one
of these options if it's like greater
than 70 it's not going to print out on C
B and a it only runs one of these things
once it finds the criteria or a test
that passes it only runs the one in that
block not everything else it no need to
test anything else so what we did is we
said 90 80 70 60 okay if none of those
are true
then we can go ahead and just add that
default statement because if none of
those are true then they must have
gotten an F their grade must be less
than 60 nothing else is possible in in
the world of math so print F and of
course instead of just writing grade F
we'll just go ahead and write something
like you are dumb because any kid have
got less than 60 on any pets
okay this is probably why I'm not a
teacher in school but it's a pretty
funny program so if you run this right
now everything looks good
says enter your three test grades and
let me just go ahead and put like 73
right now and I'll make sure that I have
like a well see what that is so my
average is seventy six point six seven
so what happened is it says okay that's
your average we stored it in this
variable right here so first I test it
if it was greater than ninety it wasn't
so I hopped down here I test it if it
was greater than 80 it wasn't tested if
it was greater than 70 it was so I
printed this out and I just skipped
everything else so no need to test this
or this because we already found our
answer and if there is any code like
down here then this is where it would
pick back up and start running again so
very simple and also what we can do just
for fun is run this program and for some
reason I just want it to print out what
if a kid got a twenty one then he
studied and he got a fifty six and then
he got a four hit enter his average 27
and it says you are dumb because he was
dumb simple enough so that is how you
make a very simple program and that is
also how you make one decision decide
between two things or decide between
unlimited options so now that we got
that taken care of I'm going to show you
guys some other sweet stuff you guys are
like becoming a pro in C programming so
thank guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
