it's the same thing as subtraction with
whole numbers except for now we have to
worry about the decimal and decimal
placement you can go right ahead and
bring down the decimal if that's easier
for you to remember so again we start in
the tenths place so 5 minus 7 we can do
that with the borrow from the 9 make
that an 8 put the fight one night there
15 minus 7 is 8 8 minus 4 is 4 and 8
minus 5 is 3 so we come over here we
have 7 minus 9 we can't do that so we
had to borrow from the ain't make that a
7 make that 17 and 17 minus 9 is 8 bring
down the decimal point very important 7
minus 2 is 5 over here we have 5 minus 9
we had to get rid of that make that a 0
make the 15 15 minus 9 is 6 0 minus 2
can't do that at the borrow and since
this is 0 we have nothing to borrow from
so we had to borrow from the 7 make that
as 6 make that a 10 but then again cross
at it again make it a 9 and make that a
10 we got to keep on borrowing it as far
as we can all the way down to where it's
needed so 10 minus 2 is 8 bring down the
decimal point 9 minus 8 is 1 and 6 minus
1 is 5
over here of 9-2 is seven eight - nine
weeds a borrow from the four make that a
three think that eighteen eighteen minus
nine is nine bring down the decimal
point three minus four we had to borrow
from way over to the six make that a
five this is going to be ten flipped
across that it again and make it a nine
make that it's hang cross it out make it
a nine and make that 13 13 minus 4 is 9
9 minus 3 is 6 9 minus 5 is 4 &amp;amp; 5 minus
1 is 4 and there's our answer over here
we have 7 minus 8 I have to go over it
to the to make that a 1 give it to the
10 cross it out make it a 9 give it 17
and that's going to be 9 9 minus 1 is 8
bring down the decimal point and 1 minus
0 is 1 so over here we can just add in a
little different points / tendance there
and add in a zero as a placeholder just
so you don't get confused so 0 minus 9
can't do that borrow from the 3 make it
it to make that a 10 10 minus 9 is 1
bring down the decimal point 2 minus 2
is 0 and bring down the 5 over here
we're going to put in 2 0 placement
holders i was 0 -7 with to come all the
way to the 5 make it a 4 make that a 10
cross it out make it a 9 and make that a
10 10 minus 7 is 3 9 minus 7
is 302 bring down the decimal point 4
minus 4 is 0 and bringing down a 3 so
over here we have to know our decimal
points just then I thought there's a
decimal point right there so we're going
to put in two imaginary decimal places
right over here just so you don't get
confused and there's a decimal point
right there so we have 0 minus 6 we have
to borrow all the way from this 8 make
it a 7 we can go right ahead and make
that annoying because we know it's going
to be 9 and make that a 10 10 minus 6 is
4 you have 9 minus 3 is 6
put the decimal point and then 7 minus 0
is 7 and 1 minus 0 is 1 because there's
nothing before the decimal point over
here we have 5 minus 9 it's a borrow
from the 1 make it a zero make that a 15
15 minus 9 is 6 0 - 9 we hit the bar
from the ain't make that a 7 make that
at 10 so 10 minus 9 is 1 where the
decimal points add that in and then 7
minus 2 is 5 now over here we have only
one decimal place and then now we have
two decimal points so we need to add an
imaginary 0 so 0 minus 8 with the borrow
from the 5 make it a 4 make that a 10 10
minus 8 is 2 4 minus 0 is 4 but the
decimal point we have 7 minus 4 to
borrow from the 8 make that a 7 make
that a 9 when you can make that a 12 so
12 minus 4 is
eight 9 minus 6 is 3 &amp;amp; 7 minus 3 is 4
there we go
and that's all I have for subtraction
with decimals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
