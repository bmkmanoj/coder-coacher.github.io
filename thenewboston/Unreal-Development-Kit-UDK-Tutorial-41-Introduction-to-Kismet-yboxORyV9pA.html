41st udk tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be introducing something to
you guys called a kismet now what kismet
is is it's basically you decays visual
programming so what that means is well
right now whenever we were playing our
levels our user could pretty much just
run around and shoot his gun and that's
pretty much it not very exciting pretty
boring if you ask me so in order to make
this game more interactive we want to
allow the user to do other things like
open doors and turn on light switches
and ride elevators and we just want to
be able to interact with the environment
other than you know just running around
a shooting his gun into the air so in
order to do this in order to give our
player the functionality to accomplish
all these things we need to use
something called kismet now first and
foremost you guys are probably looking
around all right kismet kismet kismet
where are you what the heck does this
kismet thing look like well in order to
open the kismet window you go up here
and right next to your content browser
you can see this little K with an arrow
poking out of it and it says open unreal
kismet so if we go ahead and click that
then this is our kismet window and again
we're not just ready to step into this
window right now I just want to show you
guys how to access kismet and it is
indeed a thing I'm not lying about it so
we'll get into this when it's time but
for right now what I'm going to be doing
is in these upcoming tutorials I'm just
going to build a really simple example
for you guys i'm just going to be making
a simple switch that our player can turn
on and off and when he does it turns a
light bulb on and off so again i just
want to show you guys a real quick
example of how you can make a level and
use kismet to give the user something to
interact with and later on i'm going to
be building some more complex
functionality using kismet so for right
now like i said we need a very simple
level so i'm just going to go ahead and
right click on my brush and this can
change this to 2048
and 2048 and i'll leave my Z at 32 and
build and in my perspective view if I
hit be my builder brush will come back
up and I just want to add some mass to
my level and hit be again hide my
builder brush so again all I'm building
is a very flat level somewhere for my
player to run around on so right after
this since we want to play this level
I'm just going to go ahead and add a
light now what I'm going to be doing is
I'm going to hold down l and left click
and I'm going to add a light in this
corner of the room and the reason let me
just scroll out here let me position my
light so it lights up about half of the
room right here now what am I going to
be building is a system where there's a
light switch in the middle and whenever
the user clicks it a light bulb lights
up the other half of the room so make
sure that you don't have this light bulb
cover the entire room or else you're not
going to be able to tell when the other
let you is on or off so that's why I
built this to cover only half of the
room so now what I want to do is I want
to add a static mesh right over here
remember whenever I was teaching you
guys about static meshes and I told you
guys that what you do is you add a light
static mesh and then you add an actual
game light on top of it just to simulate
a light coming from that static mesh
well that's what I'm going to be doing
again so I'm going to be going in my
content browser and clear everything out
all assets X and clear and just go ahead
and look for light again and make sure
you're looking in static meshes and now
when you find one you like I'm just
going to use that same light from last
time work that pretty good that time
right here what i can do is drag this
out right on my screen in my perspective
view and there I go so what I'm going to
be doing first and foremost is bumping
up the scale to three times it's normal
size and then I'm just going to be
dragging it up and dragging it over in
the corner somewhere so if we look in my
perspective view we can see that indeed
this light
is in the corner right there but there's
no light coming from it so what I'm
going to be doing eventually is adding
one of these game lights right next to
the slice so then whenever we turn this
game light on and off it's going to look
like this light is turning on and off a
pretty cool trick huh kind of to a trick
my viewers so that's what I'm going to
be doing in the upcoming sorrows I
actually don't know how long this
tutorial was because I forgot to look at
this camera I mean excuse me this clock
before but I guess that that's what
we're going to be doing in the upcoming
or oh so that's what you guys have to
look forward to but for now that's all
you guys get so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
