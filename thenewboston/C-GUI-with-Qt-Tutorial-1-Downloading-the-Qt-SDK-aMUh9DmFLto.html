Robertson welcome to your very first C++
GUI with cute tutorial now what Q is
spelled QT actually some people even
call it QT the correct way I don't know
I usually just call it Q but it's a
framework that allows you to develop C++
GUI applications so in these tutorials
that's what I'm going to do I'm going to
be teaching you guys how to make
applications with the drop-down lists
and menu sliders buttons labels all that
good stuff so before we get started I
just want to mention this in order to
watch these tutorials and actually
understand what's going on you first
need to have a very basic understanding
of C++ you don't need to be a super
advanced professional programmer with a
master's degree but if you don't have a
very basic concept of you know what a
function is or you know variables are go
ahead and watch tutorials actually I
have tutorials on my website the New
Boston org I'll put a link below watch
those and once you're done with those
you'll be good to go so now that you're
ready to jump into C++ GUI development
the first thing we need to do is we need
to download the cute SDK so let's go
ahead and do that go ahead and go to the
Internet hopefully you have Google
Chrome and type in QT and hit enter now
the very first link that should pop up
is this one QT it's it should probably
say something about Nokia in the link
because that's who develops this
framework but what we're interested in
is this thing the Downloads link right
here so go ahead and click the Downloads
link and that gives you all of the
different frameworks that you can
download depending on your operating
system so depending on what operating
system you have of course if you have
windows download these Linux or a Mac
however we have two choices for each one
one is an online installer and the other
is an offline installer what you want to
choose is the on line installer so go
ahead and click that and you're going to
download an executable file and once you
double-click that file
I'm not going to do it because it
actually takes a long time depending on
like over half an hour depending
on how fast your internet is and plus I
already have it downloaded so of course
don't want to download it again but
anyways it's really simple to download
all you do is you run a wizard keep all
the default values just click Next Next
Next
I agree I agree so on and so forth so of
course you already guys you guys already
know how to download crap but once you
have it downloaded it's going to install
the cute SDK now once you have that
installed you're going to have something
in your programs called this cue SDK now
this is the entire kit for development
but where we're going to be writing all
our stuff is in this thing right here
the cute Creator so just to make things
a little bit easier go ahead and
right-click that and press send to
desktop and once you do that is going to
create a shortcut on your desktop right
like that so just to make sure that we
have everything installed properly and
working go ahead and double click this
and if everything is good then you
should get something that looks like
this now what this is is the cute
creator where we can write all of our
code look at our GUI run our program
this is pretty much where we're going to
be spending 99% of our time and in the
upcoming tutorials I'm going to be
teaching you guys all about the
different parts of this how to create
different applications how to you know
create a cool user interface pretty much
how to create a sweet C++ GUI program
but just for now I'm going to show you
guys how to start a simple project just
so we know that we have everything
working correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
