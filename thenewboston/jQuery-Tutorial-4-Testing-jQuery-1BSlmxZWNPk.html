with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in the last video we looked at including
jQuery
into our page however we don't actually
know whether we have this functionality
available now if we save this page and
go over to our browser you'll see that
we don't get any errors now this doesn't
necessarily mean that jQuery hasn't has
has or has not been included into our
page it's different to other languages
because it's just a script file so we're
not sure yet if jQuery is actually
working this script tag will not return
an error if this source is not found so
it's extremely important that we just
create a quick test to see if jQuery is
working or not so don't worry if you
don't understand the code I'm using just
yet but if you are following following
along with this tutorial and you've
included jQuery using this line this
line that I'm just about to write will
just add some clarification whether to
whether as to if we are actually having
clue the jQuery properly so I'm going to
go ahead and create some paragraph tags
and inside I'm going to write some text
so this is some text or this is a
paragraph would be more appropriate now
the P will take other attributes such as
on click on mouse over and we can use
standard JavaScript to then call the
jQuery library or functions from the
jQuery library so let's go ahead and say
P on click now in normal JavaScript we
could do something like alert or in
broad JavaScript we could do something
like alert works and when we click this
text inside of this paragraph we will be
produced with an alert box to say works
so let's go ahead and test this first of
all here's my paragraph and if I click
it you can see that I get an alert box
up saying it works so JavaScript itself
is obviously working because this is
automatically available to us however we
need to go ahead and chest jQuery so
let's go ahead and write $8 inside of
this dollar I'm going to write this
inside of these parentheses next to this
dollar I'm going to write this and then
I'm going to say dot hide and then
brackets and then a semicolon to end
this line so essentially what we're
doing is hiding using the hide function
and this which refers to the current
element which is our paragraph element
so this is jQuery code and this hide
functionality is a function of jQuery so
now if this works when we click on the
paragraph this paragraph should be
hidden
we'll know that jQuery is actually
working so let's go ahead to our browser
and refresh the page here's the
paragraph when I click it you'll see
that the paragraph disappears so we now
know that jQuery has been successfully
included into our page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
