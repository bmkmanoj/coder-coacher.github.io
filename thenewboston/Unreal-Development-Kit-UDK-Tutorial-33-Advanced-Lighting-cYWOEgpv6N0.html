tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be talking to you guys about lighting
to be honest I'm probably going to be
talking to you guys about lighting for
like the next four or five tutorials
because there is a ton of stuff to cover
so if you're just sitting there saying
you know what Bucky I already know
everything there is to know about
lighting just go ahead and hold l on
your keyboard click and bam all there is
to know about lighting we got a light on
our level well believe it or not there's
actually a lot more that goes into
lighting that we can choose some awesome
effects it can pretty much take our
levels to the next level probably
shouldn't use a level two times in one
sentence it could take our maps to the
next level there we go when we learn to
use lighting properly so in this
tutorial I'm going to be doing is
showing you an alternative way to add
lights and taking you through some of
the more common interfaces and windows
whenever you're working with lights so
I'm not going to be teaching you a whole
lot of new stuff in this story i just
want to show you around the lighting
world so to speak so I already tell you
guys one way in our last tutorials how
to add light steer maps and that's of
course hotel on your keyboard and click
and you got a light but this is pretty
much like a work light like say you were
working in a garage or something and you
just needed anything to light up you
know a dark area you're like hey dude
give me a light and whatever he shine
you know whether it's a flashlight or
light bulb or lighter any way that you
can light up that dark spot it's fine
and that's basically what we're doing
here we're basically throwing work
lights up but whenever we build our
level we want something a little more
advanced that we have a lot more control
over so typically how I'm going to be
adding lights is this actually before I
even do that here's my little nice
sample room I made but it's looking kind
of bland so I'm just going to go ahead
and add a pillar real quick drag that
out right there and let me make sure in
my top view it's somewhere around and
the reason I'm doing this is whenever I
add a light it's going to cast a shadow
and I want it you know something to cast
a shadow rather than just walls so
that's why you needed to add something
to your level
so now that you got your level with
something in it in this case a pillar
i'm going to show you guys the more
common way that i like to add lights and
that's go ahead and in your perspective
view right click anywhere on the screen
and from here click Add actor and add a
point light or a delight parenthesis
point and from here it's basically same
as before it adds a light to your scene
so go ahead and the first thing you're
going to notice is this as soon as you
add a light to your scene it changes
from unlit mode to lit mode and that's
because udk realizes that now that you
have a light you probably want to you
know be able to see what's going on with
it so the first thing you probably
wanted to do is move it around a little
bit using your translation tool
translation mode this is called the
translation tool I'm just going to call
it the move tool and you see that the
shadow kind of changes depending on how
you move the light you know as you could
expect so let me go ahead and do this
first and foremost notice how the shadow
is right now is kind of crisp and
whenever you move your light you can
really easily see how your shadows
moving but keep your eyes on the shadow
right here and I'm going to go ahead and
build this all and it's going to build
in again keep your eyes on this shadow
right here because I want you guys to
notice what's going on you see how it
kind of went from real crisp and really
easy to see what was gone on to kind of
like fuzzy kind of give you a more
realistic looking light this realistic
looking light is called a shadow map and
I just want to I'm not going to be
talking about shadow maps in this story
I just want to point out that there is a
difference between this shadow and the
fuzzy shadow and that's and we're going
to be talking about that later so if
your shadows look different than me
right now don't worry about it you're
going to understand later on so anyways
the other thing I want to talk to you
guys about is the light properties trust
me there is a lot more properties to
this light then whether it's on or off
so in order to access the properties
just go ahead and select your light in
hit f4 and check it out look at all of
these properties just for light I mean
we get that in
and this is only like one tab we get
movement display look at all this crap
you guys are thinking that you know
whenever you put a light in your room or
hang them up for your Christmas lights
that there's on and off and that's it
well in the UDK it gives you about six
million options and we're actually going
to be understanding what all these
options mean but for now I just want to
show you guys through the lighting
properties window and give you guys a
real quick tour of some of the most
basic properties oh you have not
registered your rubber your project this
is injured let me just register it's now
right in the middle my freaking tutorial
yeah I'll see you later rubber oh I
don't care if my computer is vulnerable
so anyways go ahead and you're probably
going to be looking at this most go
ahead and expand light the light
component and then light component and
gun you think they don't name this tab
different than this tab but they don't
some of the more common and easy to
understand properties are like the
brightness which is by default one but
go ahead and slide that up and you can
see that it gets brighter obviously the
light color if you want to change the
overall color if you're like to let
green or something and of course if it
cast shadows or not that's one of the
more common ones if you uncheck that
check out out my shadow is gone we do
want that to cast shadows so these are
just a bunch of different properties
that you can change to kind of alter
their way your light behaves so I'm not
going to be talking about all these
right now because well it's going to
take me like five days first of all and
this is tutorials just introduction
lights I just want to show you guys that
there are indeed a lot more light
properties than just on and off so with
that being said what what else do I
wanted to go over well probably the only
other thing I want to go over in this
tutorial is this and i'll leave that
light green well green looks good enough
for now so the only other thing i want
to go over is a nice little tip i want
to give you actually this is kind of
bugging me so
if I can go ahead and change that back
to white and hit okay it might be easier
to see what I'm about to tell you guys
whenever you're working with lights you
have these little icons right here and I
just move that back wow I'm a fool Bucky
full so let's go ahead and put that back
and hit f4 again whenever you're working
with lights you have these icons right
here now what I like to do is I actually
like to change the size of the icon
depending on how big the light is for
example if I'm like lighting up a road
or a pathway and I have little kind of
like night lights going on along the
sides of it or nice of the little lights
I like to make the icon smaller whenever
I have a big light to like symbolize
headlights or a big lamp in the room I
like to make the icon bigger it just
gives me an idea of it just makes it
visually easy to understand because when
you have a lot of lights it's hard to
imagine what lights are affecting the
scene in different ways so in order to
make this icon bigger or smaller go
ahead to the display tab and go ahead to
draw scale and now if you scroll this up
and down you can see that your icon
either shrinks or gross again all this
does is change how it visually looks it
doesn't change the properties of your
light any it just lets the program or
see either a small icon or big icon in
another reason that you might want to
change the size is because maybe you
have a model of a lamp and you want to
fit this icon inside it so it can't be
like that big or else look what happens
when I try to move it in the lamp it's
not going to work out so you might want
to you know make it small so you can fit
inside a model or something but that's
another property that i use a whole
bunch and if you guys play around with
this you'll probably find that you're
using it a bunch too but for now I'm am
obviously running out of time so in the
next tutorial what I'm going to be doing
is I'm going to be showing you guys some
real cool effects that you can achieve
with lights and also probably talking
about some of those properties but for
now that's all you guys get so thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
