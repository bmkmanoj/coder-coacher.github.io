to talk to you about nesting now nesting
is a technique that allows you to write
CSS properties inside other CSS
properties and it sounds confusing but
it's actually not it's actually really
intuitive and we're going to see in just
a second why exactly that is useful so
in this example I deleted my old awesome
website and we're going to be building a
simple navigation menu I figured we
might as well build something on that
looks halfway decent so let me just go
ahead and start doing that and I'm gonna
stick everything inside nav tags and I'm
just going to make all of my menu items
list items so for the first one I'll
just make it a dead link I won't
actually have it linking to anything and
this first page can be home and let me
just copy this two more times so we're
going to have three buttons on here and
these won't actually be pages this would
just be a template for a menu so say
home bacon and tuna so this would be
something like your about page meat of
the team page contact page whatever you
want but this is our plain structure and
right now this is what our navigation
menu looks like pretty awful so let's go
ahead and spice this bad boy up so I
deleted all my other sass from the last
tutorial and I'm actually going to be
using the one technique that we learned
already which is variables so I'm going
to use BG color for the background color
and one of my favorite colors is to c350
why is this not typing to c350 and my
freaking keyboard is not connected are
you kidding me oh my god alright and
we're back for my short commercial break
I actually only had two double-a
batteries left in my entire house so
lucky me
re we're
in the middle of a color so e-50 and the
cool thing I like about webstorm is it
actually gives you a preview of your
color right there so you can click and
change it if you want but I'm also going
to have two other colors one is the
color whenever I hover over it so I'm
going to name a hover color and one my
other favorite colors is 1/6 and the
last variable that I'm going to use is
just text color and the text color is
just going to be white so the text color
so the color for white is ffffff alright
so what we're going to do is this we're
going to style the elements inside our
navigation menu now before whenever just
writing basic plain ol CSS each property
went on its own separate little section
but what I want to do is I kind of want
to write this so it's more intuitive
whenever I'm designing it so I'm
actually going to style the overall
navigation menu first now inside here is
where I typically write all my
properties and then underneath it
go on to the next thing but what I want
to do is I only want to style this item
right here so I may have a bunch of
other unordered list and list items and
also links on my website but I only want
to style these ones if they're inside
the navigation menu so instead of adding
each different chunk in heaven and get
all jumbled together you can actually
write other properties right inside here
now whenever we write this what we're
saying is the styles that we're going to
be writing right here only apply them if
they're inside your navigation so we can
do something like this
background and we'll just include
background color right here so what
we're saying is for the unordered list
background color only apply this
background to unordered list if it's
inside the navigation menu if there are
any other unordered lists anywhere else
then they're just going to have the
default styling and this is a lot more
intuitive way of looking at it because
you're basically designing your CSS how
your brain is looking at it and how it
resembles your HTML code so it's pretty
sweet now I'm also going to set the
margin to zero and I swear I freakin
hate max padding I'm not used to him at
all I just thought it would be good
since everyone you know what designs on
a Mac might as well use my Mac for this
tutorial and list-style to none alright
so that's all we wanted to do for the
overall unordered list which is our main
entire menu now another thing I want to
do is for the individual buttons which
are the list items I'm just going to hit
display:inline-block I believe they're
blocked by default which means they
would stack on top of each other
but if we set those to an inline block
then it'll be good for like the top
navigation where you want everything
side-by-side and let me get myself a
little bit more room so I can I like
being able to scroll a little bit all
right now the last thing I want to do
actually not the last thing but one of
the last thing is style those links now
for the links the color I just want to
have text color so I want to make sure
that the menu buttons have a white font
and I also want to display these as
inline blocks and for the padding right
now they're bunch up against each other
and this is great if you're just making
a regular list but whenever you're
making a navigation menu usually want to
give us some kind of padding so they
look like buttons and not just you know
text bunched up against each other so
for the top and bottom padding I'm going
to have 10 pixels from left to right
I'll have 16 that's a shorthand version
of the
and also for text-decoration I'm just
going to put none and this is going to
make it so there are no like bullet
points or any weird symbols next to my
list items so for the last thing I'm
going to have a property whenever I
hover over these buttons and all I'm
going to do whenever I hover over them
is change the background color so by
default the background is BG color and I
just want to set it to hover color so
I'll copy this paste it in there and
boom look at that
now look how this compiles hmm that kind
of looks like a mess just looking at it
now if you didn't even you know aren't
familiar with CSS at all or web design
what's more intuitive to look at this we
see okay you're pretty much reading it
says this stuff is inside this or all of
this I mean I've been doing web design
for a long time and even still I would
have to go to rely on my line back okay
this is all part of the navigation menu
and okay that's a mess this is just you
know it just feels more comfortable so
now whenever i refresh this check it out
how awesome is that boom boom boom and
if we ever want to do something like
change the hover color of these then we
can easily do that
see hover color is like zero zero nine
nine zero zero it's kind of a weird
stupid color but I just want to show you
guys that once it compiles it gets
updated all right here and if i refresh
my page we now got a new background
color so there you go that is nesting
essentially all it is is the ability to
write properties inside other properties
and it's a really cool new and intuitive
way to style child elements so yeah
thank you guys for watching don't forget
