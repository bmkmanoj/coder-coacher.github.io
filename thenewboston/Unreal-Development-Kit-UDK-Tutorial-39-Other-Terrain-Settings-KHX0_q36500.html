39th udk tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be going over all the rest
of these settings and buttons and
brushes and we already went over the
tools in the last tutorial so in this
tutorial I just want to give you guys a
better feeling of what all these other
options do and I just want to make you
guys a little more comfortable with a
turian editing window again I'm not
going to be going over every little
detail or else oh just take forever but
like I said I just want to get you guys
a little more comfortable with a terrain
editing window so I'm just going to go
ahead and start at the top and work my
way down so the very first check box is
actually a check box that I don't use
that often and I don't recommend that
you guys use that often but basically
the / tool check box is you can apply a
strength setting to each individually
currently select the tool and that way
you can have like customized shrink
settings on each tool but like I said I
really don't like to use it that often
so just go ahead and leave it off by
default now the soft select is if you
notice the soft slug probably is grayed
out by default and that's because you
can only use the soft select with this
paint vertex tool so by default remember
whenever we painted a vertex it goes
ahead and it selects all the vertexes
kind of evenly however if you go ahead
and deselect those by control right
dragon if we have soft select and we
select vertex you notice that as it
moves outward they kind of get grey and
darker grey and that's because it
selects the inner once more harshly than
it does the outer ones so that way
whenever we hold control drag and drag
that up you guys can see instead of
making a nice steep plateau it kind of
has more gradient to it that it kind of
gives you a more rolling hill rather
than a nice steep edge so basically
whenever you're looking for harsh edges
go ahead and select this off whenever
you're making nice rolling hills you
usually want to use soft select so it
kind of fades out on the edges so the
other tool constrained don't worry about
this constraint on right now it's kind
of confusing and I don't use it that
often so don't worry
constraint the angle however I do want
to go over now by default angle is
grayed out and by the way anything
anytime anything is gray down in the UK
it basically means you have the wrong
tool selected for the job so this angle
tool you can only use with this flatten
tool right here so what this does is let
me go ahead and bring everything down
you know how before when I told you guys
that what the flatten tool does is if
you go ahead and paint it takes the rest
of the terrain and it brings it up to
that level well as you can see whenever
it does bring it up to that level it
creates a nice flat surface for the user
to walk on so you know it's nice and
even flat plane however you can select
angle right here and let me go ahead and
bring all this down and now what it does
is whenever you paint it allows you to
paint at an angle so it's not giving you
that nice flat surface anymore it's
creating more of an angle so um as you
can see right here where I painted well
that's basically what it does it allows
you to flatten your map at angles so
this is useful whenever you're trying to
create you know more texture on your
mountain or something and you don't want
to make you know a nice flat or else oh
look unnatural so that's all I have to
say about that as forest gump would say
now this height right here remember when
I told you guys that whenever you're
using the flatten tool that it takes the
terrain and whenever you first click it
brings the terrain up to that height so
basically it's bringing all the terrain
up to the height where I first click on
this mountain and if I were to click
down here it would bring all the terrain
down to that level well with height you
can go ahead and give it an explicit
height such as while I'm not even going
to show you guys but it basically gives
you a fixed height instead of you know
having where you first click so well
that's all I got to say about that you
can explicitly input the height rather
than just having a guess where you first
click so I really don't use that one
this much either but i guess i would
show you guys what it means so the
mirror tool what this does it gives you
basically two brushes and it allows you
to mere
along an axis so let me go ahead and
edit along like the y-axis and now as
you can see if I select my paint tool
let me go ahead and give you guys a
better view now what i can do is i can
hold ctrl and paint actually let me
boost my shrink up and as you can see
instead of having one brush it's going
to mirror this along the y axis and this
is good for if you want to make a map
and you want both sides to be exactly
the same or exactly symmetrical then you
want to use this along mirroring one
axis and it's going to apply the same
settings to each different side but
generally you're going to want to select
none so you just have a single brush
that you can work with so that's
basically all the settings now the rest
of these view settings these are pretty
much for your visual preference or some
other things I would just go over them
real quick the terrain we only have one
terrain object so it's kind of hard to
demonstrate but whenever we have more
than one terrain object we can select
that object and then only that object is
editable now the properties window if
you go ahead and select that you can see
that just like lighting your terrain has
properties too so we're going to be
going over these properties in upcoming
tutorial but for now I just want to show
you guys that you're trained just like
lighting has properties to now the view
is pretty self-explanatory if you
uncheck that you can't see the terrain
it's pretty much a few and don't view
your terrain now this lock right here is
a little bit different whenever you have
the lock selected and you try to edit
your terrain you can this pretty much
means lock editing so if you know you
have your turn set up exactly how you
want and you don't want to mess with it
make sure you lock it so you can't
accidentally move anything around now
this toggle wireframe on and off let me
change my view a little bit this toggle
while your frame on and off just
basically shows or hides your wire frame
so some people actually like working in
this mode they think it's easier to see
everything so you know this is just a
personal preference whatever you have on
and off now the wireframe color is just
that you can go ahead and change the
color to you know purple or something
and there goes purple I kind of like it
that nice Hugh blue so I'm going to
leave it at that now the Sri cash
terrain materials is basically think of
it as like rebuilding your brushes
whenever you make changes in they aren't
visible go ahead and try recasting your
terrain materials and then it's going to
make all your changes visible again so
it pretty much means rebuild your
terrain for the most part now this
importing and exporting again remember I
told you guys that we have like hype
maps that we can make in Photoshop that
are basically just grey scales where
white shows your terrain where to lift
up and black shows your train where to
press down we can go ahead and import
them from other programs here so we're
going to be doing that and you know
probably in like a hundred soils but for
now we're just going to stick with the
basics that's how you do it also if
you're working with a team and you
either want to import one of their maps
for your level or you just made a
terrain and you want to export it to you
know your manager so he can put all the
pieces together this is where you would
do it so anytime you want to import
height maps or alpha maps or entire
terrains or export your entire train
this is where you do it now the brushes
as you can see you can have flat big
brushes by defaults or you know I'm not
even going to explain you guys you can
see this visually a lot better than I
could ever explain it however I will
move on to this section right here and
this is tessellation now just think of
tessellation is another word for detail
you can go ahead and press increase
right here to increase the detail of
your map and add more polygons however I
just want to point out this the more
detail you add to your map the longer
it's going to take the process and
render in so don't just have the most
detailed map you can because it's going
to look better however it's going to
take longer to load whenever you're
playing your game so if you go ahead and
decrease that it goes ahead and
decreases the detail again if you
decrease it a lot then you're going to
use lose a lot of your texture and it's
going to look like a game from like the
1900s so by default
the tessellation it gives you by default
is pretty good i usually like to bump it
up one because i like high quality games
so I like the tessellation right about
there so the last thing I want to talk
to you guys about is this layers panel
right here and all these buttons under
here are basically just shortcuts for
anything you can do by right-clicking in
the layers panel so what we're going to
be doing is in the upcoming sauros i'm
going to show you guys how to add new
layers like a layer of trees and bushes
and i'm going to be like adding a new
dekha layer which is that's called but
for now i'm going to be kind of chipping
away at this as we go along so I don't
want to throw everything at you right
now or just going to confuse you guys we
just remember this layers panel is
basically everything in the UDK terrain
is built using layers and this is where
you edit all that stuff so now hopefully
you guys have a little better
understanding of the terrain editing
window and what all these buttons do
again we're basically going to be using
these buttons as needed but I wanted to
give you guys a quick overview to get
you guys a little more comfortable with
interface so thank you guys for watching
and don't forget to subscribe and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
