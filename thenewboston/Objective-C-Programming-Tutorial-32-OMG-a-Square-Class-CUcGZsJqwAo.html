happened in the last couple toriel's we
just built this awesome
program named rectangle pretty much
that's what I named it at least and say
we built this fabulous program and it's
running fine is good to go and selling
it to our software company making money
but suddenly our boss comes in and he's
like dude you know that awesome program
you wrote about rectangles that took you
eight hours
well we actually need to make one about
squares instead and I'm like are you
kidding me
so uh you know I start freaking out and
uh getting upset and but then you see I
remember what they told me in those
anger management videos that my mom got
me and we start to breathe a little bit
we start to realize you know what
all the square is is pretty much a
special kind of rectangle so instead of
having to write a whole new class and
having to write all of these methods the
same write over again plus a couple
special ones for square wouldn't it be
cool if we could just type a couple
words and automatically inherit all of
these methods yeah you see where I'm
going with this yeah I think so so what
we need to do is we're gonna cheat a
little bit instead of manually typing
all the methods for square we're just
going to copy all of them from the
rectangle class and then add a couple of
our own so what we need to do is on our
source right click it and click add new
file and all your defaults look good
right there objective-c class click Next
and go ahead and create a new square
class and on don't name it squash I'll
get it eventually trust me and right
there
also create square dot H and finish it
so now we have two new classes square H
and square M so go ahead and click on
your source right here then you can see
all your files at once that's what I
like to do
and now first thing we need to do get
rid of all these dumb comments because
they know I mean we don't need an income
we make the comments around here you got
it and also we don't want to import koko
h what we want to do is we want to
import rectangle and we want to import
that you want to import whatever you
want to copy for him pretty much so
that's what we're gonna do
and now first of all get rid of these
semicolons it gives a said just delete
it everything but in it so our class
interface is named square and instead of
inheriting from nsobject which rectangle
inherited from we want to inherit
straight from rectangle so therefore
we're not only inheriting from nsobject
we're inheriting from a rectangle as
well so what happens when we do this and
inherit from rectangle well let me go
ahead and click on let's see square
rectangle H and see what it gave us all
we did is type that one little word and
herefrom rectangle and we already have a
width a height variable we already have
methods to figure out the area perimeter
and set width and height so instead of
coding all this right here all that crap
all we had to do is type this and it
automatically gave us all those methods
and variables for free so that's all
right that's pretty cool but you see a
square is it Ted bit different than a
rectangle so we need to tweak it just a
little bit and by twiki I mean add just
a couple methods of around because you
know it's a square not a rectangle can't
you know just copy everything that'll be
boring so let's go ahead and make one
method void and set aside because you
see and let's go ahead and pass it one
variable in s because we're just making
this easier for us a square has four
equal sides so unlike a rectangle which
had two equal sides we only have to pass
it one side and it can count for all
four you get what I'm saying
so we have s set aside and that will set
all four sides we couldn't do that with
a rectangle before because the four
sides weren't equal and we also want to
make a method that all it does is return
side what we just did pretty much what
we've just created so let's see we got
everything set right there now we can go
over to square M actually might want to
copy those for later for the headers so
now in square M a get rid of all this in
poor square H of course implementation
square because we're working in the
square class and we also have to put
rectangle right here to let us know
we're inheriting from rectangle so now
go ahead and copy your method headers
and you can go ahead and create I mean
begin and creating the bodies so for set
side how can we make this easier
well we already are going to pass it in
a side s and we'll say we'll make this
six or something well we can either
write a new method to calculate the side
or don't forget that we already have
this set width and height method right
here so what exactly are we going to do
to set the side well all I need to do is
call that method and now you're thinking
re Bucky I know how to call methods from
other classes and other objects but I
mean this is a method that's inside our
own class so how can we use that method
because don't forget only rectangle has
this class or excuse me this method set
width and height but square inherited it
so square has it too so it's its own
method that we want to use so anytime
you want to use your own method what you
need to do is type and this is a keyword
I'm not making this up self and what
self means is this object that we're
currently working on has a method that
we want to use so what method is it
it's set width and height and what we're
gonna do is for the width we're gonna
pass s which is going to be six and for
the height we're gonna pass a s and why
does you pat why do you pass it s twice
because a square has four equal sides so
this counts as the width and height
again you couldn't do this with a
rectangle because s could be different
and most likely is but for a square it's
always the same so that looks good right
here and for inside all you have to do
is return with I mean you could do
return height I mean it's a square
they're both the same either one it
doesn't really matter so now that we
have our implementation let's see make
sure I got everything imported that good
to go we are ready to move on to Bucky
class and the first thing I want to do
is instead an important rectangle know
we are important square right here look
at two H's pop up all the things those
pop-ups are annoying but uh yeah I'm
actually running out of time for this
tutorial but in the next tutorial I'm
going to be building our object and
we're gonna be using our new and
improved square class instead of the
rectangle class and I'm gonna be walking
you guys through everything and one last
time show you the beauty of inheritance
so thank you guys for watching if you
want any of this source code to lazy to
type it yourself go ahead click on the
link at the bottom I'll put a link to my
forum and all of its gonna be there free
for you guys so thanks for watching and
don't forget subscribe don't forget to
check out the forum and I'll see you
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
