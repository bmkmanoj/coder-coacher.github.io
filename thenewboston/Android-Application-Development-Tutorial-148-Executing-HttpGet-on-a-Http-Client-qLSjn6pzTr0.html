tutorial for the new boss in where
hopefully we'll finish this get method
example class which is again going to
just process some information from the
Internet via this HTTP client that we
set up so the first thing that we need
to do is we need to set up a URI which
is basically going to be your website
that we're referring to to get some data
so we're just going to create a URI and
we're just going to call this website
something like that
we're going to set this equal to a new
URI and then we give the website we want
to interpret the data from so HTTP
forward slash forward slash wwm I bring
back comm and that's our website that
we're going to use and again you have to
add your imports so we can use the URI
and now what we want to do is we want to
set up basically the method that we want
to use through our client and since this
is an example for get get information
we're going to use HTTP GET to process
that data or get the information from
that website so we're going to set up a
variable or instance of the class HTTP
GET we're going to call this our request
we're going to do we're going to set
this equal to again just a new HTTP GET
method and then or instance of this
class import and then what we can do is
we can say our request dot set URI and
then we're going to refer to our URI
that we just set up which we call their
website and now we're going to use the
get method with the set URI again just
from my bring back calm now what we're
going to do is we're going to set up
basically the information that we're
getting from the website and that's
going to be a response so we're going to
set up HTTP response we're going to call
this just response as well or read that
response and basically this is the most
important method to make everything
happen it's an execute method on our
client so we're going to say our
variable
HTTP variable which we call the client
and then we're just going to say dot
execute as you can see it takes within
its parameters basically a get method
which we called you know request and
again we set up our website connected to
our request or get method and that's
what we're going to actually request so
we're just going to say request like
that and then add our imports again and
everything's good to go so now that
we've set up our method to kind of
achieve some of that data we want to
make it readable or we need to convert
it into a string and that's what we set
up this bufferedreader that's going to
allow us to read some of the information
that we're getting so we're going to set
our bufferedreader which we called I n
is equal to a new bufferedreader and it
takes within its parameters an input
stream so we're going to create a new
input stream reader and within its
parameters we're just going to get our
response that we sent out so we're going
to say our response and then we can get
entity and that's just going to open up
the the entity of the response if there
is one and then we're also going to say
get the content after we open up the
entity and there we go we've set up our
bufferedreader and again we just import
our input stream reader as well it looks
like we're probably gonna run out of
time for this tutorial so if right
probably one more tutorial before we
finish up this method thought we could
get it done but it might it's taking a
little bit too long let's just talk over
everything that we've done again we set
up a bufferedreader to be null and a
string which is our actual return data
to be null we haven't gotten to that yet
but then what we do is we set up an HTTP
client which is just going to be kind of
the default client we set up a website
that we want to process some information
from and we set up some sort of request
or some sort of method and since we're
just trying to get the data we're going
to use the HTTP GET there's also a put
there's also like a post method that you
can
but right now we're just working with
the get method then once we set up a
request which again is just our get
method we're going to set the URI to our
website and then we're going to try and
execute everything so we're going to
refer to our client and we're going to
execute the request that we set up and
then we need some way to read it so
we're going to set up a bufferedreader
which is going to take inputstreamreader
which is basically converting this to
input stream and I have one extra
parenthesis there so just delete that
and then that's going to allow us to get
some sort of a bufferedreader which
we're going to decode in the next
tutorial but thanks again for watching
guys I'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
