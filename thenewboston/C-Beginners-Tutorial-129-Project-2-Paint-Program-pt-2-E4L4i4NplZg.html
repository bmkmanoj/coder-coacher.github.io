tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to continue working on our paint
application so in the previous tutorial
when we left off our line wasn't exactly
aligned so if we just select the size
here and start drawing it's all dotted
because it basically just draws a circle
every time we move our mouse so when we
move our mouse very rapidly it's it's
not really a line anymore
so instead of having it draw circles
every time we have a new Kamau's we're
basically just going to have it connect
or draw a line from a previous position
that the mouse with that to the current
position that the mouse is at so it'll
be smooth so we're not going to be using
the solid brushing or brush at all for
that matter
we're going to be using the pen so we're
going to say pen I'll say it I'll call
it a time and set it equal to a new pen
and just like before we're going to
select a color color dot black doesn't
really matter what color you use and so
that the user will be able to choose um
what position that they want it to be
we're going to do convert dot to float
so we're going to do float dot parse
text box tool strip Xbox one dot text
and float that parse will basically just
convert the text into a float since it
calls for a float right in there so now
the user can choose how thick the pen
will be alright so like I said before
we're just going to be connecting
previous position that the mouse is at
to the current position that the mouse
is that so we're just going to draw a
line so we're going to say G for our
graphics doctor all line and our panel
independently just created and for the
previous point we're going to have to
create integers there's no redefined
properties for the previous position
that the mouse is at so we're just going
to create an integer up to also previous
x equals zero and previous y equals zero
as well so we're just going to be using
these two set as the previous value so
new point equals previous X and then
previous Y and then the second point
will be the current position so it'll
just connect a line from the previous
position that Mouse's up to the current
position
so I'll do you point D de X for the
current x-coordinate of our cursor and
eat out y for the current on the y
coordinate of our cursor and then after
it draws this line we're going to set
previous x equal to the current x
position and previous y equal to the
current y position so that that way the
next time that the user moves their
mouse previous X and previous Y will
actually be the previous positions of
the cursor so we're just going to say
previous x equals DX and previous y
equals Z dot Y and again he just is the
mouse event arguments up here and they
just store information about the event
so now this should work fine so when we
select the visit or size for our mouse
office then 1 1 pixel and then we draw
yeah it works fine it's very nice smooth
pad however there are a few problems
start off it always starts at 0 0 and
that's because we automatically set
previous X and previous y equal to 0 and
the second problem is when you try to
draw a line where a previous line was
like it will disconnect the beginning of
this to where the previous line left off
and that's because we never reset the
previous position of AX in the previous
position of Y so we're just basically
going to reset the previous positions of
x and y so we're going to say previous x
equals 0 and previous y equals 0 as well
this will occur when the user picks up
their mouse or lets go of the mouse so
they're not drawing anymore so
Oh
select size four and so now when we try
and draw you can see it will always
start at zero and that's a problem so
all we're going to do here is we're
going to set the equal to null and in
order to do that since these are non
nullable types we're going to put a
question mark after the variable type
and then begins F is equal to Nevada and
we're basically just going to check to
see if either a null so if it's null we
can use the question mark question mark
operator and say if it's null then we
want it to be equal to the current
position of the cursor so to say GX
right here so on the previous position
of the cursors x-coordinate will be the
previous position of x unless it's null
in which case it'll be the current
position and same goes for wise that
could make this in here so so now what
it will do is as long as user didn't
just start drawing it'll connect the
previous position of the mouse to on the
current position of the mouse but if
user just started drawing then previous
X and previous y will be null so it'll
just start drawing on wherever the user
clicks down first all right and then um
when the user moves the mouse up or
picks it up so they're not drawing any
more we're just gonna set these equal to
null so to do the same thing all right
so now we bug here select a mouse sign
we'll just click one and now we draw we
can see yes it just starts exactly where
the easier clicks down because it'll
won't connect anything the first time
that it draws but the second time and
third time and every time after that it
draws it will connect the previous
position to the current position so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
