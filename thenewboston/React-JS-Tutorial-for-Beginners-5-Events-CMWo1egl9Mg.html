start talking to you guys about two
events now right now our components are
really boring to be quite honest because
they can only do one thing and that is
render some HTML out to the user display
some HTML on the page pretty bland if
you ask me now we started learning react
because we thought that we were going to
be able to create these cool dynamic
changing components that the user can
interact with well if you ever want to
do that then you need to learn how to
use events so an event is just something
that your component can do well right
now it can render stuff out on the
screen but let's make it do something
else so above your render function I'm
just going to make a simple function
called do something because all this is
going to do is let's say that instead of
just displaying stuff on the screen
let's have a link in these components as
well and whenever you click it it will
just alert like this little blob of text
or it'll just do something really basic
so right do something or whatever you're
going to name your function and then
after that's write function and then
make sure you have a comma because you
want to make sure to separate this
function from this function and inside
here you can write anything you want to
do so what do we want our component to
do well we're just going to make it
alert something out on the screen and
we'll just make it alert this text right
here so let me just steal it from down
here get copy and let me write like a
the text displaying is this text right
there so we can actually delete this
since we don't want to display it twice
so now our component is going to render
this this is what it's going to display
and whenever we call this do something
function it's going to display this
alert but now we actually have to make a
link because we're going to say whenever
they click this link that's when we want
to call this function
so I'm just going to write a and let me
just write the text in here first so the
link in this component we'll just say
like click me something like that and
now on click on click what we can say is
this instead of a property that we're
going to stick in this curly brace we're
going to say this components do
something and I'm too lazy to type it so
I'm just going to copy it so whenever we
click this link called the do something
function and just so make sure it
doesn't link to anything I'm just going
to make a dead link in there we go so
now whenever we display this component
it's going to display the heading just
like before and it's also going to
display a link that says click me so
let's check it out so here's the heading
of each component and whenever I click
it it's going to call do something which
just pops up some text on the screen so
here is the child element or definition
for Bucky and here it is for Emily so
that's the basics of events basically
our components they aren't just bland
HTML that we're going to display to the
user they can also have some
functionality so in this example we saw
some really simple function in other
words they displayed some alert box but
later on our events are going to get you
know more useful and a lot more fun so
for now same guys for watching see you
guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
