and create them the F in JavaScript file
so if IO new and of course I'm going to
save this as tuner da JavaScript right
there okay now again I know I did this
like um probably at least three times
already but since I haven't you know
programmed in the Ajax and probably I
don't know at least a couple weeks then
let's go ahead and do this again all
right
microphone working this thing on check
one two better be by the way there were
times before where I made an entire
tutorial that was like eight minutes
long and uh then I realized whenever I
was editing it at the end and exporting
it that I forgot to turn on my
microphone and it didn't happen just
once it happened like you know 20
different times embarrassing so far HTTP
great XML HTTP request object alright
there we go things are looking great
right now okay so now great now let's go
ahead and create the function that
creates the object so function Oh
happens to be right there how freaking
convenient alright so what we're going
to do is we're going to create it in the
most simple way I know I told you guys
how to you know do this in a variety of
different ways but far let's mount HTTP
we're just going to make one simple
check all right if window dot XML HTTP
Wow
freaking keyboard requests obviously
that's not the keyboards fault it's
obviously my big old sausage fingers
typing but hey I got to blame it on the
freaking keyboard you know what I mean
bro all right so if pretty much they're
doing that then let's go ahead and XML
HTTP set this equal to what the object
should be which is a new
XML HTTP request object with empty
parameters now if however they are not
then we got to give them the stupid
Microsoft object so just go ahead and
shave us some a time and set this equal
to new active X object and if you don't
want to set it equal to active X object
then you can just alert on the screen
that hey you are an idiot
stop using Internet Explorer and that
works just as effectively Microsoft XML
HTTP all right now let me just go ahead
and alright so create that objects the
variable window check if they're using
that if so snoo HTTP request looks like
I spout everything right and if they're
freaking using stupid Internet Explorer
will idiot then first of all they're
retarded and they okay looks good now
all we need to do is return the object
and XML HTTP all right so now I guess
there's um two more functions before you
do good stuff now the next thing that we
need to do is we need to create that
process function so remember in our HTML
file actually I like to set it up like
this HTML Javascript XML I don't know
why many ways remember in the HTML file
as soon as our web page loads we call
this function process well we don't have
that function created yet so this gets
called on load actually let me give me
some more space to work with oh that's
plenty of space easy Bucky all right
function process now the first thing we
want to do is we want to check for the
variable and that's the only if
statement that we're going to have in
here so if this variable exists then
what we want to do is we want to try to
catch a baseball so try
and catch II set up the show for that
now what do we want to try to do
hopefully this is what's going to happen
well with this variable what we want to
do is we want to open pretty much
connection to the XML file now we're
just going to use git won't complicate
things and now what name is the file
well it's tuna dot XML and just set the
last parameter equal to true now what we
want to do after this is we want to go
ahead and set the function that's going
to be called every time we have a state
change now if you guys forgot how to do
that use your variable which I guess is
the object technically on ready state
change what function do you want to call
well handle state change and I know that
we didn't create this but we're going to
in like 15 seconds so the last thing
that we want to do is again just
housekeeping stuff I smell HTTP send no
now we got to go ahead and first of all
make sure we have all our semicolons now
the last thing we want to do is we want
to do something in case we get an error
because right now if it tries to do this
and we actually end up getting err not
nothing's going to show up on the screen
so it's going to be very confusing for
us and since I didn't program Ajax in a
while then we have a very you know
likely scenario that we're going to get
an error so what we want to do is just
put a simple alert this is probably the
easiest way to handle this key which is
basically your error message to string
which that is a function that converts
it to a string and of course it will
alert it on the screen so there is a
like I said a very high probability that
we're going to see that but hopefully
not so basically what happens is we
created the object depending on if there
have internet explorer or not and then
we call this function that's going to
pretty much be called as soon as our web
page loads now what this is going to do
is it's pretty much going to have a
connection to your XML file which is
this right here and you already said
okay whenever a state changes and we
already want over States I'm not going
to you know talk about that again then
this is the function that needs to be
called now in the next tutorials what I
want to do is I want to show you guys an
awesome way and also a new way well I
don't know if it's new but it's a better
way probably the best way that we can
work with the XML file or the XML
structure but for now and guess Russian
don't forget to subscribe and eat some
subs I don't know why I said that
anything else I have to say nope nope
that's pretty much it see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
