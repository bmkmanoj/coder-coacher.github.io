tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to
be talking about how to make your own
user-defined functions now as you can
see in this first function we have here
all we have is a basic function that we
need in every program every C++ program
but what if we want to make our own
function well that's what I'm going to
be teaching you guys how to do today and
it's really easy and one of the most
useful things that we can learn so pay
attention and I'll teach you the first
thing that we want to do when making our
own function is provide a function
prototype and what this does is pretty
much describe to C++ that it's going to
be saying hey we're going to be making
our own function so first you type the
void and then type the name of your
function I'm going to I'm going to name
mine my fun and then after that describe
what kind of function it is and mine is
an integer function so that's what I'm
going to pull so again all this does is
tell C++ alright we're going to be
making a function sooner or later and
it's going to be called my fun and
typically whenever you put these in they
go above the int main it goes above your
main function just so C++ knows just
what a common practice now as you can
see here is one function that we've been
working on but we want to create a whole
another one of these so let's press
ENTER a couple times below that and
let's get to work
the first thing we want to do is define
the function and pretty much make the
function so type void my fun because
this is the name of our function
then in our parentheses we want to type
int X and what this says is we're going
to enter function in the body of our
function like this we're going to have
one variable and it's going to be called
X and it's going to be an integer
variable so whenever we make this
function watch out for a variable note
that we're going to be using it and know
that it's going to be named X so now
that we gave C++ our instructions tell
what's prepared for let's start making
this very making this function so in my
curly braces the first thing we're going
to want to do as with most our function
is use naming using namespace STD and
it's just going to say follow the
standard rules and the next thing we're
going to want to do is actually build
our function and all this function is
going to do you can do yours however
like I'm just going to make my output on
the screen my favorite number is
move this over so you can see a little
bit that I'm going to put X oops X oh
and why did I put X because that's a
variable I said it was going to use and
then I'm just going to end the line so
this is one of the smallest easiest
functions you'll ever see in your entire
entire C++ life what this does is take a
variable and say my favorite number is X
but what exactly is the value of X well
we didn't tell with C++ what it is yet
so that's what we're going to do now
what we're going to do now is actually
do something called call our function
and to do this type in your function
name my fund and in the parenthesis or
parameters type in whatever value you
want X to be and this is an example I'm
going to type 45 so now what this is
saying is all right let's run this
function use namespace my fun but it's
going to say alright what is my fun well
when you get to this line C++ right my
favorite number is whatever is in the
parentheses 45 then end the line and
then you can continue with the rest of
your code so we got this function we're
going to run this using namespace do the
my fun function whatever that is then
you continue write a rest of your code
so let's go ahead and save this compile
in a run hopefully I don't have any
errors oops I do hold on one second
while I fix this
alright here's my ear I accidentally had
a semicolon before the function name so
let's go just go ahead and delete that
and save it and I just to tell you guys
just to show you guys if you're using
this with errors it says if you compile
and you have errors it will show right
down here so it's a expected unqualified
semicolon before token and that's what
this is so you don't need a semicolon
after your functions name I just put
that because I have it so let's save
this compile and run I won't have any
errors now now it says my favorite
number is 45 press any key to continue
and again what it did was run my fun my
favorite number is and then it looked
right here for X and another thing you
can do if you don't want to just tell
C++ while you're number is you can
declare a variable let's name it year
num and then we can write if we want to
enter our own input your num
and then run the function my function
with the your num make sure I have all
my semicolons in and now what we do is
declare our own variable that's integer
we're going to say our I asked us for
our favorite number and then once we
tell you we want you to run my function
and say my favorite number is X and X is
going to be whatever your number is so
let's save this execute compile and run
and let's just type in 25 and now it
says my favorite number is 25 and that's
one way you can get input from the user
to use their values or variables in a
function so study this tutorials and
those are two ways that you can use
user-defined functions either by
entering your own input or getting input
from the user and remember to add your
semicolons and not after when you're
defining the function so I hope you
