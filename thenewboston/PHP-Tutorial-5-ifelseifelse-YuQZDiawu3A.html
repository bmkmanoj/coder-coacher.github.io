tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching you guys how to use the
if-else if-else statement now last time
I taught you guys how to use the if-else
statement which meant we told PHP
alright we're going to give you
something to do if it's this do this if
that do that we'll see that only gives
you a limited number of choices but what
if you want to tell PHP to have some
more choices well that's why I'm going
to be teaching guys today so let's go
ahead and create a variable I'm going to
call mine Steve and let's go ahead and
create a basic if statement I'm going to
say if the variable equals Steve and
notice I use two equal signs that means
the variable is exactly equal to the
string Steve then we want you to echo
estilo
now in the last case if you wanted one
condition you would use the else
statement but we want more than one so
we're going to use something called the
else if statement what this does is
allow you to use this multiple times and
give PHP multiple amount of choices so
we're going to say if VAR the variable
is exactly equal to Brian then we want
you to echo a their Brahe now you can
use this else if statement as many times
as you want you can use it just one time
or you can use it 40 times it doesn't
matter as long as you include the word
else if with a condition after it you
can use as many times as you want now
our last statement in every statement we
always end the if-else if-else statement
is of course the else now notice that I
do not give it a condition after it
this because PHP already knows RA if
none of these conditions are true then
that's when we want to do the else so
this condition only executes if nothing
above it right here can be done so we
want to say if none that can be done
then we want to echo you idiot because
that means we messed up we all want that
so as you can see right now the variable
is Steve so it should execute hey Steve
oh let's go ahead and save this and I'll
refresh my page as you can see it says
hey Steve oh let's go ahead and change
variables Brian as you can see in our
else--if statement when the variable is
exactly equal to Brian should say hey
there Bry so let's save this refresh it
and as you see
hey there brag of course lastly if we
set the variable equal to something
we'll call it Dan as you can see this
only has Steve and Brian doesn't have
Dan so else if it doesn't match any of
these echo you idiot so that's what it
should do so let's save that refresh of
course that goes you idiot just like we
want it to now to recap one last time if
gives the first condition you can use as
many other choices using the else--if
and lastly if none of the conditions are
true then that's when you want to
execute the else statement so that's it
for this tutorial see you next time I
guess see it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
