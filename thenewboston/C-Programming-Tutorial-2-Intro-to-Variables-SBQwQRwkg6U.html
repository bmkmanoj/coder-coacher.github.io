your second programming C tutorial in
this tutorial we're going to be building
a basic calculator but before I do that
I want to talk to you guys about
something I'm going to be using in this
tutorial called an escape tree now as
you can see whenever we printed hello
world and last storoe we printed it all
on one line but what if we wanted to
print all these words on different lines
let's put hello there YouTube um if we
printed this it all print on one line
but if we wanted to print it on each
different lines we need to include a
special character called an escape
character now escape characters do
something out of the ordinary um in any
string of text for example backslash T
would add a tab or five spaces in your
text but we're going to want to add a
new line so what we need at is backslash
n between hello and there and backslash
n between there in YouTube and as you
can see whenever I execute compile and
run this you're going to see hello there
and YouTube are all on separate lines
right there and this is because any time
the computer sees a backslash n it
doesn't treat it as actual text it knows
whenever it sees a backslash followed by
a character then it's going to have to
do something weird and in this case I'm
going to be using the backslash n in
this tutorial so I figured I'm going to
have to tell you guys what actually
meant so um isn't this tutorial let's
get to what we've promised or what I
promised I'll teach you guys do and
that's build a simple calculator and
before I do that I need to introduce you
guys a concept called variables now what
a variable is is pretty much a way of
storing data in your computer so you
have to do this a very particular way in
C programming the first thing you need
to do is tell your program what type of
variable you're going to be using and
since I'm going to be using integer
and integers in case you forgot like -
for five thirty five hundred and sixty
and they can even be zero as in major
it's basically just a whole number that
can be negative as well as positive so
after you tell the computer what type of
variable you're working with you're
going to have to name your variable and
you can name it whatever you want you
can name it baboon if you want I'm going
to name my num1 because it's just easier
to remember and don't um when you're
naming your variable don't name it
starting with a number you can use
letters in numbers you can't use any
symbols like that but make it start with
a letter and that's pretty much all the
rules you guys need to know for now just
don't name anything weird so um in this
calculator we're going to have to enter
two numbers and it's going to calculate
the sum for us so we already have a
variable for our first number let's put
int num2 that's going to be our second
number and the less is going to be an
integer called sum so now that we have
all our variables we actually need a
value for these variables and we're
going to have to get the value from the
user itself so right now we have three
variables and let's enter just a
statement on the screenplay enter your
numbers and this is just going to make
it easier for to use so the user is
going to be able to see what they have
to do the next function that I want to
teach you guys is a function called scan
F and this is a function that's going to
allow the computer to get value from the
user and plug it into the variable so if
you're wondering all right how the heck
does this work well pay attention alert
type in scan F and add all your
parentheses in semicolons and inside
your first argument inside your
parentheses you're going to have to tell
scanf what type of data type it's going
to be receiving and says we're going to
be working with decimal integers we're
going to want to put % in d now this %
to tells what data type in the D right
here stands for decimal integer and
that's um that's the first thing you
need to put in scanf and then add a
comma and the next thing that you need
to add is an ampersand which is the and
sign and your variable name num1 so what
this does is this your scanf says all
right you're getting going to be getting
input from the user it's going to be a
number input and I'm going to want to
want you to take that number and plug it
into the variable num 1 so now whenever
you print out the variable num 1 it's
going to be whatever value they entered
so um we did that for the first variable
let's copy this and let's do it for the
second variable is as well just change
this the num2 and now the second number
they enter is going to be stored in num2
but for some we want to do something a
little different we don't want them to
enter a value for some we want to
calculate the sum by adding num1 and
num2 so how do we do that this is the
most simple thing you'll ever learn in
your toilet entire life
put some equals num1 plus num2 BAM now
the some variable is equal to it
whatever number they put in for num1 and
num2
and now just prove you guys that this
actually worked I'm just going to print
on the screen use my printf function I
want to print oh let's put your or else
but the sum is percent d since we're
going to be working with variable but
what variable do we want to output your
sum is and it's not going to actually
print percent D this means all right
what variable and then you tell it the
variable so pretty much so let me run
this and show you guys what it does and
then I'll talk you guys through it
hopefully I don't got any errors
come on beautiful enter your number for
another number six the sum is ten Wow
we already go out and start applying for
C programming jobs actually not here I
got these two guys a couple more things
but here's what it did
we told the computer we were going to be
using three variables called num1 num2
and some we allowed it to give us the
message enter your number we typed in
the first variable and stored it in num1
we typed in the second number and it
stored it in the variable num - it added
those numbers together and I said the
sum is and then it says output a
variable right here but what variable
sum so there you guys go that is how you
build a basic calculator in the C
programming language again I'm going to
be putting all this source code on my
website that New Boston comm so if you
want it um just go to my website the new
Boston calm and get it it's going to be
right there and don't forget to
subscribe to my channel keep watching
these videos and I'll keep teaching you
guys how to program and C so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you next time and
I'll end it with me running this program
one more time 8 for 35 the sum is 443
hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
