tutorial and in this tutorial I want to
talk to you guys about string functions
and also arguments but before we do I
want to tell you guys a pretty cool
story about three days ago I was dding
for my friends because they were
drinking a little bit and it was about
2:00 in the morning and we decided to go
to Denny's
and when we got to Denny's I saw this
cute girl in another section so we were
just how goofing around so you know just
for fun I decided to tell the waitress
to buy her a milkshake for me so the
waitress got her a milkshake and she
went in and brought it over to the girl
in the girls like you know just giggling
the stuff and I went over and I talked
to her and I gave her my number because
I was too afraid to ask her for her
number I know I'm a wimp but anyways
right before I started this tutorial she
called me and we talked on for about an
hour and we're going out this weekend to
the movies so thank you thank you that's
what happens when you buy girls
milkshakes at Denny's so anyways I just
need to tell someone because I'm super
excited and she is super cute but let's
go ahead and learn about string
functions and arguments hopefully I
could stay on topic so you know how I
said that methods pretty much should do
something there pretty much have a job
well some methods need additional
information in order to work for example
say you built this awesome method that
pretty much took pounds and converted it
to kilograms well in order for this
method work it would of course need to
know the number of pounds it was
supposed to convert so say you made
another method that opens a website well
in order for it to know what website to
open you might need to give it the URL
of the website so some methods just need
additional information in order to work
so whenever a method needs additional
information you put the method
information inside parentheses so say
you have that method called convert libs
which pretty much converted pounds to
kilograms well you would type the
additional information such as 324
inside the parentheses so a couple terms
that you may need to know if you guys
are taking a test or I don't know maybe
your
in the class in high school college make
sure you remember this the additional
information in this case the number 324
is called an argument now whenever you
give the information to your method it's
called passing information in or passing
in the information simple enough so
basically in this case we have a method
called convert pounds in we passed in
324 simple enough so now let's go ahead
and of course this convert pounds method
we never made so let's see this in a
real example now aside from having to
write Colonel puts in all the different
variations of how we can write puts we
can also write it like this puts of
course needs additional information in
order to work it needs a string of text
some text to print out on the screen now
since that is additional information we
have the option of putting it in between
parentheses so instead of just writing a
space and assuring up text that we want
to print out we can put that string of
text inside parentheses so let's just go
ahead and print out the word bacon hit
enter and check it out it just prints
out bacon so in this case in this
scenario we would say that the puts
method takes one argument and we pass
the end the word bacon simple enough
so I just want to talk to you guys about
this and that sorrow basically that I'm
going to the movies with this pretty
girl from Denny's that's the main part
of this tutorial but on the side
remember this sometimes methods need
additional information in order to work
when they do it's called an argument or
I want to mention this sometimes is
called a parameter and whenever we give
the information in it's called passing
in so in the next tutorial I'm actually
going to save all the string functions
and something else something special for
the next lesson so thank you guys for
watching and by the way I'll keep you
guys updated about what happens this
weekend but uh yeah thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
