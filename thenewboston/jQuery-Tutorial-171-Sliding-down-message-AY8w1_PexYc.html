with a video tutorial for the new Boston
in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look I did our message on a
button event now this is useful for
things like user settings I've already
outlined a sort of mock-up page here the
button will allow you to actually press
a button and perform a specific action
for example if we did have some fields
around here the button could then
actually go ahead and save some settings
perhaps to a database table and would
then go ahead and display this sliding
message so for example if I now click
Save you can see this sliding down
message has appeared and in vanished
with the text your settings have been
saved so it's an extremely useful thing
to implement if you want a quick
drop-down to display for example change
settings obviously when we click this
button we can specify any text we want
to be displayed so we can use it as long
as we've included it in our page
we've got notice j/s here which is the
actual functionality and buttons jeaious
which deals with the pressing of this
input button so without further ado
let's go on and take a look at how to
create this okay so we're starting
afresh now I've got my document just
open here let's just take a look at some
of the files that we'll be using
I've already mentioned we're using
notice J s and this is the file that's
going to handle the function or define
the function that's going to allow this
drop down to happen then we've got
buttons J s is which is going to look
out for a button click on a wide variety
of buttons across your website so you
can include something like buttons J s
to handle the clicking of buttons for
now or obviously we're only going to be
dealing with one or two buttons so the
first thing we want to do is go ahead
and set up our page so I'm going to
create some H head of three tags and
then a paragraph here so I've given this
these header threes the value of
settings or the text of settings inside
the paragraph I'm just going to write
something like some user
settings and I'm gonna go down and in
another paragraph create an input button
so the input type is button will give
this a value and we'll just say save and
the idea of this we could just have a
save so this is the button or the name
that we're going to use in the selector
in buttons J s now inside of buttons J s
we're going to need to go ahead and
perform an action when this particular
button is clicked so we're going to use
a selector to select the Save button and
then we're going to create an event
handler now inside this event handler we
need a function so I've just outlined a
function here with some parentheses and
then the curly brackets within this is
going to be what happens when we click
the button so for now and just to test
it I'm going to alert out clicked so now
what's going to happen is because we've
included this button CAS file on our
page the event handler is going to
handle a click
based on this button here this entire
button here so when it's clicked we're
going to perform a function and that
function is just to alert clicked to the
browser to the user so this is what our
page looks like when I click Save you
can see that I get this alert dialog box
saying clicked so we know that the Save
button has worked now inside our Save
button once we've clicked it we might
want to update user settings now the
reason I've commented this out is this
will be handled entirely by yourself and
you would perhaps create some kind of
Ajax call some kind of HTTP request to
update user settings obviously if you're
not creating a Save button then you
would perform some other action however
after this we're going to call the
slider function so I've called this
slider notice we'll just call it slide
notice
slide notice so we're gonna call the
slide notice function once we've created
it so when we actually click this button
the specific set of actions to do
whatever you like are carried out then
we call the slide notice button and we
give it the text that we want to display
when the slider appears down so now that
we've done that we don't need to do much
else here but we are going to replace
this once we've created notice is now
before we work on notice j/s and
actually creating this function we want
to go ahead and style a div the that's
at the top that's going to be hidden so
the first thing to do on index dot PHP
is to include a div at the top of every
page that you want this slider to slide
down and I'm just gonna call this slide
notice so we can reference this div with
slide notice we can use a selector in
jQuery so this div now appears on
anywhere on the page you can place this
div anywhere on the page and we're going
to style it so it's hidden but for now
we're going to style it so we know the
exact style of it so in size style dot
CSS we're going to go ahead and
reference slide notice and we're gonna
apply some properties to this to make it
look like a slider now the first thing
that we would usually do is display:none
however we're going to just comment that
out for now because we actually want to
show it so you can see and preview it
now the position is going to be absolute
and what this means is we can place it
however we want on our page using the
top left right and bottom options
available to us but I'm going to go
ahead and give this a height of 50
pixels now at the moment you won't be
able to see anything it's completely out
of view so we're going to go ahead and
we're gonna say background color on this
and the background color is going to be
F 0 F 0 F 0 it's almost like a light
gray so when we refresh we should seen
that and it's just have a check where
let's just go and get rid of this here
No okay so we'll go ahead and put some
text just in here so put some text
inside slide notice that was why it
wasn't displaying so now we can see this
div start to appear obviously at the
moment is not looking great we just have
a little rectangle here with text inside
of it and that over let overlaps the
rest of our page contents and that's
very important we've given it for that
reason we've given it any
position:absolute now we've got the
height set to 50 however we need to go
ahead and position it at the very top
hand corner of our page so I'm gonna say
top zero and left zero now what this
will do is it will position it in the
top left hand corner let's just go ahead
and preview that you can see that's gone
up to the top left hand corner now what
we want to do is make the width equal to
the 100% of the document body so we want
to go ahead and set a width option which
is 100 sorry
percent and now you'll see that up here
across the top of the page so now we've
hidden which sort of like we can't see
this settings a header that we created
earlier and that's important that it
slides over the content and doesn't
shift the rest of the content down
you'll notice if if we had changed the
position to relative you'll see that
that doesn't really work how we want it
to so that's the reason we set it to
absolute okay so on with the rest of
this styling I'm going to set the text
align to center that just make sure that
the alignment of the text is in the
middle of this div</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
