mode me well you guys can see right
there so I already put this in monitor
mode before the tutorial wlan0 Mon as
you can see so after this in order to
create a fake access point the tool to
do so is from the air crack city and
it's called air base - ng and it's one
of the most easiest tools that you ever
had the first thing you write is what's
just the name of your y5 so - e and you
can name it literally anything you want
so I'm gonna name it hot dogs because
that girl she knew I liked hot dogs and
she knew I saw Wi-Fi then I would
connect to it Oh gives me so angry
alright now the next thing you need is
what channel do you want to broadcast on
so she set up this fake access point
called hot dogs broadcast on channel 6
which is my favorite channel and where
do you want to broadcast it from what
interface wlan0 mon so she hit enter and
boom this is up and running
alright now I'm gonna grab my phone and
I'm gonna go into my Wi-Fi settings and
I'm going to show you guys all right I
know if you guys can hear that but I
just took a screenshot of my Wi-Fi
settings I can see that now that this is
up and running this is a option
so whatever tablet laptop phone I had
and everyone around me they're going to
see that this hotdogs network is now
available in open now everything isn't
working just like she planned yet
because remember she still needs to boot
up her DNS server because she changed
all the settings for it and got to
configure it exactly like she said but
she didn't actually start that DNS mask
service yet so in order to do that is
DNS mask
I always write QSR don't do that mask
and then it's minus C and then you give
it your configuration file so e.t.c and
then then holy caps-lock gannis can I
not type today d NS mas Q dot Kampf
there we go buddy I knew you'd get it
eventually
and the second thing is your host file
so - see for your configuration file and
- H for your host and that was in
desktop and it was called fake host
Kampf now we're just going to throw in -
D and make sure that I don't have two
spaces there or else I'd annoy me and
hit enter and boom roasted look of that
so now not only is the access point up
and running but now her stupid little
DNS server is up and running correctly
oh man I'll tell you what this this girl
she was on top of her game however there
was one last thing that she was thinking
about doing so in the last terminal all
right let me minimize this so you guys
can see and again I have two services
running right now the first one is just
running as a fake access point to
broadcast and let everyone know that hey
there's an access point here and the
second one is just for my DNS server and
you have to leave them running in the
background or else you know you need all
the pieces or else this isn't going to
work so whenever she had her laptop and
she had this fake access point and
people were connecting to her she needed
to allow this traffic to actually
connect to the internet so whenever
people connected to her it wasn't the
endpoint she still wanted to take their
request and forward it to the internet
so people wouldn't even realize that you
know this was a fake access point it
would just pass through her device to
the Internet and act as a
man-in-the-middle attack so in order to
do that if she writes ifconfig at0
then she could write 10.0 0.1 24 and
bring that up now remember what she does
in this example or in this little line
of code she's bringing up that default
gateway now this isn't an actual router
that you can hold this is the virtual
one and whenever she brings it up it's
like bringing a new device up so this is
essentially the command that makes her
laptop act is that wireless router she
just brought up that interface and she's
good to go
and
she if you're right I have config you
see that we got all of those now
and now Oh what's this third one eighty
zero a fake router and it has the IP
address 10 a 0.01 yeah
very clever miss hacker which ain't
gonna fool me all right so she set up
her fake access point she's broadcasting
now she set a perfect DNS server she
even brought up that gateways IP so X's
gateway but the last thing that she
needs to do is she needs to configure
her routes in other words even though
that pretty much all the virtual
hardware and servers are up and running
she still needs to allow the actual
package to pass through her computer to
the actual Internet to get a nice proper
man-in-the-middle that no one can detect
so the first part of that and hopefully
you guys watch my networking tutorials
where I explain routing tables and or
are they in my Linux series I don't know
I'm sure you guys watch all my videos so
you guys are going to be golden but
she's going to add a route and in order
to edit just right add and the settings
for this is first what's your network
and remember this 10.0.0.0 that's your
network the default gateway is 10.0 20.1
all of the IP addresses she can hand out
range from 0 to 0 at 10 2.0 to 0.2 50 or
whatever but this is her actual networks
IP and the next thing she needs to do to
set up a network properly is a set of
her net mask which is 255 by 255 dot 255
dot 0 Wow couldn't hold it thought I
could and the last thing is your
gateways a piece of 10.0.0.0
there you go network is now up and
running clear that in oh did I hit enter
embarrassing now just like the last
tutorial sense this is a
man-in-the-middle tech then you need to
enable IP forwarding so no different so
we run this command and it is now
enabled and remember you need to do this
every time and again hopefully you guys
watch
networking tutorials where I talk about
the different fire firewall settings and
the different chains that you can use so
that was embarrassing
um I'm gonna have to remember that edit
that out so I'm not too embarrassed all
right so the first thing we want to do
is the default rule is for forward
I remember you have input output and
forward whenever you're acting is a
router it's forward and the default rule
for this is just to accept so this is
one thing that allows your computer to
acts as a router basically instead of
just getting packets and they stop there
then you actually want to forward them
allow them to pass through between
networks and also IP tables - t net - a
post routing 1 0 F 0 minus J masquerade
art so this means is post routing you
know what that means after all your
normal routing is done then we want to
send the data out through e0 so remember
it's coming in on that interface that we
specified and that's how people can
connect with but then whenever we
manipulate it however we want we
actually need to send it to the real
internet and for that we can't send it
through the same interface so we need to
use e0 and that's actually why whenever
you look at a router you always have a
line coming in and it says like a line 1
or whatever and then you have like 4
other plugs where you can hook the vises
to so you can't just jam everything into
the same plug so different interfaces
whenever you're using a router and hit
enter now if you are you know hosting
any websites on your own computer what
you can do then you would have to do a
patch e2 CTL just like last time and
start and then you can let's say set up
a fake Oh like Facebook or banking site
or whatever you want to do this is what
hackers do hit enter and it's going to
give you that but doesn't matter you now
have a patch
you're running but check this out I'm
going to pick up my phone again
and I'm going to tap hot dogs and I'll
post screenshots in the video and I'm
just going to hit connect so it says I
obtain an IP address now you guys can
see that okay a client has associated
unencrypted all very clever hacker girl
to hot dogs so I'm now connected to hot
dogs according to that thing and now let
me just go to one of those sites so I'm
going to type in Lucky's bacon comm hit
go and Dante Dante tanta and boom
look at that it redirected me to the new
Boston because remember and our fake
host file even though what I just type
in Bucky's bacon comm even though that
may be a real website maybe not it's
irrelevant
whenever anyone types it in it's going
to redirect them to the new Boston so
that is how that girl was thinking about
performing this fake access point attack
so hopefully after this video if you
watch my entire series then you guys are
finally going to realize how dumb it is
to connect to a public Wi-Fi hotspot
even if you connected to it before and
nothing bad happened you guys are now
aware of just how vulnerable these
things are I mean you might as well just
yell out all your credit card
information in your social security
number and it'll probably be less
dangerous than connecting to a public
Wi-Fi so thank you guys for watching as
always don't forget to subscribe and I
will see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
