up we can now get into learning the less
syntax now I'm starting with just a
blank website like the most bare-bones
when you can have here it is look how
awesome this looks right now and let's
just go ahead and make some content I'm
going to make like a heading one and
I'll just be like a Bucky's landscaping
so I don't know maybe that's a business
I'm starting out and I'm gonna have a
paragraph in it too and this is going to
be like I love to mow lawns alright so
we need to style this because I mean
right now look how ugly this is so we're
gonna link it to a style sheet and I'm
probably going to only have one style
sheet in this entire tutorial series so
in order to add a style sheet our style
sheets and I'm just going to call mine
main does CSS alright so it's something
- a style sheet called main dot CSS but
I didn't create this main CSS file yet
instead what I'm going to do is I'm
going to right click this and add a new
file and this is going to be called main
dot less now remember I'm linking to the
CSS because browsers only understand CSS
I'm going to be creating this dot less
file and the reason I do this is because
remember what that arm translator does
that compiler is it takes this less file
and converts it in the CSS behind the
scenes so we're only going to be writing
code in here but our translator or
compiler it takes care of the rest and
actually if you expand this in Japanese
IDs at least you can see the CSS file
that it gets translated to so enough of
me talking let's go ahead and start
styling it so the first thing I want to
do is this I know that I'm going to be
using a fancy green color a lot because
this is landscaping company now instead
of just writing you know the value like
zero zero nine nine zero zero anytime I
want to use that color I'm going to
store that color inside a variable and
that's going to make it reusable however
many times I want so in order to make
variables or
placeholders use the @ sign and then
type whatever you want your variable to
be named I'm going to name mine grass
because I don't know it reminds me of
green and this thing right here it's
kind of annoying that's just showing you
hey we're trying to translate this in
the CSS and this is an actual list
because I'm not done freaking typing it
yet but you know alright so type your
variable name colon and then the value
of whatever that variable is so anytime
I use this variable what less is going
to do is it's going to plug in this
value so now I can just write it like
normal CSS so in heading one I'll change
the color now right here typically write
some hex I would write grass and let me
just uh add another one so font-family
I'll put like a Tahoma and send Sarah so
you can actually mix this in with
standard CSS and also fancy less so let
me do the same for a paragraph so I can
show you guys how handy this is actually
and boom there you go so again well less
is going to do is it's going to go
through your CSS right here and any time
it sees a variable it's going to say
okay you want to use this value same
with here and actually if we look at the
CSS file that's what it translated -
boom - boom so if I look at my website
look at that but you know what um even
though that you know green is supposed
to remind me of grass I really want this
blue so instead of going through and
changing this to blue and this the blue
like I would have to if I was just
working with plain old CSS with less all
I have to do is this change it in one
location and since these are variables
placeholders it automatically gets
updated across my entire CSS file you
guys are loving this already aren't you
and boom look at that
everything's blue now
already you can see how handy this is
because if you ever design a website
before you know that you just don't have
these colors in two locations on my
website the color themes I have I use
the same color in like probably a
hundred or more locations so how much
faster is this going to be then you know
going through manually and the last
thing I want to mention before I let you
guys go
whenever I'm just teaching this I'm
probably going to use weird names but
you never want to name this something
like um green so for example if you just
named it green like this then what
happens when you decide to change this
color to blue well all your variables
are going to be named green and it's
going to be confusing so you never want
to name it what the property is like you
never want to name a specific color you
want to name it something like border
color or on paragraph backgrounds or
something like that what it is not what
it's equal to so you know use good
naming conventions and that is how you
use variables and trust me there's a lot
more to cover and less if you guys fell
in love with that already I don't blame
you wait to see what's coming up next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
