video I am going to talk to you about
DNS how it started what the heck it is
and why we need to use it today so at
the core DNS is a way that we can
translate domain names such as the New
Boston calm to an IP address now the way
it started is about a thousand years ago
whenever computers were first starting
to take over the world whenever they
were talking to each other they could
just use you know each other's IP
address through basic networking that
was fine but then one day they realize
you know what we're eventually going to
take over the minds of humans and they
are not anywhere near as smart as we are
there's no freaking way that these dumb
humans are going to remember these IP
addresses so we need to invent this
thing called DNS now like I said all
this is is a way that we can use domain
names and have them automatically
translate to IP addresses so that we can
get to where we want to go so what's
gonna happen is let's say that this guy
who I keep marking but now looks like he
has red hair so this guy red hair mohawk
gentleman he wants to go to the New
Boston comm to browse some dank memes
but in order to get there he needs the
IP address now he doesn't know it you
know off the top of his head and
obviously it's not just stored on his
laptop you know every IP address for
every web site in the world so how the
heck can he figure out the IP address of
the website that he's never been to
before well what he does is in his
browser he types in the New Boston com
so the New Boston com whatever
now his browser is going to connect to a
special server not the new Boston this
is called a DNS server now this is a
special server on the computer that
actually has all the domain names and it
correlates them to the IP address so
somewhere in the file it says you know
I'll shorten this the New Boston com
translates to 1.2.3.4 whatever so it's
going to look through its records and
it's going to say ok
you dumb human here is the IP address so
it sends it back and now he goes oh now
I know one night 2.3.4 is where I want
to go so then you know through internet
magic it connects to the New Boston
which is 1.2.3.4
and that is the basics of DNS basically
a way that the matrix allows us dumb
humans to use domain names and it
automatically converts them to IP
addresses for us now if you guys want to
check something else out cool I'll show
you guys this let me put my little
stylus pen away all right so you know
that I said that on that special DNS
server somewhere out in the Internet it
has a log of every domain name and every
IP address and it translates it for us
well this is actually called a host file
and believe it or not you have you know
like a minified version of this on your
own computer and I'll show you where it
is and why it's useful so if you just
pop open your computer and you go to see
Windows and I'm sure it's different but
I'm using Windows 7 um you know you
probably never need to edit this but if
you just want to check out what it looks
like I'll show you so go down to system
32 right here and go to drivers et Cie
and host now if you double click this it
doesn't have a file extension so it's
not going to know how the heck to open
it what if we just right-click it and
open it in notepad then we can see that
this is your host file now right now
ours is very limited because you know we
really don't need a huge one we're not a
DNS server but you're at least going to
have this one address right here
so essentially what it is is a log of IP
addresses and then after it the domain
name so it says whenever you type this
into your browser or anywhere on your
computer translate it to this IP address
so the reason that I have these is
because I wanted to set up a local
development site for you know my
say that I'm working on and I didn't
want to host it online so now whenever I
type tnb - dev comm
it just goes to you know my own actually
show you guys so right here on this is
the site I'm working on tnb - dev comm
however if you guys go to it you're not
going to see any of this because um this
is only set up for my own computer so if
I right-click and you know show you guys
some let me refresh this page check it
out so you can see that this is actually
hosted on my own computer now just
something to watch out for real quick if
you ever you know go to let's say your
bank's website and you try to log in or
you go to Facebook or something and you
notice that it's a little off sometimes
what hackers do is they get into your
computer and they put something like
Facebook right here and instead of going
to Facebook's IP address they have some
website set up that looks just like
Facebook or just like your bank and then
whenever you type your credentials in
then it gets sent to their server and
you you know don't really know the
difference so look at your host file
make sure it's all clean make sure
there's not something you know some
stupid hacker did to it and then you're
good to go so like I said you're never
really going to need to edit that but
just thought I'd show you guys one other
thing I want to show you guys is this
you guys may be wondering alright
so whenever I typed in the New Boston
comm and I didn't have the address yet
how did it know where the DNS server was
I mean it needed the IP of this so how
did it automatically have this server
well I will show you guys that right now
and whenever you um like first get your
computer or you first set up your
internet a lot of the stuff is
automatically configured and also I
believe whenever you download like
Chrome browser for the first time I
think they make weak some stuff but if
you guys want to see in more detail than
if you go to start menu in your control
panel
the easiest way is just probably type in
view network connections right here and
just right-click any of these and select
properties and if you go down to I P v4
and hit properties check it out so this
is saying is whenever you're trying to
go to a website and you don't have the
IP address of that yet
then get it from these DNS servers now
you're probably going to have different
ones than this because whenever you
first set up your internet they give you
a default one I actually have these
these are Google's DNS servers and I
never had a problem with them and I
change them because I actually tried to
get online and said hey you have a
problem with your DNS server so I guess
it went down or it was misconfigure or
something so I just went on my phone and
found Google's and like I said Google's
are a lot better than my internet
provider since you know Google kind of
knows what they're doing it seems like
but there you go that's what computer it
looks at whenever it needs an IP address
and well there you go that's the basics
of how DNS works basically really simple
it's how you take a domain name and
translate it into an IP address so you
can connect to that computer boom
roasted see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
