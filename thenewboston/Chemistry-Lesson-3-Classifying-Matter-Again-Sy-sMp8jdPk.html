it was a long time ago but I'm pretty
sure way back when there's this dude who
hired a bunch of different chemists to
classify matter and at the beginning of
the day they're like okay we classified
matter into solids liquids and gases
however then at their lunch break
they're like aw crap we got to work
until five o'clock and it's already noon
what the heck are we going to do for the
rest of the day so another guy was like
uh let's just classify it again so now
they have a different system of
classifying matter other than solids
liquids and gases I guess this way of
classification just wasn't enough for
them so they had to do it again so now I
got to teach it to you guys and you guys
got to learn it and you know solve the
problems with the world so on and so
forth so this slide is pretty nice and
all but let's go ahead and take a look
at a graph ooh I wonder who made this
this is a nice looking graph right there
so basically you have two main types of
matter you have pure substances and
mixtures so matter can either be pure or
a mixture of pure substances will give
in to that later on
now within pure substances you have two
subgroups elements in compounds so
elements and compounds can be pure
substances in homogeneous and
heterogeneous are mixtures you actually
say it like I have a homogeneous mixture
you don't say like I have a homogeneous
type of mixture or anything like that
you pretty much say I have a modulus
mixture or a hurrah Janus mixture oh
this is my voice already not going good
so anyways let's go ahead and dig deeper
in first before we get into all this
crap let's go ahead and determine what
the difference is between a pure
substance and a mixture well if we can
read the formal definition it says pure
substances definite in constant
composition for example a bag of salt
mixtures a physical combination of pure
substances and if anyone just reads this
stuff and is like oh that makes sense
that's crazy because who talks like that
I'm going to explain to you guys in
everyday terms what this means for
example imagine a pure substance as a
bag of salt if you had a huge sack of
salt
no matter where you reaching that bag
the left side the right side the bottom
of the bag the top of the bag the middle
whatever you pull it out in your hand is
going to be 100% salt
nothing else it's going to be pure salt
however a mixture is a little bit
different a mixture is a physical
combination of different pure substances
for example imagine you had a jar of
sand and sugar so basically if you reach
in the top of the jar you might get 80%
sugar 20% salt or whatever the heck I
said 80 percents and 20% sugar but maybe
at the bottom it's like 50/50 maybe on
the left-hand side there's like 60
percents and 40% sugar you know it just
it just like is a bunch of stuff mixed
up nothing is pure in it so sometimes
we're depending on where you reach in
it's going to be a little bit more sandy
or salty it's basically not uniform it's
not the same so like I said pure
substances are 100 percent uniform the
same they have a definite in constant
composition that's a technical term for
a pure substance a mixture is a physical
combination of pure substances and that
is how they're different so basically if
we take a look at the graph again matter
is split up into two things things that
are pure and things that are mixed
together and later on we're going to be
seeing okay how in fact this matters in
chemistry and I'm just not just you know
giving you guys weird terminology to
remember that you're never going to use
again you actually do need to know these
terms and now you do so anyways in the
next tutorial we're going to be covering
elements compounds in these different
types of mixtures and it is going to be
tremendously exciting and fun trust me
so I will see you then thank you guys
