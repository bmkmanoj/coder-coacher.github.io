studio max tutorial and in this tutorial
we're going to be going over how to
select object in the advanced kind of
way so in the last tutorial I'm guessing
you probably had a problem with
selecting objects that were either right
behind each other or right on top of
each other and it got kind of confusing
sometimes so I'm going to show you real
easy ways that the pros select objects
so you already know that you can select
objects this way by clicking a select
object and clicking on one right here
but another thing they usually want to
do is whenever you're working with
pretty advanced animations you have not
only this geometry but you also have
shapes lights cameras and all that kind
of stuff so in order to only be able to
filter your selections you can go up
here to the filter Mountain it's called
the selection filter and you can click
only select and let's say cameras so now
that we don't have any cameras in here
if we try to select something it won't
work all these weren't created with
cameras but rather geometry so let's go
ahead and click geometry and now we can
only select geometric shapes so let's go
ahead and change that to also I can tell
you guys some more things now aside from
filtering your selections you can also
select by name and how you do this as
you go to edit and then you go to select
by and then you go to name and this
brings up all the things that you can
select so for example click hose which
is the bendy part and click OK and now
your hose is selected so if that was
like in the middle of a bunch of complex
animations you can just select it by
name and it will select it for you
now aside from selecting my name you can
select by a similar color so let's go
ahead and change this color right here
I'll change to like blue or something
and whenever you select by color any
object you pick it's going to select all
the objects of the same color so we've
got three objects right here tube number
two the bendy part and tube number one
so say we want to select all objects of
the same color as to number two so we
can select these two two
and not the hose so go ahead and put
edit select by color and now if we click
any of these colors all of the similar
colors are going to be selected so if
you look in this left view this tube is
selected the smaller tube and this long
tube is selected but this bendy straw or
the bendy part is not selected because
it's a different color so now that we
know how to select my name and select by
color another thing that is really
really useful is how to select multiple
objects so go ahead and press H and this
brings up the select from box as you can
see in in order to select individual
objects like last time all you have to
do is click on the hose and press ok but
say we want to select multiple objects
or many so in order to do this you can
go ahead and click on the tube say to
number one and they'll go ahead and
click on your control on your keyboard
and click another one and any selection
you add to the list is going to be
selected so if you click it again it
deselects it so that's how you can
select multiple objects now what shift
does when you hold it down on your
keyboard it selects a range of them so
say you want to select everything from
tube number one to hose number one
select tube number one then hold down
shift and select hose number one so when
you hold down ctrl on your keyboard it
selects them individually and when you
select shits on your keyboard click one
select shift it selects the entire range
so that's how you can do that and aside
from this let me cancel this this also
works in the viewport so say for example
we want to select this tube we can hold
down control on our keyboard and with
control held down we can select this
tube and now only these two tubes are
selected and again if you want to
deselect one of them go ahead and hold
down control and deselect one of them by
clicking so now let me right click or
click away to deselect everything and
now what I want to go over is how to
lock a selection so for example say we
have a
selection of our two tubes so you have
this one I'm going to hold down control
and select this one any time we know
we're going to be working with this
selection only and we want to lock it
you want to go down here until this lock
symbol right here this is selection a
lot toggle so when you click this right
here and go up to select object anything
else we try to select see I'm clicking
select object right here it's not
selecting so I can only work with these
two so anytime I want to lock the
selection and not be able to select
anything else see I can't select this
you need to go over to selection and
lock toggle so now let's unlock that and
now we can select other stuff so aside
from that I guess the only other thing
that I can think of is other than lock
selection is how to edit name selection
sets and what this means is it's kind of
like lock selections but you can return
them if you want so the best example
just so show you so go ahead and click
these tubes again and now we have these
two pink tubes selected and not this
blue one anytime we want to save this
selection for later what we need to do
is go up to here and this is edit named
selection sets that's what I was talking
about and I already have apples in there
which are as I was playing around with
it but in order to create a new set you
need to select two objects and my tubes
are already selected and go ahead and
press create new set and then go ahead
and go to tubes and then if you click
away you have a preset selection of
tubes so anytime you're editing this
yada-yada-yada edit the to change color
a little bit do some other stuff and
then you think alright I want to go back
to that selection I saved all you have
to do is go to this drop-down list and
click tubes and those tubes are selected
again so this is how you can do
predefined selections and if you know
you're going to be working with some
certain objects a lot that's how you do
it and if you decide that you want to
get new selection or add another one
just go ahead and get rid of that and
add another one you can figure out what
all these buttons means just add another
one subtract selected objects they're
pretty simple I'm not going to be going
to in-depth of that or else or just be
boring
so I guess the only other thing and I
already said that before but I
remembered one more thing is to isolate
an object that you want to work with and
this is really useful if you want to
work with just one object and
concentrate on it to do this you go up I
have a selection in case units er they
have these two tubes go up to tools and
then go to isolate selection and you can
also click alt Q and what this means is
everything that isn't selected
disappears but it doesn't really
disappear like you delete it it just
disappears from view so now you can see
we are in our selection mode that only
our two straws our two tubes were
selected so again click X out of that
and we're back to normal so again one
last time anytime you want to do that
click your selection hold down alt Q and
then you isolate that one object so you
can model and work with that and anytime
you want to get rid of it just click
that X right there and it brings you
back so that's your quick tutorial on
how to select objects and it's going to
come in handy when we're working with
some pretty complex animations and
objects and we have them stacked on top
of each other and stuff now you're going
to know how to select them easier and
how to isolate one another so you can
model that individual object so thank
you guys for watching I hope to see you
