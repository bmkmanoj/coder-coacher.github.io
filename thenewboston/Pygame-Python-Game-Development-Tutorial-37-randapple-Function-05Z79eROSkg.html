37th pygame tutorial video in this video
we're going to be doing is generating a
function to handle this R and Apple X
and random Y as we saw in the last video
editing this anything within our you
know function here we have to edit in
three different locations which is kind
of a red flag to you that something is
wrong something wrong so what I want to
do is basically we're going to make a
function to handle this so it's just
these two lines here so I'm gonna go
ahead and highlight this will copy that
and then we're going to come up to the
top of our script and we're going to
make a new function right here and we're
just going to call this define R and
Apple Shin for R and Apple generation
and no parameters are necessary here and
then we just paste this here and it's
always a good idea to when you do
something like this is make sure all
that variables in here will match up so
sometimes what you might need to do if
you've got local variables is you'll
make the function and then say like
apple thickness not too long ago Apple
thing this was actually a local variable
right it was in the game the game loop
and we could still work with that if we
want it we would just need to change you
know add a parameter here like object
size and pass the value of apple
thickness through object size and so
these being apple thickness these would
be object size but since apple thickness
is like a constant defined up here we
don't have to actually worry about that
so this will be empty parameters then we
see there and basically the only thing
then we got display with and display
height but again those are just defined
up here so we've got a function now all
we have to do is we have this function
return these values so have it return R
and Apple X and then R and Apple Y now
whenever we want to call this function
have it return data to us all we have to
do is we say R and
Apple X comma brand Apple y equals R and
Apple Gen so R and Apple Gen is
basically returning this tuple of Raina
blacks right never why we can assign
that to people using unpacking 2x s r
and x r + y and this is a full function
and that's all we need to call now so we
can take this will cut this and then
we're going to head down and or a script
and we're going to find where we're
calling these functions so right here's
the first example
so we can just basically delete that
paste our new function there now we'll
find the other spots I think we have two
more so keep scrolling this is old code
I'm going to go ahead and just delete
this now when I'm using that and we'll
find this highlight that delete paste
and then again here delete paste and
that's it that's the all the places that
we're calling on those so let's see if
that works out for us snake regulations
see to play let's eat an apple and sure
enough we're seeing that our Apple is
indeed generating in other locations so
that's good so now we're able to modify
our apples functionalities because we
might not end up changing the size of
the Apple we might end up doing a whole
host of other things the bottom line is
anytime we need to modify something
within that functionality we saw that we
had to go through quite a few different
locations it's highly likely that you'll
maybe forget about one of the other
locations so these two it's easy enough
but the initial definition of it
wherever that is up here I think
somewhere right it'd be easy to have
forgotten about that one and so on so
it's always a good idea to if you're
going to have variables at all to
obviously have a variable definition to
them so we can change the variables near
the top and we always know where to find
them but then when you've got a similar
block of code that you find that you're
running
many many places it's best that we turn
that into a function because making
changes to it will require quite a bit
of edits and not only is it a lot of
work you might forget some spots so now
we've got that function working so we're
pretty happy there and now what we're
going to be doing in the next videos
we're going to work on adding scoring to
our game as well as pausing to our game
because sometimes users want to be able
to pause so that's what's coming up
hopefully you guys have been enjoying as
always thanks for watching stay tuned to
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
