want to make a video real quick because
i have a huge announcement and that is I
made a brand new YouTube channel called
the New Boston TV and the reason i made
this youtube channel is because i'm
going to be making a bunch of personal
videos from now on and i don't mean any
like really personal stuff but just me
talking about you know some funny
stories maybe or embarrassing stories or
maybe if I see something cool that day
or maybe if I you know I read an
interesting article or something and I
want to talk about so basically just me
having some personal videos having fun
and I didn't want to clutter up this
channel I'm gonna leave this channel
open to stuff like only educational
videos and tutorials like it's been in
my other channel the New Boston TV is
going to be a more personal channel um
you know kind of a break from the
educational side of me more of a
personal my life kind of thing so if you
guys want a break from tutorials and you
guys just want to hang out with me have
some fun definitely go and subscribe to
that channel again it's called the New
Boston TV I'm going to be adding a link
in the description box below so if
you're too lazy to type it in you can
just go ahead and click that link and
hit subscribe so definitely go and check
out that channel and go and subscribe
and it's going to mean so much to me if
you do so thank you guys for watching
