welcome to your very first tutorial in
Java FX now I'm guessing that most of
you if you click this video then you
probably already know what Java FX is
and you just want to learn about the
syntax and everything like that but for
those of you who are just curious you
you aren't really sure what it is Java
FX is a platform for making really
amazing looking GUI applications in Java
so if you ever try to make a GUI program
before in Java you probably notice that
everything on it looks out of date maybe
you're using swing and everything looks
like it was like from Windows 95 or
Craigslist and just really outdated
well what Java FX gives you the ability
to do is create amazing looking programs
really really easily so that's the
pretty much bare-bones basics of it and
in addition to pretty much that which is
you know the core of it it also comes
with a bunch of other features for
example you can create animations charts
on there's 3d stuff but that's a little
bit more advanced we're getting that
later on so for now I just want to teach
you guys the basics and yeah let's go
ahead and get started now another thing
I should mention is this Java FX is
built right into the core JDK so we
don't need to go online and find some
weird package and download it and
configure it so our program can use it
as long as you have the most recent
version of the JDK everything is built
in for you which is amazingly awesome so
again make sure you have the most recent
version and by the way if you're
watching this video I'm going to assume
that you already know the basics of Java
and you already have some kind of IDE
installed I'm going to be using IntelliJ
because is stinking awesome so um yeah
that's all I need to say let's go ahead
and start typing some code so the first
thing we need to do is we need to import
all the stuff now even though it's
included in the JDK we still need to
import it to say hey program we're using
these packages so you can either pause
the video right now and copy all these
down
or if you guys just want to watch this
video and maybe you learn better if you
don't type at the same time and follow
along with it then what you can do is
you can just watch the entire video and
at the end you can go on my github page
and I'm going to be posting all of the
code from all of my tutorials right on
there and I'll put a link below in the
description so again if you just want to
watch and then copy it at the end you
can go ahead and do that but anyways
once you got all this taken care of
the first thing we need to do with every
single JavaFX application is we need to
extends a class called application now
as you see right here it says JavaFX
application that's the one we want what
this allows us to do is pretty much get
the functionality for a Java FX
application so all that core
functionality is in this class right
here so now we're inheriting it and now
we can use all that good stuff now this
of course this is just a hello world
line that they gave me whenever I
started this project so we can just
delete that now in your main method
remember this is the first method that
gets called whenever your programs
launched what we want to do is we want
to call launch args so what the heck is
this method this is actually a method
inside the application class and all
this method is going to do is whenever
we first start our main Java program
it's going to call this method then it's
going to go into application and it's
pretty much going to set up your program
as a Java FX application now after
that's um pretty much done and set what
application is going to do is it's going
to call a method called start now we
don't have that method yet so if we
start typing it you can see that start
is actually overridden because we're
inheriting it from the applications
class so I know that this is kind of
confusing but if you're still with me um
that was the hardest part so basically
whenever your program starts it's going
to call watch launch is going to go in
the application set
reefing up and then it's going to call
start so all the code we write in here
that's going to be our main JavaFX code
simple enough alright so now we can go
ahead and start learning the easy stuff
now before I actually start typing I'm
going to talk to you about terminology
for like two seconds because it's going
to save you guys a lot of headaches now
in JavaFX language the entire window is
called the stage so this entire window
right here including the clothes
maximize minimize in this title right
here this entire thing is called the
stage now the content inside your window
or inside your stage that's the scene
and on the scene is where we're going to
be putting all the cool stuff like
buttons widgets stuff like that so just
remember um they don't call it a window
and stuff inside your window they call
it a stage and the scene alright so why
did I just say that well because
whenever we override the start method
which is essentially the first method
that gets called what it's going to do
is it's going to pass in the primary
stage and essentially this is our main
window so one cool thing that we can do
on this is primary stage set title in we
can just pass in any string right here
I'll just put title of the window and oh
come on there we go title of the window
and all this is going to do is it's just
going to set the title of the window you
see where this has new to notepad it's
going to set that to title of the window
so now let's go ahead and actually
create something that we can look at
rather than than just a blank window so
in this demo I'm just going to show you
guys how to create a really simple
button just because it's really easy but
eventually I'm going to show you guys
how to do a bunch of other stuff so
actually if I go up above main then I'll
just name my button button and I can
initialize it and start so I can set
button
equal to new button now right now we
have a button and it has no text on it
whatsoever so you always want to put
text on your button so the user has a
little indication of whenever they click
it what does it do now you can either
just use your button object and call a
method on it called set text and I'll
just feel like um click me or something
like that or what you can do is you can
actually just set it whenever you create
your button or initialize it so two
different ways but I actually prefer
doing it that way just because I don't
know lets me visually understand a
little bit easier that we are setting
text on the button right there and let
me myself a little bit more space to
work with don't want everything clam
jammed up all right so now we added a
title to the main window and we created
a button but it's not going to appear on
the screen
right now because the first thing we
need to do before we actually display
anything on the screen is we need to
make a layout now again a layout is
essentially just how you want everything
arranged on your screen and in this
example again we only have one button so
you're like how can you lay out a button
like on the top in the middle that's it
not that exciting but eventually we're
going to be building programs with like
menus and drop-down lists and bunch of
cool stuff so that's when layout comes
into play but for right now I'm just
going to show you guys a really simple
layout so if you call stack pane and you
just name it layout or something like
this you can set this equal to new stack
pane and again this is just a really
simple layout not going to be getting
into too much detail but essentially
what it's going to do is it's going to
position this button in the middle so if
you call that layout which is pretty
much your main rules of how you want
everything organized in position you can
call get children and then you can add
the button and again this is going to
make a lot more sense whenever we talk
about layouts but for right now I just
want to show you guys a real quick
example before kind of breaking anything
down so the last thing that we actually
need to do is remember right now we just
made that main stage which is
essentially the main entire window but I
also told you guys that you need a scene
as well the scene is essentially the
contents inside your window so for here
would be the area where I type this menu
all of these buttons this tab all that
stuff is included in the scene now for
our little demo we just have a button in
there so I'm not going to be that
exciting but here's how you create a
scene so in the scene class you can name
your object anything you want I'm going
to name my teen set it equal to new
scene and get that out of the way now
the first parameter it takes is your
layout how do you want stuff arranged in
your scene well the rules we just made
in layout again more details on that
later on and the other two parameters
are just the size of your scene and
since you're setting the size of your
scene what it essentially does is it
sets the size of your entire window so
just for this demo I'm going to set mine
equal to 300 by 250 and for the primary
stage which is the main window after
that you call set scene and you pass in
your scene and this pretty much says use
this scene for our window or main
program and the last thing that we need
to do is further stage which is the main
window we just call show and you guys
can probably guess what that does it
just displays it to the user and I know
I'm going a little quick and you're like
alright I really understand this thing
about the layout and why we need to like
pass all these parameters in but I'm
just going to go ahead and run this now
and show you guys that it does indeed
work so check that out so we now learn
how to create a very simple Java FX
application again I know I went through
everything really
quick and there's of course a bunch of
other stuff to cover but for right now
um well that's all you guys get so if
you want this code again go to my github

watching and don't forget subscribe and
well I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
