Effects cs6 tutorial I'm host buddy
Blackford and today I'm going to show
you another lighting effect that you can
add into your scene and it's an actual
effect that's generated and it's called
CC light rays and this is kind of like a
combination of all the other lighting
effects that I wanted to show you and it
kind of creates like a middle point with
a light source on it and it kind of acts
almost like a point light but it has
rays and has a center and all that stuff
so I want to show you what's going on
here I have an adjustment layer created
and then I have a couple like outlines
just to have a logo created in the
middle here and those are shape layers
and everything is in a 2d workspace
right now and I don't even need to have
these 3ds turned on I'll turn those
right off and then I just have a picture
as the background and everything is all
2d there's no cameras on or anything
like that so let's go into our
adjustment layer and I will show you the
light right here which is actually in
the middle in this area here I'll turn
it off real quick to show you what it
looks like before and then I add the
light rays to it and this is the after
and I've got the the radius up really
high so in the intensity up high so it's
like blowing out the light in there so I
got a more intense effect in the back so
I'm going to delete this out and show
you how to use this effect to enhance
the lighting that is already made it in
the scene by like a picture or something
like that so let's go to effect generate
and then we want to go to CC light race
and this is what you get starting out is
this just this little dot here so we
need to adjust settings to make it a
little bit more intense or something
like that if I bring it over top of a
light source it already
more intense and the way you can move
this is just by clicking on this dreck
cross hair here and dragging it so you
can bring it to wherever you want and
because of the transfer mode that we
have on which is add over here it adds
to however bright something already is
so another way to move this is to go
over here in the center property up here
in your effect click on this crosshair
button and now you can place it wherever
you want I personally just like grabbing
and dragging because it's a no-no it's
just easier and more interactive so
we've got that there I'm going to move
over here over on the clouds so we can
see a little better what is going on
with our our effect so we've got our
intensity here and that's just going to
increase how upright it is so there's a
lot of intensity and then here's just
like a little Whitman here's nothing so
that's the intensity there and wherever
you're going to put it that's you're
going to base your intensity on on that
area so I'm just going to keep it at 104
now we've got our radius which is going
to be like how much around how big
around it is so that's radius as you can
see as I'm doing this I'll zoom in a
little more this is a hundred percent
down here as you can as I create it
radius you can see like light rays
coming forward and you can see how that
might be used as like a warping kind of
effect like you're warping in like space
or something like that so there's a type
of effect you can use you see that it
looks like the Rays are moving so kind
of like in Star Wars when they do the
light speed effect you can do something
kind of like that and use this as part
of your effect let's put that back
around 50 now we've got the warp
softness and that's going to be what the
actual hot spot looks like so if I move
the softness down the hot spot is going
to get a little bigger and
a little more warped and then as I
increase the softness it's going to
become less until it gets down to
nothing and then if I let me increase
the radius a little bit more and then I
can increase the warp softness more and
that gives also like a kind of like a
warping now effect so we've got that
going on now we've got our shape here we
got two shapes round and square now
that's just up to your preference of
which one you know you would like
there's nothing too much going on about
that but when you switch to square you
also are allowed to change direction
here you can see how you can rotate this
one here so that's the difference
between square and round and of course
the shape of it you can adjust your warp
softness to get like more of a like a
circular shape and then you can change
the direction like that so there's some
examples there I'm going to go back to
round and increase decrease this warp
softness we've got a couple checkboxes
here color from source and I'll just
watch as what happens when I uncheck
that now it's pretty much just coloring
on its own and not using background
information to to determine how bright
it's going to be and the color of the
actual light ray like the center of it
so if I hit color from source it's going
to take the blue color from these clouds
and add so if I come over here onto the
brown here it will take more of like a
brownish and a yellow in this instance
here and then we got the brown light
rays coming off here so that's what the
color from source means and you can see
how this interacts with the different
with the different types of layers that
you have in your scene here if I make it
pass through these trees same type here
so you can see how you might be able to
create like a sunset kind of look based
on these trees so and then you can see
all the rays and everything like that so
that's how it like goes with that and
then we've got the Ola brightening
button and I will check that and uncheck
that a few times so let's go across
everything with the allow brightening
button up here no basically I mean it
kind of decreases how bright this is and
things like that so just got a small
effect on what's going on so we've got
our color here which we can't use with
the color from source on but if I
uncheck it then I can color the actual
light race or the actual light and
everything like that so you can add like
a color to your scene and make it kind
of like a different color and whatever
is you get the idea here so now all my
stuff is a little bit more blue and it's
not going to color from like my brown
logos here it's going to just stay blue
colored as you can see so this is with
color from source on and this is with
color from source off now we've got our
transfer mode here and we've got three
different ones none is going to do
nothing pretty much and it's going to
just keep the light source at it's on
but it still interacts with the
background as you can see
even though the background isn't showing
anymore
we've got lighten which is going to be
just like the lighting on our blending
modes we're just going to lighten up a
bit a bit a bit and I've noticed that
when I use this the Rays aren't very
large or anything like that and you can
see how it affects these layers now kind
of gives them like warping and it's
using the Lightning blending mode to
work with these different logos and
everything like that
then we've got screen which kind of is a
more broad effect and it lightens up the
whole entire screen almost well lightens
up the whole entire compound most not
option and say screen but here's with an
add-on and here's what screen on so it's
a more subtle than add as you can see
there and then here's Lincoln just going
through these so you can see how they
affect each other or how they are
different in their effects so there we
go
I think ad is probably like the coolest
one because it pretty much adds to the
brightness and everything like that so
there's how you use your CC light rays
it's a pretty cool effect and there's
third-party plug-ins that kind of
emulate this but this is I think this
one is pretty cool within itself now
that you know how to use it it's pretty
pretty decent and can help you create
some like cool really cool looking
effects in your scene so that's about it
for the CC light rays there and pretty
soon I'll be making a cool project
utilizing the different lighting
techniques and everything like that and
then the fake lighting effects like the
CC light rays and the CC light sweep and
all that stuff so thanks for watching
this tutorial and I look forward to
seeing you in next in like a future
tutorial where we put together
everything and make something really
cool so I'll see you guys then and in
the meantime
messing around with your effects and
playing around with them and seeing what
other kind of cool effects you can make
like the possibilities are pretty much
they're not endless but they're pretty
close because everybody's always
thinking creatively of how to use these
different things so thanks for watching
I'll see you guys later
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
