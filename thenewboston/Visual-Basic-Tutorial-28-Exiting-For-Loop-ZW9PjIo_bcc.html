slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at exiting a for loop
early now let's go ahead and get started
we'll create a new project select
console application and we'll just name
it exit for loop and then click OK
now I'll just wait for it to load our
project and we'll zoom in a bit here ok
so now let's go ahead and create our for
loop first let's type console dot write
line and we'll just label this one as
normal for loop now let's go ahead and
create a simple for loop so for number
one equals one to 30 let's go ahead and
print out num1
so console dot write line num1 so this
is a very fairly simple for loop now
let's just add a space here so there
will be an empty line and now let's tell
them that this is a for loop that is
exited when num1 is equal to a certain
value so console dot write line for loop
that exits before it's finished
so now let's create another for loop so
for num1 equals 1 to 30 let's go ahead
and do console dot write line num1 okay
so now what we're going to do is we are
going to test the value of num1 to see
if it's equal to something and if it is
then we're going to go ahead and exit
the for loop so we're going to do this
by using a simple if statement so if
num1 equals 23 then what are we going to
do we're just going to use the keyword
exit which is exits a procedure or block
and transfers execution immediately to
the statement following the procedure
call or block definition so basically
what that means is that if num1 is equal
to 23 it's going to hit this exit
statement and it's going to skip all the
way down to this line right here where
i'm typing these commenting because that
is after the if statement and this after
the for loop so now if we go ahead and
run this you can see it closes there
let's go ahead and do a console dot read
line
okay so let's go ahead and scroll up to
the top and you can see it says normal
for loop and it says one two three four
five and so on all the way down until it
gets to the value thirty and now it says
for loop that exits before it's finished
it starts at the value 1 and then it
goes all the way down to the value 23
and then it exits the for loop now we
can also do this if we step the value so
for number 1 equals 1 to 30 and if we
step by 4 then you can see that is this
if statement it's never going to run so
if we run this you can see it's all the
way to 29 and it doesn't stop at 24 so
what we can do is we can do if num 1
just a load here
okay so if num1 is greater than 23 then
exit the for loop so you can see that it
goes 1 5 9 13 17 21 25 and then it exits
a four loop because num 1 is greater
than 23 so go ahead and make a couple
for loops that exit under a certain
condition and then once you've got that
down and you'll remember it go ahead and
move on to the next tutorial so thanks
