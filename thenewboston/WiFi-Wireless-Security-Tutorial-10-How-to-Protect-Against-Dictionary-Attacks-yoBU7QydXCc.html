the theory behind cracking a WPA
password protected Wi-Fi network and we
also did it live you guys are probably
realizing that well it's like actually
kind of scary how easy it is for a
hacker to figure out these passwords so
the important thing that we need to
understand is how can we protect against
this I mean how can we have legit
clients still be able to use these
password protect networks but keep the
bad guys out well as you're watching
these tutorials we're gonna talk about a
bunch of different techniques that we
can use to secure your Wi-Fi network but
in this case and one of the most simple
things and I'm sure people tell you all
the time is you need to have an awesome
password and by that I don't just mean
you know how websites say that you need
at least one upper case in a number no I
mean that you need like an awesome
password you need to have upper case
lower case you need to have weird
symbols make it as long as you possibly
can and another thing that people don't
realize and what we just saw is in order
to perform that attack this guy needs a
dictionary a list of passwords that he
think may work now some people's
dictionaries are like terabytes long now
if you just took a quick look at that
word list then what you're gonna notice
is that whenever you use a dictionary
attack those passwords are made up of
you know people's previous passwords and
these are not only things like password
1 2 3 4 but there are things like sports
teams there are things like famous
people you know something like soccer
common words so if your password that
you choose for your ex's point isn't
even a word at all let's say it's just
3j k 82 11 and you know like you have a
bunch more thing like that explanation
dollar sign whatever do you think that
this is gonna be in anyone's password
dictionary it's not because this is kind
of what we're seeing this is what
they're going after vulnerable passwords
and unless they're going to brew
force you in other words just try every
combination possible then I mean it's
pretty much impossible that someone has
this as a possible option so use not
words but just random stuff if it sounds
stupid but if you just start pounding
away your keyboard if you don't even
know what your password is gonna be then
there's no way that they're gonna so
long passwords number symbols uppercase
lowercase and you're gonna be very
protected in the sense that they're
probably not going to guess it with the
dictionary now another thing that I want
to point out is this say that you are
you know just at your school you just
write that so what we saw is whenever
anyone knows the password to this access
point then essentially what it means if
they're smart enough is they can read
everyone's traffic between their device
and the network it was super easy to
decrypt and read so let's say that this
is you this is your laptop at school and
obviously you can't change the password
for the network I mean you can get in
there technically but you're not
supposed to and if you do it you're
gonna get in trouble so you go to the
systems administrator Beck hey dude you
need a better password and he's like
it's fine it's fine so now you're in a
pickle in just so we can remember that
let me drop that is d where's pickle
ever all right so now you are in a
predicament so you want to be able to
securely you know transfer data back and
forth but you have no control over the
password because the access point it
just doesn't belong to you now the best
thing that you can do in my opinion is
you can use something called a VPN now
in order to understand what a VPN is and
it's actually pretty simple the concept
at least is you first need to understand
what a proxy is and if you guys already
know all about this stuff and you know
just go ahead to the next tutorial but
for those of you who don't
this is golden information that you're
about to get and this is not only useful
for securing your traffic but also it's
good you you guys are gonna see why it's
useful so basically what's going to
happen
let's say that you're at school still I
don't know if you guys can see that all
right
so let's say that you're at school and
this is your computer and you decide
that you want to go to Netflix so this
server is Netflix or whatever website
now to do your good watching movies but
the systems administrator after a few
days he's like oh whoa whoa all of this
data is coming in the school network and
it's from this dude right here and he's
looking at Netflix when he's supposed to
be doing schoolwork so he's probably
gonna put up something called a firewall
now a firewall is basically a way that
says okay I am gonna block this person
from reaching another destination so he
can either just block your computer
which he doesn't do that often more
likely than not he's gonna say okay I
know Netflix IP address which is you
know like 2 - 2 - whatever all right so
he says that anyone on the school's
network whenever they try to go to this
website then we're just gonna block it
so it's basically a way to say that no
one is allowed to go to these sites I'm
gonna look at the traffic if anyone's
going to the - - tattoo tattoo server
then it's blocked so now you have no way
of getting to Netflix from inside the
school so a proxy server is basically a
middleman in other words okay we cannot
go to Netflix no matter what the systems
administrator blocked this server so we
cannot access that server however what
we can do is we can access a proxy
server so like I said a proxy is a metal
man in other words what we're gonna do
is we're gonna say hey proxy Jesus Oh
Mike I have this voice-activated thing
called Alexa from Amazon and
I think I think she just thought that I
said her name and she started talking
now I'm like what that f is do you hear
that she keeps talking and I thought
someone was inside in my house Wow freak
the crap on me alright where was I okay
so instead of accessing a server
directly you can say hey proxy server
can you go ahead and get some Netflix
movies for me so it's pretty much a
server that acts on your behalf
now the systems administrator he's gonna
monitor your traffic still and he's
gonna say dude to do okay Bucky is not
going to Netflix okay this is good so he
doesn't know that what you're doing is
you're actually having this server right
here
go get the movies for you and bring them
back so all he knows is that you're not
going to this boom roasted so that's how
proxies working that's how you can get
around going to you know sites that you
probably shouldn't be going to at school
so why did I say VPN is what you want to
do well a VPN is essentially like an
enhanced proxy because not only is it a
website that X on your behalf but all of
this data between you and the proxy or
VPN server is encrypted so two benefits
first of all anyone monitoring you
anyone looking at you like that they're
gonna have no idea what websites you're
going to and the outside because it's
just gonna look like you're always going
to this one server no matter what you do
you're always just going to one website
right there
now since the data is encrypted even if
they were to look at that traffic it's
all gonna look scrambled the only people
who know what you're really going to is
you and the VPN so once it gets to the
VPN I mean you can go to ebay you can go
to Reddit you can go to the New Boston
com you can do that and that and there
is no way that you're and it's not only
like the people like your Systems
Administrator at work or school it's
also the government it's also it's also
your internet service provider they have
no idea what you're doing so
I recommend that you get a VPN even if
you you know are over secure network
even if you're just at home they are
awesome I love them I highly recommend
them and yeah there you go
recommend that you learn more about them
but there you go that's the basics of
how you can protect your own traffic
from being spied on on a wireless
network and if you own that wireless
network get a nice secure password and
you'll be golden so thank you guys for
watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
