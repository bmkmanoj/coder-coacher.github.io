21st C++ tutorial and before I even get
started with the story I just want to
mention one thing that you guys probably
notice already and that is I don't have
return 0 at the end of my main and that
is because I just found out that well
let me say this in the old C++ ways you
had to have that return 0 statement but
now the new version or whatever whenever
you don't include return 0 at the end of
your main C++ just assumes you return 0
after the last statement so you know if
you go ahead and type your program you
can either put it if you're you know
old-school programmer or you cannot
include it and it would just assume you
have return 0 but for the rest of these
stories I'm going to exclude it so you
know don't forget that it isn't there so
anyways let's go ahead and get to the
heart of the story and that's assignment
operators and increment operators now we
already know well let's go ahead and get
a variable first set X equal to 10 looks
good so we already know we can do
something like this X plus equals 10 and
this is basically the same as writing x
equals x plus 10 so then whenever we let
me just go ahead and this line and print
it out we go ahead and we get 20 just
like that so what it does is it takes to
this value adds it to X and sets equal
to the new X variable so I already told
you guys plus equals is a shortcut I
also want to go over all of them so when
you see them in program you don't get
confused X well let's change this to 5
it's weird if they're the same number so
X minus equal 5 equals 10 minus 5 and
assigns that to the new value of x so
let's go ahead and see that that is 5
now if we go ahead and see multiplies
equals what this would do is do 10 times
5 and set it equal to 50 and the last
one without getting in the weird stuff
is divide equals 5 and this of course is
2 so what this does is basically takes
the old value of x it divides it by this
value and sets it equal to the new value
of x so aside from that there's one more
and I rarely use it
this way I hate writing in like this and
I hate seeing other people rate it like
this because it's confusing this is
going to be a bad example because ten
divided by five is two with no remainder
so it will be zero but if we go ahead
and throw like three something like this
what this does is it takes the old value
of X divides it by three and it stores
the remainder in one so now X is going
to be equal to one right like that so
those are all your assignment operators
plus minus multiply divide and modulus
which is remainder so now whenever you
come across them in programming you'll
understand what they mean so now what I
want to talk to you guys about is those
increment operators so let's go ahead
and get new value 20 that's a little bit
better it's my favorite number so you
know how I told you guys that you could
do something like this X plus plus and
this was the same thing as adding one to
X
simple enough right not exactly because
there are two different versions of this
increment operator and I'm going to show
you the difference with little
differences between both so let's go
ahead and see out X n line let's go
ahead and run this and take a look at
what happens so our initial value of X
was equal to 20 and then we ran this
line of code and it printed 20 all right
and then we ran this line and it was
equal to 21 well what the increment
operator is doing whenever you write
variable with plus plus after it it's
going to go ahead and run this line of
code and then it's going to add 1 to
that variable so runs this line of code
X is still 20 then when it gets done
running it assigns 21 to X and then it
runs this one so that's why it was 20 21
so saying are a simple enough what's the
other version the other version is this
whenever the increment operator is
before the variable like plus plus X
instead of X plus plus what happens is
you can see whenever you run the program
it goes 21 21 so what this does before
the variable is it adds one first and
then it runs the statement so adds one
right here and then
runs it so right here the value of X is
getting set to 21 and then run it 21
still 21 21 so it's basically if your
pluses are before the X it's going to
add one before it runs it if your pluses
are after the X it's going to run the
line of code and then add one to the
variable so it you know if you're
building a program in you're off by one
you know maybe you're running a loop or
something and you're always off by one
chances are your pluses are on the wrong
side either this side or that side so
this is a common error and it's actually
something that people have a hard
concept understanding but just remember
where you add your pluses indicate when
it's going to add one before or after
the statement and if you remember like
that it'll be simple enough so now you
understand that you don't need a return
zero
you understand all these scuse me ooh
assignment operators that's actually
kind of a tongue-twister assignment
operators assignment operators just
hyman operators got it and now you
understand increment operators which is
plus plus X and X plus plus oh and one
other thing
there's also minus minus X and what this
does of course is subtracts it and X
minus minus but I don't need to show you
guys that
so just remember those four different
increment operators all those assignment
operators and you don't need a return
zero anymore and you'll be good to go so
thank you guys for watching my twenty
first tutorial no idea what I'm going to
cover in the next tutorial but it's
going to be sweet so thank you guys
again and I will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
