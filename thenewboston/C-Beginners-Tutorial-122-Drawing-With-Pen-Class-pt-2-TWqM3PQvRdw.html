tutorial that I'm making for the noob
awesome and in this tutorial on the
continued showing you how do you depend
class a little bit more so for this
tutorial you're going to need to have a
panel to set the last tutorial and then
a user clicks it have a new pen be
created it doesn't really matter what
the width of the pen is or what color it
is I just have a currently set to red
and it's true it's who picks it wide and
just create new graphics for your panel
so we can draw so the first thing that
we're gonna want to do is we're going to
draw an arc and an arc is or drawing an
arc is very similar to drawing a pie so
or the person that calls for is a patent
so it's gonna pass through our pen here
and then the X is the x coordinate where
it's going to start all this will be 20
and 20 for the Y as well the width is
just like how wide the arc will be I'm
just going to make it to 20 actually
I'll make it 100 and a hundred for the
height as well alright so this is where
it gets into like similar to drawing a
pie so the start angle is like the angle
that it starts at so just slip the pipe
we set it to zero it would start like
out here and then it would like start
sweeping around this way so I'm gonna
put it to viewer right now and then the
sweep angle is how far around the circle
see so how big the arc you want it to be
so if you wanted to have an arc that was
like 20 degrees and you just put 20
right here so I'm gonna get 90 right now
and this will just make it so you'd be
like see it and understand what I'm
talking about so now maybe bug here and
just click it you just draw an arc yep
it just drew an arc and as you can see
it's 90 degrees it starts right here
since we had to be 0 and then it sweeps
around clockwise so if we were to make
this be a hundred and eighty degrees
right here then
it would just start here and then sweep
around till up there yep perfect and if
we made it 360 I'll just draw a complete
circle yep perfect
all right the next thing that I'm going
to be showing you is a draw Bezier I'm
sorry I don't know how to pronounce that
but basically it's just a spline and a
spline is basically just a curved line
so if you put like four points down here
what you're gonna have two is just gonna
like make a curved line similar to like
a snake I guess it's over isn't it
passed through our pen here then our
first point I'm creating a point I'll
make it be just one 20 then another
point at 30 60 new point at 40 70 40 and
last point on the 50 80 all right so
hopefully this makes it curved yep
curved line and you can mess with this a
little bit like changing the points
around
so we'd your ass they can drastically
change one of these like maybe it's like
a hundred or something you'd obviously
see huge difference in the curve yeah
all right and the last thing that I'm
going to be showing you how to do is
draw a line so there's going to be G dot
line and this is very simple you just
put pass through your pen the starting
point I'll just make that be zero zero
yeah zero and I'll make the ending
coming see I don't know 100 all right so
now I may be bug here and click we
should just get a line that's straight
down yep and you can obviously mess with
this just like anything else so one make
this B well I don't know like it's like
not as steep a slope let me just change
the lie and yep perfect so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial so see you
