tutorial and in this tutorial I know
it's going to be an exciting one because
we're going to be talking about blurring
and image now unlike last time where it
contrasted it blurring pretty pretty
much um like kind of blends all the
pixels together to give it a nice blur
so the first blur I'm going to be going
over I'm gonna be going over three of
the most useful ones um the other ones
are kind of repetitive but anyways I'm
going over three so get ready for it go
ahead and select a layer I have this
sign layer selected like I'll zoom up a
little bit more there we go and the
first one we're gonna be able is it's
called the Gaussian blur so go ahead and
put filter and make sure you got your
layer selected filter blur Gaussian blur
it's one of the ones in the middle and
this is probably one the most useful
blurs and the one that gives you a quick
control over your blur now the radius is
pretty much the amount of blur you have
right there so anytime you see radius in
the settings it's pretty much the amount
of blur and as you can see blur does
pretty much exactly what you think it's
going to do blurrier image so that's um
one way to blur your image and probably
the one we're going to be using most
there's another blur that I use quite
frequently filter blur motion blur right
here and what this does is it gives you
the appearance that the camera was
moving during the time where you took
this image or took this photograph so
the distance is pretty much exactly like
you think would be it pretty much would
be the speed of the car or whatever when
you're moving so for example when I went
this morning to the library to get the
book along came a spider by James
Patterson and they didn't have it so I
was mad and then I asked how many people
before me and they said five people are
on the waiting list so I was depressed
and I drove 80 miles an hour down a back
road and cried myself to sleep
if I took a picture then then the
photograph would probably look like this
but anyways enough about that I wish I
had that book so go ahead and cancel
that in the less blur I'm going to talk
to you guys about is called a lens blur
so go ahead and Chris filter blur Lens
Blur and what this blur is is it is
designed for let's see how can I explain
this when people take photographs with
cameras and you get that natural optical
blur this is what that tries to recreate
so you have a bunch of settings here I'm
not going to go over all of them because
some of them are useless but your
preview right here is you can either get
more accurate or faster preview faster
is faster and it's also pretty accurate
so just leave it on faster the depth map
the source if you have none it'll do
everything if you have transparency it
will only affect the transparent pixels
and if you have masks
it'll only affect your layer mask and we
don't have a mask now so let's just
leave this to none the radius again is
the amount of your curve and this is
this entire box are here with radius
light care of rotation and shape this is
represents the iris of the camera so
pretty much just leave it whatever it is
and radius is the strength of your blur
now this noise is sometimes people like
to add noise because sometimes like
having a perfect looking image isn't
realistic so and if we're adding a lens
blur then sometimes that's the case so
I'm going to go ahead and cancel this
I'm going to show you a useful
application for this now say we wanted
to I mean if you're looking at this
photograph right now this sign is in
focus focus the sign is in focus and
everything else is pretty much in focus
but sometimes if we're taking them with
professional camera this wouldn't be the
case so what we would want to do is
apply a mask to this and make the
background out of focus so you know when
sometimes the foreground is in focus and
the background is out of focus let's do
that right now so let's first go ahead
and add
by using this add layer mask and now I
see a white box pop up right here now
anything we drop with black is going to
be the mask and anything you draw the
white is going to be not a mask so go
ahead and pick your quick selection tool
cuz I'm too lazy to paint it all and go
ahead and actually I want to add my
selection right here and let's go ahead
and zoom in a little bit and I want to
get this oh yeah I want to get this
white border too but I see a problem
already that the little Stoops on the
apartment are white what's up oh yeah I
got some see so I'm gonna have to oh got
some more embarrassing so once you
select all that and you also probably
want to select this pole too then you
can go ahead and deselect your selection
right here so let's go ahead deselect
deselect the select and deselect and one
more damn and now let's go ahead and
paint this all black so make sure we
have black selected and there a paint
bucket tool go ahead and paint this
black actually turns out white but if
you look in your mask right here
you can see that it's a black right
there now we have another problem so
let's go ahead and we can deselect that
by holding down control and press D and
if i zoom up on here you can see that
some of these edges are like not perfect
like the quick selection tool it ain't
perfect it's pretty good but I ain't
perfect especially this edge so what we
can do is go ahead and press filter blur
Gaussian blur and now if we go ahead and
blur this a little but you see they kind
of smooth out a little bit so that
already helps so I'll go ahead and press
ok now let's go ahead and back to our
main picture right here zoom out and now
what we want to do is keep this in focus
but keep everything else out of focus so
now make sure you don't have your mass
selected make sure you have your layer
selected and go to filter blur
blur and now under this instead of none
we can go ahead and press a layer mask
and as you can see already it takes that
mask and whatever was black he uses it
as a foreground so it takes that mask
and it doesn't blur anything in our mask
it only blurs what's outside the mask so
if I make this radius make it a little
bit stronger and toggle off and on so
talk about off and on you can really see
that this would probably what would
happen if you had a camera lens like a
professional photographer which I am NOT
but I can pretend be one in Photoshop
and it would bring one object in the
focus and another job object out of
focus so that is your quick tutorial on
and of course you wouldn't really want
to bring that out of focus probably
something like that would be more
realistic but for the purposes of
YouTube I'm going to blow this baby up
so you guys can definitely see so
anyways that's your quick tutorial on
how to bring some objects and focus some
objects out of focus using different
blurs and I'm gonna probably go to
another town and look for my Along Came
sweater by James Patterson book sent in
it since is nowhere in my city I am and
I need to find it because I want to read
it real bad but you cannot keep wrecks
into Photoshop and that's what I'm going
to be doing so thank you guys for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
