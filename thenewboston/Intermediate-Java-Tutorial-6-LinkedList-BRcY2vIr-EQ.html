welcome to your sixth intermediate Java
tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be going over something called
linked lists now what a linked list is
is it's pretty much the same as a list
it actually inherits from the interface
list but it also has some other methods
of its own so let's go ahead and get
started
I already imported everything from util
and that's where we need everything from
in there so the first thing I want to do
is give myself a little space and we
need to be building two arrays that
we're going to be converting in the list
and then from that list we're going to
be doing some methods too that you can
only do linked lists so let's go ahead
and make a string array and I'm just
going to name mine things and just go
ahead and type like it actually doesn't
matter how many so you actually probably
need like more than five in each list so
let's go ahead and put apples noobs
pwnage saspa how do you spell pwnage
just like that good enough and let's see
what it's baked in and let's go add one
more thing goats oh well you can
capitalize it if we want to no biggie
and so now we have a string or an array
of things which everything is spelled
wrong I believe and that's what you want
or else it won't work so next go ahead
and make a list in where obviously we
play putting string bat into it and just
name it list one and set this equal to a
new linked list and this is of course
string data too and don't forget your
parentheses if yet and now from here we
have a list one that's empty in an array
of things and trust me they're just
random things so now let's go ahead and
make an enhanced for-loop string X
we're going to be using the array
strings and what we want to do is take a
list one and add each item of the array
which is temporarily X in the list 1 so
what this does right here is pretty much
populates the list one on with the thing
in string so now list 1 in the array
things are identical so let's go ahead
and make another list just so I can show
you guys how to combine them so string
and make things 2 and set this one equal
to come on cursor get over there get it
there you go
sausage and you actually need to type
these things or else the program won't
work bacon I know it's weird your
compiler knows we can use a goats again
but this time I fell right in again
since this is a list it doesn't matter
if you have duplicates or not and I
forgot to check my timer so I have no
idea how far into this tutorial I am and
of course you can't see that's pretty
cool if I click on tools' no hummus with
it later and one last thing is Harry
Potter so this is looking pretty good
now let's go ahead and put list is go
ahead and put string and just make a
list too and what this is going to do is
is going to be new linked list as well
with course string data and we're going
to be eventually putting well we'll just
do right now for string Y as things to
what do we want to do we want to add all
the elements from that things array into
the list number two so go ahead and add
everything from Y and it should be good
so things to list two out why we'll
figure out if we did something wrong
later don't feel like checking it right
now so now what we want to do is take a
list one and add all not at all
list number two and look at all is built
in method it takes everything from this
list as its parameter and adds it to
listless
so now let's number twos the same still
but list number one is now combined of
all these things right here since we
added everything to it so now we don't
really need list number two so we take a
list number two and set equal to null
just to free up some of our memory and
don't forget list number two equals null
and good so now what we're going to be
doing in this tutorial is we're going to
be building it's either three methods
print me which is going to take a
parameter of list one we're going to do
removed stuff which is going to take a
parameter of list one and two locations
so two to five in what this method is
going to do and again we're going to be
building these are going to get air
right now what this is going to do is
it's going to remove the stuff and list
one from two to four yeah I know I have
five but two to four because you know um
it starts at zero and you know how that
is and let's go ahead and print that out
print me and print list one again could
just copy it and paste oh why didn't I
and now the last one reverse me is to
contain earless number one and reverse
it so again we're going to be building
all of these in the next tutorial again
can't get done this tutorial first it's
going to print out your list then it's
going to take stuff out from it and
print it again just to show you that did
and this reverse me is pretty much it's
going to reverse everything and just
print it out so that's why we don't need
to print me after that so thank you guys
for watching this tutorial and the next
tour we're beginning the good stuff
building all of our custom methods with
um you're going to be learning all new
methods that are in the linked list
class so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
