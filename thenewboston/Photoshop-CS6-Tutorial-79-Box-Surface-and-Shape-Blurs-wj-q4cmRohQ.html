Photoshop cs6 tutorial buddy blackford
here and i'm gonna show you how to use a
couple different blurs today actually a
few different blurs so three different
ones I'm gonna show you the Box blur the
surface blur and the shape blur and
those are all under the filters or if I
go to filter and then I go to blur I can
pick those different blurs so the first
one I want to start off with is the Box
blur and you just apply the blur right
to your layer and it's going to start
blurring immediately where you have the
ability to change the radius of the blur
and that's pretty much it so what a box
blur is is it pretty much takes a looks
or it takes a look see yet pixels and
then compares it to the pixels around it
and then averages these colors together
to create a blur effect so just to let
you know that the Box blur is not a
realistic looking blur effect it's
mainly used in special effects so if
you're going for something that's not
realistic looking then go for the Box
box blur okay so you can adjust the
radius down here the blur gets larger
when you move the radius to the right as
you can see here and it just gets
totally blurred out into gray if you go
all the way out and it gets less blurry
as you move to the left so that's for
the box blur so remember that the Box
blur is non realistic and it just
averages the pixels around and blurs
them appropriately
the next blur that we're going to go
over we're gonna go over the surface
blur so filter blur and now let's go to
surface blur which it is down here at
the bottom and it brings up the same
thing but now we have a threshold here
so the surface blur is a really good
blur
and it pretty much smooth pickled pixels
that are different but it leaves out
like really drastic changes such as
edges intact if you have it set up
correctly so if you don't want to really
really blurry and you want the edges to
be intact you just want to move have the
blur radius and threshold set down a
little lower than they are right now
because right now it kind of looks
cartoony doesn't it all right so the
surface blur is good for reducing noise
it's good for smoothing out skin like
getting rid of wrinkles and retouching
photos a little bit so you don't want to
go too crazy on your blurred because
it'll look weird obviously so I'm gonna
show you how to use this blur properly
too let's fix up like some of the skin
and stuff like that so I'm gonna hit
cancel real quick and what I'm gonna do
is duplicate this layer here we go and
I'm gonna apply the surface blur to the
top layer filter blur surface blur okay
now what I'm gonna do is adjust the
radius and this decreases or increases
the amount of blur applied to the image
so I'm just going to increase it just a
little bit three that looks kind of good
you can still see it's a little over the
top
but we're gonna fix that the threshold
slider here decreases or increases like
the shift and brightness I guess so if I
move it all the way to the left you can
see what it does you can see how it's a
little different looking if I move it
all the way to the right
you can see how that looks there so it's
kind of hard to explain you kind of just
you mess with it a little bit a little
bit to figure out where you want your
blurred
so here we it's a kind of blurry on here
looks like some of the skins been
blurred out so it's like not doesn't
have like any imperfections and many
imperfections and stuff like that so I'm
gonna hit okay now this doesn't look
real so what we're gonna do is just
lower the opacity of this layer so it so
this layer below that hasn't been
affected shows through so let's go click
on our top layer lower the opacity down
to something like this and if I look in
between these you can see that the skin
blurs a little bit
now this isn't you're not going to use
this as the only way to smooth people's
skin out and everything like that this
is a supporting way to use a to smooth
the skin and just one way that you can
use surface blur on images so let's move
on to the next blur which is the shape
blur so I'm gonna delete this layer copy
off and now we're just stuck we're left
with our original image that has nothing
done to it let's go filter blur and
shape blur and the sheet blur is based
on the shapes that you already have in
Photoshop so it could be based on this
heart let me bring this down a little
bit well the lowest I can do that is 5
and yep between five and 1000 I don't
know why they don't just don't go down
to like one or something like that but
that's Photoshop probably has a good
idea they made the program I didn't so
if you want to add more types of images
that you can blur off of just click on
this over here and then you can replace
your shapes here by adding a new ones
you can add in different types of shapes
that you have already in Photoshop like
let me bring in like nature or something
like that
and if I click okay it's going to
replace all of them if I hit append is
going to add them to the end so I'm just
gonna hit append and now I've got the
different shapes here like this one
might be cool well well they just give
the like different blur effects so you
go through and pick which ones you kind
of like and obviously when you're doing
this you can't really see the actual
shape within the blur which is probably
a good thing because who really wants to
see that honestly but the way that the
image is affects the blur so we got this
lightening shape here let me click on
that you can see our blur is a little
more drastic and if you compared like
the blur to the Lincoln shapee it's like
jaggedy now if I go to something smooth
like this teardrop the blur is a little
more smoothed out so that's what this
shape blur is good for doing so I'm just
I'll just hit OK and then then we've got
our blur on here and remember that you
can duplicate the layer and lower the
opacity if you would if you would like
to add the blur in a lesser amount now
honestly I don't really use the shape
blur a lot but I'm sure it has some good
uses like when I was showing you if you
want a really intense blur like use that
like lightning bolt 1 or if you want a
smoother blur use the teardrop like I
was showing you but I kind of feel that
there's other ways to get better blurs
which I'll end up showing you in another
tutorial that'll be coming up soon so
just keep in mind those different types
of blurs box blur surface blur and shape
blur that we went over and use them to
your advantage what do you need to so
now that you know about them you can use
them and implement them into your
document so thank you for watching this
guys and actually I'm thankful that you
guys are watching the videos and give me
feedback and stuff like that on them so
I'll see you guys later
in the next tutorial it's gonna be
awesome and I look forward to seeing you
guys at it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
