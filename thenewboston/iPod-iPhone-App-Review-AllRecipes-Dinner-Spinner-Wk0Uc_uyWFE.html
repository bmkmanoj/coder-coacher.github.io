in this review is for a request i got
for this all recipes com dinner spinner
and so I got this review and I actually
downloaded it and now I am addicted to
it what it is is it pretty much allows
you to choose it just gives you a bunch
of random recipes I guess a bunch of
ideas so for example say you wanted to
cook a main dish soo i usually just main
dish and say i have some fish in my
fridge and I don't care I meant how much
time it takes any and then you go ahead
and you view matches and this is going
to give you all the matches for the
requirements you met and you can of
course slide grilled swordfish no don't
have any fish fillets like to see that
grilled salmon that's what I want so I'm
going to view this recipe and then it's
going to load that recipe and then it's
going to of course give the recipe what
you need the summary of it the
directions have to do it it's pretty
important right there and also
nutritional information as well so how
cool is that and look at these a bunch
of different comments too I have one
thing I do yeah yeah I'm not going to
read that Elizabeth so uh thanks anyways
but another cool thing that you can do
is anytime you come across a recipe you
like and this is probably my favorite
feature this app you can go ahead and
add it to favorites right there if I can
click it and it says add to favorites
and then anytime you don't want to go
back to all the recipes you got it right
there grilled salmon and that's going to
stay on your iPod no matter if you shut
it off or not so that's another cool
thing I like about this that you can
pretty much save all the recipes that
you like and that's it so I mean this
goes on through Wi-Fi then it has like a
million idea so you can do this forever
and never run out of ideas and another
cool thing about this is that it's free
so I mean how awesome is that so you
also get featured recipes right here and
I mean it's pretty self-explanatory but
again it's free and it has more recipes
that you could ever imagine so that's
why I'm going to
go ahead and write this app an 8 out of
10 um again I mean I don't really have
any complaints with this and I think I
forgot your name but I think whoever
turned me on to this because it gave me
a lot of no ideas and if I only had two
will go and make half of these then I
would be a fantastic cook but I don't
and that's it for this walkthrough so
