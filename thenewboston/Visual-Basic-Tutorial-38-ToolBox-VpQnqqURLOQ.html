slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at the toolbox and some of
the tools that we're going to be using
throughout my tutorials now I'm not
going to be covering in depth the tools
that we're going to be using the most
and then just give you a brief
explanation of the other tools so let's
go ahead and open up our toolbox here
you can either click this or press ctrl
X now you can see here that we have a
pointer now you won't have to use a
pointer very often which is it's pretty
much just a mouse that you can move over
your form and you can already do that by
default now here we have a button and
buttons you can just add them and you
can set a bunch of properties form one
that I wanted to mention was the dock to
where you could have it fill up the
whole screen just by changing the dock
or you can anchor it to the left let me
resize the form here
you can have it anchor to the left or
you can have it anchor to the right or
is at the top or to the bottom anywhere
you'd like now we've got a checkbox and
it has the check and then it has a label
next to it now you can take out this
label and just leave a checks checkbox
there if you want we've got our check
list box which is just a list of
checkmarks set and you can add more
check marks by changing the items in the
collection so just say hello we'll add
the new Boston we'll add on live gamer
and if we click OK you can see here that
it adds a couple check check boxes to
our check list box let's go ahead and
delete that and we will delete the check
box there we've got a combo box which
allows you to arrow down and select from
a certain number of items now this is
useful if you want if you want to put a
text box but you want to only let them
use certain things you would use a combo
box so let's say you're making a
temperature converter you can have it
select the type of temperature it is so
instead of having them type it in
themselves you can just have them select
from a combo box
we've got a date/time picker which going
to be used to let's say you're making a
calendar you want to get the date and
time that they set something you can go
ahead and do that you got label which is
just a text label here and all it does
is just sit there it doesn't move it
doesn't do anything it just displays
text on the form now we have linked
label which can link the user to a
website or something else we have a list
box which is very useful we're going to
be using it a lot my tutorials it can
hold a number of items strings and you
can access those through the name of the
strings like what what it's equal to or
you can access it through the index and
you can add items by coming down to the
items and the properties and looking at
the collection so we'll just add some
stuff here let's just add some random
characters and if we click OK you can
see it's added to our list box now once
this goes down past
this mark right here is going to add a
scrollbar automatically for you now
let's go ahead and delete this list box
right here that will come down to a
ListView which is similar to a list box
but you can have it separated into
multiple parts and you'll be learning
more about that when we create the
favourites viewer we have mass text box
we have we have a month calendar we have
notify icon which is an icon down in
your system tray that can show balloon
tips to people if something happens in
your application got your numeric up
down to where you can select numbers got
picture box progress bar radio button
got your rich text box text box tooltip
so a tooltip is not you cannot see it on
your form but you can set a tooltip and
connect it to something so let's say we
have tooltip one we want to connect it
to say hello so whenever the user
Mouse's over say hello for a certain set
amount of time a little tip will pop up
and it'll tell them what that button
does we got treeview we got a web
browser and then you've got a bunch of
other stuff down here that we will use
later on in other tutorials we won't use
all of it but you can go ahead and play
with some of some of them if you want to
see what they do we are going to be
using a timer which also like the
tooltip is not shown on your form but
it's very useful and we will be using it
later on in other tutorials so you can
go ahead and take a look at all the
things that you have inside of your tool
box if you don't understand what some of
some of them are then go ahead and leave
a comment or you can go ahead and look
those up on Google if you want there's a
bunch of websites out there that will
help you with that so thanks for
watching guys and stay tuned for the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
