61st Toro and in the store I'm going to
be going over the curve editor so go
ahead and open up matinee and if you
don't see the curve editor already you
can do so in a couple ways if you go to
window unreal curve editor or you can go
ahead and hit this toggle curve editor
button it's going to bring up your curve
editor now by default we need to tell
the UDK which track we want to graph so
if we go ahead and select the track in
the lower right-hand corner we're going
to see a black box go ahead and click
that box and it's going to go ahead and
graph those curves for that track now if
your view is kind of messed up like that
go ahead and just set this button fit
view to all and it's going to make your
curves up here nicely in the screen so
let me explain the guys what the curve
editor is your curve editor is basically
graphing the movement of your curves
like on a sheet of graph paper we're
left to right this axis along the bottom
symbolizes the time so this is zero
seconds one second 52 and a half seconds
right there and this up and down this
negative 15 negative hundred symbolizes
the distance so the reason we're only
getting one graph is because our model
is only changing on one axis so let me
go ahead and make this more apparent by
unchecking these if you go ahead and
select this first one you can see that
it's graphing the red or X movement of
this door so this r g and b blocks be
box excuse me graphs the x y and z
movement of this model so if we go ahead
until you take a look at the x movement
which is the left to right movement of
our door check it out whenever we play
our animation this store is not moving
left to right at all so that's why we
get a key frame right here in the key
frame right here no change whatsoever if
we go ahead and take a look at the Y
which is forward down the hallway and
backward towards me our door is not
moving in either of those directions so
that's why we get zero change in Y
however
if we take a look at Z which is up and
down that's what direction our door is
moving so as you can see it starts out
location 00 and by the end of three
seconds it's about at negative 240 at
about a second and a half it's about
negative 120 so as you can see we can
visually graph the movement of our door
so again one last time this r g and b in
other words red green and blue value
line up with this x y and z axes of your
door so since we're only going to be
working with z or blue we can only go
ahead and graph that so we don't
accidentally grab any other key frames
now let me talk to you guys about the
different types of graphs this graph
right here if you hover over it is
called curve auto clamped it's kind of
like the default curve because it gives
you a nice acceleration again I said
that if something's graph and it has no
change then it's going to be graphed all
on the same line if it's straight up and
down then it means it's moving really
fast so this store is going to start out
kind of slow and then right about here
it speeds up a lot and then by the end
as you can see it kind of slows down so
this is a natural looking crap because
whenever you're driving the car or
something you don't go from 0 to 60 in 0
seconds you kind of need to speed up
there get up to speed and then when you
you know our kind of accelerating fast
and you need to slow down you slow down
gradually you just don't hit a brick
wall so this is kind of a natural
acceleration if you do want a constant
speed throughout you can go ahead and
select one of these keyframes and hit a
linear graph and now your graphs going
to be a linear a constant speed again I
really don't like to use this in you
know maybe in some rare cases but you
typically want to use this curve auto
clamped now you can also see right next
to your key frames you have this little
white box right here if you go ahead and
grab this you can manually adjust your
curve as well so now what this is doing
is
I made something called an overshoot
since this craft or the basic movement
of my door is going from 0 to 300 so
whenever I bring that curve above that
check out what happens it kind of starts
out is zero and then it kind of loads up
changes in the positive distance so it
kind of goes up before coming back down
so that's called overshooting maybe if
you want to you know make a gun load up
or someone punching in they you know
pull their fists back then this is a
good way to do that but typically you
want to work with either curve auto
clamps or just auto or maybe you know
linear on this constant has straight
left and right or straight up and down
again it's all depends on what you're
looking for so that's basically the
different types of curves and also if
you drag these little white things and
by the way these white things right here
these white boxes are called Bezier
handles so if you ever hear me talking
about Bezier handles like grab your
bezzie a handle that's what I'm talking
about this little white box right here
it means manually adjusting your curve
so that's basically all there is teach
on the curve editor I don't think I'm
missing anything so well if I am i guess
i'll talk to you guys about it in the
upcoming tutorial but for now you guys
now how need okay how can I say this you
guys now know how to use the curve
editor so congratulations so for now
thank you guys for watching or we get
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
