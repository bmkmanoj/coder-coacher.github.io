extra exciting After Effects cs6
tutorial today is a special one where
I'm going to show you how to make a
creepy-looking logo with some smoke in
it and we're gonna use particle systems
and all that jazz so I want to show you
real quick what I made this was all made
in After Effects cs6 there were no third
party plugins that you have to download
or anything like that so let's take a
look at it real quick
now the different components here are
obviously the background here which
looks like cement or something like that
and we have the the text here which is
kind of crawling like that we got the
smoke and we got the different colors
and all that stuff so I'll show you how
to make all that well get a little close
out of that and the first thing we're
gonna start out with is by creating a
new composition I'm gonna name mine I
always name my first comp main since I
already have a main already in there
that I'm gonna use as reference I'm
gonna name this one main too and all my
settings here I only needed to be around
15 seconds and hit OK now the first
thing I'm going to want to do is create
my background so the first thing I
wanted to show you guys was how to get
like a grungy background so just type
into Google grunge and then go to the
images and you can find a bunch of
grungy backgrounds make sure it's has a
decently high resolution and just import
that into your into your composition and
we'll go from there
I'm gonna move my comp into my comps
folder don't need so everything is all
nice let's delete that I don't need that
so I'm gonna go to my images and my
grunge is here it's called oh three now
you can see it comes in and has color
and everything like that so the first
thing I like to do with my grunge is
scale it up
and that looks right around there looks
pretty decent and we need to make it so
it's not all colorized so I'm gonna put
a an effect on it called hue saturate
and we're gonna desaturate it so color
correction hue saturation and all I need
to do is move the master saturation down
and I moved it to about here or I have
some color in it but not a lot I don't
have it in like those purples in there
anymore there's a little bit of brown
but that's okay I like it that way the
next thing I want to do is crush it
actually I want to make it darker by
crushing the white levels in the in the
grunge picture so the next effect I'm
going to add is effect color correction
and levels and levels is one of the more
important color correction tools that
you'll use I'm gonna move this over so I
can see what I'm looking at because the
histogram here was covered up and what
I'm gonna do is move this white arrow
right here and it's going to affect the
output white and I'm just gonna make it
a little darker
maybe a lot darker
I found that around 75 was good for me
maybe yeah around 70 75 seems good now
that's pretty dark there and that's good
for the color of our background I'll
twirl these up so they're not all over
the place the next thing that we should
make is a vignette so that the edges of
the background are like darkened and it
looks more like creepy the way that
we're gonna do that is I'm gonna create
a new solid layer layer new solid I'm
gonna make this one black and I'm gonna
call it vignette vignette is how it's
spelled make sure it's the comp size by
clicking on this button and hit OK I'm
going to take the ellipse tool and
double-click and it's going to create a
circle that's the size of the comp I'm
going to invert that so it's only on the
edges I'm gonna turn off my mask there
and I'm going to kotor down into my mass
properties and head over to mask feather
and then we're gonna feather this out
it's gonna darken it also so
right about there seems pretty nice now
you got these creepy edges where it's a
very dark and it looks like there's a
spotlight kind of on in the middle so
I'm gonna split these tutorials into
sections because the last time I made
this tutorial I spent hour making it and
then the recorder screwed up and I was
really really mad so my mouse didn't
even move across the screen I figured
you guys wouldn't like that so I'm
redoing it so we're going to end this
part of the tutorial and then I'll see
you on the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
