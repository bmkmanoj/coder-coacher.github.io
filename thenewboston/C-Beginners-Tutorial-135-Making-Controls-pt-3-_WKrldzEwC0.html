thirty fifth c-sharp tutorial that I'm
making toward New Boston and in this
tutorial we're going to be making our
button look gloss and so the button it's
made by Microsoft it make basically this
looks like glossing well it's really
good and if we make it really large we
can see that all that that really is is
there's just a bottom rectangle on it
it's darker than the top that's
basically what we're going to be doing
alright so let's just go back to our
button class and draw a rectangle on the
bottom right here so we're just gonna
say gee for a graphics bill rectangle
we're going to be using a solid brush so
it's the same s and then x coordinate of
our rectangle will be zero because we
want us to be on the left side right up
against the left side here of our button
then or the height though we want it to
be halfway through the button so I'm
going to say the height divided by two
so if the entire height of this was ten
let me divide that by two we get five so
that would be the middle of the bottom
and this will draw a line basically
across here and then down alright so
there's the same this height or the
height of the button divided by 2 then
for the width you want it to be all the
way across the entire button so we're
just gonna save this style width and
then for the height you want it to be
from a half way down the button to all
the way to the rest so basically from
here down so we're just gonna say this
fight divided by 2
so since this is 5 right here if the
whole thing is 10 so it's basically
starting at 5 and then we're just going
to want to draw the 5 the rest of it so
it'll start at like 5 then we go like 6
7 8 9 10 let's draw all the way to the
bottom and then we'll just have a
rectangle halfway down our button right
here all right but right now if we build
it won't work because we use the same
brush which means in the same color but
instead of creating
ruch we can just change the color of
this brush right here so we can just use
the color property inside the solid
brush class to change that so it's going
to say a stock color equals and then
we're just have it be basically a
variation of this control color so we're
just going to say colored dot from no
color and then we're just gonna say
known color dot control of dark that's
basically just a darker version of the
control so now when we build here we see
that yep there is there's a darker
rectangle on the bottom of our button so
we're just gonna want to change that so
it's not a dark look as you can see
right now it's pretty dark so what we
can do right here is say dot control
light and you'd think that control light
would actually make it lighter on the
bottom well basically since it already
drew this rectangle right here with a
regular control it's just going to draw
on top of that rectangle so it will
actually be darker because it's
basically combining the two colors
together to make a darker color so now
let me build you can see that yep it's
actually just a bit lighter and it
doesn't look as dark now there's only
one problem though since we use the
label you can see like the cutout of the
label on our gradient or on our lost
part of the button right there like on
the bottom part of it and in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
change that but for right now let's just
change the colors around so let's say if
we wanted to make this B color dog blue
or something do glue for the basic color
and then if you wanted to make the other
color be like a lighter blue you can do
that like color dog sky blue or
something let's just see how this looks
so no build well I don't know but yeah
you can just mess around with it so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
so
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
