another app review and this one is for a
game called action potato so believe
that or not so what you need to do by
the way dumbest game ever is you need to
touch the pots and catch the potato just
like that and we have to do it deadly is
not catch you turn this helped a little
bit I can't catch a blue potatoes or
else it'll destroy one your pots so
pretty much just try to get the best
score ever and the closer you and if you
catch your heart by the way you get an
extra pot so this is pretty much of the
game action potato let me try to catch
one there we go so it goes 40 20 and 10
so that's pretty much all you need to do
and I think the same creators and happy
jump made this so that explains why it's
so terrible and this is one game that i
do not recommend getting because it's
not fun at all I mean look at it would
you get this game so the one thing is
cool about it is that it's free in other
than that would not recommend it so i'm
going to write this game let's say a 4
out of 10 and hopefully you didn't need
a review to find out you don't want to
buy this game so i'm going to go ahead
and kick some more potatoes and you can
check out my other videos so thank you

to my channel and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
