Android tutorial for the new boss in
what we're gonna do in this tutorial
well we're actually gonna set up our
database we're gonna create a subclass
and use the database helper for the most
part to set up our database so we have
all our variables set up and now we just
think it kind of reference everything
pull everything together and we're gonna
use a class that's gonna help us build a
database again you don't want to you
know create your database on a user
interface thread so we're gonna create a
new class that's gonna handle it for us
so we're just gonna call this class DB
database helper something like that and
we're gonna extends the class called SQL
Lite open helper open helper and just
you know set up a new pair of brackets
and again as you can see it's just a
private class that's static and we just
have to import our SQL Lite open helper
and we're getting an error because we
need to add a constructor for this class
again a constructor is something that
just helps you know it's kind of like on
create method for the most part when
this class gets accessed so we're gonna
set that up and actually I don't even
like these other parameters for the most
part so we're just gonna use the context
and you know delete these here because
we aren't gonna use them for this
constructor for the most part and now we
just need to kind of set up or give our
settings back for our superclass so as
for now we're getting in there as you
can see it takes in for the parameters
the context which is being passed into
our constructor a string which is going
to be our database name a cursor factory
which if you scroll down you can see
null for default which we're gonna use
and then the version name because you
know you can upgrade or you can have
different versions of your database so
let's just get everything set up so the
super is happy for the most part for our
SQLite open helper just make sure that
class is
happy with what we're you know passing
into the super here so again our name is
our database name which we called hot or
not database which the variable name is
database underscore name and again for
our for our Factory we're gonna say null
for the cursor and the version since we
have our database we set up that you
know variable up there as well we're
gonna say database version and that's
just passing some you know some
information into our superclass
because you know I hope wants some
information so we're gonna make it happy
alright so now we're getting another
error because we need to actually
implement some classes from from this
method SQLite open helper so we're gonna
say add unimplemented methods and it
adds two methods for us the oncreate
method which takes an SQLite database DB
and upgrade method and basically what's
going to happen is the first time we
ever create a database is the only time
this on create method is gonna be called
after that it's just basically going to
call this upgrade method and then we're
gonna you know cycle it through as well
alright so now we need to set up a
couple more variables one we're gonna
reference this database helper class
we're going to create an instance of
that and we're also going to set up
context that we're gonna use for this
class so I know this might not be making
a whole lot of sense yet but I'm gonna
try and go through go somewhat slow
through this throw through this SQL
database little example that we're gonna
build because it seems like a lot of
people have trouble with SQL stuff but
what we need to do is create a like set
an instance of this class so we're gonna
say DP or whatever you guys label that
class as DB helper and we're gonna call
this our helper something like that so
it's just an instance of this class
we're also going to set up a context for
a class so we're gonna say private
final context our context or our our
context and one last class we're gonna
actually reference SQLite database class
so we're gonna say private SQL light
database and our database so we set up
some more variables and I'll just kind
of explain them as we go when we use
them and in the next tutorial we'll set
up our on create method here for our
database as we need to add constructor
for a whole public class called hot or
not and it's basically gonna get the
context of that's being passed into this
class and just set it up to this private
variable so we can work with it that way
so just go below you know our database
helper class we're just going to again
set up a constructor that's going to be
public and we're gonna say hot or not
and it's gonna take in a context I call
C and all we're gonna do is set our
context which is the context of this
class equal to what's being passed in so
there we go
I don't know if you guys quite
understand what we're doing yet but I
promise you you will well at least I
hope you will I'll try and go pretty
slow through all this SQL Lite database
stuff because it seems like a lot of
people have trouble with this so you
know as for now you guys might be
confused but hopefully you'll understand
more as we go in the next tutorial we'll
actually set up or on create method and
set up our kind of our database so I'll
have have a good one guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
