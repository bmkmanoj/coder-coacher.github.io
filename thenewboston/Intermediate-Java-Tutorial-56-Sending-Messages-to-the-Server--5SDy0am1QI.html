to teach you guys how to use the client
to send messages to the server so send
messages to server and the first thing
we need to do is we're pretty much
fixing the errors from now on so of
course the first one we get is CIN
message which pretty much takes whatever
you typed into that little chat area and
sends it to the server
so private void send message and of
course it's a string that gets passed in
and we'll just go ahead and treat it as
message now what we want to do is of
course put it in a try-catch statement
and hopefully this catch never run so IO
exception exception and what can we put
we'll just go ahead and put chat window
a pen so again guys this is what happens
if you get an exception or something
went wrong so what would be a good thing
well um something messed up sending
message pus-y house why not
so now okay that's the part where we
hopefully don't see and I forgot a
semicolon as well fix that right now so
now we can go ahead and throw something
in the try so just like before what
we're going to be doing is we're
basically going to be creating a string
object and sending it through our output
stream so in order to do that go ahead
and tap into your output output right
object and what object you want to write
well first right who is coming from
client -
message so basically whatever message
you write such as hey what's up it's
going to be treated as this message and
this little client indicator is just
what appears like where your username or
or you know your name would appear just
to let you know in the chat window who
it's coming from and you guys will see
that later on so now of course output
flush flush the rest of the crap down
the pipe and of course what we want to
do is show the message on the screen so
so message so even though it gets sent
through the stream it doesn't show it or
display it until you actually call this
message so show each one on a new line
client and you actually need to put this
in between quotation marks new line
client message and I just like to add
space as usual so there we go so now
that is basically how you send a message
to the server or to the other person
whenever you want to you know send a
message through them pass it in here and
then it says ok I'm going to say client
because that's who it's coming from and
then stick your message on there and
then we're going to send it to them
basically anytime you want to send a
message you have to write the object and
stick it in the stream the output stream
and then this makes it display on your
GUI basically so in the next story we're
going to be doing is since we got this
error message that says dude you need to
code the method show message if you're
going to use it we'll say ok so we'll do
that in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
