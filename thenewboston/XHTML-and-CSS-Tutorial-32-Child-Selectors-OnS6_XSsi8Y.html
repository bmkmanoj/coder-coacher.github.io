name is bucket and welcome to your
thirty-second XHTML and CSS tutorial I
hope you guys enjoyed my British accent
I know I did but anyways in this
tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
guys about how to style a child selector
now let me give you guys a quick
overview of what I mean by child first
of all I'm not talking about a child
selector like you decided that you and
your wife want to adopt a baby so now
you have to select a child that's not
what I'm talking about
not in this tutorial at least maybe I'll
do that in the next tutorial one let me
just my microphone there that's better
so anyways a child in terms of XHTML is
a tag that's inside another tag so for
example you see how whenever we make
tags like body they have to be within
the HTML tags or whenever we have the
style tags they have to be within the
head tags we can't have head style head
style they have to be inside one another
so the relationship I'm talking about is
this see this head the head is a child
of HTML so HTML would be the parent and
since head is inside it would be the
child body is also a child of HTML since
body is inside HTML style is a child of
head since style is inside head so you
can say style is the child head is the
parent there now you guys should
understand what I mean by a child and a
parent now with that being said I'm
going to show you guys how to style a
child selector for example if you come
across this bro I want to style links
but I only want to style the ones inside
paragraphs well we can't just go ahead
and make a style for links because
that's going to apply to all of them in
order to say alright we want to apply
only to the ones that are in paragraphs
we need to do something something
special so let's go ahead and first and
foremost make three different links
right here just go ahead and put like a
href equals
HTTP the New Boston comm and now let's
go ahead and just write it like first or
something like that so first of all
we're just going to have a regular link
on the screen let's refresh this make
sure it works and when we click it it
takes us to the greatest website ever
the New Boston comm so anyways let's go
ahead and make two more so first and
foremost we have a regular link on the
screen nothing special so now let's go
ahead and make a paragraph PP oh man I
crack myself up and now let's go ahead
and put this link inside PP and R all
right second I am so immature is
ridiculous these are the most
unprofessional
tutorials you have ever seen in your
life probably but hey they're pretty
good so and last let's go ahead and put
another one in the header so now you're
saying Ari I have these three links and
I want oh yeah God probably do this
third so first second third so here's
what they look like the first one is
just regular plain old text the second
one is inside a paragraph and the third
one is inside the header so right now
they all look the same and you're saying
alright I want a style only the links
that are inside paragraph tag so I want
to style basically only these so in
order to do that like I said we can't
just go ahead and style all the links or
else it's going to style all of them
what we need to do is say this all right
first of all inside the paragraph tags I
want to style all the links now let me
you know kind of put this in another
terms you're saying are a a it's pretty
much all right all children a with the
parent of P or basically all link tags
inside paragraphs I'm going to go ahead
and style those and you use this with
the greater than sign so greater than
sign pretty much means relationship
whenever a make a link has a parent of P
aka paragraph I want to style you so now
let's go ahead and apply some styles
let's go ahead and put color red
and maybe but like font size 30 pixels
not that it's a lowercase Oh
embarrassing so let me go ahead and add
this last semicolon refresh and see what
we got
check it out now CSS went through look
for all the links now we're inside the
paragraph is this link inside a
paragraph nope is this link inside a
paragraph yup so I'm going to style this
one is this link inside a paragraph no
it's inside a header so don't touch that
one either
and it go ahead or excuse me and it went
ahead and applied the style to those
links so that is not only how you talk
in terms of relationships child parents
but also how you can style pretty much
not only a link but basically anything
you want depending on what it parent
what their parent is and another quick
bit of information I wanted you guys you
guys are probably saying alright
if head is the child of HTML then does
that mean
style is the grandchild of HTML yes it
does in technical terms that's how it
works so um hTML is the grandparent of
style took us um
grandchild child parent or grandparent
grandchild depending on what you're
referencing um you know that has nothing
to this tutorial but you know I got a
couple extra minutes might as well give
you a nice little tidbit of information
so anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial um thank you guys for watching

I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
