47th udk tutorial and this is going to
be a really quick tutorial because
before we go on any further with kismet
I need to talk to you guys about adding
comments to kismet because later on
we're going to be building big kismet
sequences and things are going to get
all jumbled together and we're going to
be connecting wires all over the place
and at first glance things can get kind
of confusing so I'm going to teach you
guys how to add these things called
comments and helps organize and visually
see your kismet a whole lot easier so
the first thing I want to teach you guys
is about object comments now each of
these things like this event the sound
this toggle this variable each one of
these things is an object and you can
add a comment individually to each one
of these so for example if we have a
million different light switches in our
you know level or on our sequence we
need to be able to identify each one in
look at this trigger 0 trigger one
trigger to that can get a little bit
confusing whenever you have a huge map
so go ahead and in order to add a
comment right above this you just go
ahead and select it in under sequence
object you have the optional comments so
I'm just going to go ahead and add you
would add something like oops easy caps
locks bathroom light
switch or something like that now just
go ahead and focus away and now you can
see you have a comment above it this has
bathroom light switch so you know if you
think about it this way in your house
you have a bunch of different light
switches and if you just go ahead and
identify my trigger zero trigger 1002
then it will get kind of confusing but
if your mom says go ahead and turn off
the bathroom light switch then you be
able to identify a lot easier so I don't
need to tell you guys the importance of
comments in that sense so let me go
ahead and just comment some of the rest
of these object comment on the sound is
just what sounded we have um I think we
it was like a gun sound so that looks
good right there and for this toggle
we'll just go ahead and write turn
lights on and off that's pretty good and
for this variable we'll just put like
light bulb so now even if you don't know
kismet at all you can pretty easily see
what's going on alright here's a
bathroom light switch and now whenever
you touch it a gun sound place and also
when you touch it it turns lights on and
off and this is your light bulb right
there so again if you were working as a
team then comments would come in handy
so much because they don't have to go
through each one of these vents look at
the properties and say alright what's
this one do try to figure out everything
so aside from just object comments you
also can have something called group
comments so in order to select group
remember you go ahead and you hold ctrl
+ alt on your keyboard and then you
select a group of objects so now I have
all four of these objects selected now
we can go ahead and either right click
and add new comment and there's another
way but I'm just going to go ahead and
show you guys the easiest way so with
all of those selected go ahead and hit
right click new comment and will just
write something like um
lighting system and now go ahead and hit
okay and it draws a box around all of
these objects and calls it lighting
system so now you don't even have to
look at all of these piece by piece you
can just send this to somebody and they
know all right all of these objects make
up the lighting system so this is a
whole lot easier to see then you know
just opening a kismet for the very first
time say someone handed off the project
to you and try and figure out what
everything does so again comments are
going to come in handy so much not only
when you're working with a team but when
you're working with yourself and you
have huge levels it's going to help you
organize a whole lot so again one last
time to select the group objects just go
ahead and hit ctrl + alt and drag and
then you get a group of objects selected
so aside from this I just want to go
over this real quick this sequence frame
right here the size is of course the
size of the frame the border with I
usually like to bump this up to two or
three and for the sake of this sorel let
me just make it five or something and
this makes your border a little bit
thicker because I don't really like one
because one is the size of these wires
so I know I just like a little bit
different personal preference and the
other two things I like or well of the
fill color I don't even get in that the
border color is I usually like to change
this to something a little bit different
so by default it's black like that so
let me go ahead and change it to like a
blue or something hit OK and now it's
blue so whenever you have a bunch of
different systems rigged up trust me and
I know I can't really demonstrate this
because i only have one system but
changing your border color two different
colors is incredibly useful especially
when you zoom out you can easily see
well just trust me change your border
colors to different colors it's going to
help you out a lot so anyways that's a
tutorial on comments like I said a real
quick tutorial to help you guys better
organized and better visually see what's
going on with kismet so you don't have
to figure everything out
every time you want to go back and
change something so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe it now
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
