tutorial and for the new boss and again
my name is Travis what we're going to do
in this tutorial is basically set up our
net next application so we're going to
create a new XML file we'll going right
clicking file new other and then Android
XML file you guys should be familiar
with this we're going to call it an or
email XML finish and basically I'm
trying to think of some new things that
can introduce you guys to with XML so it
doesn't get boring what we're going to
do is we're going to add some edit text
plain text you're like what this isn't
new you are lame which is fine but
whatever I'm actually going to introduce
you guys to is something called a scroll
view so at about 6 yes 6 is good 6 edit
text and then we're going to add a text
view above each one nothing too awesome
here and then we're also going to add
let's see the date and time thing we're
going to add analog clock right here
just because we can now what we're going
to do is we're going to kind of separate
some of these code or some of this code
with some linear layout so I don't know
what that statement is all right and so
first we're going to break it into some
linear layouts also we're going to add a
button regular button right after our
edit text or last edit text and there we
go and then we're going to set separate
these with three linear layouts so I'm
going to set up a linear layout again
nothing new for the most part linear
layout and we're going to close this
statement off here and delete it here
and then just set it up Android
basically I'm going to copy and paste
the same set up here it's going to be
vertical orientation again nothing new
for you guys and match parent and then
we're also going to just copy and paste
this for edit button for a button I mean
just for a one button class and
then we're also going to copy and paste
it for the analog clock as well and
we're going to change all these the
height to them for actually before we do
that we're going to go into add our air
scroll view so right here this top
linear layout this where we're going to
add our scroll view and basically the
scroll view will allow us to scroll
through all of our items within the
linear view below the scroll view has to
have a linear view for the most part
within its parameters so we're just
going to add a scroll view again Android
layout width equals fill parent and
Android layout height is going to equal
fill parent as well
all right so we have our scroll view
setup and we want to wrap our linear
view so we're going to copy this line
and paste it below this linear view now
we're going to do is we're going to set
up all of these other linear views that
we set up to have fill parent for the
height as well and then we're going to
use the weight method that we're
familiar with
oops so kind of a boring tutorial just
get everything set up and introduce you
guys to the scroll view for the most
part and the analog clock which I just
threw that in there randomly so there we
go we basically have that set up and now
we're going to add the weight to our top
or a main linear layout that holds
everything else so we're going to say
Android weight sum equals 100 and let's
say we're gonna give this scroll view
weight layout weight and afraid that's
gonna happen okay layout weight equals
let's say like 20
thirty let's do thirty sorry and then
we're gonna give this we're just going
to copy this line here we're also going
to add some weight to this linear layout
that holds our button and we're going to
give this one forty and then also this
last linear layout we're going to give
thirty as well so 30 plus 40 plus 30 is
a hundred which we want and let's check
it out
that's pretty good for the most part I'm
also gonna basically add this analog
clock fill parent for the width and the
height and you know set this button up
to center but you guys don't really need
to know that as you can see we only have
three text views but you'll be able to
scroll through these text views I will
crap what our application works so there
you go that's kind of introduced juicing
you guys to the scroll view I know we
want quickly but hopefully it wasn't too
complicated basically all you need to
know is a scroll view takes a linear
view with within its parameters and make
sure the linear view that's within the
parameters is set to vertical
orientation so you can scroll vertically
so thanks again for watching guys I'll
catch you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
