39th PI game tutorial video in this
video you're going to find out I'm a
dirty liar so I say we were going to do
a CX freeze but actually I meant to do
pausing first so we're actually going to
cover pausing real quick in this video
and the next video we'll talk about
converting your scripts to an executable
so with that let's go up to the top here
and now we want to have another function
and this function is going to be our
pause function so we're going to do a
define pause pause is any empty
parameters and then the way that our
cause functionality is going to work is
basically an institute its own little
like mini instance of PI game so when
the user hits P to pause uh it's just
going to say pause and then press C to
continue Q to quit whatever and it's
just going to keep going through that
until someone presses P or Q or exits
out of the screen so it's going to be
like a little mini instance of our game
loop so with that Stu go ahead and just
hop into it so first of all we're going
to start with paused equals true so a
lot like game over equals false that
kind of stuff and we're gonna say Wow
paused what do we want to do well bow or
pause basically we want to go through
the event loop and see what the user is
doing so we're gonna say for event in PI
game dot event dot get anti parameters
um what do we want to do and then now
we're going to check for the PI game
duck quit and now we're going to check
for the key presses
so if event dot type equals PI game dot
all caps quit then we want to go ahead
and run a PI game quit and we want to
run it just straight-up quit and that's
that and then we're going to say if
event dot type equals a PI game dot and
all caps key down then we're going to
ask if event dot key equals PI game um
dot K underscore C for continue
basically we're going to say
is a equals false so this while loop
will finish and then our function will
be done
Elif event dot key equals PI game dot
uppercase K underscore Q what do we want
to do well we want to do a PI game dot
quit to uninitialized pah game and then
we'll run our quit and that's that now
outside of this for event loop we're
going to come over still within our
while loop though and now we're going to
say game display dot fill and we'll fill
it with white then we're going to say
message underscore to underscore screen
and what do we want that message to be
well first of all we want to let them
know like hey you hit P it's paused so
paused and then what color do we want it
will want it black and then where do we
want that pause we're going to do
negative 100 pixels up basically well
100 pixels up not negative hundred
pixels up pixel size equals large then
we want to notify them like how do we
get out of this screen and so message
underscore to underscore scream and this
will be a press C to continue or Q to
quit again we'll make this black and
this one will move it down about 25
pixels that should work out and that's
it it's going to be the smallest text oh
I got itchy back no smallest text so we
don't have to actually define size
because small was the default function
parameter so that's that now we're going
to do a PI game dot display dot update
update there we go
and then we're going to do clock dot
tick and I'm just going to do 5 again it
really does not matter you could put
your typical frames per second in there
but I just think it's kind of silly to
be running through 30 frames per second
on
on a pause screen I mean the very
definition of pause is like we're
pausing the game so let's go ahead and
not be running through 30 frames a
second or more so clock I take five done
now that's all fine and dandy our pause
function should in theory work unless
I've got a typo in there somewhere but
now we have to actually be able to call
up a pause function so we're going to
come down to our game loop and hold on
well game over equals true okay so
basically here where we where we've
defined for event so after the game exit
stuff and here's where we're like
turning our snake around and stuff like
based on key presses so now we can just
throw in another L if statement so come
down here and we can just say L if event
dot key equals Pi game dot K underscore
P so K press the P key uh we just want
around the pause function that's it so
um let's go ahead and save and run that
and see if everything is working as we
might expect press C to play or moving
around happy Dappy okay you press P it
paused
let's press C to continue we continue
and just to show you that it's not like
restarting the game or something it
really is pausing let's get a couple
apples here good and we'll hit P to
pause C to continue nice still working
on our same score and nice pause Q to
quit awesome so that's working out now
the only thing I would add to this is I
know some way of notifying the user that
you can press P so you've got C to play
Q to quit and then I would say P to
pause so
um we want to go up to our game intro
somewhere up here I think yeah so our
game intro function come down here press
see a player our cue to quit I'm just
going to say proceeded play P to pause
and then or Q to quit easy enough so now
we run this the user can see well you
see to play P to pause Q to quit sweet I
can play it I can pause easy enough okay
so um sorry for being a dirty little
liar but I did want to cover pausing
it's pretty necessary um yet very simple
to add pausing to your game now there's
a couple of things obviously some people
may want to pause and still show you
could pause without clearing the screen
if you really wanted there's a few
different things that you could do for
that you could have event handling but
not update the screen so you do one
quick screen update and then you have
your event handling loop that will exit
so there's no reason to keep updating
the screen at all really but you can if
you want so um and what you could do is
have the paused over over the snake and
maybe I'll show you guys how to do that
and not the next video but the video
after that's the next one I'll show you
guys how to make the distribution just
so I'm not dirt liar but we'll do that
and then I'll show you I think how to do
a pause screen maybe over everything
something like that so anyway stay tuned
for those an exciting video next I
promise this time it's for route
so okay stay tuned for that thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
