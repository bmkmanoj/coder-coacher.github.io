slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
talking about class libraries now when
big companies work on an application in
either Visual Basic or C sharp or other
languages they can't just give every
person a big huge copy of the project
file and make them go through and look
and see what the program does and how it
works so what they do is they'll split
that work up and do a whole bunch of
different people now one person may
write a class another one may write
another class and then you have what's
called class libraries now it's a
basically a library of classes it holds
a bunch of classes that can be used in a
program
and it's all encapsulated into a dot DLL
file so that the person using it does
not have to know what's inside of it or
what it does they should be able to just
use it and see what everything does
because you either used good names for
your classes and functions and methods
or you come within commented them right
so um you can create class libraries and
use them in other projects and you don't
have to see what the code is and you
won't have to change anything in the
code it'll just work so let's go ahead
and make a new project
so we'll go ahead and instead of
selecting a windows forms application we
will select a class library and you can
see that it says up here a project fray
for creating a vb class library which is
a dot dll so we'll just call this
enemy's library now if any of you have
watched any of the new boston's c++
tutorials you may remember he made some
tutorials about inheritance using
enemies and villains and stuff now i'm
going to be using that same concept in
here so in case you've already done that
it'll be familiar to you and I feel that
it's a good way to teach the class
library class libraries and we're going
to be making a game out of it so now
this is loaded let's go ahead and we
will add or we'll rename this right here
to class one VB this is automatically
generated by the class library project
we'll call it enemy VB and you can see
that it changed this for us right here
now I'll just zoom in some okay so let's
go ahead and create a constructor for
this so we'll just go ahead and set
health equal to 100 now we haven't made
the variable health yet so let's go
ahead and create a private variable
called health so we'll make it an
integer and we'll just leave it like
that okay so when an enemy is
constructed it's going to set their
health equal to 100 now what we want to
do is let's make some stuff um that the
enemy can do so we'll go ahead and do
let's see sub attack and then we will by
ref
user health as integer so whenever they
call attack what it's going to do is you
it's going to require an integer to be
passed in here and it's going to
reference it so it can change that
integer so let's go ahead and create a
let's create a random generator so that
we can randomly generate from a series
of attacks so well go ahead and type dim
jinn as new random so now that we have
our new random let's go ahead and pick
between a certain number of attacks so
Djinn dot next int or next and what we
want to use is the min value and then
the max value so the min value is going
to equal to one the max value is going
to be equal to let's leave it at five
for now because we haven't thought of
any attacks now let's set set some
default attacks for the enemy
so we'll come up here and we will create
an array so private attacks and we'll
just give it let's say two so zero and
one and we'll set it equal to well we
don't need that right there we'll set it
equal to let's say punch and kick so all
of the enemies will have the ability to
attack now let's just create this as
default attack okay so when they attack
we want to generate a random number
between let's say 1 or we'll do 0 &amp;amp; 1 so
it's going to pick between either 0 &amp;amp; 1
then what we want to do is we want to
set user health
equal or something now we have to know
what to set or we have to know what to
take away from user health so let's say
let's do a select case so we'll start
off by typing select case and we want to
do we want to use the number that's
generated right here so what we can do
is we can just cut this and paste it
right there so it's using that number so
let's see looks like it's not wanting me
to do that so let's just create a
variable so dim attack num as integer
and we'll set it equal to this okay so
now we're going to use attack num so
select case attack num let's do case 0
so if the number is 0 which is which
would correspond to punch in here
because the tax at at index 0 we want to
just take away let's say 1 from health
so user health
- equals 1 so this way we don't have to
know what user health is we can just
take away 1 from it then we'll do case 1
and then we'll just take away 2 for a
kick so user health minus equals 2 let's
go ahead and get rid of that ok so now
we have our default attack let's go
ahead and let's just add one more
property that will get our health so
we'll create a public read-only property
so they can only get the health they
can't change in it they can't change
anything in it so let's just do health
as integer now you can see that we have
already declared health up here so let's
just call it int health so that we can
refer it
to refer to it in this class as in
health they won't be able to see it
outside of this class
so if we use health for the property it
will make it easier for somebody else
using our class library to know what's
going on
so we'll just return int health okay
let's see here everything's looking good
okay so go ahead create this project if
you haven't already and once you do that
type in this code because we're going to
be using this a lot in the upcoming
tutorials we're actually going to be
making a game using this you see here
that I've got some enemies and then our
hero is going to be Popeye so once you
put this code in go ahead look over it
make sure you know what it does and then
once you've done that go ahead and move
on to the next tutorial and we're going
to continue working on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
