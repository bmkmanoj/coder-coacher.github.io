going to do some formatting of some text
I went to this website google or and
summons a way to generate some some text
to put into a web page if you're trying
to just put in some filler text so I
went here and copied this and I pasted
it inside of a regular HTML document as
you can see and when you preview that it
has no styling to it whatsoever and you
can see that inside the web page so this
is what it looks like inside the website
we're going to now add new CSS rules
actually first let's do this let's
highlight each paragraph here and let's
use inside our insert here is our insert
tab we go to the top we are going to
wrap that in a paragraph tags so we're
going to do that for each paragraph
first second and third over here refresh
our CSS and now we're going to add a new
CSS rule want to call it p one text
stands for a paragraph one text and
we're going to say it's in this document
we're not going to make an external tell
see right now we're going to leave it
internal say okay and now we're going to
get some properties for this tutorial
we're just going to change the type so
let's select one there and apply say
okay and now let's create another one
it's the same thing instead of p 1 2 x
AP to text for paragraph to say okay and
change it to something different apply
and ok go back here and let's add one
more CSS rule will call this on p3 text
okay one more essay times you're going
all right why now that we have our
internal style sheet here we have p1
text p to text and p3 text so let's
click inside of our first paragraph tag
for our first paragraph and let's give
it this class for the second paragraph
will give it this class for the third we
will give it to this class now as you
can see each paragraph has different
text and we did that all within CSS you
can see that right here what it's called
I'm sorry now we can also add a lot of
other styling to each individual
paragraph now we can go over here inside
of our CSS selectors and we can let's
change the font size make it a little
larger you can see that it got a little
bit larger something a little bigger
than that there we go we can also change
the font weight to all these different
options we'll leave that blank for now
font style normal italic oblique let's
say oblique now let's also change the
color
all right so why as you can see it did
all of that for just a little bit of
coding which we didn't even do ourselves
all we have to do is select these
different options inside CSS CSS rule
definition so I'm going to run this now
we see what it look like before with no
style at all and save it and reload this
page and now you can see that it's all
been changed or CSS the next tutorial
will be going over a little bit more
with the way you can do with CSS we were
just working with some simple type
changing here and make sure you keep
watching and subscribe to our feet
