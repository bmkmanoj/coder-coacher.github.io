slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
continue working on our paint program
which like I said before comes from the
book beginning Microsoft Visual Basic
2008 by theorem Willis and Brian Newsome
published by rocks so I just want to
give them full credit and if you don't
know what this is then you may want to
go ahead and move back to the first
tutorial to where we start building this
program otherwise you might get lost
so we have our must inherit class
graphics item with our color is filled
and rectangle so let's just go ahead and
make some public methods or subs subs
can also be referred to as methods if
you didn't already already know that you
may have been confused at some of my
previous tutorials when I called subs
methods so we'll create public must
override sub draw this is going to take
some arguments so we're gonna need by
Val graphics as graphics so they're
going to need to pass a graphics object
to this draw sub now you can see that it
says it must override so what this means
is that every class that inherits from
grass graphics Island must override the
sub draw so they must have another draw
sub for themselves or else they will get
an error and they won't be able to
compile so what this does is it lets
let's say you make a a couple classes
from graphics items you have a different
draw for each one of those but if you
create a a variable a type graphics item
in your form on V B and it is use
polymorphism so you use let's say
graphic circle if you call graphics you
grab a circle circle object draw it's
going to run because graphics item also
has draw now if that confuses you a
little bit that's perfectly fine
you'll learn about more about that later
on we've done that in some previous
tutorials polymorphism is a simple
concept but sometimes it can get pretty
confusing so don't worry about it right
now if you don't understand that so
let's go ahead and create another sub so
public sub set point now this is gonna
do is it's gonna set the point where of
where we're gonna draw our circle so
this is gonna take some arguments so
we're gonna need the exposition and
we're going to use it an integer and
then by Val Y as integer and we're gonna
need the graphics size so by Val
graphics size as integer and then we're
gonna need the color
so by thou graphics color as color and
then we're gonna do graphics is filled
so by Val graphics is filled as boolean
okay so now we're going to set the we're
gonna create the rectangle that we
declared up here so we've got public
rectangle as a rectangle now when we
create a rectangle we're gonna have to
make it object of it so we're gonna say
rectangle equals new rectangle so we're
creating a new rectangle object and this
is going to take some arguments now what
we're going to use is we're going to use
the x position the y position and the
width and the height which is the second
of the two options for creating a
rectangle object so we're going to use X
which is passed right here now we're
going to subtract it we're gonna
subtract it we're so track graphics size
/ - from so let's just make sure it's
graphics size so it's going to be X -
graphics size / - so it's going to take
our our point X and it's going to take
away the size of the graphics which is
we haven't created yet I believe it's
going to be an enumeration that's gonna
have either like medium small or large
so this math right here is a little
complicated you don't really have to
know how it works you can play around
with this number right here divided by 2
and see what it does so basically what
it does is I'll try to explain it the
best I can instead of when you click
it's going to draw a circle down like
when you clicked in our previous video
with the square you created it at the
top left corner of the square and
everything went down
and to the right from that well what
this algorithm right here does is it
makes it so when you click you're
clicking in the middle of where the
circle is going to go instead of the top
left corner so we're gonna do that for
the Y as well
so Y - graphic size divided by 2 so this
is gonna do the same thing to where
you're clicking in the middle of where
the graphics is going to be drawn
instead of the top left corner and then
we're gonna do for the width we're gonna
do graphics size and then for the height
we'll do graphics size so what this is
gonna do is it's going to give us a
perfect circle each time so let's say
graphic size is equal to let's say 10
this one is also going to be 10 so it's
gonna be a 10 by 10 rectangle and when
you draw a circle inside of that 10 by
10 rectangle which is a square you're
gonna get a perfect circle and now if
you didn't use the same sizes right here
you would get what's called an ellipse
and we don't wanna have to deal with
that so we're just gonna be making
a bunch of circles by using the same
graphics size so we have our set point
our exposition our wide position the
graphics size and we're gonna have the
graphics color which is a type color and
then the is filled
I wish checks to see well which tells
this set point if it's going to be
filled or not so go ahead and put this
code in if you haven't already and
before we're done
we're gonna have to add two more things
to this sub so we're gonna set color our
variable color up here equal to graphic
color and we need to change this to
graphics color so it's going to set our
color variable equal to whatever they
pass to set point so that color will be
updated to the new color and is filled
is going to be equal to graphics is
filled so it's going to update the is
filled is filled baleen to the new one
that is passed to our set point so if
you have any questions please leave them
in the comments I'll try to monitor
these and solve as many problems as I
can
I might be a little hard with 200 videos
so just be patient and once you're done
putting this code in go ahead and move
on to the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
