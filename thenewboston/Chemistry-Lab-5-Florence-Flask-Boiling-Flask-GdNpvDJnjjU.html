Bucky and welcome to another awesome
chemistry lab video in this video I want
to talk to you guys about the boiling
flask now the boiling flask is the piece
of glassware that looks kind of like a
well-well I think you guys get the idea
and the reason that this looks so
similar to a bong is because actually a
bong and a boiling flask were designed
in the same kind of way because they
have the same type of job now these were
specifically designed to of course you
can't tell by the name to boil liquids
boil solution and the reason that these
are a little bit better rather than I
don't know an Erlenmeyer flask or you
know just an ordinary beaker whenever
you want to boil something is first of
all they're made to resist thermal shock
and by that I mean not only the glass is
typically a little bit stronger since
we're going to be heating it up but also
the shape of it it was made in a way
where they are pretty much less likely
to crack or chip
whenever you heat them up now a boiling
flask is going to come in one of two
types the first type is a flat bottom
boiling flask and this obviously is a
flask with a flat bottom and in order to
use this you need to set it on top of a
wire mesh and this is usually on an
o-ring or an O clamp on your stand
so again set on the mesh and then put it
over the flame and that will heat up the
flask the other kind is our round bottom
now obviously whenever you have a round
bottom you can't just set it on a flat
surface or else it's going to tip over
so these need to be held up by clamps at
all times now the most common sizes for
boiling flasks are 250 milliliters or
500 milliliters if you are to only get
one I recommend 500 milliliters because
those are the size that we're going to
be using more commonly for our lives now
another thing I want to recommend is to
get high quality glass now I know I say
to get high quality glass all the time
but it is super important whenever we're
talking about boiling flask to get a
nice high quality glass why is that well
we don't want our glass
to crack or chip whenever we heat it up
and obviously a boiling class we're
going to be heating it up quite a bit so
that is why it is very important now the
last thing I want to mention and I don't
mean to sound like Captain Obvious but
you need to use tongs whenever you're
working with a boiling flask I can't
tell you how many times I saw people get
burnt by touching hot glass so please I
know it's obvious and I don't mean to
you know talk to you like you're stupid
or something but just remember to use
tongs
so anyways think guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
