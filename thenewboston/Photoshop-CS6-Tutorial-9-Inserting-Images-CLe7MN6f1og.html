Blackburn here with another Photoshop
cs6 tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to go over opening up images and
how to place images in your document or
insert them into your document
so the first way in the easiest way to
open up an image is come up to here and
click on file and then we're going to go
to open and that way you can come up to
your where you can browse your computer
and then I'll come down to my folder
where I have some of my stuff image is
and then I'll just open up an image that
seems halfway decent this one seems good
and then this will open up a new image
with its actual dot within its actual
document size and everything like that
so you can check out the size of this by
going to edit one I got a let's go to
click on this and we go to image here
and we go to image size and you can see
that this is three thousand six hundred
forty eight by two thousand four hundred
and thirty two pixels and then the
actual document size is fifteen point
two by ten point one three three inches
and then you can change these to
whatever you feel like using instead of
maybe pixels it's got a resolution of
240 pixels per inch so that's how you
can see what's going on there now maybe
you already have something open or you
have a document here that just has
nothing in it so the way that you can
add images into the document easily this
way is going to file and then we're
going to come down here to place
and this is good for putting images in
that are smaller than the actual size of
your actual size of your canvas so let
me grab something like this here and
then it places it in the image for you
now you can move it around if you if you
need to and you can resize it over here
in the corners or on the sides now if
you hold shift when you're resizing it
will constrain the proportions so it
doesn't get all the story then you hit
Enter once you have it in the spot that
you want and that takes off the the
tools for like resizing it and now your
object is placed and you can still move
it around and everything like that if
you would like
my Photoshop is lagging right now real
so when I click and drag is going to
like see if I got to hold it or
something like that yep just hold it and
now I could drag it wherever I want
some reason it has some type of leg but
that's fine now when you place your
image it'll create a new layer for you
and when you open up your image your
layer your actual image will be the
background if you open it so those are
the different things going on there now
you can switch between the two things by
clicking on these tabs up here and that
will switch between the two documents
that you have opened now another way for
you to bring an image into Photoshop is
you are able to just drag it from like
your folder and if I bring my folder
over from my other monitor over here I
have a bunch of images in here now if I
take one of these images and just drag
it it'll place the image here into the
area and that way now I can have this
image in the document also now it's
taken up over everything so I'll just
hide that and you can hide and unhide
things in your layer panel by clicking
on this eye and that toggles the
visibility of the layer
now other things that you can insert
into your document are PDFs Adobe
Illustrator files and EPS formats which
is another Adobe Illustrator file in
case your film familiar with Adobe
Illustrator now there's one more thing
that I want to show you and that is the
open ask function now you can come in to
a file here and you can click on open as
and what it will do is allow you to open
up like something like a JPEG and I can
open it up as a like a PSD if I wanted
to or a tiff I'm trying to find PNG I
could try to open it up as a PNG and
sometimes this will allow you to do it
and sometimes I won't but well we can
try now and because the file well
obviously that method didn't work but
sometimes maybe someone will name the
file incorrectly or save it as the wrong
thing and you are able to open up a file
as another type of file so that's about
it for the opening of different things
in Photoshop and placing pictures or
images so thanks for watching this
tutorial and I look forward to seeing
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
