Android tutorial from the new Boston
what we're gonna do in this tutorial is
basically set up our handling XML stuff
class because again we set some sort of
content handler to basically do the work
or kind of handle the method that we
want it to do and that's what that class
is pretty much gonna do don't get
confused by a handler or anything like
that
all the saying is you know we have this
class that we want to handle the work or
do the work so we're gonna set that up
and again as we scroll over here you can
just see it needs some sort of a content
handler so this class has to be some
sort of handler but as for now it's
nothing so it's giving us an error here
so let's jump over to our handling XML
stuff class and all we're gonna do is
say extends default handler
and then we just have to import that
control-shift oh and let's just check
out some of the classes or some of the
methods that we can use for this class I
should say over source override
implement methods and here's all of our
methods for a handler or a default
handler such as start document in
document and most importantly we're just
looking for certain elements like the
city or the temperature so we're gonna
work with this start element and we're
just gonna hit OK and it adds our method
for us and just the just to briefly talk
about the important aspects of what's
being passed in we have a string called
local name and that's basically gonna be
if we switch over here that's gonna be
these call tags here like forecast
information or city or postal code or
temp F for Fahrenheit so that's what our
local name is gonna be and then what's
our attributes this fourth parameter
what that's going to be is this call or
this call to action this data and pretty
much all of them are the same data so
that's another thing to keep in mind
those are the two things that we're
gonna use with this tutorial so let's
just get started we're going to delete
this super method there and all we're
gonna say is if local name which again
is the name of our second parameter
that's being passed in so we're gonna
say local name and we're gonna say if
this is again we have to compare strings
so we're gonna say dot equals two and
then we can say something like city so
we're gonna use city that's equal to
city all we're gonna do is set up a
string called city and we're gonna set
this equal to or attributes that's being
passed on orders and copy that and the
specific attribute that we're looking
for is again called data so if you know
this is a different reference but for
the most part it's all the same again we
have a local name here in our attribute
here
so we have to define our attribute to
equal data for the most part and then
it's gonna return this value of Lincoln
Nebraska or whatever the person searched
for so we're gonna have say our
attributes dot get value of the index
which was data so again that this string
city is just going to be equal to
Lincoln Nebraska or whatever city they
taught typed in and then what we're
going to do is pass in some information
to our data collected class so we need
to set up a data collected type variable
so we're just going to set that up above
here we're just gonna say again our
class name which was XML data collected
and we're just going to call this info
we're going to set this equal to a new
XML data collected and I'll explain this
a little bit further in the next
tutorial what's actually happening but
you know just as for now we have this
variable called info and then all we're
going to do is we're going to set up
this string or we're gonna pass in the
information of this string to that class
so we're gonna say info dot set city all
right call this city again that's a
method we set up in that class and we're
just gonna refer to our string that we
have here called city and we just have
to say else if and again I'm just going
to copy this format here and paste it
we're gonna say instead of city we're
gonna say temp underscore F and we're
gonna change this method the info to dot
set temp called temp maybe and we're
just going to set this variable equal to
temp for a string and again all we're
doing here is oh and this has to be
integer so all we have to do now is
convert this string reference into
integer
so we're actually going to call this
string tea and then we're gonna convert
and convert it in ten ants so we're
gonna say int temp is equal to integer
dot parse int and that's just going to
parse information into an integer again
convert it into an int and we have to
refer to our string name which we called
T so now we're setting the temperature
variable as well again all we did is we
referred to the local name if it's temp
F we're gonna you know see the data of
that and get the value of that data key
reference and then just convert it into
an int so it works with our method that
we created called set temp and just to
show you guys again here this is the
name that we're looking for and this is
again called data so we don't have to
change that second reference of data so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
guys and I'll catch you in the next one
where we're going to explain a little
bit more of what we've done and I'll see
you then have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
