actually I think it's your 59th I never
check and make sure what's all I'm doing
before I start recording it probably
should do that but anyways I think it's
your 59th storyö so welcome and now
that you guys understand the basics of
matinee what it is how it's used and
kind of the neat little overview of
matinee I can begin talking to you guys
about the more intricate details of
matinee
so the very first thing I want to
mention is how to open matinee so we
have a couple options here the two most
common are if you go ahead and click
this little director board you can go
ahead and open matinee for your scene or
what you typically want to do is open
kismet in kismet and matinee are kind of
like real close cousins whenever you're
working with matinee you're probably
working with kismet and a lot of time
whenever you're working with kismet
you're gonna be working with matinee
so if you go ahead and you have a
matinee in your kismet go ahead and
double click that and that's gonna open
up the matinee as well so now what I can
do is I can actually go ahead and slide
this over there and well let me go ahead
and talk about our matinee object right
here first so whenever we have a matinee
object it has inputs on the left-hand
side
and outputs on the right-hand side just
like any other you know action or any
other object we would add so the inputs
of course play you know that those
reverse reverses your animation stop
pauses your animations change direction
again these are all self-explanatory the
outputs are pretty self-explanatory to
whenever your animation completes its
gonna fire this little completed right
here and if it's reversed it's going to
fire this however to things that
probably aren't as self-explanatory is
this data and this door moving variable
right here this data object basically
stores how your animation should be
played it pretty much stores all that
keyframe data and timing data so you can
actually go ahead and copy this and
stick it on another matinee and you
basically would have the exact same
matinee so just remember this data
stores all the animation data of how and
when
animation should play now this variable
right here these are going to be
changing depending on how your matinee
is set up since we have a door moving if
I scroll you can see that this is the
thing that's moving
we now have an inter Pachter which is
actually that door that is automatically
built into our matinee sequence so if we
wanted to go ahead and you know decide
that we want another door to stick in
there all we'd have to do is change this
variable and now it'll play the exact
same animation with a different variable
so again these men a objects are pretty
self-explanatory you just got to watch
out for the data and basically what
object is your animation using and
that's what this is right here and those
will change so now let me go ahead and
talk about the matinee window I guess
I'll go ahead and just talk about the
toolbar first so at the very top
probably the most common tool bar you're
going to be using except for this big
timeline let me go ahead and scroll out
to give a better view so I can
demonstrate some of this stuff so the
very first thing I want to mention is
this add keyframe so we can actually add
keyframes and remember I talked about
keyframes in the last storoe in a couple
ways we can go ahead and slide this time
slider to ever we want to add a keyframe
and we can go ahead and select the track
we want to use and hit enter and it'll
go ahead and as you can see it'll add a
keyframe right there or what we could do
if we right-click that we can delete
that keyframe we can go ahead and hit
this and it'll add a keyframe there as
well so you know whatever floats your
boat you can use whatever method you
want so I'm gonna go ahead and
right-click and delete that and I'm not
know that this next little drop-down
list has to do with the curve editor and
we're gonna be talking about that in a
few seconds but for now just hold on so
these other things are play your
animation so if you go ahead and bring
your animation back to the beginning and
you play it check it out in my
perspective view it's going to play my
animation right there
pretty cool huh now this loop play we're
gonna be talking about that in like a
couple minutes but anyways we're just
talking about these other ones for now
this
stop animation if you play it you can go
ahead and stop it and you can go ahead
and play in Reverse
again all self-explanatory now this
right here is the speed of your
animation so if you have a really
intricate animation and you want to make
sure it's working exactly how you want
you can go ahead and slow the speed down
to like 25 and then play it and it'll
play only 25% as fast
aka 1/4 slow I don't even know how to
say 25% as fast as it normally would so
basically take 4 times longer so I'm
gonna go ahead and leave it at 100 now
undo and redo you obviously know what
those mean and now I guess I'll talk to
you guys about the curve editor by
default you have another section in here
that's hidden if you go ahead and click
this it's going to bring up this section
called the curve editor and if you still
can't see it if you go to window you
have another option of viewing it and
hiding it right there so what the curve
editor is is it's basically a section
that you know how I told you guys that
you're gonna go ahead and make keys and
keys are pretty much like checkpoints
and the UDK takes care of all the
in-between stuff well with the curve
editor you can actually edit that in
between stuff but we're not gonna be
really messing with it in these
tutorials because the UDK typically does
a pretty good job of handling that in
between stuff so I'm gonna go ahead and
hide that for now and move on so this
next thing I want by the way this has to
deal with that curve editor too so again
this and this button right here we're
not going to be using all that much so
the next thing I want to talk to you
guys about is toggle snap now the stock
will snap and the snaps eyes kind of go
hand in hand whenever you want to move
keys you can go ahead and hold down
control and move your keys just like you
know you can move I don't know anything
so as you notice we have these gray
lines that kind of indicate the
half-second marks of our timeline so we
can go ahead and if we have snap enabled
whenever you try to move our keys our
keys are going to pop to those
have second marks so if you want to keep
everything nice and even it's a good
idea to toggle snap also if you want to
pop everything you know bigger or
smaller you know like pop everything to
a second I mean go ahead and have some
bigger snaps but typically you want to
use that at like you know 0.5 and if
you're working in really intricate
animation where every millisecond counts
you're gonna want to go ahead and untie
GLE that snap so you have full control
over your keyframes so now this fit
views the sequence and all these buttons
right here just pretty much give you a
customized view depending on what you
want to look at but typically I just
like to use my scroll wheel on my mouse
to scroll out I think it's a little
easier to see and these buns right here
we won't really get involved with so
basically that's a real quick overview
of the toolbar and also the matinee
object and in the next soro I'm gonna be
covering hopefully the rest of this
stuff right here so for now thank you
guys for watching and I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
