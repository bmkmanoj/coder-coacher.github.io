enough to the point where I can drink it
this little pot of water that's probably
has like a cup in it I would say it
literally took over 20 minutes for this
to cool down so this kind of sucks cuz I
need like a gallon of water right now
Silva warm tastes like ash it's a good
water
that felt good though we're really good
they kind of filled me up believe it or
not I know if my stomach's got smaller
since yesterday or whatever but I know I
need to keep drinking so I'm probably
gonna do that like 10 more times that
was good so I decided that I'm probably
gonna stay here for the rest of the
night I really don't have the energy to
get up in walk in you're a realtor right
now and this is probably the AMA the
best place I found as far as I have a
water here that I can drink and it's a
semi comfortable it seems safe
so probably tomorrow morning I'm gonna
get up in either head that way I'll
probably go to the edge as far as I can
see in both directions and see which way
is easier because I really don't want to
climb over that thing right there so oh
I think that's what I'm gonna do and for
the rest of tonight I think I'm probably
done filming I'm just gonna boil as much
water as I can get my rest get hydrated
and not even cook any minnows because
it's way too much work for hardly any
food at all and yeah that's about it so
hopefully I will be out of here soon but
we'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
