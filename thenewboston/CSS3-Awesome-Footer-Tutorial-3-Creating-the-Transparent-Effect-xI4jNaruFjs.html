tutorial and now that we have the basic
framework of the footer set up I want to
show you guys how to achieve this glass
effect this transparent awesome looking
glass so the first thing I want to do is
I want to add a border to the top of
this footer now you're saying okay why
do you want to add a border to the top
of this well I'm going to be adding a
one pixel border and I know that you
guys probably can't see it because you
know it's very subtle but it's always
good to add a border to the top of this
footer because if you don't it's going
to look like it's blending in with the
background and you kind of want this to
pop out so the user knows okay I have a
footer this is where all my buttons in
navigation is right down here so like I
said the first part of the glass effect
is add a border to the top so your
footer pops out more so border top and
we're just going to make it one pixel
solid and since this is css3 I'm going
to be working mostly with RGB a colors
so RGB which is of course your standard
red green blue your a which is in CSS 3
which is alpha basically means the
transparency of it so red green blue
colors 0 0 0 of course for those values
you have anything from 0 to 255 and for
your last one alpha I know most of you
guys probably know this already but for
those who don't you can have any value
in here from zero point zero to one
point zero
now what zero point zero means is it's
totally transparent you can see right
through it what one point zero means is
it's completely opaque so this would be
you know solid black solid red not
transparent at all like we have right
here so in order to get any kind of
transparency in by the way 0.5 would
mean 50% transparent you can see through
it 50 percent what I want to do is I
want to add 0.3 so that's basically what
I'm saying I'm going to make a solid
one pixel border that's very subtle and
it's going to be basically almost more
transparent than not so that's what RGB
a means and you know just explain it to
all the beginners now the next thing I
want to do is I want to add an overall
background for this border so background
equals RDP a let me just go ahead and
copy this now I like to set this at 0.25
now again this is the overall background
right here so right now what we have is
a black semi-transparent footer that's
it but we don't have this shine on top
or if you notice it gets kind of darker
and fades up kind of like a glossy
button we don't have any of those
features yet so if we added this right
now it would basically just look like a
transparency without the gloss so if
you're wondering but Bucky how do you
get this nice white shine on top it
looks like a light shining down on it
kind of glowing and gleaming like glass
well for that what you need to do is you
need to add this feature box shadow make
sure I spell that right now there are
two different types of shadows that you
can use whenever you work with css3 the
ones you're going to be familiar with
more often than not it's kind of the
shadows that are on this you know
notification kind of like you are
shining a light on an object and then it
creates a shadow you know most of the
time that's what you work with great I
messed everything up now that's where
you're going to be working with whenever
you're adding shadows to css3 elements
but there's another type of shadow that
I'm going to talk to you guys about in
that inset now what inset means is that
instead of the shadow being on the
outside of the element it's actually an
inner shadow so in other words if we had
an outer shadow then it may appear out
here but when we have an inner shadow
check the
so this white gloss right here is
actually an inner shadow how freakin
sweet is that so it's kind of like
hacking CSS to make really cool crap
that's how I like to look at the lease
so what we're going to do is we're going
to be making several different shadows
because it doesn't just take one white
shadow on top you need multiple shadows
and when they intertwine together it
gives you an awesome sweet effect so in
set 0 1 pixel RGB a and for the first
shadow I'm going to have 255 255 255
which is white and for the opacity I'm
going to set it at 0.3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
