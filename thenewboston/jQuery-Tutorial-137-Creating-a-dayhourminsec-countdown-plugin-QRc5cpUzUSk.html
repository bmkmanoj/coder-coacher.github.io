statement or a shorthand if statement
for each value and we want to check if
the length of it doesn't equal two and
if the length doesn't equal two we want
to append a number in front for example
if we were to say if the length of days
doesn't equal two which it doesn't we
want to add a zero in front of here so
it'll show zero one days it just adds a
bit more structure but obviously this at
this point it's optional let's go ahead
and do this anyway so what I want to do
is I want to redefine each variable so
I'm gonna say days equals and then
here's going to be my condition so I'm
gonna say string days we're converting
days which remember at the moments an
integer to a string and then we're using
dot lengths to check the length of it so
if this doesn't equal two I want to go
ahead with a question marks the first
option so if this if this statement
evaluates to true I want to go ahead and
say days is equal to zero plus days else
using a colon I just want days to equal
days so we're just reassigning the same
value so you might may have seen
something like this if you've studied
other languages are the programming
languages it's just a way to say days if
days if the length of this or if this
conditions evaluates to true then this
value here will be assigned to days
otherwise this value here will be
assigned to days so we can do this for
each one so we've got days hours equals
and the same thing string hours dot
length doesn't equal two if it doesn't
equal two we append a a zero
onto the front of ours otherwise ours is
just step back to ours
and the same with minutes we say mins
equals convert temporarily mins to a
string check the length doesn't equal
two if the length doesn't equal two we
have a zero appended on two mins
otherwise we had just have mins and the
same for seconds we convert seconds to a
string we check the length a story check
the length against minus 2 and if it is
we just go ahead and pop it and see it
right in front of seconds otherwise it
just stays a seconds so quite
straightforward here let's go ahead and
just test this when i refresh you can
now see that we've got oh ok so let's
just take a look at what we've done
oh okay sorry the the countdown here as
obviously as it reached now hasn't let's
just have a look them I'll right okay so
I called this minutes and this seconds
and let's just realign these up so the
wrong variable names obviously there we
can just go ahead and correct this
so minutes and seconds and the same with
this minutes and seconds okay and the
last one seconds right okay so we've
obviously got days hours minutes and
seconds being reassigned depending on
their length and we're adding a trailing
or a leading zero if not so now you can
see that we've got one day which is 0-1
now 21 hours which is two characters so
we haven't appended on a zero to the
front or prepended a zero
we've got two minutes which does how
many have one character so we've
prepended on a zero here and then the
seconds work in exactly the same way as
when they get down to like for example
the number 9l which we'll see in just a
moment we then can see that it will add
to zero on so that's all that this does
obviously it's optional depending on how
you want to display it but if you want
to sort of keep the same size elements
this is really useful because you're
keeping the same size depending on how
these change if for example 22 seconds
comes down to nine seconds in a moment
this will shift everything inward if you
didn't have the prepended zeros so it
just makes it look a lot cleaner as well
and it maintains the same thing so you
can see there it's just changed and it
hasn't shifted everything inwards
okay so now what we want to focus on is
checking whether this date is a number
or not because remember we're converting
a string based date here to a timestamp
so what we want to do is if if it's not
a number we don't want to display
anything we want
just you know not do anything we're not
gonna give an error I mean we could give
an error but we're just gonna want to
not do anything so for example at the
moment if I go to ext Deus and just
change this - I'll just type Alex and
capitals in the middle of this when i
refresh you can see that we've got n a n
n a n n a n and n am for not a number
because this has had a problem
converting with Alex into a timestamp so
what we want to do is before we display
everything here we want to say if not is
n a n so if this if something inside of
this bracket is not a number which is
event date then we want to display this
so if it's not not a number which means
if it is a number we could even go as
far as pulling this up to up to here I
guess yeah I suppose we could actually
that would probably be the correct way
to do this and let's just go ahead and
undo all of that so I'm gonna say a just
up here I'm gonna say if not is not a
number event or settings event
Oh an actual fact now we need to convert
the value beforehand to check whether as
a number so what would is we'll just
keep it down here we use slightly more
processing power before we actually work
out if it's not a number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
