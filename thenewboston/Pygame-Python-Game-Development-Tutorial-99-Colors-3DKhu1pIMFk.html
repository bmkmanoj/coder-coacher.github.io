another PI game with OpenGL with Python
programming tutorial in this video we're
going to be talking about colors with PI
OpenGL so to do that we we don't
necessarily have to specify anything
further here but generally when you add
color you're going to add you want to
fill in the edges right or the the faces
so to speak of or the sides of the cube
but just to show you for example we
could do something like where am i here
we go Joe you look really lost here we
should be able to get away with
something like this like just do GL
color 3fv
and then in here
let's do 0 1 &amp;amp; 1 we'll see if we get
away with this you'll never get away
okay so we've added color to our lines
now of course we still have that zoom
thing going on so let's go ahead and fix
that code as well so the perspective
these are the clipping edges again so
0.1 and will do 50 there that should be
enough to kind of fix our problem okay
so we've colored the lines but the
question is how do we do the rest so um
we're p.m. so the other thing like just
to show like we could do green for
example like this right so these are
like RGB values okay so you've got all
red green blue so conversely if you want
it to be red you would say 1 and then
that's how we can also mix the colors
and all of that so that's how that goes
together let's let's make it why does we
leave it red for now and now let's talk
about how we can do like faces so the
way that we would do faces is we have to
specify the
seize that make the face and then we
have to specify some OpenGL code that we
say hey by the way this makes a face
that you were going to fill in OpenGL so
the way that we do that is right here
let us also let me just pause the rotate
real quick and just so we can see for a
second how many faces or surfaces does a
cube have we've got the top left right
and bottom so that's four and then front
and back so that's six faces and then
you just specify the nodes that contain
each face and that's a face or a surface
so let's go up to the top where we've
got vertices edges and now we just add
surfaces let's say surfaces equals and
it's gonna be a list and in the list
we're gonna have six surfaces so one two
three four five six and then these
connects basically the vertices so
you'll have zero one two and three will
be one of them then 3 - 7 + 6 is another
one 6 7 5 + 4 is another 1 4 5 1 + 0 is
another one and then you've got 1 5 7 2
and then finally 4 0 3 &amp;amp; 6 and that
makes up all of the faces of our cube
then we come down to draw cube and we
basically we need another GL sequence or
GL can't block because this GL block is
just 4 lines and we need another GL
block that will be for like faces so
what you're gonna do is basically enter
enter and we're gonna have another block
of code as usual you always have geo
begin and geo ends and then in here is
where we put like the bulk of new code
so first of all we do need to have a
parameter just like geo lines for here
and the way that we're gonna do this is
GL quads then
we're gonna say for each surface in
surfaces what do we want to do and what
we want to do is well we've already
colored the lines but let's go ahead and
say for vertex in surface we're gonna do
GL color 3fv
and then we'll do 0 1 1 and it might be
enough but I don't think so I think
we'll have to add one more line but
we'll tip we'll test yeah we have to add
one more line so let's close out of this
and now we add GL vertex 3fv
and then we have vertices with the index
value of vertex so that's vertices with
the index value that we passed through
here vertex and that's for vertex in
edge and so on let's save it run that
and now you see that we've filled in the
faces but we still see our lines of
course and that's ok so with that and
now let's turn back on our rotation and
now you've got a rotating cube and you
filled in the faces the last thing I'll
show you of course is the question of
order so let what if we do this move to
cut paste now you'll see that we fill in
the faces first or rather we've drawn
the lines first and then we filled in
the faces so you'll see that there are
no lines on that cube as opposed to what
we were doing before where we drew the
cube first or the quads and then we do
the lines and that's why the lines
appeared in front so anyway that's it
for this tutorial video so hopefully you
guys enjoy we added some color and we
got some zoom go
on here awesome blossom so hopefully you
guys enjoyed and stay tuned the next
