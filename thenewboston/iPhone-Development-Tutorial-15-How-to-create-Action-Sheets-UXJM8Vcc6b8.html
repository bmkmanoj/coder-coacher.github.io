your 15th iphone development story and
in this tutorial we're going to be
learning how to create action sheets and
alert buttons so let's go ahead and
remember before whenever we click this
button nothing happened but now check it
out whenever we click it this thing pops
up and this is called an action sheet so
what an action she is is pretty much
mobile in all simplicity it's all it is
is a choice so it gives you a title
right here in two choices cancel button
which we know that those cancels out of
it and then another thing that when we
click it in this case an alert pops up
now when you click it you can pretty
much have anything you want to happen
but I decided since we need to know how
to build alerts I decided to have an
alert pop up and by the way all an alert
is is pretty much a prompt that pops up
on the screen that all you can click is
done like you maybe maybe can use it for
like warnings or you know just to say hi
so let's go ahead and jump right into it
now before we begin I just want to tell
you guys about a couple things first of
all in the last story I accidentally
passed a parameter to this button
pressed method and we don't need that
parameter so go ahead and get rid of
that parameter and also in your method
body go ahead and get rid of the
parameter there as well and by the way
if you already linked your on button and
interface builder to this method go
ahead and delete it and Link it again
whenever you change your method you need
to go ahead in re link it in interface
builder or else that object is going to
be pointing to the old method instead of
the new one alright so now with that
being said hopefully you change your
method header and body and relinked in
interface builder now let's go ahead and
get started the first thing that we need
to do is go ahead and adopt a protocol
now I don't know if I tie you guys about
protocols in my objective c tutorials
but will a protocol is is what you do is
you put the protocols named after
whatever class you're inheriting from
and your
and what this does is it give you a
bunch of built-in methods that you can
use depending on what the protocol is so
for example we want some action sheet
delegate methods but we don't want to
have to build myself there already
built-in methods and check this out the
coolest thing about this is sent to you
adopted it right here you don't need to
declare the methods right here it does
all of that for you all you need to do
is pretty much build the body for them
in your implementation right here so in
order to find out like what their names
and stuff are you need to know what they
are so go ahead and well you pretty much
just need to know them so if you want to
adopt any protocols then go ahead and
look at the Apple documentation and
they'll tell you what you just adopted
but anyways i'll be showing you a sample
of this protocol and if you don't know
what I'm talking about then everything
will clear up in a minute but anyways go
ahead and make sure you import this
action sheet delegate protocol by
putting it in between the grape less
than and greater than signs and once you
do that you're ready to move on to your
implementation so the first thing that
we need to do is go ahead and set an
action what pretty much what do you want
to happen whenever you click this button
on the screen I am a bun well before
nothing happening just clicked it and
just stood there but now we want an
action sheet to pop up so what we need
to do in order to make this happen is go
ahead and create an action sheet how do
you do that well I'll show you go ahead
and put you I action sheet no not that
look it
you I action sheet and I'm going to name
mine action sheet and set this equal to
and a bunch of crap it's going to pop up
in the second you I action sheet and of
course we need to allocate some space
for it now here is the all the
parameters for the extra sheet in it
with title and trust me go ahead and
press a right and all of these
parameters are going to go on forever so
all right let's go ahead and just take
them one at a time it hit by title is
pretty much the title of your action
sheet nothing fancy here so we're going
to name my action sheet want to see and
alert alright so that's in it with title
pretty much the title of actually
nothing too confusing there to delegate
now check this out I don't know if I
told you guys before what delegates are
not but delegates are pretty much code
that runs at certain points of time
automatically so you're saying why would
you want bit of code to run
automatically well sometimes like
whenever you open a program then you
know the beginning housekeeping code
pops up like you know the main loop to
keep the program running and whenever
you close out of your program maybe you
want something to save automatically so
you you need to delegate these methods
now why am I saying so we know a
delegate is pretty much code that runs
automatically at a certain point in time
so why do we even need a delegate for
the action sheet will check this out
anytime you either clothes out of your
action sheet or do the other button that
pretty much means they do something
button we want a bit code to run
automatically depending on what you
clicked so we don't want to have to
write another method to pass every time
it says all right click this click this
there is already a built-in method that
handles your response to your action
sheet and that method was actually
included in our protocol right here so
that's why we had to adopt that
and I mean I sometimes say import a
protocol but the correct term is adopted
I think so i'm going to start saying
that so anyways we're going to be
building our delegate method in the next
tutorial probably but for the parameter
we have to pass it here itself because i
mean we can put this delegate method
anywhere we want but we're going to be
putting it in the same class is this so
that's why we need to pass itself so
anyways your delicate says all right I
already have a built-in method to handle
this action sheet where is that method
and you say it's in the same class is
this method so even though we don't have
that method yet just go ahead and put
itself will we've been building in the
next tutorial now the cancel button
title is if you accidentally click
action sheet and you want to cancel out
of it what do you want the text up here
on the button well go ahead and make it
something simple like cancel like that
now the destructive button title this is
one of the worst names worst name thing
in objective-c pretty much I mean it
makes it sound like pretty much exactly
like the cancel button destructive
button but what the destructive button
is is is actually the button that it
means okay go ahead so check this out if
you click button this action sheet this
method here yeah let's see it this is
the destructive button so I mean can you
name it anything works because I mean
it's in destructive it actually does
something so I mean why they named it
that I don't know it's pretty poorly
named but anyways for my destruct button
as you just saw let's go ahead and name
it yeah let's see it because this is
button we're going to click when we want
to see our always call alert box so the
other bun titles you can go ahead and
add other buttons to this well let's go
ahead and just add nil because we don't
want any other buns so now this is all
the entire method for building the
action she I know there's like a
thousand parameters but that's all you
have to do so after you're done building
the action sheet what you want to do is
called tumor methods action sheet show
in view and just go ahead and put self
view because it says where do you want
to show it well we want to show it we
only have one view so you know show it
there and actually sheet release to
release the memory when we're done with
it so pretty much what we learned is
create an action sheet show it and
release it and i'll be going over
everything we didn't cover in this story
on the next story so thanks for watching
them could subscribe and i'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
