15th art tutorial and in this video as
promised I'm going to be teaching you
guys how to read data from a CSV file so
the first thing that would be handy is
if we had a CSV file to work with if
there is only one on the internet for
free Oh what do we got here I already
made one for you guys and what you can
do is below this video there's a link in
the description of where you can
download this I made it in on Google
Drive so if anyone wants to go to this
link then click file download as CSV and
make sure you do that because that's a
file type we're going to be working with
then it's going to go ahead and download
it for free
so now you can go to your yeah your
downloads folder or wherever you have it
downloaded and the first thing I want to
do is actually rename this so just
rename it to be our users with a capital
u and copy this and now you're like okay
so where do we put it well we can keep
it there and then just tell our to look
there whenever we're working with files
but here's a little trick what you can
do is in your art studio
you can type get WD and what this
command does is it gets your working
directory so what is your working
directory your working directory is the
folder that R goes to first whenever
it's looking for files so instead of
changing the file path to make
everything work what we can do is we can
just stick that file in see users Buckey
documents of course yours is going to be
a little bit different but that's the
folder that you need to put it in so
Buckey rillette documents actually
documents right here so paste that bad
boy in there and now we don't have to
have any file path we just go ahead and
type the name so now it's in our working
directory clear everything out so now
that we have a CSV file downloaded how
exactly do we read from it guys this is
incredibly simple easier than any other
programming language first store name
where you're going to keep all the data
that you're going to read and the
function is read dot CSV probably cut
against that now the first parameter it
takes is what is the file name and of
course it's BR users dot CSV now the
next parameter go ahead and just type
true all in capitals right now this
second parameter is actually see if I
can pull this back up if your first row
of your data is not the data itself with
the headers or the titles of the columns
then type true if your data starts right
here
then type false but our first row of the
file is the column names so that's why I
put true and the last parameter that it
needs is how do we want to separate this
data how is it separated well CSV stands
for comma separated something whatever V
stands for so of course we're using a
comma to separate each item so now what
this is going to do is it's going to
read all the information into tuna so we
could go ahead and print this out but
first let me show you guys something if
we go ahead and run this we can see that
tuna which was a CSV file is now a data
frame so essentially what this does is
it takes the entire CSV file and
converts it into a data frame why is
that awesome because R has a bunch of
crap built in already to work
specifically with data frames how
stinking easy is that and of course I
don't want to print out the whole thing
so I'm just going to print out the head
so you guys can see if I run this you
can see that indeed
it did grab all that data ID first name
last name age Bitcoin relationship and
guys this is an actual information I
just made like dummy information some
samples that we can work with by how
easy is that that's how you take a csv
file and convert it into a data frame so
you can work with it in r and you want
to know something that is even cooler
than that check this out
clear your console and i'm also going to
include this link but this is pretty
much just a random csv file file i found
on the internet you can grab any one
that is on the internet and what we can
do is we can actually read from this
without even downloading it pretty
stinkin awesome so all we have to do is
type the parameter or the URL as that
first argument so before it said be our
users which is on our personal computer
but even though this is a file on the
internet check this out
reads from it just fine how awesome is
that usually you'd need to you know
build this whole thing that connects to
the internet and pulls it from it and
converts it nope just one little
parameter just like the name boom you
got the information so that is how you
read CSV data from your own computer and
from the internet and now that we have
it hey do whatever you want to it but in
the next couple videos I'm going to be
showing you guys how to do awesome stuff
like make graphs make charts and guys
it's going to be awesome so anyways
thanks for watching and I'll see you
