Python tutorial and the story I'm going
to show you guys how to loop through a
dictionary and also how to use the break
statement to exit loop so in the less
well not the less story but a couple of
tutorials ago I showed you guys how to
make a dictionary using keys and values
so let's go ahead and make one real
quick because we're going to need one
for example I'm going to make one for
ages so dad equals 42 mom she can be 48
she's gonna be a little older and let's
make one last one say there's someone in
your family named Lisa she can be seven
so let's go ahead and make sure about it
right we did now if you want to loop
through the items in this dictionary
what you do is put for item and remember
this isn't a keyword this is whatever
you want to name your variable and this
is going to be set to the variable dad
Lisa and mom it's not going to be set to
the values right here it's going to be
set to the elements right so let's go
ahead and write for at items in of
course we need ages because that's what
dictionary we're going to refer to put
your colon and then put prints item so
once you do that it prints out dad Lisa
mom so that's the main item but what if
you want the value that our response to
and not only the element well to do that
what you would do is a syntax slightly
different you would put for item in ages
and that would be the same right there
because that's where you're going to
correspond to the only thing different
is you want to print out the values
along with the elements themselves so
prints item and that's going to give you
the same thing it did before and then
also we want to print some of the notes
ages in item and square kro quotes and
what this is going to do is whenever you
put the item name
inside the dictionary name that's going
to give you the value that the element
corresponds to so we're kind of tricking
it into printing out the value as well
so again this is the value itself and
this is the excuse me this is the
element itself and this is a value that
a corresponds to and I keep saying
element set of keys but just the old it
so as this is how you get dad 40 to Lisa
7 mom 48 and that's how you print out on
each what's it called
uh I don't know what the combination of
these two things is called but each of
those in your program now another thing
I want to talk to you guys about is
something how to break out of a loop now
in the last story I showed you guys how
to test the condition like how a
variable is less than 100 and then you
can loop through that a hundred times
but there's going to come some cases
where you're going to want to break a
loop after a certain event happens and
not just only after like a desired
number of times like 110 or a thousand
you're going to want to wait for an
event and let that be your deciding
factor when enter a loop and while we're
on that subject I told you guys that you
can have a test condition like while
variable is less than 4 but you can also
do a wild one if you want the loop to go
on and on and on forever so if you do
while one and the loop goes on and on
forever we're going to need a way to
escape this loop somehow and that's the
break statement so let's go ahead and we
need a variable somewhere to test the
break let's all right if name equals rao
we'll have the user input data name
equals rot input and just write enter a
name and then we have we're going to
have the user input something right here
and that variable is going to be stored
in name so now we want to test that name
and if it is equal to certain thing and
only if it's equal to a certain thing we
want to break this loop so let's write
if name is equal to
that's right quit if name is equal to
quit break and what this program is
going to do is say alright I want to
keep going on this loop forever until I
encounter a break now first I'm going to
ask them further name and if they give
me anything besides quit I'm going to
loop again but if name is exactly equal
to quit then I'm going to break out of
this loop so let's go ahead and press
ENTER and her name
Greg Tom Lisa Bucky
quit and as you can see as soon as I
type to quit the program escaped so what
this does is loop forever and ever and
it actually would go forever until I've
got to quit and once you get quit you
know you can add this keyword break and
any time your loops cease break it's
going to know all right
now it's time to exit the loop so that
is your quick tutorial on how to loop
through dictionaries how to get the keys
and values of them both and also how to
use the while loop with infinite loop
and how to break out of it so I hope you
guys learn a little something I don't
know why my teaching next door oh but
it's probably going to be awesome as
usual so thank you guys for watching
