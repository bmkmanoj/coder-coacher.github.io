and CSS tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be building a basic website
and applying some sweet CSS properties
through it so let's go ahead and get
started and build just a starter quick
little website um put a header at the
top h1 h1 and make this website
Bucky's bacon wagon just imagine a wagon
with a bunch of bacon in it and there
you go and now let's just go ahead and
add paragraph actually tighten that up a
bit that's what she said and we'll just
add one paragraph that's good enough for
now and we'll just be like best on this
side of the best bacon on this side of
the Mississippi explanation point and
space so let's go ahead and make a copy
this and you know we just need some text
so just fill that in like that so we
have actually a paragraph that's more
than one line so we have a header h1 and
a paragraph so if you save that and
looked at it right now here is what we
have but this website although you know
the idea is good a bacon wagon sounds
like a pretty good idea the website
needs some work so let's go ahead and
let's change the color of this and also
make this a little more readable so what
I want to do first is we need to add
that style sheet that we talked about
last time so style equals or excuse me
I'm getting ahead of myself
type equals text slash CSS and remember
you also need the ending style tag now
everything in-between here is going to
be you know one of the rules so the
first thing we want to work with is that
header I mean this plain black header I
mean we can do better than that so let's
go ahead and make a rule to change the
color on that so the element we're
working with is h1 and in our curly
braces the property that we want to
change is color now before I told you
guys that you can just make it something
like red and that's good
so let's go ahead and refresh this and
now it's read what you're saying well
everyone has read on their webpage I
want mine to be a little different I
want mine to be the color of bacon so
what you can use aside from just
keywords like red blue green is you can
actually use something called RGB value
now if you don't have Photoshop because
that's where I use mine um you can go to
pretty much than any website or go to
google and type in RGB values and it
will give you a list RGB values but
whenever I'm looking for a specific
color on my website here's what I do I
go in the Photoshop and I click this
thing called a color picker and I make
sure that I'm working with only web
colors and I can scroll down to the
color that I'm looking for and highlight
over it and then I just copy this and
this is the RBG value on that stands for
red blue and green so what I want to
stress is not only do you have to use
keywords but you can also use RBG as
well and anytime you do that you go
ahead and put the pound sign and then
paste that six digit color in there
so now if we go ahead and save this and
refresh it instead of red we get this
brown dark brown cooked burnt and bacon
looking color so that's a little better
um again if we're just building a basic
website then the keyword is fine but
anytime you want like a really specific
color then you need to use that RBG
value so I just want to tell you guys
that you have more options than you know
just the colors you know in your head so
aside from this I mean our Bucky's bacon
wagon is looking Brown and looking
pretty beautiful but you may say alright
this paragraph right here this isn't
really readable to the user
maybe these lines are too close together
or maybe you just want to space them out
so we can fill this website a little
butter so anytime you want to space out
the lines you need to use a property
called line height so let's go ahead and
first tell CSS that we're going to be
working with our pair
raph we'll do that by typing P and in
our curly braces go ahead and type
line-height as the property and now we
can set this equal to a percentage by
default it's at 100% right now so if you
want to space them out a little bit go
ahead and type like one hundred and
thirty percent like that and now add
your semicolon at the end let me save it
and let me refresh this in front of you
guys can see when i refresh what happens
to the spacing when we refresh and I
didn't save it or something aligned
height one hundred and thirty percent
looks good and okay I'm also like okay
let's try this one more time there we go
so I changed it to 150% and as you can
see the line height grew or well I mean
I can't even explain it as well I can
just show you so let me change this to
like 170 170 is good enough and I'll
show you guys one more time what happens
right like that so what happens is you
get more space in between your lines
aka line height so you know I'm not
going to explain you guys what line
height means because I just showed you
but anyways I usually like somewhere
around 125 130 percent so I mean let me
go ahead and refresh this and it makes
it more readable than it did by just
having a default paragraph so that is
the basics of how to change color
remember take away from the story not
only can you use you know just common
colors like red blue green you can also
use RBG value and last thing you can use
something called a hexadecimal value I
think that's how you say but don't ever
use that because no one ever does that
and again with line-height anytime you
want to change the line height this is
the property and change it to a
percentage of different than what it is
to make it more readable so that is two
basic property values I want to show you
guys and you know these might not be the
most common properties that you want to
change on your website but I just wanted
to illustrate the point
and I just wanted to go over CSS again
so hopefully the idea of what element
you want to change and what you want to
change to is sticking in your head now
so now that you understand this concept
of basic style sheeting we can move on
to the next tutorial so thank you guys
for watching don't forget to watch the
next tutorial and I guess I'll see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
