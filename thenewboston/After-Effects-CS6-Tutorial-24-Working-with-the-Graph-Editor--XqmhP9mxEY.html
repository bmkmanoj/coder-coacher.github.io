can show a little better so now if I
click on the rotation here I should be
able to snap it there we go now you can
see how the snap works it's snapping to
that point right there and to this point
over here control Z to get back I'm
gonna take on the animated so both of
them are like position alright now this
magnifying glass here with the arrows
this adjusts the height and auto zooms
on your graph based on the height of the
graph so remember when I was using the
hand to scroll well and it was
automatically adjusting if I turn this
off zoom in now I can scroll around and
it doesn't automatically adjust so that
might be handy
it's a it's good for seeing like the
graph in relative because sometimes when
it automatically zooms and you kind of
lose track of where you are so I'm gonna
put that back on because it's on by
default I'm gonna zoom back out the next
button over here it's a greyed out right
now it's called the pit selection to
view so if I select some points here and
select those two points
that one's unselected and now it's
available to click on so I can click on
it and it puts those points in the view
get back out there we go the next one
here is the fit all graphs to view so I
will add the other graph again and let's
get it let's move this point way way out
here now that point is out of view so if
I hit this now it's going to bring
everything in view let me move that back
this right here is the separate
coordinates so I'll click on that for
you and now you get your x position Y
position and your rotation so if you had
scale it would do the different scales
the height and the width that would show
up so that's how you can animate those
individually let's turn that back off
looks like it changed my keyframes when
I did that also so I'll turn those back
on to what they were
you don't remember how to do that you
can check out the keyframe velocity
tutorial on how to change your keyframes
so the next button over is the keyframe
menu and where you can do your keyframe
editing here okay I just clicked off the
next one over this is the hold keyframe
button so if I clicked on that and
wanted to make it a hold keyframe you
could say it changes we haven't gone
over hold keyframes but that's how that
works you can change it to a linear
keyframe and this one is the auto
busy-busy a keyframe the next buttons
are easy ease buttons so if I wanted to
make this an easy ease key you could see
how it changes and it is also an easy a
ski keyframe now
and this is the easy ease in and this is
the easy ease out button so if I want to
change this back to what it was Oh click
on the linear so that's how you get out
of the easies also and that's it for the
buttons for now we'll we'll be going
over how to edit these points and what
these handles mean and all that stuff in
the second part of the tutorial so I
hope to see you guys there and have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
