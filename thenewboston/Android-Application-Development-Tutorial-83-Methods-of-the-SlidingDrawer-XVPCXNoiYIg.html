Android tutorial for the new boss in and
what we're going to do in this tutorials
actually start programming are basically
our sliding drawer class and what I've
done is I've set up the Java class
called slider you guys should have that
set up I kind of just set up all the
reference bridges because we have these
four buttons right here which I just
give them the ideas of handle one handle
to handle three handle four and then
again this one has the actual handle ID
so keep that in mind I also gave a
reference to the check box and I set the
onclick listeners by implementing the
onclick listener and on check change
listener so setup or bridges or
references to the XML then I set this
check box or the check box called check
box and I set the on check change
listener this that's why we had to
implement that and I set all of our
buttons the set on check on click
listener - you know our on click
listener that we implemented down here
and then what I did is I set up a switch
in case we're on click method this or
these are four buttons switch in case
just gets ID if is the first button
here's that case second button we
haven't really filled in that yet I'm
just setting up the basic framework for
for the sake of time and then for
uncheck change listener passing this
compound button for argument one we're
just going to say it is that checked if
it is we're going to do something here
if else or not now obviously we haven't
done anything with a handle yet I mean
with our sliding drawer yet so that's
what this tutorial is mainly about I
just wanted to kind of talk through what
I've done so far just so you guys aren't
too confused there so the first thing we
want to do is set up our our sliding our
sliding drawer so let's do that again
within our on create method here I'm
just going to set it up real quick and
again it's called sliding drawer it's a
class we're just going to call this sd4
sliding drawer and
and we got to import that and then we're
just going to say again sliding drawer
just like any other time we set up a
reference find view by ID and then it
was sliding D was ID we gave our sliding
drawer set that up now this is the main
main part of the the tutorial here I'm
just going to show you some of the
functions or methods that the sliding
drawer can do so we're going to say set
on drawer closed select drawer
set on drawer closed listener on drawer
open listener and there's also a scroll
listener for the drawer that you can do
basically we're just going to do one of
those but hopefully you get the concept
of all three of those that's just when
the drawer closes this is when it opens
so we're going to say this as well and
then we have to implement our class
implement that that class so we're going
to say let's slider implement on drawer
open listener and then we just have to
implement and add the end implement
methods down here so now we can just do
something like media player MP equals
media player dot create and context this
for class ID r dot raw dot explosion and
then we're just going to do MP dot start
so now when our drawer closes it's going
to just start a explosion noise that we
we have in our resources again that's
not review but that's just one of the
methods that we can use now something
else we can do is basically we can
toggle our draw our drawer through code
so let's say we hit the first button we
can say our SD slider I'm sorry I'm
sorry our slider drawer
which we called SD we can say dot o
again we have to establish four above
this oncreate method so our whole class
can use it so again we're just going to
say SD there and define the variable
above and then we can do SD dot open SD
dot let's not do that one we're going to
do for the fourth button we're going to
say st dot close and the third button is
just going to toggle it whether it's
open or closed it's going to toggle to
the other option so I mean these are
just some of the methods that we can use
for the sliding drawer again that's kind
of what I wanted to show you guys and
then one other thing that we can do is
if are checked if that box is checked we
can also do SD dot lock and that won't
allow our our slider or handle the work
it's going to lock it in an SD dot
unlock here I know I'm going kind of
quickly but hopefully by now in the
series you guys kind of understand the
concepts I just wanted to show you some
of the methods that we can use for the
sliding drawer and how they're how they
work I'm not necessarily getting into
the actual coding just some of the
methods again we just set up our slider
and we say on open listener so let's
just check it out make sure everything
works
and at the end of the tutorial I kind of
scroll through the code one last time
slowly so you guys can pause the video
and catch up and write it if you guys
are having trouble but hopefully you
shouldn't so we're going to open up our
slider class and first thing we're going
to do is open it and as you can hear
that's our explosion noise that we set
up now let's do a checkbox now let's
check so we can't try to slide it down
but it's not allowing me to so we
uncheck it and then we can slide it down
again our first button is going to open
it up and it also calls the on open
method so you can hear the explosion
there fourth button is going to close it
and since it's closed it's not going to
do anything and our third button is just
going to toggle back and forth so
hopefully you guys see how that all
works
our second button really doesn't do
anything but um and even when we have
this checkbox when we lock it from the
check box this force button won't close
it and the third vote button won't
toggle it because it's locked so there
you guys go
umm hope you enjoyed that I don't know
oh yeah I'll slide through this code
real quickly implement all three of
those things and pause here or here or
here and so hopefully you guys kind of
understood standard what I was trying to
teach you there didn't want to get too
much into like setting this all up
because it would've taken too long if
you guys just watched me typing but
thanks again for watching guys and I'll
catch you in the next tutorial peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
