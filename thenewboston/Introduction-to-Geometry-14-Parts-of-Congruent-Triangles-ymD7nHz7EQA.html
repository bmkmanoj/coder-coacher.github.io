of congruent triangles so we have this
triangle ABC and we're told that it's
congruent to triangle d e f now the way
you name your triangles is important
because if these two are congruent then
all corresponding sides and angles are
congruent so angle a right here has to
be congruent with angle D right here
which if you look they are so angle B
has to be congruent with angle e which
we know is true because angle B is a
right angle which is 90 degrees and the
angle e is also a right angle which is
also 90 degrees and angle C this last
angle has to be congruent with angle F
which we know is true so not just the
angles corresponding angles are
congruent that the corresponding sides
are also are congruent if these
triangles are congruent so a B is
congruent to de
BC is congruent with e f and a/c is
congruent with D F so now that we know
how which angles have to be congruent to
which we are going to do an example
naming which angles are congruent so if
we were to name this triangle according
to how its congruent if we start with T
we know that triangle T we're going to
go t.v you is congruent now we have to
name them the same way so we went from
11 arc mark 23 so we have to go from one
to three so triangle why W X we have to
name them the same way because
corresponding angles and corresponding
segments have to be congruent so this
means that angle tea should be congruent
to angle why based on the way we named
it and this has one and this has one so
that means they are congruent so angle V
has to be congruent with angle w which
that's three that's three we're good
there an angle you has to be congruent
to angle X so we got two we got two
we're good all right so now we have to
make sure that their sides the right
sides are congruent
so side TV right here has to be
congruent with YW right here which is
right because they're both marked the
same way segment vu has to be congruent
with WX 22 we're good and that means
that you t or t you either way is
congruent to Y X which tu is right here
YX is right here so we're good and we're
going to do one more example at but
we're going to name we're going to do it
by naming the triangles that are
congruent and we're going to name them
according to their corresponding parts
so for the first one we're told we want
to say the triangle h g I is congruent
to another triangle so we have to look
at which sides and which angles are
congruent so that we can name them
correctly so if I start with angle H
this is two marks so I need to start
with the angle that has two marks which
is right here angle k so we're going to
start triangle k and then i need to go
in the same direction that i went last
time so i went h2g h2g which is this 10
inch side so i need to do the same thing
on this triangle i need to go to the 10
inch side and go to el which makes sense
because angle g and angle l are
congruent
and finally I'm going to go i went from
g2 I so I have to go down this six and
side on the other one as well and go Jay
which makes sense because Jay an angle I
are congruent so we're going to do the
same thing but in a different but for a
different triangle and these are all the
same triangles it's just the way we name
them is important to talking about
they're congruent see so triangle jkl
jkl is congruent with so if i start with
j I have to start with I right here so
triangle I and then I went to K so I
have to go to angle 8h right here and
then I went to angle l over here so that
means i have to go to angle g over here
because lng or congruent same thing but
i'm starting with I and I'm going to G
and i'm going to h so i started with I
so I had to start with J on this one
then I went to G so I have to go to El
on this one and then we went up to H so
I got to go up to k on this one and then
one more we have L j/k so I started with
L so I have to start with G on this
triangle I i went to j LD j so I got to
go g to I and then I went up to k I went
up to k this way so we gotta go up to H
this way and that makes sense because if
you look at it
hg I is really just is really reflected
over to get que je l because we still
have h up here then I would be over here
G would be over here so that's why these
are reflections of these so now that we
can talk about which parts of of
triangles are congruent we're going to
talk about some theorems to proving
triangles are congruent in our next
video so be sure to watch it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
