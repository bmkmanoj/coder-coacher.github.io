video and in this video I'm going to be
styling the tables and links and
hopefully some classes if we have time
but let's go ahead and get started with
styling the tables now I know you guys
are saying you're like will man my web
designer just told me that tables
shouldn't be used anymore because we
have dibs now well that's true and the
reason that they usually say that
because my web designer kept stressing
that too is because people used to lay
out their entire website using tables
and this isn't the best way to do that
however that doesn't mean you shouldn't
use tables ever whenever you have a list
of information to display such as a list
of items tables can come really in handy
and just to prove to you guys that I'm
not just talking and I want to use
tables to be lazy if you go to ebay or
amazon com go ahead and look at their
source code they use tables like crazy
so like I said while it's not the best
delight lay out your entire website you
can utilize them in the way that we're
going to utilize them perfectly so the
first thing we want to do is we want to
change the width of all tables through
one hundred percent and that is because
we want them to fit exactly inside our
box now why do we have to specify this
because by default your table with is
only going to be wide enough to fit the
content so if you have like a picture
that's 200 pixels wide and you have two
of them then your table would be 400
pixels but we want this to be evenly
spaced so you guys are going to see why
this is important later on the next
thing I want to do is text align Center
what this is going to do is centerline
all the contents in your table now there
are going to be times when ever we have
like dates or something we may want it
right align but we cannot specify that
later on whenever you're working
strictly with the code so there is our
overall table styling fit the area that
we put you in and center align
everything so the next is the table
header which is basically the titles for
each column so for the color for these
I'm just going to make these hexadecimal
a
eight it's pretty cool song for font
weight in a side for a mom headings
table headings are also bowled by
default and I really don't like um bold
I want like a subtle gray look so I'm
just going to go ahead and put font way
normal and I'm also going to put text
decoration underline so what this is
going to be is this going to be nice
light gray underlined font very artistic
very beautiful might I add and the last
thing I want to take care of is the
table data so we pretty much have the
overall table in the titles for each
column now for each cell of that table
basically I want to add some padding now
the reason I do this is our table is not
going to have a border and whenever we
put a bunch of elements in there if we
just stick them in there they're going
to be pressed up against each other and
they're going to look like one big mess
so we want to give it some space around
each cell so the table data the padding
i'm going to write shorthand it's going
to be three pixels 10 pixels now
whenever you pass two pixels in your
padding what it treats this is as the
top and bottom padding is three pixels
and the left and right padding is 10
pixels so we're going to have a little
bit of space up up and down in a lot of
space left and right and those are
pretty good settings I already mess with
them a little bit so now it's time to
mess with the links the first thing I
want to do is style the overall plain
old link the first link you see whenever
you go to a web page so the color by
default is this um 0066 99 and the color
of this is a nice oh I'll show you guys
right here it's a nice blue like this so
I not dark blue not navy blue but just a
beautiful delicious blue so the next
thing I want to do is I want to put text
I got the friggin hiccups are you
kidding me
decoration equal to none now by default
links have an underline so what I want
to do is by default my links on my
webpage I don't like underline not many
people underline them a whole lot
anymore so by default they are not
underlined however when you hover over
them that's when it changes colors and
underlined so I really like the style
that and it's what some big websites are
starting to do now so another thing that
I want to do is this is the main link
pretty much the default link i also want
this to be the visited link i don't want
my links to turn purple or anything
whenever you visit them because it gets
really confusing and i just don't like
it so basically a visited link and a
regular link are the same exact thing
the next thing I wanted to do is we have
two more link states that we got to take
care of what happens when you hover over
a link and as you're pressing down on
that link it's called active now a lot
of people like to turn this orange when
you're hovering over it and like red as
you're pressing down but I think that it
kind of looks cheesy whenever you get a
different color whenever it's active so
I like to keep the hover and active the
same so let me go ahead and do that
right now just like we kept the link in
the visited the same we only make one
property which is a hover now whenever
you hover over link how do you want this
to be different than the normal link
first of all we want the color to change
we want it to change from blue to nice
orange color so the color of that orange
is CC 6600 and aside from that we also
want to change the text decoration I'm
just go ahead and steal this to
underline so again let me stress that
one more time whenever you hover over a
link it's going to turn orange and
you're going to get a nice underlined
that just gives the user a feel of you
know I'm actually interacting with
something and the web page isn't broking
something is supposed to happen that's
what it is so there you go and aside
from this i also want to copy this whole
baby and make my links hover and
div so basically whenever you press down
on the link it doesn't change for a
split second because I just think that's
kind of cheesy so there you go there is
the styles for the table as well as all
the links so in the next story what I'm
going to be doing is there's a bunch of
weird classes that we need to go over
and aside from that with all the weird
classes we also need to kind of set the
main layout for the website what appears
on the left what peers on the right so
there's going to be a few more videos on
CSS and I promise you guys will get into
the good coding program and stuff soon
but for now thank guys for watching I'll
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
