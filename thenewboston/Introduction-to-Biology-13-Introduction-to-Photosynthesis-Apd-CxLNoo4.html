and in these next couple videos i'm
going to be covering the process of
photosynthesis in this video i'm going
to be talking about the structure of the
chloroplasts and some stuff about light
the theory of light how it acts all that
you're kind of stuff and gave a brief
little overview of the actual process of
photosynthesis and in my next videos
i'll go into more detail about the
photosystems and the calvin cycle
photosynthesis is the process by which
light energy is captured and then is
used to synthesize carbohydrates the
general reaction is to take six
molecules of carbon dioxide and six
molecules of water and light energy in
the form of photons to produce a one
molecule of glucose and six molecules of
oxygen and during this process carbon
dioxide is going to get reduced water is
going to get oxidized and it is an
endergonic reaction which means it
requires energy to proceed and that
energy like I said is in the form of
light dinner but if this is mainly takes
place in plants and green algae it can
take place in some bacteria too but
we're not going to really discuss that I
mean the process is the same they just
don't have the specialized organelles
for it but anyways in plants it's going
to take place in the mesophyll of the
leaves within these medicine is revealed
our structures called chloroplasts and
these chloroplasts contain what are
called thylakoids there's just little
flat membrane sex then these things
called photosystems that trap light
energy in the thylakoids and then carbon
fixation is going to occur in the stroma
of the chloroplast and you can see my
little drawing here of the club last you
got the outer membrane the inner
membrane the thylakoids which are
organized into big stacks called garena
are gharana however you want to
pronounce it the stroma is just this
material between the thylakoids and the
inner
remembering the plant is going to get
water through the roots and it's
absorbed and transported up to the
leaves through what is called xylem and
co2 is going to enter through stomata
which are little like pores within the
leave these stomata are going to protect
be protected by guard cells so nothing
else it's not that's not supposed to be
there is going to come in and then
oxygen is also going to leave through
the stomata so the nature of light light
is a type of electromagnetic radiation
it travels as a wave it's got short
wavelengths or long wavelengths and it
also put the heck behaves as a particle
light energy becomes in these little
bundles called photons light has two
different or three different properties
rather you've got your velocity which is
three times ten to the eighth meters per
second which is hey freakin fast dude
but um this velocity is not going to
change for the most part so the
properties of light are based on their
frequency and their wavelength so
visible light has a wavelength of
anywhere from 380 nanometers to 700 and
80 nanometers and the shorter the
wavelength the higher the energy there
are several different pigments involved
with photosynthesis you got
chlorophyll-a is the main pigment
chlorophyll b and carotenoids are
accessory pigments and the color depends
on what wavelengths of light are
absorbed or reflected or transmitted for
example leaves the green because they're
going to reflect green lights white Li
like white flowers and things like that
reflect all colors of light and a black
flower for example would absorb all
colors of light so the actual process of
photosynthesis has four different events
that happen in two phases you've got
your photochemical reactions and
electron transport chemiosmosis
carbon fixation and the two phases you
got the light phase where oxygen is
generated also hydrogen ions to form the
chemiosmosis ATP and NADH and then there
in the dark phase which is light
independent this is going to use ATP
NADPH and carbon dioxide to form
carbohydrates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
