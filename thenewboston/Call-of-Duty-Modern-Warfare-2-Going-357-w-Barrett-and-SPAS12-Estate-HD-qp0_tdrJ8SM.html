sniping vid me sniping on a state I
think yer yes a stage we thinkin delete
and I've got another I've got a Barrett
50 Cal but I do not have my FM jaya so i
decided to use thermal which thermal is
very thermal is a good attachment to
some extent the only bad part is it's
not a guaranteed one hit kill like FMJ
is other than that it's a it's a very
good attachment but what I don't get is
it's not supposed to be used on every
weapon like I've seen people use
actually I was planning called beauty
today and actually saw somebody using a
Barrett 50 cal I mean not a Barrett 50
Cal but i'm using a mini uzi and the
thermals and a thermal scope with that
makes any sense which it obviously does
ok i just go back over here i snipe
least amount of people trying to epic
fail
after the mail sniping right there get
that guy pretty easily and then I start
to get noob tubed which nobody likes so
I decide I'm gonna go up here I decided
to go up here and I tried to snipe back
here so I don't get shot in the back
intend don't get shot in the back so I
actually saved that guy right there and
I see on my UAV I see a couple guys see
a guy back here so i decided to try and
take her wait till he comes over here
and take him out and so trying to find
him if at all possible and instead I say
screw it i'm just going to go and snipe
some people over here exactly what i
doing
over here going back I know that this
guy still over here because I see as you
can see one of my guys just died that
was that happen for like four of my guys
and I'm trying to just wait till this
guy moves which he never does
unfortunately uh in this I'm trying to
go back over here i'm just trying to
this guy got a c-130 that's back there
unfortunately I'm just trying to live so
I just decided to camp in the back
believe it or not it's probably one of
the best camping spot you could have
cash nobody suspects it and it's just
some random room to the side thankfully
i got mine creditor right there before i
died and i was like and i see that there
are like four guys that randomly came in
here trying to just not die in general
try to find a new sniping method that i
decide go back to the sniping over here
after I take out my spouse it gets not
oh I didn't even forgot I didn't even
realize I was about to get my hairs okay
then I just put it basically in front of
the house so anybody that's in front of
the house like that guy is gonna die
like those people are going to die it's
just annoying to get some odd killed
it's just annoying
I know I grown fit rages I've thrown my
controller my brother before don't
comment about that trying to survive her
again actually no didn't realize what
was happening there was a guy in the
house with a TMP and everybody was just
like bull rushing him and kill them you
can get it no one died now ok you can
look back at that I got three shots on
that guy in the head or at least two on
the head you can I will you can rewind
and look at that frame by frame I got
that guy it should if not let's not
should have not taken more than one shot
killed again ok now they're starting the
now the other team is starting to rush
the house not a good name you and what
I'm trying to do is I'm just trying to
stop that in cali which does work to
some extent and then it doesn't work at
least i think you're not entirely sure
I'm going back the sniping over here
which basically I spend almost this
entire sizes house deployment trying to
get my Harrier strike without dying
which go back into the bathroom or maybe
not I thought I went back into the
bathroom anyway I get my Harriers right
here and I get my second harrier of the
game is and even if we're losing I'm
still doing really fine that's right
actually I do like getting
katey sagal 420 nomination any other
almost any other game type Philippe
search or demolition delay on we'll try
for the objective but for domination I
just trying to get either kills or a
good k 2 year or something like that in
my hair you well my hair you're here
it's like five kills for me if not are
not like five six kills for me and then
somebody decides to be a buzzkill and
blow it up
unfortunately there's some guy I just
realized something you're supposed to
wow epic double epic fail sniping right
there usually I can do some pretty good
with sniping but i'd have to say from oh
that makes up for it sniping a guy
without even seeing it through the bush
okay right here that is that is even
more bull crap look at that look at that
and so I decide I want to get my revenge
scheme so somebody takes my revenge from
John that's not fair that is not fair
okay Oh anyway trying to get my revenge
and I do thankfully it gives you that
was the guy because I gotta pay back
trying to epic fail sniping again
Rapha's Rapha's Rapha's Rapha's Rapha's
is good is a good gun you can get pretty
pissed when it's used against you though
only bad thing okay I decide to pick up
the ACR but it has pretty much less than
half of a round clip so it's not what I
decided to instead of trying rush be
even actually no I decided before we got
beat to try and rush be and as you can
see that guy's sniping obviously in the
ne estate and I'm trying to take him out
through the wall but I don't have FMJ on
okay over here so I don't get shocked
back I decide to shoot this guy in the
back and I took this guy's I'm 16 so we
could keep see ha check this point I'm
trying to just get kills and get another
hopefully another very year work down
over when you're going I don't think I
do UAV online and just running around i
decided to try and get the house or try
to go to the house but doesn't seem to
work very well this little epic fail
right there get my killed by my own stun
grenade and then i get killed with a
shotgun one it's just something from
call of duty for that i like better in
this game why can't why couldn't you
make a spaz 12 a primary weapon it's
good enough to be a primary weapon okay
i just i tried to go over to be before
but then I decided I just wanted to rush
the house with my shotgun since pretty
much everybody's in there I see this
guy's right here and I galen with while
I am stunned because i'm awesome
and the game is about to end ever then I
pretty much just go awesome with all my
shotgun right here and he like got three
kills right off back and I get shot the
back back into parently I slept with my
Claymore there which that's always
helpful okay right here we're about to
lose but I still want a cap position
along the way cuz it's just better try
this night and then the game ends
unfortunately as I'm trying to snipe a
guy I don't like this I got thirty five
and seven which is always good so see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
