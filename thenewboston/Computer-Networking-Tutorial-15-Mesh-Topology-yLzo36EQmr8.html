computer networking tutorial and in this
video we're going to be going over the
last apology now I say this is the last
apology because it's called a mesh
topology in it's not the last apology
because of course you can just go ahead
and have you know unlimited number of
topologies and there's also you know
like a star ring topology in different
topologies where basic topologies are
mixed together but this is the last main
one that I'm going to be teaching and in
the next couple tutorials we're going to
be moving away from layouts and moving
into something a little bit more
interesting but for now I want to go
over this topology let's say that we
have let me just draw like five pcs or
something PC here a PC there a PC
everywhere PC and you know it doesn't
matter if these are you know desktop pcs
or laptops or anything like that and you
actually need more than um you need
three or more for this missed message
apology to work out but this is
basically what it is it's a topology
where every single node is connected to
every other node so this
I'm just draw it real quick um let's see
what else this would be connected to
this this to this and of course so I
think if I draw it like this then this
blue thing is of course Ethernet and as
you can see every single computer in
this network is connected to every
single other computer for example if you
look at one this one is connected to
this this this and this so it's very
clear to see exactly what a mesh
topology is so now let's go ahead and
take a look at the good parts and also
the drawbacks of this network now the
good part is let me go ahead and change
my color to red the good part is let's
say you have a cable that breaks right
here well since all of these species
provide or should I say are all
connected your data is provided an
alternate route so instead of going the
data going directly to this PC if these
two computers want to communicate it
could go to this PC
and then go to this PC so again like I
said your data has an alternate route in
case you know a cable breaks or node
goes down or anything like that and
that's kind of cool because it has
built-in protection now another thing is
that even though more notes maybe you
had another PC and it's connect to the
system PC it would get more complicated
it's actually beneficial for some reason
and that is because the more nodes equal
more communication paths so let's say
that I don't know this cable went out
right here and also this PC went out
right here so the data couldn't go from
here probably easier if I'd read like
this from here to here well if this PC
went out then your data could still go
from here to here or from here to here
so on and so forth so actually even
though when you add pcs it would get
more complicated as an entire network it
would also provide more communication
paths now those are some good things but
let's go ahead and talk about some bad
things as you can see there is lots of
cable in here here here here and
whenever you have lots of cable that
means that this is going to cost a lot
of money so it's very expensive to set
up a mesh topology especially if you
have a bunch of different computers a
bunch of different nodes another thing
is that you know when I talk about NIC
cards and I see well typically if you
put you know let me see if I still have
my star example oh let's see like in
this star example right here this
where's my drug this PC right here would
only have to have a NIC card with one
port in it because it only has one
Ethernet cable going to one router so of
course one cord and that would mean only
one port in your ethernet card but for
here let's go ahead and take a look at
this PC for example this would need a
NIC card that had one two three four
ports so the more computers in your
network the MOE or should I say the
bigger NIC card you have so in this
example each
PC needs input for four cables so of
course a more expensive knit card so
that's another reason why it's going to
cost more money because in also whenever
you expand you're going to have to put a
new knit card in get more cables so on
and so forth so that's the good and
that's the bad basically the good is it
has a lot of built-in protection and a
lot of different paths of communication
that the data can go through but the bad
part is it's expensive because you need
a lot of cable and you need NIC cards
that can input a lot of different chords
or you know handle a lot of different
Wi-Fi so overall I would say that
typically in your home network this
usually isn't in lands at all because
it's very complicated you're going to
often see this in either man or way in
because this is really good for you know
big fiber-optic networks because they
can all communicate to each other and of
course you don't want to set up you know
your big worldwide AT&amp;amp;T that for example
doesn't want to set up their network
where if one station goes out in
California then the entire you know
Internet doesn't shut down so that's why
they have a lot of different you know
checks and balances because of course
with big worldwide networks it's a lot
safer and also in worldwide networks
they wouldn't use Ethernet they would
use fiber optics or these cables right
here would be something that could
handle a lot more data so that's
basically the benefits of a mesh
topology and well that's all the
topologies like I said that we're going
to be going over in this little tutorial
series but I just want to point out that
typically in a network you often have a
hybrid topology like a mesh bus or a
star ring is a very common one so
anyways I'll shut up now in the next
tutorial
going to be going over something very
interesting so I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
