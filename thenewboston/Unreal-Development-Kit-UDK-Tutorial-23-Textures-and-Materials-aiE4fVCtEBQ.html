Tesoro and in the last tutorial I taught
you guys how to use material expressions
to make a very basic material in this
case just a plain old pink material and
in this tutorial what I'm gonna be doing
is I'm gonna be teaching you guys how to
use textures and hold on a second my ear
just gonna I have no idea but it seems
every time I hit the record button my
ears are itching it's the weirdest thing
but anyways and this is aura what I'm
gonna do doing is I'm gonna be teaching
you guys how to use textures so we can
use textures and materials instead of
just a plain solid color for example
whenever you're making like a 3d house
we want a texture for the siding in the
windows and we want a texture to
simulate the shingles on the roof so of
course we can't just use basic plain
colors for this we need some picture
basically so typically we're going to
create textures and places like
Photoshop in external programs or you
can go ahead and buy textures offline
but for now just to make sure we're all
on the same page I'm just going to be
using some built in textures that are
already included in the content browser
so the very first thing we need to do is
we already have our package in our group
set up we need to create a new material
so go ahead and right-click and just go
ahead and select new material and again
like I said our package and grouping is
already set up so I'm gonna give this
material a name of crappy material Oh
too and go ahead and click OK and it's
gonna open up that material in the
material editor now a couple of things
on one point now is this first of all
you guys probably are noticing that my
material expressions window is closed
and I actually closed that for a reason
because I have an easier way where you
can work with material expressions in
adam2 your big pain now aside from just
dragging and dropping them from the
material expressions window you can also
right-click and select all of your
expressions from here and this gives you
a nice a better organized list that all
your material expressions are rather
than this window where you have to
scroll down and
I'm also go ahead and close out of that
I'm not gonna be using that anymore so
in order to add a texture to a material
what we need is the material expression
texture sample so go ahead and
right-click and under our texture group
we're gonna find this new texture sample
now go ahead and we're gonna be applying
this eventually to the diffuse property
right here so go ahead and control and
scroll this up to the diffuse now I want
to say this before I even continue in
the last Sorel I told you guys that the
diffuse was kind of the overall color of
your material that may have been
confusing and I probably shouldn't have
chose those words the diffuse is pretty
much the overall look of your material
so you can give it a basic color but you
can also give a texture so say we add a
brick texture or wood texture or metal
texture and we plug that into the
diffuse then your material will look
like that brick or wood or what else
that is a metal so basically diffuse is
not color it's the overall look I don't
want to confuse you guys so we're gonna
be making a texture here plug it in into
the diffuse and whatever texture we have
here is gonna give our overall look of
the material so that being said let me
go ahead and put my money where my mouth
is and actually show you guys how to add
a texture in this texture sample so if
we go ahead and we click this expression
right here it takes two properties the
first one is what texture do you want to
associate it with and the second one is
the description and by the way every
material expression has a description
it's basically just a little comment
that you can have to organize your
material expression so if we go ahead
and type like bricks right here because
we're gonna be adding a brick texture
and we click out we can see that we get
a nice little comment that says bricks
right above here again it's not required
but if you want to have a nice little
comment above your expressions go ahead
and type it in the description so now
let me go ahead and show you guys how to
associate this expression with the
actual texture go ahead and clear
actually
did you know that in Windows 7 if you
just go ahead and grab a window and pull
it to the right it'll make it exactly
that size and the same thing if you pull
this one exactly to the left it'll kind
of line up so that's not a UDK thing
that's just a Windows 7 thing for all
you Windows 7 users I actually use that
quite a bit so now that I'm done with
that little rant go ahead and clear out
everything so you're in all assets and
clear out both of these and we're gonna
be looking for a texture so go ahead and
select textures right here and I'm gonna
be looking for building textures right
here so in order to associate a texture
with a material expression go ahead and
select that texture don't go ahead and
double click here it's going to open up
the material editor just go ahead and
select it now back in your material
editor window go ahead and hit this
green button right here when you have
your texture sample selected and what
this green button says is whatever you
have currently selected in your content
browser and in this case is this brick
texture that's the texture I want to
associate with this so go ahead and hit
green and as you can see since that
brick material was currently selected
that's the texture that we want to use
whenever we're referencing this bricks
expression so that's pretty cool that's
how you do that now saying all right we
got this texture setup so how do we make
a apply to our material well all we need
to do is we need to drag the black
output into this input for diffuse and
remember the diffuse like I said is the
overall look for your material so
whenever we're outputting this texture
into the diffuse this over I'll look for
material is going to be this texture
right here so that's why when we're
scrolling our material that's what we
get pretty cool huh
so in the next story I'm gonna be
telling you guys how to add kind of like
detail or I'll cover that in the next
story for now don't worry about it for
now I have to worry about is go ahead
and apply these changes and that's gonna
save your material basically and then
make sure you right-click and save your
package as well
and that's gonna save everything inside
your material just go ahead and make
sure you clear out of that so you can
see it so now our material is saved and
we are good to go so that's all I have
for you guys in this tutorial in the
next story we're gonna be editing this
brick material to make it look even
better so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
