tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna
continue working on our writer class and
finish it up alright so the first thing
we're gonna want to do right here is
basically just create a method to write
a single character into the file so
we're just going to go ahead and say
public good and we're gonna want to name
this method right character so just go
ahead and stay right here right there
and then we're just gonna have the user
pass through the character that they
want written into the file so it's a
character and I'm just going to call
this two right alright and then we can
just go ahead and use the write method
inside of the binary writer class to
write this character into the file so we
can just say BW for a binary writer and
stay right and then just pass through
that character that these are passes
through this method alright so it was
really nothing special to it there you
don't have to reverse it or anything
like that alright so I'm going to
subtract that there alright so now we're
just gonna go ahead and create a method
to write a character right to the file
so to say public lloyd wright rector's
and then we're just gonna have the user
pass through a character array of
characters if they want written into the
file and just like all the other methods
they're gonna call this variable to
write okay
so now we can just go ahead and use the
write method just like before to write
our character array into the file so we
can say V W dot right and then just pass
our character array right on food so to
write and the reason that we don't have
to reverse it even it doesn't matter
what quite ordered is is because
characters are never stored backwards so
you're never gonna see like a string
written or characters written where the
user wants to store like ABC and it's
written like CD a it's just never gonna
be written like that so there's no
reason to reverse it if the by order a
little on the inner big endian or any
like that so we can just go ahead and
write it out straight like this and
it'll just write out like I'm a VC if
the user passes through a VC right there
alright so the next thing we have to do
is create a method you just go ahead and
close our binary writer so that the user
can you use the file that they're
writing in somewhere else so we're just
going to say public void close and then
think we don't need any information from
the user so just empty parameters right
there and then we're just gonna go ahead
and say e W dot close and that'll just
close the binary right here so the user
can use the file that they're writing in
somewhere else
okay and inside of our reader class we
had a method that is called change byte
order and this change by clothes are not
that basically allowed the user to
change the by order to something
different so if the by order was like
little endian and the user wanted to
change it to big endian they could just
pass big endian right through here and
it would change the byte order to big
endian but we're gonna want to need this
inside of the writer class as well and
since this doesn't have anything to do
with a reader or a writer you can just
have this in our base i/o class so we
don't have to write it twice so we're
gonna go ahead and copy this right there
and then just go ahead and paste it into
our base IO class now since both our
reader and writer class are inheriting
from this base i/o class on that change
by order method we'll be inside of both
of these classes so you don't have to
write it twice and that just makes
everything a hundred times easier
alright so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial
in the next tutorial we're actually
going to be making sure that our classes
work properly and they write everything
great all right so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
