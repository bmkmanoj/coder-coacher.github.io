equations and an equation comes in this
format with a variable which for this
one is X which is just a letter that's
used to represent a number so when we
solve the equation our goal is to figure
out what value X has for that particular
equation so we're today we're just going
to talk about using substitution excuse
me
subtraction and addition so here in
order to solve for X we want to get X by
itself which means that we're going to
collect the like terms of 16 and 25 so
in order to move this 16 over here
mathematically since this is plus 16
we're gonna do the opposite of adding 16
we're gonna subtract 16 and we're gonna
do that from both sides because in math
whatever you do to one side of an
equation you have to do to the other
otherwise it's not mathematically
correct so we're gonna subtract 16 from
both sides and that'll leave us with X
on the left and 25 minus 16 which is 9
on the right so that's how you solve
equations using addition and subtraction
so now we're just gonna do some examples
ok so this time we have negative 100
equals B minus 72 well this time we have
subtraction so when we want to get B by
itself we have to do the opposite of
subtraction which is addition so here
we're gonna add 72 because that's gonna
give us 0 and we're gonna add 72 to the
left as well and that's gonna give us
negative
twenty-eight is equal to B okay so over
here we have parentheses so if you
remember your order of operations we
have to do what's inside here first
before we can do anything else to the
equation so we have this side will stay
the same eight minus 13 which is
negative five so since we have
subtraction on this side in order to
undo that we're gonna add five and add
five and here we get W equals zero which
is okay that is completely an acceptable
answer okay so over here we have
fractions so the first thing we're gonna
do is get a common denominator so that
we can add or subtract these fractions
so if you look our least common
denominator would be 4 so I multiply the
top of this and the top of this and the
bottom of this by two so you'll get to
force is equal to 3/4 so in order to
undo this addition I'm going to subtract
the two force over and you get net n is
equal to one-fourth so for this last
example we have we have two fractions
that are paired with whole numbers so in
order to be able to add and subtract
these we're gonna have to write them as
an improper fraction now if you
remembered how to do that you take the
number out front multiply it by the
bottom of the denominator so 2 times 5
which is 10 Plus this one on top so you
get eleven fifths plus X
is equal to it we're gonna do the same
thing on this side 3 times 2 negative 6
plus 1 over 6 this would be negative 7 6
oh I'm sorry I don't know why what I was
thinking you multiply these two and you
get negative 6 and then you add it to
the 1 over here so you get negative 7
over 2 you always keep your original
denominator so now we have to get a
common denominator in order to subtract
these two so the common denominator here
would be 2 times 5 which is 10 so we're
gonna have to multiply this top and
bottom by 2 in this top and bottom by 5
so 22 over 10 plus X is equal to
negative 35 over 10 because you remember
we multiply the tops and the bottoms
together so now since this is this is
addition when you're gonna subtract 22
tenths from both sides and we're gonna
be left with negative 35 minus 22 which
is negative 57 over 10 X is equal to
negative 57 tenths now you can write
this as a mixed number but I'm just
gonna leave it like that but if you can
reduce you always want to reduce but
this one won't reduce right here so now
that we learned solving equations with
addition and subtraction make sure you
come back and we're gonna move on to
solving equations with multiplication
and division</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
