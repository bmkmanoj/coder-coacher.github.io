and in this video we're going to be
testing and uploading our applet seeing
if it works basically so remember in the
last couple videos when I click on that
Twitter link did you notice that
sometimes it wouldn't send any
information to me well I think that's
because Twitter thinks that my applet is
a bot so instead what I did is I changed
out Twitter for just the forum but just
go ahead and put any website in there
that's not Twitter because evidently
Twitter thinks my Java applet is ABAB so
I changed that first of all and I named
the title - awesome forum and aside from
that I also forgot to add one line of
code right here right below your
listener go ahead and add that list to
the screen if you don't do that then
your list isn't going to show up so
again copy this line of code add the
list and put it in the center and this
is going to make sure that it peers on
the screen so now with that being said
let's go ahead and run our applet now go
ahead and click this button right here
run this applet right here and our
applet viewer pops up but nothing pops
up right here because it isn't in the
browser itself so just go ahead and
close out of that and the reason that
where you ran that is because it doesn't
generate a class file until you run the
applet itself so now that we ran it our
class files should be generated so if
you go to your computer and type in oh I
forgot the name in my class buckey's
sites actually did this before
lucky sites class and search in your c
drive lucky sites that class then it
should be a few seconds and since I ran
this a couple times I'm probably going
to see a few copies of my classes
waiting for my computer alright so here
we go let me find the most recent one
all right there we go so you see that
you have two different classes and um
you may only have one but this is my
class and this is my class definition
just go ahead and copy both of them
that's all you need to worry about
raining oops oh oh I accidentally
freaking deleted it no I do not want to
do
actually want to copy you little fellas
and I want to paste it in my folder that
I renamed crap lit so paste in there so
now basically you have your two class
files which is a class definition which
is kind of like a blueprint for a class
in your class and your main HTML file
because your HTML file says okay that's
what classes we're using so now you have
everything set up and again I put those
in a folder called crap lit so now I
need to upload them to a server so here
is my computer that I'm working on right
over here and here is my server so I'm
just going to go ahead and take this
I'll make sure it's refreshed refreshed
okay everything is good to go so take
your entire folder and drag it over to
your server so now it's going to upload
to the internet so now if we open a
browser we can go to my server which is
Lisa 1986 comm slash crap lit slash
Bucky HTML now you need to go to
whatever HTML file that you are called a
you may name yours is something
different than Bucky I recommend naming
it Bucky because it's awesome but go
ahead and go to that and check it out
here is our applet and everything looks
good so far now we just have to test it
let's go ahead and click on the new
Boston org takes us to the New Boston
Network let's go back and try awesome
forum take them to an awesome freaking
forum so how sweet is that our applet
now works that's what you need to do to
upload it to server and test it out and
if you guys are getting any errors then
you guys are probably going to see a
error message instead of you know this
list right here but if you guys have any
questions about anything then go ahead
and just ask me on this forum right here
under the Java section but if not then
congratulations you guys made a very
simple applet that uses some very basic
networking capabilities again concerning
networking in Java we have only
scratched the surface we have so so much
more to cover and it's going to get so
much more in depth so much so that you
guys are going to look at this and be
like you know what this wasn't even
networking at all so thank you guys for
watching don't forget
subscribe and uh well I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
