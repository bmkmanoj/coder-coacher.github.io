exciting After Effects tutorial my name
is buddy Blackford and this is the New
Boston today we're going to be talking
about importing and setting up folders
within a project so that you are able to
pass it on to another artist usually
when you're working in a studio there is
a production line and keeping everything
neat and organized helps speed up the
process of the production line so the
next person that gets your stuff isn't
all confused about where everything is
not a bunch of mumbo-jumbo they know
what they're going to and what they're
looking for it's good to have a good
system so the first thing we'll start
out with is importing the quickest and
easiest way for me to import is just
double click over here in the project
panel it brings up your import you can
click on your whatever you want to
import and then there sometimes is a
twirl down menu that has more usually
you want to keep it on footage so let's
open this up and toe quickly bring it up
just make a complic put it on something
interesting this looks interesting and
dangerous so that's exactly what I
wanted so and then another way to import
is file import so click on file up there
go to import file let's go to my images
folder this looks like a great one
and let's see
and he looks happy nice very studly
looking all right now let's go to
another way is the hockey control eye on
a windows when I'm always using a
windows it would be command I on a Mac
so let's import that so you can import
video you can invoke import images you
can import image sequences which kind of
acts like video if you import them
correctly and then you could import PSD
s whole bunch of stuff will probably
import different things throughout the
tutorial series also we can go over the
project panel a little bit here you can
click on these columns to sort so if you
want to sort by alphabetical order sort
of my type is pretty useful you can't
grab here on the corner when it turns
into this double arrow and open it up
you can see more tabs the file path is
nice because you can use that to figure
out where your picture is supposed to be
in case you moved it by accident you can
click on up here on the corner where
there is this is called the project
panel settings and there's different
settings here you can add different
columns if you would like I pretty much
just keep it over here by the framerate
and this is basically the only
information I really ever use down here
this is the interpreted button create a
folder button create a comp button and
this is the project Settings button if
you click on it brings out the project
settings or you can I'll click on it and
it rotates between the different color
depths and this is the delete button so
we can delete whatever we click on there
use this to scroll down here obviously
and this is the quick search so if I
type in
eat it'll only show it'll bring up
everything that has the word bulky in it
which is nice it's very handy if you
have a lot of stuff and in folders you
can quickly find something and it's very
useful now when I was talking about
folders you want to keep things
organized so you could pass everything
down the pipeline nicely and there's no
problems so let's create a folder here
you name it
you always want to have a cop's folder
now if you mess up and you don't type it
incorrectly hit just hit enter and you
are able to just retype it in but I
didn't misspell it which is good and
drag your comps into there you want to
create images folder these are the three
main folders that you should usually
have and a that's the wrong button
and a video folder you can do video you
could say footage for images you can say
pictures whatever your boss wants or
whatever you feel comfortable with so I
guess that's a good overview of the
project panel here and how to import
things and it's a good idea to remember
everything oh there is one more thing
that I would like to show you the when
you click on let's say a movie or one of
your images you get a bunch of
information up here which is very
helpful actually up here right here 3:52
by 240 is your resolution so that's how
big the video is 352 by 240 here and you
get your frames per second which is
which is nice you want to make sure that
your frames per second match throughout
your comp if you have 21 that's 24 and 1
this 29.97 they're not going to really
gel and it's going to look all weird 24
frames per second is usually for film
and 29.97 is usually for television you
have the length here what type of file
it is
and then you got all the rest of your
information I mean I don't really use
this audio information too much but you
may need to use it since the video does
have audio on it yeah that's pretty much
it for this tutorial stop by for the
next one
well we're discussing something entirely
new and exciting have a good one
