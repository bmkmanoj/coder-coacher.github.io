physics lesson and in this lesson I want
to talk to you guys about two different
types of waves transverse and
longitudinal so the easiest way for me
to explain this would be first to
basically give you an example of a
transverse wave so we'll say that you
went to Kmart here's you right here will
name you Bob and you went to Kmart or
did I say Walmart can't even remember
and you bought a slinky so then you're
like oh my god this is going to be so
fun
I'm gonna invite my friend gee I
n/a n/a n/a
and I'm going to hold on to one and and
you're going to hold on to the other end
so you did that you guys are both
holding one end of the slinky but then
you thought it would be funny to start
whipping your arm up and down in this
direction right here well whenever you
did that what it did was it caused the
slinky to create these waves that kind
of look like this and they went all the
way down towards Gina now aside from you
know having fun what you notice since
you know you watch the new boss in
physics tutorials on YouTube that you
are actually making transverse waves now
the definition of a transverse wave is a
wave that vibrates perpendicular to the
motion of the wave so here is the motion
or general direction of the wave going
from Bob to Gina and of course whenever
they say vibrations they're talking
about what sort of movement caused this
wave so as you can see when you moved
your arm up and down it caused the wave
to go left to right that's why they say
perpendicular and that's the definition
of a transverse wave now what the heck
would be this other type of wave well
this other type of wave is called has a
couple names some people call it
longitudinal other people call it
compression waves and you guys are going
to see why in a second so Gina was like
you know what that is so
immature Bob making transverse waves
going all up in my body like that and
then she left you so you went ahead in
you know since she took your slinky you
had to go get another slinky at Walmart
so you decided that with this one no
more making transverse waves instead you
whose name is Bob and your new
girlfriend whose name is Bertha decided
to go in your kitchen and play with your
new slinky now what you did this time
since you decided you know you didn't
want to lose a girlfriend you took one
end of the slinky gave to Bertha while
you held the other end but this time you
took the coils and you formed kind of a
compression you pulled all of the coils
on your side together now over on her
side she didn't do the same so if you
can look at my little diagram let me
change colors for a second this area
right here would be the compressed area
and this over here of course has no
compression what's whether ever so
basically you know a slinky is like a
big spring and what you're doing is
you're taking a portion of that slinky
and squeezing the coils together causing
it to be compressed right here now
obviously once it's released the
compressed portion of the slinky is
going to travel down towards Bertha
until it eventually hits her and she's
going to absorb some of the energy so
that is basically the definition of a
longitudinal or compression wave you
guys can see why they call it a
compression wave because it's a wave
that vibrates in the same direction as
it is moving so both of the waves are
traveling in the same general direction
however the origin of the waves while
this one was up-and-down this one was
parallel or in the same direction of the
motion so just remember that both types
of waves even though they transfer
energy in especially whenever we're
looking at a lot of the formulas they
use the same formulas and what I mean by
that both of these waves even though
they look a lot different whenever i'm
explained
they both can use the formula velocity
equals wavelength times frequency and a
bunch of other formulas as well however
in the real world this is how they
travel in different types of energy use
different types of waves that they
travel through what I mean by that well
you know that's probably a weird way of
saying it but light waves they use this
type of wave to travel transverse and
things like sound waves they use this
type compression waves or longitudinal
now before I let you guys go I want to
mention a couple things that are going
to bug me if I don't mention but it's
kind of important to point out because
even though you know you're probably not
going to find this in your physics book
this is always a concept that kind of
bothers me and especially when I'm
trying to explain these things to people
and they don't get it this is what I
want you guys to know so even though
well how can I say this notice what is
happening when these waves move along
the slinky whether it's the transverse
or longitudinal waves the waves
themselves and if you just looked at you
know this from a distance it would look
like the wave was moving down the slinky
such as in this case it's going to look
like these waves between Bob and Gina
are actually moving towards genome but
the waves themselves are actually not
moving the individual coils as you can
see are not moving so if you were to
take one of these coils whether it was
you know a coil that was right here or a
coil that was right here and you painted
one of these coils pink you would see
that no matter what types of waves that
you created these coils would not move
down the slinky they would just vibrate
back and forth back and forth so just
remember that even though it looks like
the waves are actually going from Bob to
Gina or Bob to Bertha the matter does
not get transferred no matter whatsoever
gets transferred from Bob to Gina it's
only the energy from person a Bob to
Gina
person B so I just you know I like to
point that out because this is actually
true for all types of waves
waves do not transfer matter they just
transfer energy from the source which is
in this case Bob</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
