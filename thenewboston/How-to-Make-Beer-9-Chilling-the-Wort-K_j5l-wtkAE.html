chill the wort and there are many
different ways that you can show the war
I'm going to show you guys how to use a
wort chiller some people actually just
bring it out and set it in the snow or
set it in an ice bath and basically what
we're gonna do is we're gonna bring that
boiling hot liquid down to a room
temperature now before we really didn't
need to sanitize anything because of
course everything was hot boiling
bacteria can't really grow in boiling
hot wort
but now once it's at room temperature
it's the perfect medium for bacteria to
grow so anything that touches the war
after we chill it we need to make sure
its scent is sanitized
because if not bacteria can grow in our
beer so as you can see I'm in New York
and it's winter right now which means
that there's snow on the ground and
usually I hate snow but it's actually
really good for chillin war because not
only can I set the entire pot in the
snow and I help cool faster but I can
also go outside and use my host hook up
to attach to this wort chiller now if
you have one inside maybe in your
laundry room or something then you can
go ahead and use that too but the way
that these wort chillers work is
basically you take one of these and hook
it up to your hose nozzle and the water
flows through this and as cool water
flows through this it kind of acts like
a radiator or a CPU fan it's basically
going to draw all the heat away from
your beer or away from your wort and
then warm or hot water is going to come
out the other side so it's basically
going to take all the energy from there
hot beer or beer sorry I have kind of
axe in there and it's gonna pretty much
dish it out a lot faster than if you
were to just set it in a snowbank
or an ice bath so let me go ahead and do
that right now and now once you see
whenever I turn this on water is going
to start to flow through this and it's
going to take a little while because
it's going to go through all of those
coils and also come out the other side
I'm actually turn off the pressure a
little bit
so there you go and it doesn't really
matter if it leaks a little bit right
here now another thing I want to mention
is that sometimes people have different
size boiling kettles maybe they're
taller or shorter or maybe are boiling
more or less wort so if you ever want to
adjust this then what you need to do is
adjust the screws on here then you can
either contract or expand the spring or
these coils and that's how you adjust
that these two little springs right here
but anyways let me go ahead and bring
the word out here and I'll show you guys
how to chill it alright so now what we
want to do is you want to get this wort
down to room temperature as fast as we
can so go ahead and use whatever
technique you're using I'm using the
word chiller just stick it in and want
to go ahead and turn on that make sure
that none of this water from here gets
in your beard or wart now this is where
your thermometer comes in handy what you
want to do is you want to go ahead and
keep this in the ward and you want to go
ahead and take note of when it gets back
to room temperature which is around 70
that's 75 degrees Fahrenheit now another
thing that people do a lot is they
usually just go ahead and put their
chiller in the beer and just let sit and
that will in fact cool down your wort a
whole lot faster but it will close down
even faster if you move it around and
you can feel this because the more hot
water you have coming out of your hose
the better that means you're sucking
more energy from the wor away from it so
as you guys can see it's at about 120
now and going down pretty fast and if
you didn't have a wort chiller then to
get down to this temperature would take
about 20 minutes instead of two with a
wort chiller so that's why I highly
recommend investing in one of these
because remember the faster it takes to
get down to room temperature the less
chance
bacteria has of infesting we're getting
in your wort and of course we want to
limit the chances as much as we can of
having a contaminated batch of beer all
right so now we're down to proper
temperature let's go ahead and remove
this
killer and I remember like I said
everything from now on that touches this
warrant has to be sanitized</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
