tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use lists so all
you need for this tutorial is a button
and once you're put on your form just go
ahead and double click on it alright so
a list is very similar to an array the
only difference is when you're creating
a list when you define a list you want
to specify the amount of elements that
will be inside of your list for example
if we were to create an array right here
actually a string or a and just call it
great I guess instead of equal to a new
string array then inside of these two
brackets we have to specify the amount
of elements that will be inside of your
array so if you always want three before
or something like that well that's fine
but in some instances you're not going
to know the amount of elements that
would be inside of your array so instead
of having to do something complicated
what you can do is just create a list so
to create a list you just going to want
to type the list and then following that
you're going to put a less than and a
greater than sign and then inside of
here is we're going to want to put the
type of list that you're going to want
to have and we're just going to create a
string list so I'm just going to type in
their strength all right and then after
this you're just going to want to type
the name of your list I'm just going to
call it names because we're just going
to have a bunch of names inside of this
list and then you're just going to want
to set it equal to a new list and make
sure that these types are the same so if
you're creating a string list you must
study equal to a list of strings or it's
just not going to work and as you can
see right here we didn't have to specify
the amount of elements that would be
inside of our list or the amount of
string that would be inside of our list
this is very useful so in order to add
elements to our list all we have to do
is type the name of our list which is
just names and then do dot and then add
and then inside these two parentheses
right here we're just going to want to
type what we want to add so if you want
to add a person's name like Adam I'll
just add them to this names list so now
inside of our names list there is
currently one element or one string so
if I wanted to access that all I would
have to do
names for my list and then just put two
brackets and then inside up here the
index of the string that I want to
access it sends currently there's only
one element or one string inside of my
list
I'll put zero in there so a list just
like arrays start counting at zero so
the beginning element inside of the
array or this list is zero so if you put
zero in here we're just going to access
this atom element or this atom string so
let's just go ahead and display this
inside the message box and see what we
get and you should just get atom inside
the message box all right so it's just
debug here and yep we get atom all right
and if you wanted to add more elements
or more strings we could just go ahead
and add more so we just do names for our
list do dot add and then inside of
parentheses the string that we want to
add to our string list so if we just
want to add I guess yo we could do that
so now in our names list we have two
strings we have atom and we have Joe so
if I wanted to access Joe I would just
put a 1 inside of there so instead of
our list and just do a comment right
here and I'll just say inside of our
list you have atom and we have Joe
alright so if I wanted to access this
Joe I'd have to put one since it starts
counting at 0 so go 0 then 1 and so on
so I'll do 1 and I should get Joe inside
of a message box yep perfect and you can
create a list of any type you want for
example if we just wanted to create a
list of I guess integers we could just
put int inside of there and then we
could call our list of something I'm
just going to call it numbers inside
equals do a new list of integers so now
this works just like before with the
names so if I wanted to add another
number or another integer on to my list
of int I would just do numbers for my
list right there dot add and then inside
of here I just have to put the int or
the integer that I want to add to my
list so if I just want to add the number
5 let's put 5 in there and now inside of
my list I currently have one element
number so I just have five so if I want
to access that I'll just have to do
numbers and then zero since there's only
one element inside of there so starts
counting at zero so zero and then I'm
just gonna have to convert this into a
string so I'm just going to dot two
string so that we can view it in our
message box and I should get five and
message box and a debug here yep perfect
if I wanted to add another number I
could just do number or numbers for my
list right here and then do not add to
add another number to our list or
another integer and I'll just add six
six seven 667 so now inside of our
integer list we have five and 667 so it
starts counting at zero we're going to
get one and so on so if I want to access
667 I'm just going to put a 1 inside of
here and now I should just get 667
inside of the message box yep perfect
all right so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial on using lists so see you
