welcome to your 24th tutorial in C++ and
in this story we're going to be covering
the do-while loop but you guys probably
already knew that because I got a
feeling that the title is right above
this video and you know what else I do a
lot I tell you guys this is probably
going to be a short video and I just
realized that the time is right under
the video so I don't know why I say
those things but it's habit I'm going to
continue to say those things so get over
it so anyways we're going to be covering
the do-while loop in this tutorial and
if you remember from I don't know
however many tutorials those go I talked
to you guys about the while loop and the
while loop was basically a loop that you
had a test and if that test was true
then you ran a bit of code inside while
the do-while loop is basically the while
loop flipped upside down what the do
while loop does is it runs the bit of
code first and then it runs the test so
let's go ahead and let me show it to you
guys and you guys will understand better
one means let's go ahead and get a
counting variable called X and set it
equal to one this is our starting point
now the syntax for do-while loop is do
and then you go ahead and add some code
in the body so let's just go ahead and
print out X
and then after this we need to increment
X or else the loop is going to run
forever so X plus plus and now after the
body immediately after it you write
while and then after this you have your
test ended with a semicolon
a lot of people forget that semicolon
because then basic while loop
there is no semicolon if it's not in the
body so don't forget to put this in my
Coleman right here so let's give a
simple test like X is less than 10 now
go ahead and run this and check it out
just like the wild loop it ran the same
bit of code print it out X on the screen
from 1 all the way to 9 pretty cool huh
so we're saying all right a couple of
things are kind of weird here first of
all why is this loop even useful because
it seems like a bad while loop because
isn't the point of a loop to run the
test first and if the test is true then
run a bit of code but if it's false then
don't run the bit of code well people
use do loop mainly for this reason
whenever you have code in here and you
need it to run at least one time it's
guaranteed to run at least at one time
and the reason is this say you have a
test that is false like 99 well this
test is going to come false as soon as
it hits it 99 is not less than 10 99 is
a whole lot bigger than 10 so whenever
you run this is just going to print out
99 so as you can see it ensures that you
run your code at least one time before
testing it at all so no matter what this
value is it's going to do it one time
and then test it so whenever you want to
run your code guarantee that it runs at
least one time this is what you do so
that's the main reason that people use a
do-while loop to ensure their code runs
at least one time again if you have a
basic program and you just want to loop
it normally your best bet is to run the
while loop or the for loop because those
are your basic loops where you test it
and then depending on the test you run
your program so again this is basically
a weird a kind of loop this is probably
the most uncock
Loup but whenever you come across it I
wanted you guys to pick up on it
understand what it's doing and why some
people prefer it over the wall loop so
now that you have knowledge of the
do-while loop and you guys know that
it's really not that common in
programming so you don't want to use it
that often you at least know what it
does and how I was going to say how it
worked well yeah that makes sense and
how it works so anyways that's all I
have to cover for the do-while loop
pretty simple basically a while loop
flipped upside down so thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and yep I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
