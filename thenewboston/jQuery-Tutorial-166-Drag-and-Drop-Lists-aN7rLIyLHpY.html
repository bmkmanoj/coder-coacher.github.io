with the video tutorial for the new
Boston now in this example application
we're going to take a look at creating a
simple drag-and-drop list and by this
we're going to be dragging particular
elements in this case we're going to be
dragging Li elements from an unordered
list into a div and then appending the
text associated with them so essentially
what it's going to look like is this and
what's going to happen is we're going to
be able to drag elements into this div
and they actually append on here and
then we can drag more than one element
in if we like now this isn't a foolproof
shopping list I guess this the names
here give away that sort of food items
but it does give you a good idea of how
we are appending the text inside of here
depending on what we dragged in so it's
a really good way to practice the
draggable and droppable elements using
jQuery UI ok so let's go ahead and look
at the code this is the index page we've
obviously included jQuery the jQuery UI
and UI j/s which we're going to be
writing our code in now we've also got
style dot CSS which is extremely
important because we're going to need to
style up a lot of our page as well as
the borders associated with list and
obviously the list itself so the first
thing we're going to do is create an
unordered list and inside here we have
each li element and I'm going to have
three of these for three different items
this works with an unlimited amount of
items within Li tags so you can add as
many items as you want so I'm just going
to go ahead and create a few items here
and now that I've done this let's go
over to our page and you can see that we
have something looking like this now I
want to style this up to remove some of
these bullet points as well as the
padding as well on this let's go to
style dot CSS which I've included in my
document as well and let's go ahead and
style the unordered list so we're going
to have a width of 100 pixels because by
default this reaches out across the
document and we'll have problems
dragging I then want to set the padding
to zero pixels and what this is going to
do is just pull that in a little bit and
we want the list style to be none so we
don't have any of the bullet points okay
so now that we've done this let's done
this get let's go ahead and create our
div which will be our list area I'm
going to given this an ID of Lists now
at the moment obviously we don't see
anything we need to go ahead and give it
some style so inside here we want to
style our list element our list div on
our page and the width of this is going
to be 120 pixels and the height I'm
going to set to 180 pixels and then
going to give it a background color just
so you can see where it is and that's
going to be F 0 F 0 F 0 and the border
by default is going to be set to 1 pixel
solid and black so now we have something
that looks like this so we're going to
eventually be able to drag these inside
here now when we drag elements over we
want this border to increase to 2 pixels
so I'm going to go ahead and create a
class of our list div and that's going
to be called border and inside here I'm
just going to specify the border width
and that's going to be 2 pixels ok so
now that we've done this we need to go
ahead and actually start to create our
UI j/s which like I mentioned earlier we
have included in the page and this is
going to make these li elements
draggable so
let's create a document ready point here
and inside here we have a function ok so
once this is done once the page has been
loaded we want to make these elements
here draggable so we can drag them
around the page so the first thing we do
is we go ahead and use a selector this
time what we're doing is we're selecting
Li on its own so all Li elements on the
page we want to make draggable now
there's a few things we need to specify
in here being the options in for the
draggable element or draggable function
i guess if you want to call it and this
the first one is hover class and this is
going to be the class that we put into
this so the class that we apply to this
div when an element has hovered over
before we do that let's just go ahead
and look at the draggable element so you
can see that we can now drag them across
the page obviously we can drag them up
here which we don't want we'll fix that
a bit later
so the hover class is going to be border
so now when we hover out when we drag
over that hasn't worked
let's check why that might be let's just
go back into here list order
now we might want to go and say
border:2px solid black oh so my
apologies I have absolutely no idea what
I'm doing
the draggable doesn't take a hover class
because this is the draggable element
okay so that probably threw you off a
bit but the draggable element doesn't
take the hover class I'm thinking of the
div itself so let's go ahead and
actually get set the correct properties
to draggable so the containment of this
we need to set to our document and what
this does is it stops our elements going
off of the page you can see that now
they've stopped once my cursor leaves
the the document itself the next thing
we want to do is set revert to true and
what this will do is it will revert the
element back to its original location
once it has left here so it won't stay
in a particular place forever that's
extremely important because we want to
drag append and not return to its
original place okay so now on with the
actual list itself we're going to go and
make the list so we reference this as
hash lists so using a ID selector and we
want to make this droppable so now that
we've made it droppable nothing is
actually changed because we haven't
applied any events or any properties to
it now we can want to test the air
actually works so what we're going to do
is inside curly brackets we want to say
drop function and then inside this
function we're just going to go ahead
and say alert let's just pull that over
a bit we want to say alert dropped and
this will check if it's working so yeah
is working as I dropped this element
over we have this dialog saying dropped
and then that reverse back to its
original position</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
