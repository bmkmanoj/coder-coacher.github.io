another Photoshop cs6 tutorial where i'm
your host buddy blackford so today we're
gonna learn how to use the freeform pen
tool but what the magnetic function
checked and to me there should be a
whole new tool where you don't so you
can select it easier but this is how you
do it it transforms the pen tool into a
magnetic vector path drawing tool
basically so go ahead and upload in
import an image or open one that is has
pretty clear defined edges from the
background what I did is I just added
this image here it has no background and
then I put it over top of this other
layer so make sure you have your layer
selected select your free form pen tool
and make sure this magnetic is checked
now all you need to do is make sure you
are someone zoomed in so you can see the
edges and you want to have the whole
object in screen because once you click
you can't stop until you close your
shape it's just so you know so go ahead
and click near the edge of your object
and I click there and I'm not even
holding down just drag your mouse around
and it will go right to the edge of your
image so this is really easy and fast
you don't even have to be like super
precise now we're coming up to a point
where there is a kind of a sharp edge if
I come over here you can see that it
hasn't made a point yet you can click
with your mouse and it'll create a point
for you and then you can continue now if
I don't click you can see what's going
to happen here right below my mouse
right now you can see that it's not
perfectly aligned and if I try to go
like this around the edges and right
there again you see it's not perfectly
aligned that's what happened
if you don't click so use that clicking
to your advantage to make some nice
sharp edges now it's probably not gonna
click here so I'm gonna make my own same
down here and then you can come and to
your edge where the cursor turns into a
circle underneath the magnet and click
and you have closed your shape now if
you need to come back in use your direct
selection tool and you can zoom in and
edit the areas here where where it
didn't quite go and right so here I
would change the Bezier handles and drag
them out so that they went inside there
nicely and you can see you might have to
do some fixing up and stuff like that
like this this garbage right here that
doesn't look right I'll just try to fix
that it's hard to see because the points
are black and the edge is black maybe I
should zoom out a little bit I'm still
kind of hard to see but you should get
the idea if I turn this off you can see
that there is a path and in my path
section there is a work path there and
that's how you create a new path and
using the magnetic selection tool you're
gonna want to use it
along an image that's already there if
you need to trace so that's how you
create a path off of an image that you
already have and I wanted to show you
another thing we're just gonna make
anything here so I'm gonna click and
drag and make something so if you want
to just automatically close your shape
you can just double click and it will
close your shape for you creating the
rest of the line the rest of the way
there and if you don't make a new layer
when you're working on your paths it's
going to add it to the same one so
that's how you use your magnetic tool to
create paths
there's our path and remember that when
you're
create aisle lining up the points and
stuff like that you can click with your
mouse left click and it will make a
point for you and that's how you get her
on those sharp edges and everything like
that so thanks for watching this one
hopefully you guys got another trick up
your sleeve to use when you're making
paths so see you guys later and have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
