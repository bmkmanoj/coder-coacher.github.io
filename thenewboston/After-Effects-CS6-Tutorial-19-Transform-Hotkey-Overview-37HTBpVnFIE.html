buddy Blackford with another After
Effects cs6 tutorial for the new boston
today we're gonna be going over the
shortcuts so you can have them all in
one tutorial and that way you don't have
to go back to each tutorial to try to
remember what the shortcuts are and I'm
just gonna go over all the ones that we
learned real quick and then maybe in a
couple if I didn't go over so let's get
started I have a picture of my cat his
name is caddis and this was his
Halloween costume this year and when we
put it on him he didn't move he
basically just fell on his side and laid
there and he wouldn't move until he took
it off but we got this picture of him
and I used this for Halloween picture
what I post on my facebook or whatever
okay let's uh start by the timeline
panel down here and let's go over the
timeline jaquise so remember that a is
anchor point p is position s is scale R
is rotation T is opacity and if you hold
shift you can type one of those hot keys
on your keyboard and it'll add more so
if I press shift and I press R for
rotation it'll add it in there let me
press in a for anchor point or P for
position it'll add them all in there so
let's get rid of those
now if you want to open up a transform
menu with the stopwatch turned on you
hold alt or option on the Mac shift and
then press the reveal key which I'm
gonna do rotation so alt shift are got a
click on the layer o shift R and then it
brings up rotation with it with the
stopwatch on which starts your key
framing and to turn it off
same thing turns it off if you press you
it'll show all your animated properties
so I press you right now click on the
timeline always make sure that the time
line panel is highlighted when you're
doing this press you and it will bring
up the properties that you have animated
so I animated the position on this just
so I could show you how you worked now
if you want to find all your properties
that have been changed from default you
press euu so to use in succession and I
added a sharpen on this picture which I
changed it from 0 to 20 so that's not
default that's 20 and then the position
was changed and the scale was changed to
200 instead of 100
so that's how you find things that you
have changed now if you want to solo
your selected properties which let me
select scale and position here I could
select them both by holding ctrl while I
click and I press SS so two S's in a row
it now goes to the properties I have
selected if I want to hide a property
I will hold alt and shift or option +
shift on a matte Mac and click on it it
goes away now to bring up the transform
dialog boxes you will see this one you
hold ctrl shift and you push the hot key
for your transform property which I'm
going to use position control shift P
yep I got it right
and that brings up the dialog box now if
I want to stretch the layer to fit the
comp let's use a solid real quick
because if I stretch this picture it'll
look all weird
so there new solid and we'll make it the
cops will make it not the comp size so
let's just bring this down to something
random
it's hide the hot dog cat caddis so to
do that to make this the size of the
comp I will hold ctrl + O and press
there we go
don't always use that I always might
it's hard to remember all the hotkeys so
usually for that one I just go to layer
solid settings and then make comp size
but if you can remember all these
hotkeys and you can remember that using
that one that is useful and turn this
off because it's bright as hell alright
and that's about it for the hotkeys the
that are important at least and we will
go over more things like creating a
solid that has a hotkey control Y just
real quick creates a solid and you make
solids all the time they're good for
backgrounds and things like that and I
masks
shapes whatever we'll go over that in a
while but just I didn't even really need
to tell you that yet because I haven't
gone over solids but I will later on and
that stack or two that I took last
tutorial still on and I'm still watered
so it seems to be a good energy shot
because it's only a dollar
let's end this tutorial and we'll move
on to the next one I hope to see you
guys there see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
