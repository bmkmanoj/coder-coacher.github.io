code the wild chatting method so while
chatting with server and this course is
private void while chatting and we can
just go ahead and oh hello cats log
throes IO exception looking good so the
first thing we want to do is now that
they are connected and they can begin
chatting it would be a good idea to ah
crap what the heck that I named that
able to type I think was the name of the
last one and we might as well set this
equal to true so after that just go
ahead and throw everything in a do-while
loop while we did before or like we did
before I mean so do-while message equals
server and so basically as long as the
server doesn't type end then you can
continue having your guys as a
conversation so inside this do I'll just
go ahead and put a try/catch
klas not found exception in class not
found exception I own and for this all
we have to do is show message and we'll
just put something like on whenever we
receive an object that we don't know the
type of it or just be like um I don't
know that object type something like
that but anyways what we want to do now
is now get to the meat of this tutorial
and that is what do we want to happen
while you are chatting with someone else
well the main thing that we want to do
is we already pretty much handle the
functionality to send a message now what
we want to do is pretty much wait for
messages from them to be received and
just display it on the screen so set the
variable message equal to first of all
we want to turn into a string input read
object so what this is going to do is
whatever they are sending through their
stream which is of course the input as
you can see right here we're going to
read whatever they whatever object they
sent treati is a string and store it in
the variable message like that so now
that we have that stored and variable in
order for the user to see it
we just need to throw in show message
which basically is a method that we're
going to be building that displays it in
the main chat window and we'll just go
ahead and stick this on a new line so
new line plus message pretty much takes
the string with a new line behind it
because you want each one on a new line
and displays it in the chat window so
basically whenever you're chatting
that's all you have to do make sure that
the user is able to type because um you
know you want them to be able to send
messages and wait to receive a message
and then show it in the show message arm
method whenever we do that and guys I'm
going to be coding the send message
method later on and that's the
functionality that lets you send a
message
so you'll see later on whenever I do
that but anyways for right now thank you
guys for watching and again one last
time this probably the last time I'm
going to say this if you want any of
this completed source code then just go
ahead and go to my forum tnb forum comm
link below get it all there for free
you're welcome so like I said thank you
guys for watching I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
