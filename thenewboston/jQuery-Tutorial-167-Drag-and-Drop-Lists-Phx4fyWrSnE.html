ahead and get rid of that now the
properties we need to give the drop of a
list are like I was attempting to do
before the hover class and the hover
class is going to like I said change the
border of this because we've specified a
border class inside of our styled CSS
file and that's just going to be border
then no need to add the dot as you
usually would think to do so so now when
we have an element over this the border
changes to two pixels as opposed to one
so this just ensures that user knows yep
that's a that's a horrible that okay so
now what we want to do is we want to
allow only a specific set of elements so
let's just say you had this list
embedded on a lot of other content in
your page the may or may not be
draggable if you did have other
draggable elements you only want this
particular list here to be allowed to be
dragged in here so all li elements
draggable inside of this box so you can
either specify a general set or a
particular class so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to only accept Li and this
means that if we have any other
draggable objects they won't be allowed
to be dragged inside of this box so
that's extremely important as well we
only want this predefined list to be
able to be dragged in there in actual
fact what we could do is we could which
we should have done is give these a
class so item and it's a class of item
and this a class again of item and now
what we could do is we could change this
except to sorry item and now this class
here will only be allowed inside of this
div area so you can see that it still is
not allowing us there that's because we
need to specify a dot because we're
referencing a class on the page so yet
so now that when we drag it over it's
allowed but any other draggable elements
that don't belong to the class item
won't be allowed so that's extremely
important as
well okay so now that we've done this we
need to create some callback events
based on events under this droppable so
what we want to do is we want to create
a drop function when something has been
dropped so we come a separate I'm going
to come down a little bit here to make
this a bit neater and I'm going to
specify a drop event here now the drop
event is going to be a function so we
create a function as we normally would
and the contents are going to go in here
so let me just go ahead and alert
dropped again so that works the same way
as the example we looked at previously
where when we drop it says dropped but
this time when we actually drop in we
want to take the text associated with
the current element we've dragged and
append it into this list so let's leave
this part for now now inside draggable
when we actually when we actually go
ahead and start the dragging we want to
set a variable with the text associated
with that element so hopefully that
makes sense if not I'm going to go ahead
and do that now
I'm going to come and separate that and
come down and inside here I'm going to
say start so I'm using the start event
and this is obviously again any function
this time inside here I want to set a
variable called contents equal to this
meaning the currently dragged element so
if I was dragging soya milk contents
would then equal soya milk if I was
dragging bread contents would then equal
bread and so on with water and any other
elements so this dot
which takes the text in between the Li
tag there so content will now equal the
currently dragged element so the
draggable element once it starts we have
this variable called contents with the
name of it so then what we can do inside
of our droppable list under our drop
event we can actually specify what we
want to append into this list so for
example or not really for example what
we're actually going to be doing we're
going to be appending to list so list
dot append and we want to append
contents then what we want to do is just
append a break on to that contents as
well and then we've got a line break
after each one so now what happens is as
we drag the element it's released and
the contents of that is applied into
here so we can take a look at this at a
slightly you know lesser working level
and we can go ahead and in here now we
can just go ahead and alert content so
once something is dropped in we alert
the name of that so you can see it
working sort of more more purely as
opposed to appending it so once we've
dragged something we grab the content
and apply it once we've dropped it into
this list so again let's change that
back to where it was okay so with the
way this has been done we're picking up
all the elements and we're making them
draggable we're only allowing elements
or li elements or any element with the
class item so it's extremely easy for us
to actually just go ahead and create a
new item as long as the class is still
equal to item we can go ahead and create
a new item
for example flour and we can come back
and we've got this new flour element
which we can now drag because it is an
Li element and we can still append it to
this list so the you know the list
really is endless you can add and append
or create as many li elements as you as
you wish and then these will add to the
list obviously we've got some styling
issues there but we could go ahead and
just change our style and we can say
overflow:auto and as we add items to the
list that would then just create scroll
bars for us so some CSS styling there
and then we have a scrollable list so
obviously in practice this isn't great
because if we were to add soya milk for
example accidentally twice we may want
it to then say soy milk times two we
might also want to be able to remove an
item for example there are ways you can
do this but for now this is just a short
example on dragging and dropping lists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
