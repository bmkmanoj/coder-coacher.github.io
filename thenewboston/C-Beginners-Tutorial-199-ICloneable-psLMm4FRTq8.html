tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to be looking at the eye cloneable
interface so all you're going to need
for this tutorial is a button a string
and you're also going to need to have a
clasp and inside of your class just make
sure you have a string property you can
name anything you want alright so before
we can actually look at using the eye
cloneable interface or first gonna have
to look at what the clone method does so
the clone method will basically just
return the exact copy of the object that
you called it from for example if we
were to clone my name right here we say
my name cloned this clone method will
basically just return an exact copy of
my name so if we were to create a new
string and study equal to my name clone
the value of my name is Adam will be the
same as whatever we step is equal to so
if we're going to say right here string
cloning equals my named clone clone and
my name will both be equal to Adam since
we just cloned my name and since this
clone method returns an object or this
can have to convert it into a string
though is gonna cast a string right here
alright so now clone and my name are
both equal to Adam so we were to display
in a message box on my name Jeremy and
clone then it would be Adam since my
name equals Adam and just cloned my name
and set that equal to clone all right so
this is debug here and make sure that it
works yep Adam perfect all right so once
again this clone method will basically
just return an exact copy of my name and
that works for everything or every class
that the icon will interface is
implemented it
alright so let's actually look at how to
clone our own classes or our own objects
so the first thing that you're going to
want to do right here is inherit from
the eye carnival interface you're just
going to put a colon after your class
name and then just right eye cloneable
right after it re and the eye crow Noble
interface only has a one method inside
of it and that's clone so we're just
going to say
public objects since we actually have to
return something we're going to actually
return a copy of this class right here
so we're just going to call this clone
and we don't need any input from the
user
all right now you're probably thinking
well how are we going to actually clone
our object well we could create a new my
class and set the name property equal to
the name property inside of this class
but there's a way easier way what we
could do is just say return this and
remember this is basically just our
class right here so if someone were to
create an instance of our class right
here and set the name property equal to
Adam then it would return an exact copy
of my class so the name property inside
of this would be Adam as well all right
so let's just make sure that this works
right here we'll just go ahead and
create a new instance of myclass call it
MC instead I equal to a new my class and
then we just say MC dot name equals Adam
and then if we were to just clone MC it
would be the same as MC so through
despair right here and say my class
clone class equals MC dot clone then my
clone class and MC are the exact same
therefore the name property inside of
clone class and MC are the exact same
and once again this method returns an
object so we're going to have to convert
it into my class I'm just going to pass
that as my class right here and then
we're just going to display the name
property of this class and a message box
so we're just going to say right here
message box to go clone class name and
we should just get Adam in a message box
because once again we set the name
property of MC equal to Adam and then we
just cloned that MC class and set the
equal to clone class so we should just
get Adam in a message box yep perfect
all right and returning this will work
for anything so if you had like a
hundred properties it would work just
the same all right so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial on using the I
cloneable interface so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
