here with another After Effects cs6
tutorial and I'm going to teach you how
to use enable character 3d in your text
options to make things like this here so
when you enable per character 3d you get
another axis that you can work with and
that is the z-axis and it gives you like
a different kind of 3d going on where
don't really need a camera and
everything which is pretty nice so I'm
going to get to showing you how to make
something like that and let's start so
I'm going to delete out my text and I'm
just going to write something in my text
box here I think is it - there so we've
got our text here I'm just going to
scale it up ooh 3 yes and it's scaled up
here so we can just see a little better
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
add something that has Z the z axis on
it so something like opacity won't work
because there is no z axis on it so I'm
going to try I'm gonna use position
because that's the best way to
demonstrate now if we look down here at
the range selector we've got 0 0 the
left one is X down here and the one next
to it is the y-axis so you can see that
and you know that from being able to
move position from like the beginning of
our tutorials here so we're going to
come up to animate again and click on
enable per character 3 now you can see
we've got the z axis going on here to be
able to see this a little better I'm
going to be switching between the active
camera and custom view one where custom
view 1 has a dummy like a dummy camera
already set up for us I'm going to go
back to my selection tool and I'm just
going to scrub and you can see how I can
move in the z axis now which is this
blue arrow
so let's open up our range selector here
and if I move my start nothing's going
to happen right now we have to set the
position to be where we wanted to start
out from and then where it is right now
is where the position is going to end so
let's do something like negative 400
because when you go in the negatives it
comes towards the camera when you go in
the positive it it goes away from the
camera so there's negative 400 there and
then if you want it to look kind of like
right on you're going to want to
increase the height so I'll try negative
100 not exactly sure how high so let's
go back to our active camera we can see
that we've got to increase how high it
goes so there we go and now if I move
the start here it's going to right on
there so all I have to do now is just
animate my start from 0 to 100 and it
should be issued just right on
you do a ram preview here real quick and
this is what we get
so that was easy enough now if you
really want to make it like fly-in we
can add some motion blur to it real
quick make sure this button right here
is enabled which enables motion blur for
your layers and then click on this
column right here and that'll add some
motion blur it look like your letters
are like flying in like this so this is
kind of like like flying in or like a
write on kind of something like a
typewriter like smashing them down or
something like that so that's how you
use the enable per character 3d pretty
much all it does is just add on the
z-axis and I'll tell you which character
or which animators here we can use them
for the anchor point position scale and
rotation we'll all get a third z-axis
dimension so that means that blur
opacity skew the fill color stuff like
that that that stuff isn't affected when
you enable per character 3d so let's
remember it is anchor point position
scale and rotation so let's just add
something like rotation in for fun
so I went up and add it went up to
animate and I selected a rotation which
is here and what's come in to somewhere
around the middle here and let's mess
with our rotation and see how it works
out
see we can rotate our characters like
that and now they'll flip off the screen
now they're like flying so you could
also animate this the other way let me
give you a ramp review
so they're like flying in
so you could do something where you
animate this the other way and they fly
off the screen so maybe I put this at
100 down and then at the end to zero
I think they'll fly off the screen
check it out
yep
so there you go there's a couple ways to
use the enable per character 3d and
