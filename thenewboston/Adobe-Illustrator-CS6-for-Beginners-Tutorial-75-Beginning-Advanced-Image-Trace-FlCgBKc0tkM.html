or EO my name is buddy and today we're
gonna continue learning about tracing
raster graphics and creating vectors out
of them and we're gonna learn about the
Advanced Options that you see that I've
got here and I'm gonna show you how to
get there and everything so let's go
ahead first I'm gonna make this so it's
not a vector anymore and I'm gonna go to
object and I'm gonna go to image trace
and we're gonna go to release and it's
going to change it back to the source so
in case you were messing with image
trace earlier you don't know how to get
it back besides pressing ctrl Z you
click on your object that has been
traced click on object and then go to
image trace and hit release alright so
go ahead and select the object that you
want and we're gonna go to window and
we're going to go to image trace and
it's gonna bring up this right here this
is what its gonna look like up here at
the top you've got presets and there's a
couple different ones auto color high
color low color grayscale black and
white and outline and they're pretty
self-explanatory except for auto color
but auto color is gonna try to get you
the best looking with a color in it so
and then you got the high color which is
lots of colors low as low or a little
amount of colors grayscale gives you a
gradient value of black to white and
then black and white is just either
black and white or white I mean and then
outline is just the paths so if you just
do outline you can go ahead and color it
in yourself if you wanted to and then
we've got our other presets down here
which have the presets that we had
before that were next to image trace
button and then we've got our view how
to look at our different views once you
it has betrays we've got our modes we've
got black and white grayscale and in
color so I'm going to put this to color
we've got our palette which you can use
a limited palette or a full tone or
you can pick from your document library
that you have the amount of colors and
then our whole advanced here so let's
start off before we get into the
advanced by clicking on something like
auto color these are presets up here so
we'll click on auto color first and I'll
hit OK and usually this goes fairly fast
the screen does go black B while it's
doing this so I'm not really too sure
why it does that but I'll pause it and
then I'll get back to when it has
finished doing this progress here hey
everybody I'm back and this is what we
came up with with using the auto color
and I think it's a really artistic
looking really cool and I didn't really
have to even do too much to even do it
all I had to do is click the preset and
I've got some really sweet looking
vector ducks so we've got our presets
here we can view the different modes
here's the source image here's our
outlines only and you can see all the
different paths that it contains and
that's pretty much all we can see there
if I click and hold on this I it'll let
me see the source image and if I let go
of it it goes back to the trace result
and that's a little quick way to look at
look at the differences if you want to
flip back between them real quick and
compare okay and then we've got our
colors here it looks like there was 25
in this you can adjust this to get more
colors if you wanted to or you could go
down to get less but I advise you
against using way too many colors
because then it'll get a little bit
wacky just be careful and use a good
amount and experiment with how much
looks good
how many different colors look good and
how many colors look less so this kind
of reminds me of like a watercolor
painting and I kind of like that and it
looks pretty cool I think so let's um
well I was going to get more into these
Advanced Options but it looks like I'm
gonna leave that for the next tutorial
so I'll just go over something here I'm
gonna release this from its image trace
so it's not traced anymore I'm just
gonna do the outline once so you guys
can see what it is instead of starting
to get into the advanced I'm gonna hit
OK and it's gonna do its a thing here
let's see how fast yeah it goes a lot
faster when you're just doing the
outline looks like just doing a few
things I'm just gonna pause it once
again and then pop back in oh no it's
already it already did it but this is
outlined obviously it then it didn't
work so what you would do is you would
adjust this threshold and I'm not sure
which one would be faster
let's try less it's gonna do this I'll
pause it real quick and I'm back and
this is what happens when the threshold
gets too low and let's bring up the
threshold a little bit higher these are
these are actually pretty quick I
probably don't even need to pause it but
when you do put the threshold up higher
it does take a little bit longer but
here's what we got for the threshold so
what you're gonna do is you're gonna
have to try to find a threshold that
works or maybe just outlines on this
image just don't really work all that
well now I'm getting closer to what
might be something that might be kind of
acceptable but obviously it's not right
now and then we wouldn't end up having
to get into these Advanced Options for
that but I'll leave that for the next
tutorial
sorry further like a lackluster finish
the auto color was way better so I'll
see you guys in the next tutorial we're
gonna be going over these Advanced
Options and I'll let you know what all
the stuff means in it so see you guys in
that tutorial have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
