intermediate Java tutorial and in this
tutorial we're going to be going over
the init method and what the init method
is is is pretty much well it is a method
that is inside J applet so we inherited
by default but we're going to be doing
is overriding it and pretty much putting
some stuff in it that we want to happen
so let's go ahead and I already imported
what I need to import and also extend J
applet because you know you obviously
need to do that and let's go ahead and
build a program that takes two numbers
from the user and pretty much adds them
together and prints out the answer so
pretty much like a little mini
calculator so we first need a private
variable private double sum because some
you know seems like an appropriate
variable name and now what we need to do
is overwrite this method in it so public
void in it and it doesn't take any
parameters and what init is short for an
it is initially initialization or have
your say irrelevant and what happens is
before your applet Evon loads or does
anything at all this is what happens
first so if you were building a
calculator before I even start
calculating anything what you need to do
is get numbers from them to begin with
so let's go ahead and put string oppa FN
for first number and then go ahead and
put J option pain and you guys should
know this from hopefully you've been
watching my other tutorial so I'm not
going to go ahead and explain all this
and just go ahead and put show input
dialog and this is pretty much like a
prompt box and the prompt is enter first
number so whatever number they enter
it's going to be stored in the string
variable FN and later we're going to be
converting that string into a double so
go ahead and copy this and paste that
right below it and instead of FN write
SN and set a first number right second
so now the first thing we built is we
gave two little dialogue boxes one place
to open two
enter their first number-one place to
enter their second number and in case
they didn't know they're going to be
adding these numbers together so now
what we need to do is we have two
numbers but they're strings right now
and we can't add strings together if we
do it just looks like one big string so
what we want to do is convert the
strings to a double so go ahead and put
double and one and set this equal to
double dot parse double and go ahead and
write FN in there and what this is going
to do is take the string FN which say is
like 17 and convert it to a double 17 so
now we can do numerical methods on it so
let's go ahead and just copy this
because I'm too lazy to type it all out
and paste this and put n2 and we want to
convert the second number SN and n2 so
now we can work with numbers instead of
strings which is a whole lot easier for
building calculator so go ahead and take
that sum variable and I press the little
button so the sum is n1 plus n2 so easy
enough so now all we have to do is once
we got their numbers and converted them
just print the sum out on the screen so
how we do this with athelets again is
and remember this is outside your init
method public void paint and is your
prim per graphics Yorgi object so you
can draw with it and what do we want to
paint call the superclass of paint which
is of course our G object is argument
and then go ahead and put G draw string
right there
and it takes three arguments um the
first one is what do you want to draw
and we'll put the sum is and just put
plus some and argument the two other
arguments are where you want to be so
I'll put 25 in 30 so I'd appear
somewhere in the middle of the screen so
just go ahead and that's that so let's
run this make sure you don't have any
errors and I'll go through it one last
time so here's my applet right here
enter first number 95 point 8
and enter second number 42 press okay
and it says in my little applet viewer
the sum is 137 point eight so pretty
sweet so one last time here's how it
worked we inherited an extended
everything we need to do then we created
a blank double variable called sum that
did store anything yet so I called a
blank then the first thing it does is it
goes to this init method initialize I
initialism you know however you say I
can't even say right now and we pretty
much got two variables FN which store
the first number in SN the thing is
these are string variables so I had to
convert them to numbers once they were
numbers we can add them up in the
variable called sum and then once we
have that sum we just printed it out
using our paint object to draw on the
screen or graphics object I guess it
would be called so that's that and that
is how you use the init method to
perform whatever you need to perform
before the applet actually loads so
that's that for this tutorial in the
next tutorial we're going to keep
building some pretty sweet applets but
for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
