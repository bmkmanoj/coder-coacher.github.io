you guys to form basics whenever you go
to a web page and you enter in some data
like whenever you get a facebook you
type in your username and password or
whenever you go to google and you type
in something to search for you are using
what is called a form and forms are used
in web pages to get user input and
process that so in this tutorial what
I'm going to show you how to do is
create your own form that is going to
get a username and a password and it's
going to submit it to a file there's
some key concepts understand about how
forms work so you understand is out here
what's going on whenever you fill out
something and you submit it you're
sending it off to a server-side script
like a a JavaScript or some sort of PHP
code or some cold fusion or some asp a
server-side technology is going to take
your user input and it's going to
process it it's going to put it into a
database or just going to check it
against the database I'm just going to
do something with it and then it's going
to tell the the browser where to
continue from there so now that you
understand sort of what forms are used
for and and how they're used I'm going
to show you how to create your own we're
going to use Dreamweaver to to do this
and we're going to use the insert column
over here we're going to click on form
it pops up with with this window and it
gives us a few options of what we want
to do with our form the action is the
actual file that we are going to send
our data to in this tutorial I'm not
going to show you how to handle the data
I'm just going to show you how to build
the form to submit the data to a file so
the file that i'm going to type here
doesn't actually exist but in future
tutorials i will show you how to use PHP
to handle some form data so i'm just
going to say sample handler dot PHP and
there's two methods we can use here
there's the get method or the post
method the get method is used to
actually do assets get data and in this
tutorial we don't want to deal with
getting data we're going to deal with
actually posting data and what poaching
data does is just like it sounds it post
data to an action or to a file somewhere
to process it we're going to leave the
encoding type link for now we'll give it
a name of sample input I'm going to say
ok and I'm going to hit the return key a
few times so give some space and between
the closing and opening form tags and
you see here that it's given us an
action a method and a name so save this
and right now we have created the
foundation for a form there's nothing
inside of right now but this is the the
beginning step to creating a form so now
we want to enter some some pieces to
collect some data you can see here that
there are many different options on what
we want to use to collect our data from
the user in this specific example we are
going to use a text field
so you can see here that it pops up with
this window that gives us some options
on what we want to do and what we want
to use our text field for we can use it
as just text password the radio and
check box in an image file and hit those
doesn't matter for this specific example
so we're just going to leave text and
we're going to call this text field
username and i'm going to show you what
value is but usually you will leave you
will leave this blank but i'm going to
type this in just you can see this is a
value and what that's going to do is
it's going to put some text inside of
the text field itself when the page is
loaded you could say actually will say
enter enter username that way it will
tell the user what they need to do we're
going to give it a size of 30 and a max
length of 30 the max length that is used
to set a maximum of characters that are
able to be input into this specific text
field so we're going to say okay and we
can see that it is inserted this inside
of our form for us to use so now we're
going to repeat the same thing with with
a little twist so go and click on text
field again and it's your type this time
choose password and what that's going to
do is it's going to hide the text as
being typed inside of our text field so
we're going to give it a name of
password we're going to give a size of
30 again and we'll say a max length is
going to be 30 as well so what we have
here is two input form items one is of
type text and one of is of type password
so I'm going to save this I'm going to
run in our browser so you can see what's
going on here so you can see the value
is enter username and here is the
password
text field and you can type a pass over
10 it's going to be hitting so you can
just type some text and you can see that
that is hidden and so you can see that
we have our text fields but if the user
is just coming to this page they don't
know exactly what is going to be is
going to be done with these text fields
so we're going to give these a label I'm
going to take this value out right here
and I'm going to use the label button
over here click on label and then click
inside the opening tag for label on type
for and what this is going to do is
saying this is a label for user name so
what you do is you type in the name of
the input that you want to link this
label to in between the opening and
closing tag of label I'm going to type
username with a colon here and now I'm
going to repeat the same process for the
password i'm going to say label for
password and i'm going to put password
we're going to run this so we can see
what it looks like in a browser and now
we have created a form that allows us to
input a username with a password now we
have the text inputs and we have the
labels but we don't have a way to
actually say okay I'm done now I want to
submit so we need a button that's going
to allow us to submit this data to this
action right here and I'm going to add
some break tags in between these two
inputs so we can move them down the line
just going to put one break tag just
right there and then I'm going to also
put one after the password input and now
i'm going to go over here to button and
i'm going to make this type a submit and
we don't need to give it a name or a
value I guess we could get a value we
could say submit data if you don't give
it a value of the default value is going
to be submit query but we're just going
to leave it I submit data so I'm going
to save that I'm going to run it and now
we have a form that allows us to put in
a user name and it allows us to put in a
password and it also allows us to submit
it to a file that doesn't exist right
now but if this file did exist it would
have some PHP code inside of it to
handle the data that we submitted and
that is all the time I have for this
tutorial continue watching and we will
go through some more form elements and
we will check out exactly what can be
done with some more advanced form
elements other than text fields</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
