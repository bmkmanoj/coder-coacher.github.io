what this is gonna do is allow us to say
okay even though the character is this
big this is the area that you want to
use to for him to react to the game and
I'll show you guys that later on so the
first thing we actually need to do is we
need to set the origin and image points
so if you go to this tool right here you
see the origin is in the middle we don't
want that so press two and now just like
before since so we pretty much want this
block to mirror the player in a way
press 2 and now it's on the bottom
center now we can actually close out of
here now that we got our block exactly
how we want it actually I'm gonna zoom
in a little bit so you guys can see a
little bit better what I'm gonna do so
now what you want to do is you want to
take this square and gonna unsnap this
and you want to hover it right over the
player and now with your little scale
tools scale this box exactly it doesn't
need to be exactly but pretty much to
surround where the players body is and
essentially you guys can probably see
what we're gonna do already but
basically we're gonna tell the game okay
this is the users main body so we don't
want to crop this or else it's gonna
delete like his arm and stuff so we're
gonna say keep this animation or this
image for the player but whenever you're
reacting to things in the game like
enemies standing on this platform right
here use this blue box so that's what
we're gonna be doing and before we
actually get to the intelligence of that
we need to set a couple properties for
it so the first thing I want to do is
actually select this box and the first
thing we should do is obviously since we
don't want the player to see this in the
game set the initial visibility to
invisible so right now it's visible of
course showing in the game and set it to
invisible and even though it's still
gonna display in your game developer
whenever you play this obviously the
blue box is now invisible
now another thing that I want to do is I
want to add a platform behavior to this
box pretty much make it pretty much say
that okay we're gonna be using this in
platform game and I'll talk more about
behaviors later on but for now this is
how you do it so once you have it
selected in the behavior section click
behaviors and it doesn't have any
behaviors at this box is just a box how
do we want it to behave well let's add a
new one and what we want to choose right
now is platform so if you scroll down to
platform it can say and whenever you
highlight these it gives you a little
description below jump into run between
platform aka solid objects well that's
that's what it's going to do as we're
gonna see later on so click that and now
once you have a selected you can see
that we actually have a couple settings
right here that we can adjust now the
first thing we want to adjust is the
jump string and this is another thing
that you're pretty much just gonna have
to experiment with but a good place to
start is a jump strength of 1100 and
also a gravity of 2500 now hit enter and
you can close out of that right now and
actually there's other one thing that I
can do in this tutorial if you select
this box and we can actually add another
behavior right now what we want to do is
we want to have the screen follow this
player so what we can do is I don't know
if you guys remember for my last
tutorial but whenever we move this
player we just don't want them like
walking off the screen we want the
camera to follow them so make sure you
have your box selected who is text me
let me read this my friend Ralph okay he
said go to google and type in people
coughing that sounds like something I do
not want to do but I'm probably good to
do it later on so I should I'll actually
tell you guys in the next video what I
found if you don't find it already so
anyways what were we talking about have
the camera follow the dude so we want to
add another behavior are you freaking
kidding more friggin text messages
at another behavior and this one is
called scroll to behavior and it says
always Center the view of the subject
and or exceed me or at the midpoint of
multiple objects pretty much saying have
the camera follow dude simple enough so
those are all the behaviors that we want
to add right now so now we actually
don't even need to adjust any of the
properties for that just close and we
now have a blue box surrounding the guy
so again it's not all that impressive
but you guys are gonna understand later
on why I did that
and why is incredibly important and also
I'm gonna be showing you guys how to
associate this image with this box right
here it's gonna be awesome believe it or
not so thank you guys for watching and
in the next tutorial well guys sorry I
have to go Google people coughing right
now so I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
