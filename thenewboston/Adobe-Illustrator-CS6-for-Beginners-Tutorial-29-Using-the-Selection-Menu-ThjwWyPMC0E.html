another Illustrator cs6 tutorial today
we're gonna be using the selection menu
to select objects in different ways and
we can use it to select similar objects
and it gives you a variety of powerful
selection commands for you to use now
we've got our different objects here
that we have and right now they are all
in a group actually now I can go ahead
and ungroup them if I want or keep them
in a group it really doesn't matter but
I'm just gonna ungroup these so they're
all single here now I'm going to go
ahead up to our select menu we've got a
bunch of different things that we can do
here we can select all which is gonna
select everything that we have on our in
our whole project here we can see
everything basically in the layers panel
so I'm gonna keep this layer layers
panel open I'm gonna go to select all
and you can see that everything has been
selected
you know it's selected it's got this
little square on it indicate indicates
selected art so that's what that square
means and now in the layers panel so
that's a the first thing we're gonna
learn is select all control a is the
hotkey for select all control a and
that's something you'll want to remember
because you might you'll probably be
using select all a lot so the next thing
we've got is all on active artboards if
we have different artboards going on we
can select everything on the active
artboard and that way we won't be
selecting everything in on all the other
artboards that we have now if you are
don't really understand what that means
you might want to check out the artboard
tutorial that i had going on before it's
a pretty helpful you can make new
artboards and have different objects on
those artboards alright so the next
thing we've got is deselect shift ctrl a
that's something you'll want to remember
as well - in case you select something
that you didn't actually mean - by
accident
and I mean you'll use that all the time
you're gonna be selecting things by
accident all the time I go like this and
I want to just select the circle I mean
I just want to sect the square and the
polygon down there but I accidentally
also selected this I'm just gonna
deselect and start over again or
something so that's what's happening or
if you're messing with an object you
don't need to mess it with it anymore
and clicking off is gonna make you click
like the background or something like
that
then you're just going to want to use
deselect to select nothing instead of
selecting the background by accident so
there are a couple more here let me
click on this object here and I have it
selected now if I click select we've got
another thing called inverse if I click
that it's gonna select everything else
other than what I had selected so that's
pretty nice if you just don't want to
select a couple things but you want to
select everything else you can use that
it's quicker than going around and
picking everything else around it so a
couple more things we've got next object
above necked below so I will click on
this polygon and we can see that is
selected over here in our layers if I go
to select and go to next object above
it's going to select a star because that
is the next object above in the layers
panel I go to select next object below
as now we're going to now we're
selecting what was below the star which
was the polygon again next object below
again now we're on to the square where
the error the rectangle I think II I
think I've called it a square a few
times and not haven't caught myself but
now I have okay there are a couple other
things that we probably want to go over
we can select similar objects or object
attributes so if I go to select and I go
to the same we can go appearance
blending milled mode fill and Stroke
we've got a whole bunch of different
things let's go to stroke wait
now everything here has a stroke weight
that is the same so I'm able to select
everything that had the same stroke
weight five points let me go ahead and
change the stroke weight down on this to
four now select this and I go to select
same and gonna go to stroke weight and
now if I go to move this we can see that
the spiral wasn't selected because it
doesn't have the same stroke weight as
whatever when I had selected before I'll
put that back up to five to be OCD about
it didn't really have to but you can see
that there are a bunch of different
things that you can use to select there
I mean fill color is not going to work
because we have all different fill
colors opacities whatever you whatever
you can think of in here that you can
use the next thing we've got here is
object and this talks about objects in
the layer panels so you can click all on
same layers Direction handles so let me
click this square now go to select
object and I can click all on same
layers to select everything that is on
the same layer now create a new layer
here and let me put the star into that
new layer if I go ahead and select the
square again and I go to select object
all on same layers the star is not
selected as you can see because it's not
on the same layer so you can go ahead
and mess around with these different
things but guys clipping masks and brush
strokes I mean we haven't gone over
everything but if you already know a
little bit about it now you know where
you can select similar objects in the
menu so that's about that's all I'm
gonna go over about using these
different selection techniques and
selecting the similar objects so
hopefully you guys learn more and I'm
sure not a lot of people went up to the
Select menu and really checked it out
too well and figured out what was up
there when they were first start now so
now you know and now you've gone back to
like some of the basics where you can
help make yourself a better artist by
working more efficiently using
more efficient selection techniques so
thanks a lot for watching this tutorial
I hope you guys join me in the next one
we're gonna go over how to save our
selections and edit them so everybody
have a good day see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
