much query in my database and selected
all the messages that I have not yet
read however I didn't do anything with
it nothing's popping up on the screen
yet so what I want to do I actually want
to store the number of messages that I
have not read yet or new messages in a
variable called num now in eat in order
to get the number of the result set you
need to use a function called my SQL
underscore num underscore rose what this
is going to do is it's a function where
we need to pass it in pretty much a
MySQL query which oh look at that we
have one right here we pass it in a
result set it pretty much counts the
number of rows from this result set or
this query and it stores it in a
variable called num so if this query
returned five different rows then this
is going to be equal to five make sense
so now what we need to do is we need to
test if this is equal to zero or if we
have more than 0 new messages so if num
is exactly equal to zero then that means
we don't have any new messages we read
all the messages so in this case all we
need to do is echo out a href equals
messages and I know I did not create
this page it but inbox that's the link
to your inbox dot PHP now I'm just going
to go ahead and write messages and end
that link right there but not before
adding a pipe sign so if we don't have
any new messages then just go ahead and
make a plain old let me just go ahead
and show you guys real quick Bucky if we
don't have any new messages like in this
instance it's just going to give us a
plain old link to our messages page
where we can click on and it could take
us right there however if number is not
equal to 0 then it must be greater than
0 else let's go ahead and this is the
code where we must have a new message so
whenever we do have a new mess
is the first thing that we want to do is
we want to go ahead and bold the word
messages so I'm actually going to go
ahead and steal okay I'm getting ahead
of myself right now I first want to go
ahead and well let me go ahead and do
this this might be a little bit easier I
want to start with that core messages
link now what we need to do is we're
going to actually add some variables in
here so make sure to escape all your
double quotation marks now the first
thing I want to do if I received a new
messages is I want to bold this by
changing the class equal to user names
now I know the usernames class is
specifically built for user names well
what it does is it basically bolds any
link so now this link right here if we
go ahead and end this span is going to
be bolded now aside from this another
thing that we want to do is right after
messages we want to put parentheses in
here and we want to put the number of
new messages so if we received five new
messages then it's going to say messages
and bold and it's going to say five in
quotation marks now whenever you read a
message the status is going to change to
read so you only have four unread
messages so then it's going to say
messages for in parentheses now of
course the only other thing that we need
to do after this is we need to add that
little pipe sign right there which is
this little pipe sign right here and
then we code the rest of the links so
basically the only link that's going to
be dynamic or changing is this message
is links the rest is really easy so
after this else right here one second
someone's at my door
all right just a friggin UPS guy all
right so we already created that
messages link which is going to change
depending on whether that ever new
messages or not so now all we need to do
is we need to add the other plane three
links add item my account and log out so
we only want to show these links if the
user is logged in so this is the code in
here which is the user logged in then
this is the code we want to output all
of this code right here is for the
messages so where we want to put these
other three links is right here outside
the message is else Clause but inside
the code where they must be logged in so
in order to do this go ahead and just
put an echo single quotation marks now
the first link is add item and let me
just sit around this with a little a
href equals in let's name this page add
item dot PHP and of course eventually
we're going to need to create all these
pages and after this let me just go
ahead and put a little pipe sign and I
actually can cheat a little bit if I
want to so the first is the add item the
second one is to my accounts and we'll
name this page account PHP and last
thing that we need to do is add one more
link I forgot if I copied anything copy
and paste eshe is now the last link is a
log out link and this script is the
easiest script to make I can't wait till
I teach you guys this log out so now if
we go ahead and save this code we see
that our top right links are going to be
one of two things if the user is not yet
logged in then they get two options
register are logged in if they are
logged in then the first link it shows
is whether they have any new messages or
not if they don't have any new messages
it just gives you your default link if
they do have new messages it gives you
that cool blue link but either way it
puts the messages link out there and
also gives you your three other default
links whenever you are logged into your
account so there you go I'm going to go
ahead and test this and I probably
messed up something in the meantime um
go ahead grab something from burger king
or mcdonalds somewhere unhealthy and
i'll talk to you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
