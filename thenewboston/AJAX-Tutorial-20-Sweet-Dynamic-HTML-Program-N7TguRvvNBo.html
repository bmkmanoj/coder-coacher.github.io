let me actually note that down because I
have a little piece of paper right here
that I write what number I'm on because
you can see whenever I'm making
tutorials a lot in a row I just forget
completely and then I'm like hey guys
what's going on
but anyway so what we did so far is we
created an HTML file this is it and we
created some styling pretty cool an
inner HTML file what we said is whenever
you click I'm a dude then you're going
to call this dude function however check
this out nothing's happening and that's
because we didn't create the functions
yet in JavaScript so let's go ahead and
do that right now and the first thing
that we need to do is put a new file and
I'll just name it Bucky oops that's not
where you do that
Bucky dot J s for JavaScript and now
what I want to do is get rid of that I
actually want to move this over whatever
file I'm working on I like to have it
you know right there for some reason
weird OCD kind of thing but the function
that we want to work with first let me
make sure I got this right all right
once called dude in once called chick so
let's go ahead and work with the dude
first and I'll show you guys basically
what this function is going to do and
that's this whenever you click this
button is going to set the overall table
to the dude to the do table is going to
set the head which is things in my
pocket this right here it's going to set
it to this and it's going to set the
items of course to do two items so how
do we do that well the first thing we
need to do of course in this as a
general rule this is always the first
thing you want to do whenever you're
trying to change something on HTML page
with JavaScript or Ajax you want to
reference everything in JavaScript so
the table equals document dot get
element LEM and T let me look that
option in dictionary by ID in the ID of
this
is I don't even think we gave an ID so
alright ID equals table that's
embarrassing table RA so now what we did
is this table variable represents the
table on our website so after this let
me go ahead and save this I hate when
that's read for some reason the next
thing we wanted to do is do this with a
head in the different items so I'm going
to save us a little bit of time by
copying this so basically the table head
make sure I have the IDs for these this
table head and item one is item 1 and
item 2 is of course the second item so
now what we basically did is we created
variables and we can alter these
variables in JavaScript and that's going
to alter the HTML on our web page pretty
freaking cool but now we have the
question how do we change the style or
the look of an element in JavaScript
well we do that and this is one
technique by changing its class so right
now for example if you look at this
table it has no class and I don't mean
like oh it's a scum it's not very classy
I mean in HTML it doesn't have a class
so it's pretty hard to style something
or change its class if it doesn't have
class so what we want to do is whenever
we click this function and dude is
called we want to go ahead and set the
class of this table so table which we
define right here go ahead and change
its class name equal to whatever class
name we got right here which was do
table now what this line of code is
going to do
is this and I'll go ahead and explain
this one little mini example and then
you're going to understand the rest of
the code so basically by default this
table has no styling whatsoever so then
whenever we click on the dude right here
it's going to call the dude function in
JavaScript so what the dude function is
going to do is it's going to get all
your elements as a reference and it's
going to change the class name of this
table of this table right here to do
table so actually if we go ahead and
save this and refresh it right now
whenever you click I'm a dude check out
what happens it changes the style of the
table now of course if you click I'm a
chick nothing happens because we didn't
build that and also the head and the
items are not working in so let's go
ahead and do that so this is basically
how you change the look of an element
dynamically now we can just go ahead and
copy this and this is going to take like
one second maybe two ok maybe three four
five six seconds just like I said all
right so what is this one dude head dude
head and do two items and all the items
get the same styling so now basically
what we're doing is whenever we click
that dude function using this button
it's going to go ahead and call the dude
function just javascript file and change
the styling of every single one of these
elements so we already know that that's
true because we look a took a look at
that mini example so now let me go ahead
and just copy this save us a whole
crapload of time get myself some more
space and now just go ahead and copy
this and change this to the chicke
function now remember the chicke
function is basically the exact same
thing is this the only difference is it
uses these classes because these are
like the pink in yellow italic little
cool curly classes so let me go ahead
and see what's different okay so the
function name is different and pretty
much the last four lines all right so
check table setup do table
chick head instead of dude head and
chick items instead of dude items so
save that and we should be good to go as
long as I spelled everything right and
okay looks good to go so now go ahead
and save that and refresh and check it
out
now remember when you refresh the page
the default hTML is basically no classes
or no styling whatsoever it's not until
you click one of these bunk buttons
until the JavaScript functions are
called changing this dynamically so
click i'ma dude and it changes to the
dude where everything is mainly blue and
red
click I'm a chick and it changes it
dynamically through JavaScript where of
course everything is pink yellow all
girly and italic like that so basically
the user can click back and forth and
back and forth and if you're like you
know what this isn't really Ajax it's
just JavaScript and we didn't really use
XML at all well the reason I want to
give you guys this example without
throwing you guys into XML is because
this is going to happen dynamically
through your XML instead of the user
clicking a button for example whenever
you're on Facebook or something and you
click like well instead of a button it's
just the link that says like now what
that button does is it changes to unlike
or you can you know arm what else is an
example if you want to say view more
comments or on this YouTube video you're
watching right now where you click on
the description instead of changing this
to you know blue and red it shows you
more of the description or more comments
or more information basically all of
that is done through the use of XML and
we're talk about how those are more
tightly integrated later on but for now
this is how you include CSS in
JavaScript or fire in your files and
also basically this is what we're going
to be using this technique working with
Ajax in the future so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe I'm
going to keep clicking this for you know
probably a few more hours and when I'm
done I'll teach a new tutorial so thing
guys for watching and I'll see you
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
