and this video is for the new Boston now
the next part of exception handling
we're going to talk about is try throw
and catch now what we do with try thrown
catch is we need to try a block of code
within this code if we come across an
error we throw an exception as we've
already looked at but what we do is that
we then catch the exception and we can
display the custom error message in our
own way
so to start this we say try we open a
new block and then afterwards we say
catch and we have a new block and we've
got two parentheses here which pick up
the exception and give it a variable
name so for example exception e^x so
what's going to happen now is we're
going to try some code in here and if we
do need to throw an exception the
exception will be caught by here and the
exception will be named e^x what we can
then do is from e^x we can get the
message that has been predefined in the
hour after when we throw an exception so
if you're having trouble understanding
this we'll go ahead and write the code
and then wear them we'll understand it a
bit later on hopefully so what do I want
to try now I need to think of a scenario
that I can try in order to throw an
error so for example if my age here I
set was a 16 let's say in the UK you
have to be over 18 to drink alcohol
let's try and create and well we're
going to create an if statement and
we'll try this block of code so if age
is greater than 18 we need to say that's
fine you're old enough so we can say
echo
just say old enough else otherwise we
want to throw in your exception so we
need to throw new exception as we did in
the last example and we can supply text
so we can say not old enough so we try
this block of code let's just indent it
so it looks a bit neater we try this
block of code in the block of code says
if the age is greater than 18 then we
can display to the user yes you're old
enough that's fine now otherwise we're
going to throw a new exception and the
exception text or the message if you
like is not old enough now because we've
thrown in your exception at this part we
can catch it with this part and to catch
or not to catch something because that's
already been done but to display your
custom error message we want to echo out
and let's just say error : and we're
going to append on the variable e^x now
from the variable e^x we need to call
the function that's within throwing new
exception which is going to echo out
this text here so we need to say e ex -
greater than sign get message now I
haven't predefined ittin this function
myself anywhere this is just standard
notation for getting the message here
that's thrown by a new exception so now
you can already see we've come up with a
way of throwing an exception and giving
up ourselves a custom error message here
and you can throw multiple exception
throw multiple exceptions which can be
caught multi you know multiple times as
well so eventually it's going to create
a lot better flowing code for now it C
does seem a bit sort of pointless to use
but we can go ahead with refreshing the
page and looking at the example anyway
so let's put our age older than 18 for
now but it's a 21 so let's refresh and
it says old
so we've got the we've got the output
that we're expecting now let's type 16
and we can see what happens
let's press refresh and you can see that
we've got this error that we wrote in
here and then we've grabbed the error
message from when we've thrown our new
exception so what we've successfully
done is created a try throw and catch
method to our program to try a block of
code something goes wrong or if
something is not right a values not
compact you know hasn't been compared or
we have an else we're going to throw in
your exception and then we're going to
catch that exception and display the
custom error message to the user so that
is try throw and catch in exception
