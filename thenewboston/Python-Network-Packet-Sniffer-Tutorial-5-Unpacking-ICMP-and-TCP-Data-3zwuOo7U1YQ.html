point what we did is we unpacked an ipv4
packet so there we go we got all this
information now once we unpack it what
we need to do after this is we actually
need to find out what kind of data is
inside now the way that we do that is we
actually look at the protocol right here
so we already got that and it's going to
return a number and once we have that as
you can see in this little section the
protocol is going to tell us what type
of data that packet is carrying so some
of the more common ones are ICMP um TCP
which is going to be the protocol like
95% of the time and also UDP if you're I
don't know maybe trying to get a DNS
request or whatever but anyways there's
a lot of obscure protocols but we are
only going to worry about ICMP TCP and
UDP since those are gonna be like 99% of
the actual protocols that we're going to
be working with so let's go ahead and
make three different methods because the
way that you unpack those are different
so again one last time eventually what
we're gonna be doing is looking at the
protocol and we're just gonna make a if
statement and we'll say if the protocol
is one unpack this using the unpack ICMP
method if it's 6im packet using unpack
TCP so on and so forth
so let's first make a function to will
say ICMP packet and if you guys don't
know what ICMP packet is um it's
basically I don't even know what it
stands for internet control message
protocol I think and it's really useful
whenever you want to diagnose a problem
with your network and let me just go
ahead and Becket's it'll pass the data
right in there alright and I don't have
a diagram of this but whenever you
unpack it you get the type code checksum
and you also get the data
let's just go ahead and do this so
struct unpack and put an exclamation
mark and then BBH so B B H now what you
want to do is you actually want to get
the first four alright so we're gonna be
passing data and we're gonna grab the
first four bytes and it's going to
return this right here so now we have
those values and what we want to do
after that is just return all of those
so we're gonna return all of this and
the last thing that we actually want to
return is the rest of the data so this
is pretty much the header the first four
bytes but now what we can do is we can
return the actual payload so data for to
the end so this is the beginning and the
actual data just goes wherever the
header ended all the way to the end
and let's just go ahead and unpack the
TCP segment now so unpacks TCP segments
all right so check this out so like I
said 90% of your packets that come
across the network are going to be TCP
IP now we already unpacked the IP part
right here so we're gonna be left with
the TCP so this is pretty much the
packets you get whenever you're just
going to some website Facebook Instagram
the new Boston whatever and what we get
is the source port the destination port
the sequence number acknowledges
acknowledgment number a bunch of flags
and a lot of this stuff is just for I
don't know not really useful to us just
useful to the router to make sure that
it's communicating correctly but this is
what we're going to unpack so let's just
go ahead and make a function cone let me
scroll up a little bit all right
TCP segment
so whenever the protocol is 6 we're
gonna unpack this information so what I
can do is actually this what I got
source port destination port sequence
acknowledgement and now do my flags
alright let's storm this up source port
that's the parts for the destination
port sequence heavy spell
acknowledgement easy ignol is meant
guarantee I messed it up
no all right looking good all right now
I've set reserve flags all right so this
last value that I'm gonna unpack is
actually this entire thing offset
reserved and TCP flags now take note
that this entire thing is 16 bits this
entire little chunk right here so let's
say that we just want the offset what
we're gonna have to do is we're gonna
have to bit shift this chunk to the
right 12 bits so the reserve and your
flags are gonna be pushed out and you're
gonna only be left with this offset
right here so go ahead and do this all
right so in order to get this if you
just call struct unpack I don't even
know if I can scroll over yet all right
so it's H H ll ll H you know this is
data 14 all right so check this out
we're gonna go ahead and grab the first
14 bytes unpack it using this and
they're basically most of them are just
integers and we're going to unpack it
into these variables right there so most
of these are just good right now like
the source destination sequence number
acknowledgment but we have to do some
weird things with this because this is
all in one chunk so we actually need to
extract
offset and you know all that crap so
I'll talk to you guys about that right
now so the offset what we're going to do
right now is we're just going to get the
offset from these 16 bytes and remember
I said in order to do that what we need
to do is we take the offset Reserve
flags and that's just what I named this
entire chunk right here and what we're
gonna do is we're going to bit shift it
to the right 12 and then if you multiply
it by 4 you're gonna get the offset so
basically taking this chunk be shifting
it to the right 12 which pushes these
two outs and now after we do that we
need to get all the flags now if you
guys don't know what flags are go watch
my Wireshark tutorials and look at the
video specifically about the TCP 3-way
handshake and you guys are gonna see the
flags like um syn ACK fin basically
whenever you first start communicating
with a server you just can't start
making a request back hey give me this
picture give me that picture you need to
establish a base connection so that way
you know you send these flags and then
whenever you end the connection you
pretty much send other flags to say
goodbye so pretty much the computers way
of saying hello and goodbye oh oh oh
there you go so there's a bunch of them
so flag urghhh and these are all pretty
similar so I can just copy and paste
these most of the time so I'll set
reserve flags and we're gonna go ahead
and hand this by 32 and we shut that by
5 and how many flags that we got was you
got AK we have 5 more 1 2 3 4 5 art then
we got back your acknowledgment we got
yes HST sin and what's the other one
Finn saying goodbye all right so these
are pretty much all set up in a similar
kind of way but we're gonna hand this by
16 8 4 2 and this last one is gonna be
ended by 1 and by the way like I said
this is all gonna be on my github page
so I'm sure you guys don't want to sit
in wondering exactly what I'm typing but
there you go so this is how you get all
of your flags and this is how you get
the offset value so now what we can do
is just go ahead and return everything
so we're just going to return all these
so over the source port the destination
point
those were good already the sequence
acknowledgement and now we can go ahead
and return our flags as well so flag NR
right there you go now again the last
thing that you're gonna want to return
is the actual data so this is your TCP
header and the actual data which is
going to be um the HTTP request most
likely where is that well we need to
take your offset which we already
figured out and just return everything
after that so it begins at your offset
and then return all the rest so there
you go and why is my cursor messing up
art so that ladies and gentlemen is how
you unpack an ICMP packet and also a TCP
segment and I'll also um do the UDP one
you guys don't have to watch me do it
I'll just do it and show you guys in the
next video save you guys some time but
yeah thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
