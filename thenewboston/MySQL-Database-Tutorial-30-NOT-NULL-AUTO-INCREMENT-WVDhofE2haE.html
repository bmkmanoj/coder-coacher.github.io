xxx MySQL tutorial and in this lesson I
want to talk to you guys about some
additional pieces of information that
you can use whenever you're creating
your tables they're going to come in
handy the first piece is null or not
null now whenever you create a table and
you want to allow the people to insert
rows there are certain columns where you
can leave empty and it doesn't really
matter for example whenever you're
making a website in you want a user to
sign up and type in their username and
password you don't want them to leave
this empty so in other words you do not
want this no you do not want this empty
there are other times when you may have
forums on your website that it's okay to
leave empty for example you know those
address forms that say address one and
there's an optional address two if you
live in an apartment or maybe you have
some foreign address well not everyone
needs to fill out the address two or the
second address so it's okay if they
leave that empty but other times such as
name zip code you need to fill that in
so let me go ahead and give you guys a
quick example use your name bar chart if
you were to insert a row like this where
you definitely needed the information to
be required they couldn't leave empty
such as a username you definitely want a
username go ahead and after you're done
writing your data type type the word not
what I say nuts not null and what this
means is not empty they can't enter a
blank for a username so if you would
have something like address two you
would go ahead and not even include that
because address two is optional but
again remember whenever you want the
information to be required and you can't
have empty go ahead and type not null
and this means that if they try to
insert a row of data without a username
or with a blank username it won't insert
it into your table and it'll give them
an error so that's what not in all means
it can't be empty another thing is
something called Auto increment now
whenever you're making a primary ID
say you want to make a primary D it's of
course and and of course it's not no
because that's the unique identifier you
can't have it empty now we don't want
the user to choose their own primary key
we want to do that automatically now in
order to do this every time a row gets
inserted into your database we want it
to increase by one for example we want
the first easier that signs up to have
the primary key of one we want the
second one to have the ID number of two
three four five and so forth so how can
we do this well at first you may be
thinking okay so I'm going to have to
make a query I'm going to have to select
the most recent user I'm going to have
to select their ID number maybe make a
formula add one to it and then throw it
in for this one pretty confusing huh or
you can just use this skirt keyword
right here Auto underscore increment now
whenever you use the keyword Auto
increment that means that it's
automatically going to add one to the
last ID you don't have to do anything
manually it automatically adds one
whenever you create a new row so there
you go instead of having to grab the
last piece of data and making a formula
to add one it automatically adds one to
each entry sounds confusing it's it once
you get the hang of it it's really not
so now let me show you guys what a final
full table creation will look like so
let's say we want to create a table we
already have users and customers so
let's just name this I don't know people
you can even name it bacon or something
stupid doesn't matter so of course let's
just go ahead and enter the same
information as before ID username and
password now ID is going to be the
primary key so int now of course not
no and aside from that auto increment so
this is going to start by default at one
and it's going to keep going and going
add one to it each time the user doesn't
have to worry about the ID number you
don't have to worry about the ID number
MySQL is going to take care of
everything for you so again their
primary key is not null it can't be
and it's going to increase by one each
time now the next one
the next column is username which is
just text letters and numbers and we'll
give this a max of 30 and this can't be
empty either and the third one is
password varchar' I think this was 20
and of course they need a password they
can't have this empty either now last
but not least we already know that we
want this to be the primary key primary
key there you go
I was about to say primary IKEA's
totally different but MySQL doesn't know
that yet so we need to tell it so
primary key we want one of these to be
the primary key which one you say ID so
now we go ahead and create this table
and it says okay table created BAM there
you go so now if we look at bacon it has
ID is the primary key use your name and
password before but now none of these
are allowed to be null and also ID gets
Auto incremented so if we were to add
some information in the bacon table say
we wanted to I don't know insert two
users or something check it out for ID
I'm not going to put anything by default
and whenever you're programming your
website or something you don't insert
any value in here explicitly you let
MySQL take care of it so the first user
comes along and his name is Bucky he
must be a pretty cool guy and its
password is password because he's an
idiot
now the next user comes along in her
name is Sally and her password is slam
bacon so now we go ahead and hit go and
it says two rows inserted but now we go
ahead and look at our bacon table and
check it out MySQL automatically gave
Bucky the user ID of one and he gave
Sally the user ID of two how awesome is
that and if we were to add more we just
need the username and password in MySQL
would automatically give them the next
ID of three four five six and seven so
on and so forth so there you go that is
how you well make awesome tables
and um is there anything else let me
think huh no that's it so I mean I guess
I could stay here and not talk about
anything else but what would I do that
for so anyways I'm going to go out some
videos and I maybe go get a milkshake at
McDonald's I know what's unhealthy about
come on guys give me a break so anyways
thank you guys for watching and no idea
what I'm going to be teaching in the
next lesson but it's going to be awesome
so I will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
