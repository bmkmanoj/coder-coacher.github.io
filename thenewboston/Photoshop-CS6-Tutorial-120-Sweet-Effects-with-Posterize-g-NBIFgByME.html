name is buddy Blackford and this is
another Photoshop cs6 tutorial today
we're gonna learn about the posterize
adjustment layer and what that does is
it creates a simpler image by reducing
the number of colors it's useful for
creating an image to get a like a
clipart kind of look or reducing the
number of colors and preparation for
output to web so when you're using our
one of the trends right now is
pixelation especially in like videogames
pixelated and low poly is something and
simplistic design is kind of trending
right now
so using posterize if we if you can
figure out how to use it correctly and
use it to your advantage it could help
you create some cool like retro designs
maybe or simplistic designs so let's go
ahead and just add posterize to an image
so I'm gonna add it to my regular image
here and show you what happens so image
let me select the right layer make sure
it's on as well image adjustments and
then let's go to posterize ritzer's
right here and this is what it does it
lowers the amount of colors so there's
four levels of color here and if I move
it up it gets more color brought back
into it and here's 255 so that's what
happens with this and here's two so this
is just the basic this is low as you can
go
alright alright so the next thing that I
want to show you is how to make like a
grayscale vector art style image using
the pasteurize effect so go ahead and
cut your person out of the background
like this and I use the magnetic lasso
tool which is this one here just one
around them and then I use the quick
selection tool to add or subtract
anything that I missed and then I refine
the edge using the select and then I
went to refine I went to modify and then
all right so let's go ahead and start so
what we're gonna do first is we're going
to duplicate duplicate the layer so I'm
gonna duplicate this twice and I'm just
gonna name one bottom and this one's
gonna be named top and I'm just gonna go
ahead and turn off my other layer here I
don't need that I've just used it I'm
just keeping it so I can save it in case
I screw up on anything so the first
thing we want to do is we're gonna make
these grayscale so let's change let's
add the black and white filter to these
so image adjustment black and white and
just hit OK use the default image
adjustment black and white right here
alright so now both of these are black
and white now we're gonna go ahead and
start editing our posture eyes to these
so we're gonna adjust this one here at
the top one image adjustment and then
posture eyes and you can we're gonna
leave it at four for the levels and
we're gonna hit it okay let's take take
the visibility off and so we can only
see the bottom one so image adjustment
and posture eyes and this one's gonna be
at either two or three so go ahead and
check out which ones you like better
there's two and then there's three
now it looks like I like to better so
I'm gonna pick two because now basically
the facial features are just defined in
it so I hit okay
so then we've got this image looking
thing right here all right
so the next thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna edit add a filter to these
it's gonna be the cut-out filter and
it's gonna make it look a little more
victory and stuff like that so let's go
to the top one let's go to filter and
then we're gonna go to filter gallery
what we're gonna select is in the
artistic folder and it's gonna be called
cut out so hit that and we'll go ahead
and select that hit okay and then we're
gonna apply the same exact thing to the
bottom layer so if we go to filter and
then the top thing is the top selection
is the one we just used so click on that
and it'll do the same thing to that one
too
so this is what they look like and what
we're gonna do is we're gonna set the
top layer to opacity of 60% so the other
one shows through so this is what we got
showing through now and the next thing
that we want to do is let's add a
brightness and contrast adjustment layer
and we're just gonna crank the
brightness up and that's probably yeah
we'll crank it up all the way and that's
what that looks like we've got our white
background here and now we've got some
abstract vector art going on there so
there we go no I think it looks a little
better to me since there's so much white
with a black background here so I'm just
gonna change that background to black
and now I like the way it looks even
better so here's your different or
here's your vector art looking
simplified looking image its grayscale
and I personally think it looks pretty
cool so hopefully you guys can put it to
good use this
the pasteurize adjustment layer and it's
just layered and added some couple
filters to it to make it look a lot
cooler so thanks for watching this
everybody and I hope you guys have a
good day and can put this to good use
and check out the forums the Photoshop
forum and at the Bucky's room or forum
page thanks for watching everybody
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
