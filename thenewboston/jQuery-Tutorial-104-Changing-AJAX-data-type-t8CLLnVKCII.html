with a video tutorial for the new boston
now in previous videos we have looked
into the Ajax function not as much as
possible because there are many many
many you know many sort of things based
around this this this request there are
so many different ways to use it and so
many different things we can do with it
however for now we've looked at enough
so we can actually post data to a page
retrieve pages load files etc now one
thing that I haven't mentioned is the
ability to change the the method I guess
as you'd call it in a form an HTML form
and this is how the data is sent so we
can actually change the way this data is
sent from when we pick it up in for
example page PHP at the moment I've just
created a name variable from a well
taking a value from a text field and I'm
posting this to page dot PHP the data
that I'm supplying is name equals and
then I'm supplying this name that has
been typed now this will automatically
be sent as get data so it will
automatically using get data here to
post this to page dot PHP therefore
inside for example page dot PHP we would
have to use dollar underscore get and
the name to retrieve this value here
however what we can do is we can change
the type of request inside of our Ajax
request altogether so this is quite
simple what we need to do is just come
up here and as one of the parameters
that we specify to this request we can
just specify a type parameter and then
obviously we comma seperate is now this
can either be get or it can be post so
now that we've changed this to post this
variable here which almost looks like a
get variable I guess will actually be
sent as post data so if you're using the
age
to request and you are we need to send
large amounts of data all you need to
protect page dot php' against people
changing you know values in the URL
obviously it's not completely protected
because if people can see the variables
that you're sending that will always be
able to send data there themselves
however for these I guess two reasons
and they're probably a few others you
can change the type to post so with the
Ajax request not only can you just
default and get you can change type to
post to send this same data so you don't
there's no need to change the way this
data is displayed you can then go on to
send additional data so text equals
hello for example using an ampersand
here there's no need to change that at
all
it will this line here will handle the
type of request so you know so it
actually changes the request type then
when you go ahead and pick it up in PHP
you can go and use dollar underscore
post instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
