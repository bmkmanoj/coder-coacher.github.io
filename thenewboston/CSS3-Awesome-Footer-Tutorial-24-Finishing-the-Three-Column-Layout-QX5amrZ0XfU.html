tuna so much and this next piece of
information can say I love bacon so much
and this last piece of information can
say I love yo mama so much so this this
would say I love tuna I love bacon I
love your mama that's what we're
creating right here now after this of
course we're moving to a new row so we
want to add another clear now what we're
gonna do here is we're going to add
another single column because on the
third row we have a single column and a
double column but we also did something
special with this notice that this is a
black box and what I did on my website
is whenever I made my prayer private
messenger I added a black box on the
conversation area because it makes the
text a little bit easier to read so
let's go ahead and do the easy part
first so the first thing we need to do
is we need to add a single column and
this just says I don't know I am a
single column black box something like
that and then we can add the double
column so column two and guys this is an
easy way to make sure that your layout
is right in between every clear make
sure that the column total equals three
so this equals three one plus one plus
one equals three one plus two equals
three you always want a three because
this is a three column layout simple
enough so okay for the one we put I'm a
column black box and for this says I am
outside the black box that's on the same
row Wow did I actually spell everything
right I actually accidentally spout
everything right all right now for the
black box how do we set that because if
we ran it right now it wouldn't have any
black box
guys so glad you asked this is actually
incredibly easy go ahead and set the
class equal to black box now what this
is going to do is it's going to give you
not only a black background that is
slightly darker but it's gonna make the
border around it slightly curved and it
gives you a really nice futuristic look
and also this isn't it looks oh excuse
me got the hiccups it looks completely
black on the computer screen but in real
life you can see that it's kind of
transparent so you can still see through
it get a really nice sweet look so now
we created this row we're done with it
we only have two more rows to go this
which we already know how to create in
this image row so again since we're done
with this row let's go ahead and clear
it to tell our browser hey we are
working with a new row now we can just
go ahead and add another heading and
what did this heading say my profile
alright
so this would say my profile and now
let's go ahead and clear that you guys
are probably getting the hang of this by
now so clear that and the last thing
that we want to do is we want to add
another three column layout I'll show
you guys what we're creating right now
now first of all we're creating a three
column layout but we want to do it a
little bit differently even though this
only looks like one column let me see if
I can even though this only looks like
one column this is actually a three
column layout if I add in more text so
I'm gonna show you guys how to add this
picture and also this text right here
all in a single row basically so the
first thing that we want to do is we
want to put everything in a paragraph
because this gives it the proper padding
and kind of the housekeeping stuff that
we need so even though we're adding an
image and also some links to your
profile this is how you do that
so the first thing you want to do is you
want to add the image that's going to be
floating left now I don't know if I gave
you guys that image you can use any
image from the computer image source
equals again you can put this um you
know a path to your local or you know
just find the image off the computer off
Google anywhere now the class for this
image is actually going to be two
classes image left and that's going to
make it float left and anytime you n
want to add multiple classes you don't
add two class tags you just go ahead and
write the class with a space in between
and then you write white border so again
this image has two classes applied to it
image left which makes it float left and
white border which gives it that white
cool-looking border around the image and
if you don't have this the image looks
kind of weird because it's dark image
and it blends into a kind of dark
background and when you add that white
border it makes it stand out and it
makes it you know um well just stand out
is probably the best word so after we
added that image remember what we want
to do is we want to make sure that the
links we add display to the side of it
instead of underneath it so how do we do
that well the first thing we want to do
is of course add links so a style
actually let me go ahead and finish
writing my link so this of course would
be a link to either my profile or you
know an article maybe so if it's a link
to your profile then you can just write
your name and that'll link to your
profile or if it's a link to article
you can just write a href and then I
would say something like read you know
more you know something like that but
anyways the style for this first one is
going to be display I make sure that you
guys are seeing this properly display
font wait what do I got a freaking
sausage fingers they font-weight:bold
and also the color equals white so
that's actually display:inline that's
what you want because you don't want
this one to be a block level element you
want it to be in line since you're
floating the image to the left now again
what this does is it creates this right
here which would actually be a link um
if I gave it an href but you know you
can just add that right now now again
this would like link to your profile or
something and this would link to an
article but for right now I'm just
showing you guys how to do the basics
you can make it link to whatever you
want but that is how you create this
section where you have an image that's
floating to the left and you also have
two links and you can actually also make
this image a link that might be better
for the user so you can either have them
click you know this this or this but
anyways we're getting kind of odd track
here because what we're focusing on is
the entire layout and that is how you
create a three column layout and again
one last time and this is like if you
only remember one three well one thing
from these HTML section of this tutorial
remember this whenever you make a three
column layout every single one of your
rows has to add up to three so this is
three three equals three one plus one
plus one equals three
one plus two equals three and three
equals three three equals three simple
enough so now what I'm gonna do in the
next video is I'm gonna actually I'm not
even going to show you guys how to
create this two column layout because
it's in
EEZ you make a two-column layout and
everything has to add up to two either
two equals two or one plus one equals
two simple enough and the next story
what I want to do is I want to go over
this programs menu because it's actually
a lot different as well as these
notification icons and the logout button
and once we finish this you guys are
going to be pros and know how to create
the coolest footer ever design so think
guys for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
