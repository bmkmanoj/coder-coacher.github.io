right here but we have a little bug and
check it out whenever the user jumps he
just stays in that jumping position so
he doesn't start running again he just
slides like you know he just jumped onto
a platform of ice or something
so that's obviously not what we want so
we need to basically say whenever he
lands um
don't make them stuck in that jumping
animation we need to change that real
quick so this is how you do that we
actually need to add another event and
the cool thing about this is there's a
built in event that says um basically
when they land it and this is platform
animation triggers on landed so in order
to do this we need to see if they landed
in one of two positions were they
continuing to run when they landed or
did they just land and stay still
so if they were continuing to run keep
the running animation going or whenever
they land it if they just stood still
play the idle animation so of course we
need some sub events so highlight that
and click s and the first thing that we
can test is platform is moving which
pretty much means did they continue to
run if so player will just go ahead and
set that animation to run and done in
the only other thing we need to add is
make sure you don't click this add event
because then it's going to create
another whole thing we want to create a
sub event to see when they landed so
basically this is saying um let me go
ahead and do it first then I'll talk you
guys through it booked platform is
moving and for this we're going to
invert it and let me add the action to
it'll be easier to see set animation and
this one is just idle so basically is
saying okay the dude landed now what do
you want me to check
well if he's moving still and set the
animation to keep her
instead of having him just slide across
the ice and also after he lands from a
jump if he is not moving remember I
inverted this so it this means not
moving then just set the animation to
idle so he doesn't look frozen he's just
sin when he lands he just stands there
and Bob's up and down so it's gonna have
a lot more realistic behavior and if we
check that out right now let me go down
in my base level right here well can't
fit through there so he's gonna run and
then he's gonna jump and now he's gonna
keep running after that and also
whenever he jumps and he just lands he
doesn't go in this weird like looking
left or right position
he jumps player let's go and he's
standing there idle ready for the player
to do something so that is how we fix
that bug right here and well our game or
at least our player is pretty much set
up good to go he can jump around he
could run left and right so now I think
it would be cool if we actually started
adding some enemies so that's where
we're gonna be doing in the next
tutorial making this guy's life a little
bit more difficult but a lot more fun so
thing guys for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
