tank now for some reason if you don't
know what a gas thing is it's pretty
much the big tank that holds gas if you
couldn't figure that out so in order to
mount the gas tank just go ahead and
screw it into four places onto your
frame right here now this is a really
simple gas tank and only holds a couple
gallons but a bigger gas tanks that
usually have other stuff built in for
example in a car that would have a fuel
sensor built in so whenever you're
looking at your dashboard you can see
how much fuel you have left and the
bigger ones also have something called
baffles and baffles are little they're
like kind of like plates inside and it
just keeps the gasoline from sloshing
around whenever you're going over bumps
and or any corners and stuff but this
one I don't know if there's any baffles
inside and look but it's really simple
this holds gas and then pumps it into
your engine so here is our gasoline tank
perfectly hooked up two bolts on each
side but before we can actually start
getting gas to the engine we need to
hook up two hoses because of course this
isn't Wi-Fi where you can just take gas
and have it magically transfer into your
engine what you need to do is you need
to hook up first of all the main fuel
line now usually two main fuel lines or
two hoses are hooked up to the gas line
and you can tell which one is the main
fuel line because it has a fuel filter
right there which is of course
responsible for getting any crummy crap
out of the gas and this one right here
says oil outlet if you guys can't see
and where this is going to go is the top
right here so that's where the main fuel
line goes now this second one is for
vapors and it says let's see if we can
see it vacuum connection there we go and
if you can't tell by the little diagram
this one goes on the intake valve right
below it so again the vacuum goes on the
bottom which is
sponsible for capturing unwanted vapors
and the main fuel line goes on the top
in the main the job of the main fuel
line hose is to take the gas from the
gas tank and pump it into the engine so
let's go ahead and hook up these two
hoses right now now make sure your hoses
are really clean and actually whenever
you have post clamps you usually want to
use pliers but these ones I found that
they're pretty much the easiest way to
get them on is just to use your fingers
perfect size so go ahead and plug this
one into your tub and if you have
trouble if you just try to push it on on
void what you can do is take one of your
fingers and twist it while the other one
pushes it on now slide these there you
go right up to the tip so this is pretty
much a clamp just make sure that it
doesn't come loose and now you need to
do the same thing with the vacuum line
which has vacuum right on it so make
sure this is clean you probably want to
clean it with a wet a washcloth or
something just to make sure we'll go
ahead and with one finger twist or with
one hand twist and the other hand push
it on and it should be good
take your clamp slide it on and check it
out that's a check I do like a Canadian
now this gas tank is good to go fill it
up with gas make sure that you don't
have any leaks and well you're ready to
move on to the next step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
