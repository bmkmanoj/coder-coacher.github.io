a polynomial by a monomial so when we do
this we have a polynomial on top and a
single mono meal on the bottom when we
do this we're gonna rewrite it like at
like as if we were doing this R squared
divided by R + 6 R divided by R + 5
divided by R because when we divide a
polynomial by a monomial what we're
saying is R goes into this how many
times and this and this so R squared
divided by R is just R + 6 r / r the
owners are gonna cancel we're gonna get
6 and then we're gonna be left with a
fraction of 5 over R so now we're gonna
do some examples so the first thing we
can do for number one is we can cross
out we can cancel this 2 because two
divides evenly into 4 and 2 divides
evenly into 6 so now that we we can
write this as 2 y squared plus 3y over Y
now the only reason I could cross out
those twos was because both of these
terms were divisible by two if they
weren't I would have to leave the two on
the bottom so now I divide Y squared by
Y I'm just gonna get two Y and then Y
divided by Y those boys are just gonna
cancel it's just gonna be 2y plus 3 so
for this example I don't have any
numbers to cancel so I'll just go in and
first we divide X's by X's and then we
divide wise by Y's so x squared divided
by X can be positive x and then I'm
gonna have something over here and then
minus X divided by X is just 1 now I'm
gonna divide my Y's
why / why is 1 + y squared divided by y
is positive y so I'm left with X minus y
as an answer so we're gonna do a couple
more examples okay so M squared divided
by M is positive M and squared divided
by n is positive n plus M divided by M
is 1 and since there's not another n on
that I have to write this as 1 over and
- since there's no M here I have a 1
over m and then n divided by n is 1 so
now in this last one we have a
coefficient that we can divide out so 6
goes into 6 evenly one time 6 goes into
42 evenly seven times and six goes into
72 easy evenly 12 times and now I just
have AIDS I can divide so one a squared
divided by 8 cubed is 1 over a because
the egg drops to the bottom plus seven a
divided by a cubed it's gonna give me a
7 on top and then a squared on the
bottom and then this is just gonna stay
12 over 8 cubed because I have no age to
combine so that's all we're gonna do
with dividing today but make sure you
come back and check out the next lesson
where we learn how to simplify fractions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
