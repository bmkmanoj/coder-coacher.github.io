divide a polynomial by a monomial so
when we do this we have a polynomial on
top and a single monomial on the bottom
when we do this we're going to rewrite
it like at like as if we are doing this
r squared divided by r plus 6 r / r plus
5 divided by r because when we divide a
polynomial by a monomial what we're
saying is our goes into this how many
times and this and this so r squared
divided by r is just R plus 6 r / r the
owners are going to cancel we're going
at six and then we're going to be left
with a fraction of five over are so now
we're going to do some examples so the
first thing we can do for number one is
we can cross out we can cancel this 2
because 2 divides evenly into four and
two divides evenly into six so now that
we we can write this as 2y squared plus
3y over why now the only reason I could
cross out those twos was because both of
these terms were divisible by two if
they weren't I would have to leave the
two on the bottom so now I divide y
squared by why I'm just going to get 2y
and then y divided by Y those boys are
just going to cancel it's just going to
be 2y plus three so for this example I
don't have any numbers to cancel so I'll
just go in and first we divide X's by
X's and then we divide wise by wise so x
squared divided by X can be positive x
and then I'm going to have something
over here and then minus x divided by X
is just 1 now i'm going to divide my
wise
y / y is 1 and y squared divided by Y is
positive Y so I'm left with X minus y as
an answer so we're going to do a couple
more examples okay so M squared divided
by M is positive m and squared divided
by n is positive n plus M divided by M
is one and since there's not another n
on that I have to write this as one over
and minus since there's no m here I have
a 1 over m and then n divided by n is 1
so now in this last one we have a
coefficient that we can divide out so 6
goes into six evenly one time 6 goes
into 42 evenly seven times and six goes
into 72 evenly 12 times and now i just
have AIDS i can divide so one a squared
divided by a cubed is one over a because
the egg drops to the bottom + 7 a
divided by a cubed it's going to give me
a seven on top and an a squared on the
bottom and then this is just going to
stay 12 / 8 cube because i have no is to
combine so that's all we're going to do
with dividing today but make sure you
come back and check out the next lesson
where we learn how to simplify fractions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
