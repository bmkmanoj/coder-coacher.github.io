tutorial that I'm making for them in
Boston and in this tutorial we're going
to continue working on our hangman
project and basically what we're going
to be doing in this tutorial is drawing
labels inside of this group box right
here and there's going to be a label and
the texted with that is going to be an
underscore and we're going to create a
label for each letter inside of our
random word alright so the first thing
that we're going to want to do is create
a method and in this method we're
actually going to be making the label so
I'm going to say void make labels
alright there we go and the first thing
we're going to want to do in this make
labels method is called the get random
word method and a get random word method
in the last tutorial we've created this
it basically just gets a random word
that usual have to guess for we're just
going to say it's random word alright
and then we're going to create a string
up here called word and this word string
will basically hold that a random work
that we generate and then we can access
it later and check to see if the letter
that the user guesses is actually in
that word and we'll do that later on
so we'll say word equals this random
word that we generated right here
alright so the next thing that we're
going to want to do is create a
character right and in this character
array there will be a letter for each
character inside of the word so I'm
going to say character array characters
equals word dot 2 character right and 2
character array we'll basically just
convert this string into a character
array so they'll be element inside it's
character array for every letter inside
of this word and the last character that
is inside of this word is going to be
it's actually going to be /n and slash
and just means that the next word will
start on a new line so we're just going
to skip over that when we do stuff later
on here alright so the next thing that
we're going to want to do is basically
create an integer telling us how many
pixels each label will be apart from
each other because if we just set
all the same then every label is just
going to be on this right side right
here unless we have like a really big
word so we're going to want to space
them out so that it looks right we're
going to say int it's mean you can call
us anything you want I'm just going to
say between because this is how many
pixels will be between each label so
we're going to say into the tween equals
we're going to say 330 because the width
of this is 336 and we're just going to
make it 330 so that the last label is
not on the edge of the screw box right
here Syleena say between is 330 divided
by the length of these this character
right here minus 1 we have to do minus 1
because the last character in this
character array is /n so we just want to
skip over that we don't want to label
treated for that character for that
slash inherited all right and now we're
going to want to create a core statement
that will go through each character in
our character array and create a label
for it so you say 4 and I equals 0 and
I'm going to say well I is less than the
length of that character array minus 1
because again we want to skip over that
slash end character we don't want to
make a label for it and then we're just
going to want to increment I each time
that we move through this array or this
for statement and the final thing that
we're going to do for this tutorial is
just create a list of labels and in this
label list we're basically just going to
be storing every label that we create
for each letter in this word so I'm just
going to create it up here so we have
access to it later on when we're trying
to change the text of it so I'm going to
say actually list label and oops this is
the that way label list and I'm just
going to call it labels but it doesn't
really matter what you call it I'm going
to set it equal to a new label list all
right and then for each character inside
of our character array or for each
letter inside of our word we're just
going to want to create a new label so
you say
labels dot add a new label alright so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
in the next tutorial we're actually
going to be I'm changing these labels
properties like setting the position of
that I'm setting your text and stuff
like that alright so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
