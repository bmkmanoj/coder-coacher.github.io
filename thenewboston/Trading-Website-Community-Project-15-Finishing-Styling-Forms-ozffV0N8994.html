video and in this video we are finally
going to be done styling the forms that
CSS file the last two things that we
need to do is we need to style some
specific form elements specifically
input areas and text areas so let's go
ahead and do the input areas first now
the input areas are the form elements
for your username/password email so on
and so forth so the first thing I want
to do is I want to change the font size
to 15 pixels now that's the font
whenever the user enters it that's
what's going to be 15 pixels now the
padding for this is 5 pixels just so
it's pushed a little bit away from the
borders speaking of the border I believe
this is the same one who's a search
llege is one pixel solid and hexadecimal
b 9 b dc1 and i'm actually going to use
that again in just a second now for the
width of this entire input form element
go ahead and make this 500 pixels and
also set the color equal to hexadecimal
50 50 50 now I'm going to sneeze and
about 70 nope it was about two seconds
and there we go so anyways just mind you
that the color and the width of all this
this is the color whenever the user
enters text so you know just don't
forget that now I also want to do one
other minor thing whenever you focus on
input I wanna go ahead and set
background color to white now even
though um the only thing we have in this
form is basically a submit button as
well as input areas in other forms we're
going to be working with text areas for
example i say exam / example whenever
the user has the list item and they give
a description there's going to be a text
area so that's why i want to go ahead
and style the text area now even though
there isn't a text area like i said on
the registration form so let's go ahead
and set the font family
ariel and the height of this is going to
be 150 pixels on the width time you
start stealing stuff the width is 500
the font size is 15 padding 5 thank you
input areas thank you copy and paste and
for the border thank God I don't have to
copy that is that and for the color wow
you know the only problem with this it's
a little bit too easy so we've got font
family height width font size padding
border and color specifically the height
this is the only thing that we may want
to change a little bit I have to see
whenever we're working on our list item
page how tall this is my anyways what
what's called cross that bridge when we
come to it something like that but
anyways that is all we have for the
forums that CSS now the last little
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go
all the way to the bottom and clean up
clean up all these blank lines because
you don't need blink lines if you don't
need them there you go so that is it in
the next story what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be coding one
last CSS file you're saying what the
heck do we have left the code that is
the CSS specific to this register page
right here there is only like five
things and it's pretty much overwriting
the stuff by default that we already
coded that we need to change for this
page and I'll show you guys exactly what
I mean in the next tutorial but for now
we are two tutorials away from the good
stuff so just stick with me and I
promise we'll get there soon so thanks
for watching and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
