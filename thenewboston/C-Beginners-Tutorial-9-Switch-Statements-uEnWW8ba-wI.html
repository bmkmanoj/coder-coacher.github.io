tutorial that I'm making for them a
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to use the switch
statement and the switch statement is
basically just an alternative to def and
Al's so all you're going to need for
this tutorial is a button and a text box
and once you've it on your form just go
ahead and double click on it
alright so to create a switch statement
you're just going to want to click the
keyword switch and then following that
you're going to want to have two
parentheses and inside of these
parentheses is where you're going to
want to type on what you check it and
we're going to be checking text box ones
texts or just going to put text box ones
text inside of there
and then you're just going to want to
put two curly braces and inside of these
curly braces is where you're going to
want to create all of your cases and I'm
just going to go ahead and create a case
and then explain what it is my case okay
so basically what this is right here is
it just says case Adam and this is
basically like saying if text box ones
text equals Adam then after this : we're
just going to put what we want it to do
and we're just going to have a message
box show saying hello so we can say
hello re and then in every case you just
going to want to put break calling and
there are instances where you may want
to put something different but we're not
going to learn it in this tutorial so
just put break after every case at the
bottom so what break basically does is
it just breaks out of the switch
statement so if you have multiple cases
right here we just say if it's Adam and
then if it is it'll do this code and
then following that it'll just break out
of the switch statement and stop
checking the other cases so let's just
go ahead here and make sure this works
so if we put text box ones text as Adam
and click the button we should get a
message box saying hello yep and if you
put something else or G no if we don't
get it
all right and you can have multiple
cases as many cases that you want so if
we had another case here like case Bob
then we're going a message box show
Sankyo so
vo and then of course we need to have
that break in there so it's going to be
great and now I can really explain great
more so if text box ones text was added
I would say all right let's do this
quote right here it's going to a message
box show and then following that it's
just going to break out of the switch
statement so we just go down here it
wouldn't even check Bob because text box
ones text can't be Bob and Adam it can
only be one of the two all right so
after doing this code I'll just break
out of this switch statement and go down
here all right so let's just go ahead
and make sure that this works here if we
do add them you should get a message box
saying hello yep if we do Bob we should
get something followed at yo the message
box yep perfect
and in switch statements the default or
the else would just be D probably just
probably be fall right there and then
just put : following that and then
whatever you want it to default do so if
both of these aren't true so if text box
ones text isn't Adam and it's not Bob
then it'll just do the default and we're
just gonna have a message box show
saying your name isn't important so your
name isn't important and then of course
we need a break so does going to do
break all right so let's just go ahead
and make sure that this works here go
ahead and tie Adam in we get hello if we
do bottom side up here we should get yo
and if we do anything besides Bob and
Adam we should just get your name isn't
important yep your name isn't important
all right and you can do this with
really any data type so if you wanted to
do like int I equals 5 then what you
could do is switch I and then check to
see what I value is so case y equals 4
then we're just going to have a message
box show sang you're too young you're
too you know and then got a break of
course and then um case 16
messagebox show saying you can drive
alright and let's just put I equal to 16
I guess and of course we have to break
okay so yeah this is basically this
going to check to see if I is four and
if it's four we're just going to get a
message box saying you're too young if
it's 16 we're just going to get a
message box saying you can drive alright
so let's just go ahead and see if this
works here yeah if we get you can drive
because I is equal to 16 if we set it
equal to 4 then we get a message box
saying you're too young because of this
case right there yep and if we were to
put a default in default it will just do
this if your age is in 14 here I mean 4
or 16 so let's do a message box saying
your age isn't relevant so you're a
cheater
well of knowing to seem to break out of
there just like with everything else so
for every case and even for the default
you need to have parade at the end of it
let's just make sure that this works
here is 4 so we're going to get you're
too young Wow if we change it to
anything besides 4 16 we're just going
to get your age is irrelevant yep
all right so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial on using the switch
statement so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
