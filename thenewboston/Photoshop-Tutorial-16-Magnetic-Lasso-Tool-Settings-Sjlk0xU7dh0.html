to your 16th Photoshop tutorial and in
this tutorial we're going to be covering
some settings dealing with the magnetic
lasso tool some things we didn't cover
in the last tutorial but before we get
to that I want to ask you guys a favor
and that's this last night me and my
cousin right here we went to a
housewarming party for my parents and
they had some alcohol there and we might
have had a little bit too much to drink
and in the middle of the night he
tweeted me and one my friends this SI
ollr HR and i have no idea what it means
she has no idea what it means he was
wasted he obviously doesn't know what he
was trying to say but it's bothering me
he was trying to say something when he
was plastered so I'm hoping that one of
you guys out there can help interpret
this for us and if you guys know what he
was trying to say then please let us
know because it's bugging me but anyways
to the tutorial magnetic lasso tool
settings basically all this crap up here
that we didn't get to in the last video
I want to cover what it means so
basically in order for the magnetic
lasso tool to work what Photoshop does
is it looks at the different contrast
between certain objects and that's how
it gets aligned for example a yellow
post-it note against a black shirt or a
black background that's how it
determines what the object is now of
course the settings can be changed so
this contrast right here is pretty much
how much change in brightness should I
use to determine the edge of an object
so this is where you can mess with that
90 percent is actually pretty good so
I'm going to keep that right there right
now but I just want to mention that
because if you have an object that's I
don't know blends in with the background
you may want to change these settings a
little bit but for right now 90 percent
that's pretty good and the only other
one is the frequency the frequency right
here is basically saying how often
should I add anchor points now the
anchor points are these little boxes
that you can see whenever we start to
drag around an image so as you can see
it has about four anchor points on the
left hand side and I'll be going over
more about anchor point
later on but for right now I just want
to show you guys how to change the
frequency or number of anchor points on
the line so if you want more we can
change this value anywhere from 1 to 100
of course if we bump it up to 100 then
we can go ahead and just deselect this
then when we start to drag look how many
freaking anchor points this makes pretty
much 1 every freaking pixel so I don't
know probably somewhere like 40 or 35 is
the ideal in most cases but you guys are
going to have different number of anchor
points um well whenever we cover anchor
points later on in paths and especially
the pen tool you guys are going to get a
better understanding of that but for now
I just didn't want to skip over anything
now the only other things that I want to
cover are pretty much just a shortcuts
for this so let's go ahead and change
this to I don't know 5 or something like
that and any time you're working with
one of these paths and you figure out
you know what I need more anchor points
but I don't need them all over just in
certain locations you can actually click
your path to add anchor points manually
so see that I made four anchor points so
far well if I wanted another anchor
point right here I just hover my cursor
over it and click and as you can see it
adds anchor points manually pretty
freakin sweet huh so that's how you add
anchor points manually and another cool
trick is if you want to delete an anchor
point then all you have to do is hit the
backspace on your keyboard so see these
two anchor points under her eyes keep
your eye on them I'm going to hit
backspace that one disappears backspace
the other one disappears so again
whenever I'm dragging let me make an
anchor point see the one closer eyebrow
hit backspace it disappears make it
again by your eye backspace disappears
now the last thing I want to talk to you
guys about is again real quick shortcut
is if you ever want to switch
temporarily to the free lasso tool the
first lasso tool I talked to you guys
about then all you need to do is hold
alt on your keyboard so now I have alt
held in and you can click and drag
so look at my path now I'm now using the
magnetic lasso tool but I'm temporary
using it as a general lasso tool so now
I can release alt and I'm back to the
magnetic lasso tool so if you ever want
to switch temporarily that is how you do
that
so now that you know about the contrast
which is basically how much changing
brightness should Photoshop use to
determine the path and also the
frequency how often do you want to make
those anchor points and also all the
other little shortcuts that I told you
guys in this video you guys are ready to
move on to the next tool which is the
polygonal lasso tool so we're going to
be covering that in the next video so
please again hopefully someone you know
what even if you don't have an
interpretation just go ahead and guess I
want to see you guys as answers and uh I
don't know maybe we can piece this
together as a team but anyways thank you
guys for watching number you subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
