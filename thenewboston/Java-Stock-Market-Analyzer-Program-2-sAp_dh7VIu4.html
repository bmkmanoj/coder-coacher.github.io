welcome to your second lesson and how to
build a Java stock market analyzer
program how awesome is that sound so now
that we already have the data we can
begin building the program to analyze it
and before I get started I just want to
tell you guys one little thing I did
already in my folder if you go to my C
in my stock folder I got that new Dow
which we have before and this has all
the data in it from today to the
beginning of time pretty much I also
took the most recent 20 rows out of this
and made it into a smaller file called
Dow and this is pretty much just to a
test like I knew there is 20 rows in
here and we're gonna have a formula
called finder rows and in order to
verify that I just needed to make a
smaller file and like when I make
smaller programs just a test I'm like
alright is this one greater than this
one then I just have something small to
look at and I don't have to go searching
through my huge file so if you want to
get a little piece of your huge data
file and put it in another smaller file
so you can actually visually see that
you're working with and it makes a
little more sense you can do that but
when we run this program full-fledged
and we're gonna be analyzing all of this
data right here because the more Daddy
analyzed the more accurate it's going to
be so again all of my data is in the new
doubt in my smaller twenty rows of data
is in the DAO so we're gonna be testing
with this Dow but remember when you run
the program for real that's the new
doubt and you can see the size
difference right here quite the
difference so now what I did is set of
my program is I built my main method or
right here in the something called stock
market dot Java I name this stock market
you can name it anything you want you
can name like stock program if you want
but we're gonna be using this to run all
of the other classes pretty much in for
now I just want you to build one other
class and I'm gonna name this read files
now what this class is gonna do is
pretty much take that
file that CSV file that we just
downloaded and it's pretty much gonna
read it and verify that it's some file
in do stuff to it so name your's read
files because that's the basics of what
we're gonna be doing now you need to
import two things that I already did
just import everything from Java IO
which is input/output in this so you can
like input/output files and also string
tokenizer and string token well I'll
tell you guys what that does later it
pretty much takes all the commas out of
your file in essence so now let's get
programming the first thing that we need
to do is store that file in a variable
so from the file class name your
variable something I'm gonna name my
file because it's easy instead of equal
to new file and set as a parameter it
takes the location of wherever your file
is and it takes it as a string so here's
what you need to do I put mine in the C
Drive so I'm gonna put C colon and
instead of one backslash remember
because this is a string we need to
escape a backslash so anytime you have a
new directory put two backslashes
normally it would be one but one is an
escape character so if we put two it
views it as one backslash and then I
have a folder called stocks and you
should put it in the same one as me and
then I have my file code Dow CSV
remember this is my smaller file that
I'm gonna use for testing purposes so
now this file is stored in this variable
called file so now anytime I want to use
a file I just use the keyword or
variable name file instead of having me
to write this whole thing how awesome is
that so we're gonna be building two
other variables that we're gonna use
later actually a variable in an array
the first well the second method we're
gonna build is to find how many rows are
in that file so put in row and set equal
to zero for now and this is pretty much
going to store the number of rows in
that file and we got to find the number
of
to figure out how big we need to make
our array and you'll see why later on in
the second thing we have to create is an
array to store all the data now we
actually just can't read the file like
it is right now we need to change it
into an array because we can do a lot
more stuff with an array it has a bunch
of built-in methods that we can to a CSV
file so that's why we need to we're
gonna eventually be changing that file
we downloaded it into an array so since
it has rows and columns let's go ahead
and make a string and just have it say
items so now we're gonna have a two
dimensional array called items
eventually and remember since um well
I'll show you guys right here if you go
to computer C stocks I know you guys
can't see this but there we go
remember we can't just make this an
integer array or a float array because
this first element right here
that's a date that's not an integer
float all of these we could probably
have float double but this one since
it's not pretty much since these are all
aren't the same type we're gonna put
them all as a string and then convert
them to whatever type they need to be so
let's go ahead and just make a two
dimensional array in one name of items
and this is gonna store all of the
elements from that file I just showed
you so now let's just go ahead and make
a quick little method and what this
method is gonna do is pretty much check
if this file is a file and this pretty
much verifies that we have the correct
path pretty much so go ahead and make it
public boolean's says it's gonna return
a true if it's file and false if it's
not
and name something like check is file
and it doesn't take any parameters and
now let's just go ahead and put
something like let's just go ahead and
return since we want a return value file
what we're gonna be testing and there's
bill and Method
that's called is file and this is file
method it checks this right here which
is in essence this and says alright if
this file is a file then I'm gonna
return true if it isn't a file I'm gonna
return false and let's go ahead and use
this right now so remember this is all
in the class read files in this method
is called check is file so let's go
ahead and put read files are you can
name it whatever you eyes and they my
are equals new breed files empty
parameters and now we can use all that
stuff in this read files class and we
only have one method in here so let's go
ahead and use that
let's just go ahead and system out
system.out.print line and let's go ahead
and call that method our dot what do you
put check is file right there so what
this is pretty much going to do is it's
gonna print out true or false if this
file is a file we're gonna get the
return value of true and remember this
is file is a built-in method in Java so
we meant we don't have to create this if
it if this is not a file it's gonna
return false so let's go ahead and run
it and we should get true right now and
look at this we get true print it out on
our screen and just to show you guys how
this works if we have a file called like
Dao 43 we never created this file it
doesn't exist on our computer so this is
not a file so if we go ahead and try to
run this again it's gonna go false and
that way we can only run this program if
it is a file in the next store I'm gonna
be showing you guys how to use this
program and kind of check if it is file
and if it is a file run the program just
a little nice little safety measure
but for now change the directory back to
where your file is and in the next
tutorial we're going to be getting the
row number of the file in here so for
now just for excuse me remember to buy
build your check is
file method to check if the file is a
file and again like I said in the next
story we're gonna be getting the row
number of that CSV file so thank you
guys for watching I know we're off to a
great start this program is gonna be
awesome by the way
don't forget subscribe and now see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
