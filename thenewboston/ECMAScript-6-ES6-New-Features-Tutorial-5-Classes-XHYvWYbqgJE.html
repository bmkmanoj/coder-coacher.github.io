tutorials that I am most excited to
teach you guys about and that is the new
class syntax with es6 because I had a
real problem with classes and you know
the traditional version is the
JavaScript it's like if I want to create
a class I know how to do it I'm just
going to use the class keyword write the
name of the class then I have
constructor tomato tomato it's simple
but JavaScript no have to make it so
confusing have to make functions and
prototypes and god forbid even try to
use inheritance because get ready to
pull your hair out well now with es6 it
changes all that it allows you to make
classes pretty much like you should have
been able to since the beginning so
let's say that I want to make a new
person class so all I have to do is
write class person and of course
whenever I create a person the instant
that I create them I want to give them
some initial values I want to be able to
give them a name maybe an age and maybe
a weight I don't know maybe this is like
for a doctor's office where you have to
like store their weight who knows so I
thought that was going to pop up but
basically anytime you want to do that
you have to make a constructor and you
just call it constructor easy enough so
now any values or attributes that you
want to initially set you just pass in
some name age weight boomer Elstad now
of course you want to make these
attributes specific to this object so
thankfully we can use the keyword this
now whenever we hit something like this
name equals name then what this means is
whatever name we passed in is equal to
this object's name and of course what
this allows is for you to be able to
create multiple different people and
they each have their own name so Bucky
can have his name we can create another
person called Sally she could have her
name so on and so forth so this would be
something like this age equals age and
this weight equals weight so later on
I'm going to show you guys how to create
multiple objects in they each have their
own set of properties and that brings me
to another point
people ask me a lot when do you use
classes and when do you just create a
bunch of you know standalone functions
you're going to create a class whenever
you have a bit of code that you need to
be self aware so I always have like
helper functions like to write a file
parse JSON do whatever whenever I use
those they're pretty much just a little
snippets of code that run and then
they're done I don't need them to
remember anything or do anything special
now whenever I create a person object
then this person or this little bit of
code it's going to need to remember its
name it's going to need to remember its
age it's going to have some bit of
memory that it needs to be aware of so
that is when you write a class versus
just a bunch of functions whenever you
need a bit of code to be self aware or
remember something stick it inside a
class also if you just have a bunch of
similar code and you want to group it
and make it a class but there you go
all right so instead of just making a
constructor in here you can also have
methods so I'll say display weights and
this is just method that displays the
person's weight so I'll just say
console.log um I'll just say this weight
so again whenever we create methods
inside here we have access to the
objects attributes so we can just log
out this object's weight and it's going
to print out their weight right there so
with that being said let me go ahead and
create a few objects I'll make one
called Bucky and this is going to be
equal to a new person object and of
course it takes three parameters the
name the age in the weight so the name
is going to be Bucky how old am i 87 and
how much do I weigh so centering six
thousand six hundred and fifty pounds
all right beautiful night now anytime I
want to print out my weight I just call
the object we only have one which is
Bucky and then display weight and boom
look at that now again like I was saying
we can also do is we can create another
object named Sally that is an object
from the same class the same template of
course Sally she's my girlfriend in case
you guys never heard verse she's
actually 21 years old and she owning
lace 89 pounds what I yeah she's pretty
cool I guess sometimes you get in the
movies and whatever but anyways anytime
I want to display Sally's weight then
all I have to do is something like that
boom roasted there you go so I'm not
going to go in too many details about
how to work with classes because I'm
assuming that as programmers you guys
already know um es6 just makes it a lot
easier to use classes and create objects
and makes the entire syntax a whole lot
cleaner so yeah thanks for watching and
in the next video I'll show you guys how
to use inheritance with es6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
