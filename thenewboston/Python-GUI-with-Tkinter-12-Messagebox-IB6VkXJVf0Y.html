out in this video I'm going to be
showing you guys the kinter message box
or to kinter however you want to call it
but anyway so what this is is it's
essentially arm the equivalent of like
an alert in JavaScript pretty much a
little pop-up that appears on the screen
and they can either just give you plain
text like a tidbit of information or you
can also ask you a question like um you
know those pop-ups that are like do you
want to leave the site yes/no um are you
cool
yes No do you like baloney yes no
although that might as well just have a
yes button but you know I'll show you
guys how to make it anyway so first
thing we're going to do is import some
crap that we need Ginter and this one is
called message box so this is pretty
much the class that allows you to pop a
message box up on the screen simple
enough so the first type I'm going to
show you is just pretty much basic text
which is basic dialog nothing that you
can interact with in any way as far as
you know typing in info or pressing any
buttons so what you do is you kinter and
in the message box class there's
function called show info now this is
actually going to take a couple
parameters some of them are optional
some of them are necessary the first one
is I probably should have showed you
just a while ago but you know at the top
of every window I think by default it
just says like TK or something but this
right here it says YouTube tutorials
that's actually called the window title
and the first parameter are just
actually right window titles so you can
see exactly where it is whatever text
you write in here
that's what's going to appear as this
text so I'm just stuck with like TK or
cancer or whatever it was called so now
since this is just a basic show info
dialog all you can do is pretty much
have a blurb of text and display to the
user so I'll just read something stupid
like um monkeys can
of up to 300 years you know like a fun
little fact is that true absolutely not
but who cares someone's probably going
to believe it so my program I can lie if
I want to but anyways check this out
I'm going to right click run this bad
boy and it says window title that's
where I was talking about right here and
monkeys can live up to 300 years so of
course you can just press ok close it
pretty much zero interaction so the next
thing I want to do is I want to show you
guys another thing that's actually
pretty similar to this but instead of
just having an OK button and that's all
you can do this is actually going to
give you a couple options it doesn't say
yes or no now what you always want to do
is instead of just running it real quick
you actually want to store that in a
variable so then you can use it later in
your program so I'll take this and store
it in the variable answer so this answer
is going to be equal to yes or no so now
when I do enter and this is actually my
freaking cursor all the way message box
I have like half a stuffy nose half na
stuff we know so I sound weird but you
know probably sound weird anyway so ask
question now the first one of course is
the window title again so we'll say that
we're making like a quiz application I
don't know maybe IQ test so this can be
question 1 and the second parameter this
has to be a yes or no question because
that's what this is if you write like
what's your name it's just going to have
a button yes or no so unless your name
is yes or no you know they don't have
anywhere to type in and of course so
I'll just pull like I don't know let me
think of something real stupid got it do
you like silly faces so of course they
can click yes or no stored in the
variable answer so now we can just make
a basic if statement so if the answer
and make sure you have a double equal
sign
never put is and never put on one equal
sign because of course one equal sign
this assignment like assigning um the
value of five equal to the variable X or
something so what is answer equal equal
to yes so that's how you do with a vast
question dialogue and now if they
answered yes if they do indeed like
silly faces then we'll just print them
out a silly face like this oops
you know just some guy with like a silly
eyes and you know like a little beard at
the end so that's pretty silly face and
give some spaces around that actually
let's make his face a little bit longer
there we go
so now when I run this bad boy check it
out monkeys can live up to that's a
pretty interesting fact actually okay
now check this out do you like silly
faces whenever I click this yes button
what it's going to do it's going to take
this function which is basically that
box and since we clicked yes the answer
yes is now stored in the variable answer
so this was true of course it print out
our silly face and that's how we got
that so really quick tutorial really
simple but that's how you use message
boxes and cancer and now I have to go
because I am trying to get my crush
Barbara for you to to sign up for
buckey's rooms so that's what I got to
do
if anyone can actually get her sign up
then I'll give you like five bucks
because she's hot and I want her to sign
up for my website but anyways that's all
I have for you guys so I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
