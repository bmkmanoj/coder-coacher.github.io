we get started with this tutorial I just
want to go ahead and thank Kevin for
pledging of $5 to my patreon account so
thank you very much Kevin this video is
for you alright so what I want to do now
is I want to talk to you guys about how
to set up your gulp file j/s so this
file is basically the instructions where
you tell gulp what to do so basically
whenever you use gulp you need to give
it a list of commands and these commands
are going to be different for every
project the ones I have for my website
or I say hey we have a bunch of s CSS
files go ahead and convert them to CSS
and then I give another command and I
say hey you know those CSS files go
ahead and minimize them and then I say
go ahead and minimize all the JavaScript
so again pretty much just a list of
tasks or instructions so before we can
get into any of that
what we need to do is we actually just
need to import this gulp file or
directory' right here so you know
whenever we installed gulp it came with
all of the source code that we need in
order to import it what we do is we just
write baller
gulp and you just write require require
gulp alright so what we did in this is
we just pretty much took all of this
right here and we stored it inside a
variable in that way we just don't have
to write this over and over and over
again so now that we have gulp imported
we can pretty much just use gulp however
we want so I'm just gonna go ahead and
rate the syntax for the method or task
and then you guys are going to
understand how to write them so you
always write gulp your variable right
there and then your right task now in
parentheses right after if you need to
give it kind of two parameters the first
one is the task name and you usually
aren't just going to name it test name I
just want to show you guys where it goes
and the second one is a function so let
me just go ahead and real quick let me
just comment this out it was they do
something all right
so every single bit of instruction is
gonna be broken down like this you're
gonna say hey gulp we're gonna make a
task and this is gonna be the name of it
so again whenever you I don't know maybe
you want to convert a CSS to CSS you
might name it SAS or s CSS or something
relevant but just for this tutorial just
to show you guys that you can name
anything you want I'm gonna go ahead and
make a simple task called bacon now
inside here just like any other
JavaScript function you just need to
give it something to do so what's the
easiest thing I can imagine right now
let's just go ahead and print something
out in the terminal on the screen right
there so if you guys don't know how to
do that it's just console dot the log
and again all this means is print
something out in the terminal and just
write something stupid like wow I don't
know bacon is so juicy looking good
alright so again what we did is we
imported all the files that we need in
order to use gulp now once we had those
we're gonna make a new task or new
function so I named it bacon and
whenever I use bacon all it does is it
prints something out on the screen so
how do we actually call this function or
use it well what we can do is we can
open up a terminal or again I already
have one built right into my IDE but if
you want then you can go ahead and just
use your command line terminal whatever
you're using right there but let me just
go ahead and do this it might be a
little bit easier to see if it's all on
one screen so in order to actually use
this you first navigate to whatever
directory your gulp files in and type
gulp and then the name of the task so
this would be gulp bacon now go ahead
and hit enter and look at this it first
gives you some
that's and this is just saying hey we're
using gulp and then it does this thing
Wow bacon is so juicy and again all
these lines are here they aren't really
important they just say hey we're
starting this task ending it and it just
tells you how long it takes so again
that command let me go ahead and type it
here is gulp bacon so we use the keyword
gulp first because whenever you use the
keyword gulp then what it's going to do
is gonna look through this directory
whatever directory you're in and its
gonna look for a file called gulp file
is that's why I said in the last video
it's very important to name it got 5ks
because if you name it something else is
gonna say um you don't have any
instructions for me so it's gonna look
for this file that's what that gulp
command does and once it finds that it's
gonna say ok what next bacon so it's
gonna look through this file and it's
gonna look for a task called bacon
so what bacon says is just print
something out on the screen in this case
wow what bacon is so juicy so that's why
it printed this right there and again
let me just show you guys real quick
I'll say uh frogs I'll say uh frogs are
cool my caps lock is on alright my
typing it gets more superior as I go on
but again just to show you guys just so
this sticks in your brain if you're
right
gulp forgot about that little caps lock
thing cope frogs and it's gonna do the
same thing it's gonna go through look
for that gulp Tijs file in call the task
frogs so there you go that's the basics
of how to create a task in gulp okay you
would never want to have tasks like
these in an actual project or you're
probably going to get fired or kicked
out of school so now that we know how to
give gulp instructions and the next
story I'll show you guys how to create a
test that is actually useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
