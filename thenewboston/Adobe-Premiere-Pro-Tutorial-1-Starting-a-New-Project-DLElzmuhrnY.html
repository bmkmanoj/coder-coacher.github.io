Robertson welcome to your very first
tutorial in Adobe Premiere Pro so before
we even get to the good stuff of
teaching you how to edit video like a
pro I want to mention this if you're
watching these videos on YouTube make
sure you're watching in full-screen 1080
high def because if you try watching it
on the little youtube player it's not
going to work so again make sure you're
watching full screen and change your
video settings to 1080 and everything is
going to be crystal-clear just like
you're looking at your own desktop so
anyways before I jump into the program
and open it and start slicing up some
videos I want to tell you guys this for
those of you who don't even know what
Premiere Pro is sometimes people click
my videos just because they're bored at
work or school or something I better
mention this Premiere Pro is a piece of
software that's used to edit video and
it's one of the best video editing
programs out there I absolutely love it
it's probably my favorite program on the
computer so what you can do is whenever
you go around and shoot some film with
your handy cam that you got from Best
Buy it's pretty cool and you can use it
as a home movie or what you could do is
throw on your computer edit the video
throw some titles on it add some special
effects adjust the audio and turn it
into an awesome movie with this program
so another thing I want to mention is
that I'm going to be using the version
cs5 point 5 but it really doesn't matter
what version you have some things may be
a little bit different if you're using
an older version or if you're watching
this video in a couple months in a newer
version came out it's okay you're going
to be able to follow along with these
tutorials just fine you may have a few
more options in like one of the
drop-down menus for effects or something
but generally you're going to be able to
follow along just fine so let's go ahead
and open up this bad boy I'm going to go
ahead and assume you have it installed
on your computer already or you probably
won't be watching this video so go ahead
and hit the start all programs and
either under Adobe or production premium
it really depends if you bought the
whole package or just Premiere Pro mine
is under production premium and look for
a program called Premiere Pro whatever
version number you have now you can go
ahead and click this and it's going to
open
it or since we're going to be working
with a lot go ahead and right-click it
and hit send to desktop and what that's
going to do is it's going to give you a
nice pretty little icon on your desktop
so go ahead and double click that and
now this bad boy starts opening up so
the very first screen we get is pretty
much it says welcome to Adobe Premiere
Pro it's where we have to decide do we
want to open a project we already been
working on or start an entirely new
project and since we probably or at
least I think that you guys never
started a project before it's probably a
good idea to start from here so new
project and now it asks us for even more
stuff the first thing I want to mention
is this tab over here scratch this don't
ever touch this Adobe is a really smart
company and they already set up where
they're going to store all of your files
and they set it up really good so don't
even worry about this another thing
that's pretty cool is all this stuff 90%
of it is set up for you video rendering
video and audio they already selected
what's best for you this is like the
industry standard stuff unless you're
shooting with a really weird
I don't know slow motion camera or
something you don't want to change any
of this the only thing that you need to
worry about is this crap down here the
capture depends on what camcorder you
use to shoot the footage it's either
going to be regular digital video or
high def video which is a little better
quality and if you don't know just go
ahead and either go over to your
camcorder and look it says DV or HDV or
on your box or the manual that your
camcorder came with it's going to say it
on there but figure it out and you know
select whatever one you want so I shot
the footage that I'm going to be working
with in my tutorials with a high-def
camcorder so that's how I'm going to
select that and this is pretty much
saying where do you want to store your
project you know store it wherever you
want and I'm going to name this YouTube
tuts or YouTube and I'll just name it
YouTube you know just going to wing it
okay so go ahead and hit OK and now it
asks us for even more crap
oMG Premiere Pro come on give us a break
but anyways pretty much you
have a bunch of preset settings that you
get to choose from now every camcorder
is built a little bit differently in
that may be the size of the picture is a
little bit different or how many images
it takes per second is a little bit
different what you need to do is you
need to go through here and match up
whatever preset you have with whatever
your camcorder has in again I can't say
do this or do the other because it
really depends on what kind of camcorder
you were filming with but for my
camcorder I'm filming with HD v 1080
which is the size of the frame and 30
right here this is the frame rate pretty
much how many pictures per second this
camera is taken so that's my setting and
I guess I might as well mention these
other tabs - you're probably never going
to use this but if you have a really
weird camcorder like 99% of times don't
even worry about this but if you have a
really weird camcorder and you want to
give it custom settings then there you
go in tracks we can go ahead and change
this whenever we're editing so they
shouldn't even put that tab there so
pretty much go ahead and find your
camcorder settings by looking at the
manual or whatever and select what one
you need so go ahead and just keep
sequence one for all of your projects
it'll work fine and hit okay so now you
hit OK and it goes ahead and Wow
look at all this crap right here a bunch
of menus and tabs and panels what the
heck is going on well it can be very
overwhelming at first so what we're
going to do in the next tutorial is go
over the entire workspace actually I'm
not going to have time I lied in the
next tutorial we're not going to be
going over the entire workspace but
we're going to be picking it apart and
I'm going to be giving you guys a better
idea of what all this crap is and what
all these buttons and widgets do so
that's what you have to look forward to
in the next tutorial but for now go
ahead and get your project set up and
make sure that you go ahead and save it
and you should be good to go so for now
thank you guys for watching don't forget
