video we're gonna be fixing a few
problems with the game the first one is
right now
check out this first meatball whenever I
run the game it falls right through the
ground not good even though it has
physics applied to it our game doesn't
know yet that this brown stuff in this
little grass right here is the ground
even though we can see it as human
beings gonna realize we needed to help
construct to that it needs to treat this
area as the ground now
before I do that I want to mention this
right now um of course whenever we play
the game the camera follows the meatball
will never refire it and this is really
good for the final game but just for
developing it and making sure that we
see everything I actually like to take
this entire window and I like to see
everything at once so I'll show you guys
what I'm talking about
if you click new project right here
actually I forgot what the size of my
layout was all right so go ahead and
copy your layout size and then in your
projects panel right here click a new
project and I'm gonna make my window
size the same size as my layout size now
whenever I do this you guys can see that
my entire window is now pretty much that
so it's a little bit different than if
you play Angry Birds or something but
this is really useful whenever you're
just developing your game and you don't
want to keep looking back and forth with
your camera so that's a how I'm gonna
develop this game from here on out but
just remember whenever you export your
final game to go back and actually
change your window size so right now
I'll make sure to go back in the layers
panel and have that game selected and
now another issue I want to take care of
is this of course now we can work on the
issue with the meatball going through
the ground
obviously we don't want that to happen
we want it to pretty much roll across
the ground so in order to do this take
this sprig right here and hopefully you
name it a square or it is named square
already and drag it down the bottom
right here and the size um the height
really doesn't matter that much but what
you can do is you can just resize it
something like 1500 because remember
that's how wide our game is let me
scroll out a little bit so you guys can
see so make sure you have it exactly
1500 wide and it could be just a hundred
taller or whatever so now if we scroll
in and I just accidentally hit all on my
keyboard so alright 1 make sure my
didn't mess up my screen recorder at all
and position this exactly right there
maybe even all right
so pretty much position that right where
the ground is and since it just looks
annoying right here I'm also going to
change the opacity of it from 100 to 50
although that's not really going to
matter and also another thing I want to
point out is I'm just changing the
opacity so it's a little bit easier to
work over there right now
opacity means transparency of course I
don't know why I said that you guys know
that and whenever you export your final
game make sure that you have the opacity
at zero for this meaning that it's there
but no one can see it so right now again
just go ahead and put it at 50 and that
allows us to work with it easy but still
see the ground in the background and
actually what I can do is change the
name from this to ground and that way we
can be um you know whenever we're adding
physics through it or behaviors to it
later on it's easier to see our objects
if they're named properly so right now
we put the square at the ground but we
didn't say to treat it as a physics
object yet so other things like the
meatballs in the cannon and the tower
interact with it so in order to do this
make sure you have it selected and add a
physics behavior and whenever you do
this the meatball can now roll across
the it will treat it as um a solid
object basically now before you just
start firing stuff into it I want to add
a couple other properties to it so the
first thing I'm going to do is I want
there's a property called immovable and
I just want to go ahead and set this
equal to yes and as you can see it goes
in able to make object have infinite
mass ideally for scenery so basically it
allows them things to work properly
whenever you're using them in the
background scene and another thing I
wanted to do is prevent rotation so
prevent the object rotating when hit now
the reason I selected that is because we
don't want even though this is treated
like a real life object right now we
don't want it to interact with really
anything so whenever we hit these blocks
right here they're gonna tumble around
they're gonna move however whenever we
hit this ground with a meatball we don't
want it to rotate or move around or bump
around at all so that's why we pretty
much need to make it a moveable and
prevent rotation and that takes care of
all of that so now it covers the area
that we want opacity is at 50 and now
whenever I shoot the meatball you see
the first one just dropped and landed
there which means it's working awesome
and check that out pretty freakin sweet
so we can either just shoot this first
one or the second one and all of the
physics are built right in to construct
2 which makes this incredibly awesome
and efficient one of the reasons I use I
love working with these game making
software's and engines rather than
coding everything by scratch because
coding like all the laws of physics by
scratching gravity and how things react
take a crapload of time so anyways we
got our ground working we got our
meatballs behaving sweet so uh well
that's it for this tutorial I think so
thank you guys for watching and
well see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
