multiplied by the luminance and 50%
actually I think it's 50% multiplied for
the darker part of the images and 50%
screened for the lighter parts of the
images if that makes sense to you so
it's kind of a combination of screen and
overlay the next one here is soft light
and that's kind of like a less version
lesser version of overlay go to the next
ones
the hard light is another variation of
the overlay it's like a little bit
better than a soft light linear light is
even harder than then the soft light I
guess it looks it's more amped up I
guess the next one is vivid light here
and that's an even more amped up version
of the linear light so it kind of like
based off each other go to pin light
here and as you can see this is like
more like the darken and lighten mode
that we use before and then here's
harden mix and this creates like that
posterize effect if you if you are in
like in Photoshop there's a posterize
effect in there but it uh I mean I think
it only has a few basic colors in it and
they show up here depending on what
where you go over top and the image
the next set here are the subtraction
and division modes
so here's difference so the color values
of one layer are subtracted from the
color values of another layer when a
difference is on you can go to classic
difference is probably the same thing
yeah exclusion here I mean exclusion is
pretty much like difference but like
less contrast and like less saturation
maybe the next one we got here is a
subtract and subtract is going to only
be in cs5 and up so you won't see it if
you are you trying to use cs4 follow the
tutorial but it subtracts the top layer
from the layers below it the next one
here is divided and it's a lot brighter
than the subtract and divide is also
only cs5 and up so you won't see that in
cs4 below the next set of modes here is
the property replacing modes so we'll go
to hue so hue the top layer is combined
with the saturation and luminance of the
bottom layers and we can go down here to
saturation for saturation the top layer
combines the hue and the luminance and
remember that the hue combine the
luminance and the saturation so think of
that once just remember how those two a
little differ so we'll go to color so
color is a little different it's it
combines the hue and saturation of the
top layer with the luminance and the
brightness of the bottom layer
kind of confusing and again I'm not sure
how it computes it really but that's
that's I mean I mean that is how it
computes it but I'm not sure how its to
predict what its gonna look like
so let's go down to luminosity
luminosity takes the hue and saturation
of the top layer and I guess it puts it
on basically I don't really know how to
say how it does it just puts it in the
the luminance and the brightness of the
of the upper layer so the bottom layer
of the has the hue and plus saturation
and the top is the luminance plus
brightness I mean it kind of like not
sure how that one works too much either
and I don't really use it that often
because it often gives me these crappy
looking colors the the next section is
based on transparency so it has a
whether or not the object has an alpha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
