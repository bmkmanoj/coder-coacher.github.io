your xx intermediate Jeff tutorial and
in this story we are finally going to be
going over applets and this is probably
the most common use of Java on the
Internet what an applet is is is pretty
much basically in essence a way of using
a java program through your internet
browser so this is how people can share
um I mean if you ever played a runescape
that's what this is if you have like a
Scottrade account
um they use applets heavily so in
actually if you want to just view a
couple examples of a java applet go
ahead to your computer let's go
computer and let's see if i can find it
under c program files under java your
JDK version click let's see I think it's
under demo applets this is a list of
APIs that's pretty much built into the
JDK whenever you install it so go ahead
and click like draw test or something
like that and now you see you have a
bunch of classes in the Java file and
this example right here is actually a
URL I'm a Firefox Firefox document so if
you want to check and you want to see if
you have the applicant Ainur which is
pretty much the way you use applets let
me minimize this so I can actually get
in my screen recorder see this is a Java
program that is able to be used from the
browser itself so this is called draw
test and I didn't build this it comes
with your JDK go ahead and click points
and pick a color so here's a just a real
quick example of how you can have a Java
program running right inside your
internet browser so this is what we're
going to be creating in these next
tutorials but you know nothing this
advanced right now so let's go ahead and
the first thing we want to do is create
a real basic applet so go ahead and
click import java.awt and what this is
going to well these are just your
imports you want to import Java x-wing
as well and the way you even set up a
class is a little bit different in order
to create a
class you need to have to extend J
applet and this is the crash in class
use the create applets so let's go ahead
and get started not for me talking
public class I'm just going to name mine
Bucky and it needs to extend J applet
and like I said this is the class that
you need to inherit from because this
tells job you're going to be creating an
applet now why do you inherit from it
because any time your browser tries to
open an applet there are certain methods
that it needs to have and the methods
are in J applet so that's why you need
to inherit from there and you can of
course override them which will be learn
do later on but for now I'm just going
to make a real basic arm pretty much the
most basic thing I can have so what we
want to do is you just want to paint
something or print it on the screen so
go ahead and make method public void
paints and of course you remember from
are not even our intermediate
intermediate tutorials these are our
tutorials from long ago you pass a
graphics object in name G and this
allows you to paint on the screen or
pretty much print text so let's call a
superclass of paint and pass it in that
G that we just had just created and now
with our drawing object which is G we
can draw strings on the screen so draw
sring and it takes three parameters the
iterator which is pretty much the text I
don't know why they named the iterator
will type out wow this actually works
you type anything you want and x and y
is of course the positioning but at 25
across and 25 down so now here is our
very first applet and the cool thing
about eclipse is of course whenever we
created a website we want to go in with
our FTP but uh with it with eclipse you
don't have to do all that all you have
to do is press run press ok and it will
start the applet viewer right for you so
here's your Apple viewer here's your a
status bar this means the applet started
and here is our applet itself so this
would usually appear once you go to like
someone's website like
trade or runescape or something this
would pop up but for now it's just going
to pop up as a standalone without having
to do your web browser so this is the
excellent way of testing your applets
real quick through a I mean that's the
beauty of Eclipse that's another reason
right it's just totally awesome and you
should get it so if you're coding in
notepad plus plus that's another reason
to download that but now that we made a
sample applet on I mean we probably want
to be learning and do some stuff other
than just writing text or screen so now
that we learn to create it and now that
you know your computer is not messed up
we can finally move on the next tutorial
so in the next couple stories I'm going
to be teaching you guys how to put this
on an actual real website so that anyone
can access it and also be learning how
to make some pretty sweet applets but
just go ahead and do this all to make
sure that you actually have Java on your
web browser and nothing's messing up and
once you all coded this simple applet
you already move on the next tutorial so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
