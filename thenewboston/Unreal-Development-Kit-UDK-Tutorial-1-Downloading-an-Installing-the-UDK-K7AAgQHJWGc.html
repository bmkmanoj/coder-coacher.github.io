Robertson welcome to your very first
tutorial and learning the UDK the Unreal
development kit now before I even get
started telling you guys what the UDK is
why it's useful what you can do with it
I want to tell you guys this in order to
watch these upcoming tutorials you need
to change your resolution to 1080 and
you also need to watch in full screen
that's how I'm going to be recording I'm
going to be recording my entire computer
screen and 1080 resolution so instead of
trying to watch these videos on your
small little YouTube player watch on
full screen 1080 you're going to be able
to see every single detail of what I'm
doing on every single menu button and
drop-down box and it's a lot better way
so that's how I'm going to be recording
my videos that's how I recommend that
you watch my videos so now that I got
that out of the way let's talk a little
bit about the UDK the UDK is basically a
program that's going to allow us to make
awesome amazing 3d games so let me show
before I even get in you know talking
about a little more let me show you guys
a couple games that were created using
this unreal technology Gears of War
infinity blade army of 2 Bioshock 2 Mass
Effect oh let's see what else we got
down here Batman
Borderlands one of my favorite games so
as you can see these are some of the
newest most visually stunning awesome
games that were ever created not any you
know crappy 1980 computer games these
are some of the most amazing games and
this is what we're going to be learning
so these are the magnitude and caliber
of games that we're going to be learning
how to make so that's what we had to
look forward to I am super excited for
this so with that being said let me talk
to you guys a little bit more about the
UDK I told you guys that it's a program
used to make 3d games but it's a lot
more than that the UDK is responsible
for organizing all of our assets for
example it organizes our 3d models our
3d characters our sound effects it takes
all these pieces and brings them
together in order to allow us to put
together an awesome game it also takes
care of how our computer handles
the memory the graphics that appear on
the screen it also takes care of the
game physics so whenever you're playing
a game you take a lot of things for
granted such as the sound and physics
and the game engine also known as the
Unreal Engine is responsible for this so
like I said it takes care of a lot of
behind the scenes stuff that we take for
granted so with that being said the UDK
basically has all the tools that we need
in order to create epic amazing games
and by the way it's entirely free how
awesome is that so let me go ahead and
show you guys where to download this UDK
go ahead and go to google and type in u
DK and go ahead and press Enter
now go ahead and go to the UDK website
UDK comm I guess you could just like
that in your browser but I like Google
so might as well use that now this
website may look a little different
depending on when you're watching this
video but you're going to want to look
for a button that says download UDK and
click that now you're going to see a
bunch of different versions of the UDK
they basically come out with a new
version each month just go ahead and
download the most recent version now at
the time of this recording the most
recent version is the May 2011 UDK but
if it's a different version then don't
fret it's basically the same program no
matter what version you download just a
few little features maybe they have them
you know a couple more options included
or something but go ahead and download
the latest version I'm not going to go
ahead and download it because I already
have it downloaded and downloading to
you DK's would be stupid so I'm going to
assume that you guys know how to
download and install things because you
guys probably have a lot of experience
from downloading illegal music and stuff
so I'm not going to hold your hand and
teach you guys how to download and
install because I'm going to guess that
you guys know how to do that already but
once it's downloaded and once it's
installed go ahead and under your all
programs I'm assuming you guys are using
windows go ahead and click Unreal
development kit and I want to create a
shortcut to the desktop so go ahead and
right click UDK editor and click
sent to desktop this is going to give
you a nice little shortcut on your
desktop right here and it's a lot easier
whenever you're you know you want to use
the UDK to click on this icon right here
rather than going through your Start
menu every time so that's why I want to
add an icon to the desktop and basically
if your program opens successfully it
means you downloaded it and installed it
correctly if something goes wrong it
means maybe you downloaded a corrupt
file just go ahead and download it and
install it again
but once you have this open it means
that you downloaded it and installed it
correctly now that is all I wanted to
cover in this tutorial but I want to
tell you guys about one more thing at
the end of these tutorials once I'm done
teaching guys how to create 3d models
and use the UDK to create everything you
know game development related I want to
get a huge project together and I want
to create a huge game I think for the
community for the new boss then it would
be super fun it would give us all a
bunch of experience and also we'd have
an awesome game to add to any of our
resumes if we wanted to apply you know
as a job as a game developer or anything
like that so that's the goal of these
tutorials to teach you guys how to
create amazing games and at the end of
these stories if you want to sign up to
be part of this project you can but for
now that's all I wanted to cover in this
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
