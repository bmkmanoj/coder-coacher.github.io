decayed soro and in this tutorial I'm
gonna be enhancing our texture a little
bit so in the last tutorial what we did
is we gave our material an overall look
and we just made it basically to look
like bricks but if we scroll around our
material a little bit we're gonna notice
a couple things first of all it looks
kind of bland and another thing this
material right here it doesn't really
pop out because in real life these
bricks would kind of stick out and in
between the bricks it would have some
depth this part would be indented and
right now it really doesn't have a lot
of bumpiness or depth to it so we can
change that right now by applying the
normal setting now this normal setting
right here is a setting you can use to
apply depth or bumpiness to your
material so in order to do that what we
need to do is we need to include
something called a normal map now a
normal map has information about which
what part of your material you want to
stick out what part you want to indent
what part you want to apply bumps to
this is pretty much the picture of what
material you want to use now the normal
map is saying what areas you want to
have you know indented and stuff like
that so enough of me talking let me just
go ahead and do it go ahead in in order
to apply a normal map go ahead and right
click and hit texture new texture sample
and now what we need to do is instead of
applying just as plain old texture to
this we need to apply a normal map to it
so whenever you import textures into
your UDK you're gonna have two things
you're gonna have the texture itself and
you're gonna have a normal map so let me
go ahead and see if I can find this
texture so whenever they imported this
this is the texture itself and this is
the normal map right here so go ahead
and select this normal map and then go
ahead and select this green arrow and
this is going to say use the currently
selected object in the content browser
and whenever I do that you say that
it imports the normal map as my texture
so let me give you guys a quick little
background or history on normal Maps
like I said a normal map isn't a texture
itself it's basically saying all right
these are the parts of the texture that
you should indent out that and stuff
like that so as you can see right now it
doesn't really look like a regular
picture it has three colors basically a
red green and a blue color the red color
shows the X pixels that should be
intended the green colors show where the
Y pixels should be indented and the blue
color shows which Z pixels should be
intended basically I'm going to be going
over this whenever we make our own
normal maps in Photoshop but for now
just remember normal Maps tell your
texture which area should be out dented
and indented normal Maps basically apply
depth to your material so in order to
apply this normal map to our material we
need to go ahead and take this normal
map and stick it into our normal right
there pretty cool huh
so actually let me go ahead and delete
that and go ahead and keep your eyes on
this while I do it
so nothing yet and then go ahead and
keep your eyes on that material and when
I go ahead and release this you can see
that the bricks now look like they're
sticking out and it kind of gets
indented where the black should be right
there so let me go ahead and delete that
one more time just so you guys can see
the difference and apply it and check it
out our bricks and now have some depth
to them pretty cool huh
so now that we have an enhanced material
we can go ahead and save this material
and then go ahead and X out of this and
then you can see our materials if we go
ahead and clear this out we want to go
ahead and save our package
and now we have our new enhanced brick
material so now we can use this new
brick material which now has the newly
normal map aka has some depth to it to
apply anywhere in our level so go ahead
and let me just if I can drag and drop
that right there so pretty cool huh we
can use our texture to you know make a
weird-looking cube if we want a pink
side that glows and two bricks pretty
cool huh
so that's basically how you use normal
Maps what they are and again whenever
you import textures or excuse you
whenever you import yeah textures from
Photoshop or something into the UDK it's
gonna have two pieces it's gonna have
the texture itself in a normal map which
gives depth information so that's how
you apply the texture and the normal map
to make one sweet looking material so
now that we understand the basic stuff
had to do that we're ready to move on to
some more advanced materials but for now
