tutorial that I'm making for bunny
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to create your own
exceptions and how to throw them so all
you're going to need for this tutorial
is a button and some sort of method that
passing the string through so we're
going to check to see if this string is
an empty string or not so we can say if
my string equals an empty string and one
throw an exception instead of just
spline a message box saying something so
in order to do that there are two things
you can do the first is you create a new
exception right on the spot and you
throw it or you could create an
exception that you can use multiple
times or throw a whole times so we're
just going to go with the first one
right now we're going to create a new
exception and throw it right on the spot
so it's going to throw to throw the
exception and then we're going to want
to type new and then exception and what
this will do is a little throw this new
exception and inside of these
parentheses right here we're going to
want to put the description of our
exception so I'm just going to make the
description be used and set this equal
to and you're probably going to want to
make your ception description a little
bit more professional than that is so it
sounds better but you get the idea right
now so now we're going to go back to a
button click and we're going to try to
have a pass an empty string through this
check string method and we should get an
error because we told it to throw an
error or throw an exception so when you
click this button now it'll throw an
exception in our application will crash
yep and they gave us the description
that we wrote out
another thing that you can do is you can
create an exception and throw a multiple
times so for example like if you if
there was like a an instance where you
would need to throw the same exception
twice if like description would be the
same like if you had to on the spots
inside your class we're having a
description for your exception the you
can't set the string keep it to an empty
string make sense for what you're doing
then you might as well create an
exception you can throw multiple times
instead of throwing two new exception
through the same description so you can
just do exception and then you can name
your exception I'm just going to call it
my exception but you're probably going
to want to name is something that is
more relevant to what to what your
exception actually is and then you want
to set equal to a new exception just
like before and put a description inside
of it now I'm just going to copy this
description code it's fine for what
we're doing now and then of saying throw
new exception
we can just say grow Oh my exception but
we got to make this static because we're
using because this is a step method
right here and all the members that
we're using inside of our static method
must be static as well so now we can
throw my exception all right so this
should do the exact same thing before
yep now you may think to yourself well
this is stupid
why why would you ever want to throw an
exception why would you ever want your
application in crash well usually you
don't want to crash you really have like
whoever's using your class like you
usually use this inside of like a class
that you're creating and then like
whoever's using your class to put a try
and catch around the list and instead of
having to have their own a message box
be displayed when they catch the
exception they can just have it display
the the exception message so let's have
a message box show the matter of the
exception map message search duty a stop
message and what this is right here is
this is the exception that is thrown so
we just display the message of the
exception is thrown and instead of our
application crashing this time we should
get a message box saying you can't set
this string equal to an empty string yep
so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
