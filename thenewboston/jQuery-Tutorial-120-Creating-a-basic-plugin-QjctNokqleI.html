set to say a few spaces here
what trim would do is it would get rid
of these spaces and therefore render it
as nothing so we can go ahead and use
that as well and that will have the same
effect it's just something to know in
you know that's quite useful if people
are trying to mess your plug in around
find things that are wrong with it
now the third condition so or again is
we need to check if this target is
currently in this target array and
obviously if the target is in the array
we don't want to apply target --blank
so we can check that against false so
it's a jQuery doc in array remember case
sensitivity we've got a capital A here
and a capital J here as well as all
these lowercase letters so target array
is gonna take two parameters the first
one is the actual thing you're looking
for which is obviously the target that
we retrieved earlier from the attribute
set and then we want to take a look at
checking this against target array so we
just use target all right so now we
can't leave this as it is because if it
is in the array which say for example we
had to set this to self this would be
returned true so we don't want to apply
target --blank if we already have blank
self parent or top so we check this
against false okay
so if the target isn't in and it isn't
in this target array we want to not
obviously check this against false so if
it isn't then we want to apply a target
blank so there are the three things that
we need to check and we've used the or
operator to separate all of these we've
checked undefined nothing and we've
trimmed it so however many spaces for
example will be entered it will always
equal nothing and then we've got jQuery
in array and we're checking that game's
false just a quick note the trim will
also work if the user was to say do self
and then three spaces afterwards so
that's quite important
just go and get rid of this for now on
okay so in plugin what we want to do is
go ahead and apply target --blank so
this is relatively easy we just
reference this again as in this now this
in this case refers to this here okay so
we're using the functionality inside
target --blank to apply it to something
that we've you know so found it to and
we want to create the attribute so the
attribute is target and the value is
blank so if the target is undefined
doesn't equal anything or it's not in
the array then we apply target blank so
that's quite simple and we've now
completed our plugin so now obviously we
want to go in the head and test it just
in case we've done anything that we
shouldn't or it's not working properly
so let's just go ahead and refresh now
at the moment the target is undefined
and therefore this condition should
return true and then we should apply
target equals blank so let's go ahead
and refresh and click the link you can
see that we've applied a target of blank
and this is open in a new window so now
let's go ahead and say target equals
nothing so it's defined we've actually
defined the attribute itself but we
haven't placed any content in so when we
refresh and click is still opens in a
new window so we've applied target
equals blank to this despite the fact
we've defined it already let's go ahead
and into three spaces in here and see
what result we get back this isn't part
of the if statement because obviously
we're checking for just one or being
blank in this case we would have to go
ahead and check target equals you know
an amount of spaces but because we've
used trim it will always be rendered
back to this if there's no other content
so let's refresh and click Google and
you see it opens in a new window so
that's absolutely fine let's just go
ahead and check out what would happen if
we didn't have this trim in here
and that's refresh click google Louis it
has worked ok so maybe it will
automatically trim white space but it
doesn't hurt to use trim anyway ok so
now what we want to go ahead and do is
set the target to something that it
should it was something that will
override this this you know line here
this execution of this line here so by
using target self this is contained
within this target array
therefore this here this statement here
will render as false or return the
condition as false if it equals any of
these which it does so when we refresh
it opens in the same window you can see
there's no new two have been opened so
we've sort of overridden this by using
self the same with something like parent
if you were to use parent more or less
does the same thing but there are the
slight differences but you know we we
have the functionality in place and
obviously if we were to go ahead and use
blank we can't really see it in action
but it still opens as a blank window but
the only difference is is that this line
didn't run because it already had the
target set to blank
so essentially what we've done is
created our own plugin something very
basic but could be useful so I didn't
want to include something that was too
useless and essentially now we can just
in EXT dot j s apply this to any element
we want for example if the link was just
called link blank for example and this
here had an ID let's just get rid of
that and this here had an ID of sorry a
class of link blank that would still
work because we've just applied the
plug-in to that particular element if we
were to go ahead and copy this and just
paste it down but get rid of the class
and let's say change this here to PHP
academy' org when we go ahead and click
on this new link that we've created it
will open in the same window because
we've only applied the plug-in to that
particular link there so we can now use
our plug-in and we can tell people that
want to download our plug-in that we use
that our plug-in like this target blank
now there's one thing you'll notice that
we haven't included here and that is
supplying parameters within here so in
the next tutorial we're gonna look at
creating a plug-in but being able to
supply particular parameters to it so
that's essentially how we go ahead and
we create our own plugin in jQuery and
we've included some functionality in
here that could or could not be useful
but the main thing is that we've created
our plugin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
