person called Satoshi Nakamoto created a
computer program let's just call it a
website for now so he makes this website
where anyone can sign up and every 10
minutes this website randomly gives one
point to someone's account also all
users are able to send their points to
one another first me and my friend sign
up my friend gets to point however I
want the point so I offer him I had for
it
my friend says ok and he sends to point
to my account then some other friends
hear about it and they signup to they
think it sounds cool now there are a
dozen people signed up for this site or
trying to get these points after 10
minutes it randomly gives another point
to one of my other friends I offer him a
hat for it but someone else offers him a
ps3 game he takes the ps3 game and sends
the point to their account people
realize that the value of these points
are clearly increasing more people sign
up because they see that it is free and
that people will give you stuff for your
points everyone decides to rename points
to Bitcoin but wait there's a problem
what if the website server gets shut
down everyone will lose their bitcoins
the solution the creator Satoshi
Nakamoto decides to make the program
open-source anyone can download and run
this Bitcoin program on their own
computer so now it's not only on just
one server anymore but the Bitcoin
program is now running on many people's
computers all over the world so if one
computer shuts down the Bitcoin program
is still running fine but wait can't
anyone just change the program to say
they have 1,000 bitcoins nope
everybody's Bitcoin program is
constantly monitoring and checking all
accounts if someone tries to change
their balance the other computers will
say nice try all transactions between
users are verified by these come
butis now bitcoin is spreading thousands
of people start using it people love it
because no government or company is
controlling it it is controlled entirely
by the people not even the inventor can
stop it now
also since bitcoin is transferred
directly from user to user without any
middleman fees are incredibly low
transactions are instant no more waiting
three days for funds to clear your
account can't be frozen by anyone there
are no banks or companies with access to
your money
you control your funds no one else what
makes this even better
anyone can make a Bitcoin account wallet
for free you don't need to give any
personal information you don't need to
give your email there is no age limit
it's just like a numbered bank account
completely anonymous so how do I get a
Bitcoin wallet the easiest way is to go
to Bucky's room or every account comes
with a built-in easy to use Bitcoin
wallet and how do I get Bitcoin well
there are several ways you can sell
things and get paid in Bitcoin at HTTP
colon forward slash four slash Bucky's
room
org slash sharp slash you can buy
bitcoins from people in person at local
bitcoins calm you can also buy Bitcoin
from companies like coin based calm but
you need to give them personal
information Bitcoin is quickly becoming
very popular with people using it every
single day it is more than just a
digital currency bitcoin is a
technological innovation that is
changing the world
