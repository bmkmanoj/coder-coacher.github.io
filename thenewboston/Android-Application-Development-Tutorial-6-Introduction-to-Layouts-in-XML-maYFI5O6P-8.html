Android tutorial for the new Boston
again with me Travis and what we're
going to do in this tutorial is install
some new software that we can use for
the I'm just kidding we're getting into
the XML and XML programming so it can
set up some custom views and some custom
layouts so I want you guys to open up
your layout folder and click on this
main XML and you guys will get something
like this now you can switch between the
graphical layout which is this and the
coding which is this by these two tabs
down here graphical layout and main.xml
basically what I'm going to do in this
tutorial is describe what's going on and
teach you guys a little bit about XML
it's pretty simple language for the most
part but you know might be confusing
right at the beginning you guys will
pick this up quickly I'm I'm almost
positive now the first line of code you
see is isn't that important because any
time we set up a new layout it's going
to give us this code as well I mean it
is important but you guys won't have to
remember typing this out every time
because it's going to define it for us
and basically you need to have that as
your first line of code for the most
part and then what we do is we set up a
linear layout which starts here and give
some attributes to the linear layout and
it ends here basically what a linear
layout is going to do is it's going to
hold some other items such as a text and
it's going to kind of define basically
the layout of those items to a sense so
it's going to kind of categorize them
and do all that stuff let's see you got
a new whatever alright so we're going to
do is basically kind of define this
linear layout and or I'm going to
describe everything that's going on
within the attributes of this linear
layout now we have this reference
basically and that's all it is you guys
don't again you don't have to really
remember that because when you set up a
new layout
Eclipse will set up this reference for
us so that's nice um nice and pretty for
new programmers where you guys don't
have to remember the actual file path
and type that out each time
then the next thing that we have is the
orientation of our linear layout which
is set to sorry set to vertical I was
messing around with it and just so
that's why I has changed and basically
what that is going to do is going to set
all the items within the linear layout
vertically so for example if we copy
this text view or this text for the most
part oops and paste it twice since I cut
I cut it instead of copied it so now we
have text to text and we go into a
graphical layout they're placed
vertically from top to bottom that's
just how our layout is going to work
again we can also set this horizontally
as well as you guys just saw so I'm
going to do that real quickly by typing
horizontal and hit save go graphical
layout and and I messed this up all
right but you guys should have fill
parent again I was playing around with
this as well but just kind of wanted to
show you guys what is going on so that's
why I'm doing it this way save that and
then we go into a graphical layout and
you're like where's the other textview
and basically what's happening is being
pushed off the screen right here and
I'll explain why that's happening in a
second as you guys just saw I kind of
change the code but that's how you guys
should have your setup because I you
wouldn't have that change code so
basically now we're also adding two more
attributes to this layout basically
we're setting the parameters of how big
this layout is and what the parameters
are well the width is going to fill the
parent so it's going to take everything
that's available for the width so the
whole screens width for the most part
and same with the height it's going to
take all the height that is available to
it and it's going to set that as it's
basically basically that's its
attributes or its parameters for the
most part so there you go you have your
linear layout set up taking the whole
screen and set to a horizontal
orientation now within here we have our
text view which is basically just the
text and again
pretty much the same line of codes for
these first two layout width we have
that fill parent and as you saw I change
this to the something like wrap content
is the other option you can do basically
this is going to wrap the content of the
text whatever text we have available so
then now if we switch to graphical
layout you can see the the pretty much
delay or the parameters of this textview
is wrapping the content of the text so
those are your two options for the most
part that you can use you can also use
you know pixels if you want and we'll
get into that later but basically once
you guys remember fill parent and wrap
content the same for width the height
it's wrapping the content now the text
says at string hello and you're like no
it doesn't it says hello world starting
point now basically what's happening is
this is using a reference any time you
see an @ within it within the XML it's
using a reference so it's referencing
the string hello and that string is
located within our values so we have
this values and we have this string so
we're going to say strings and there's a
string called hello so it's using this
reference and then this is the name of
the reference but it's displaying the
value of the reference so for example we
can set up a new string by clicking add
a string and then we can set up a name
call the breath for reference and say
this is a reference and save it and then
go back into our XML and we can also
just do something like at string ref and
then we go over to our graphical layout
it says this is a reference just that
new string we set up the alternative is
you can also just type so you can just
type whatever you want without using the
@ symbol as long as it's within
quotations and there you go you can just
display your type now the good thing
about the references are for strings is
basically if you're working for a boss
that keeps changing his mind on the
title of whatever the application or
whatever if you guys have a title within
your app keeps changing the name instead
of looking through all this code for
where you type the title you can just
refer or set
a title a reference and then just go
into your string under the values and
look for that title and change the value
there so that's kind of the benefit but
hopefully you guys understand a little
bit about the layout oh one other thing
there's two ways to kind of close your
statements you can see them both here
basically we're setting up our linear
layout here and it's closing down here
now basically anytime you see a forward
slash that's when it's closing so
example you can use for I just kind of
set up two different text views and
their closing statements so we have our
text view and we set up some attributes
and then we use the less than sign and
then we use a greater than sign forward
slash text view and then you know less
than sign to close it or if you don't
want to type this out every time you can
just do forward slash less than sign for
your text so you guys go quick overview
for XML I'll catch you guys in the next
