slash on live gamer from the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
continue working on our person program
using classes now if you don't know what
you're looking at right now you may want
to move back a couple to couple
tutorials to the introduction to classes
and that is when we get started on this
program if you don't want to then that's
fine you can just go ahead and try to
figure out what's going on so if you
remember last time we set the weight
money and income label we set the text
to whatever the person's weight money
and income is and then we added the
button a click event so they will eat
five pounds of food and they will gain
five pounds and then it updates their
current weight so now let's go ahead and
do this for each of the other buttons so
we'll type my person dot work and the
arguments of this is hours as double so
say just works eight hours now we need
to update the label so label weight I
mean label money dot text equals current
money and we'll go ahead and add my
person dot get money and we'll convert
that to a string and you can see that if
we go ahead and run this we get and if
we click work our money goes up to one
hundred fifty eight dollars because
$7.25 times eight is $58 and each time
we work we get more money and now we can
eat and gain five pounds each time so
now let's go ahead and do this for the
increase income and the exercise so
we'll go ahead and click on exercise and
we'll type my person dot exercise and
the arguments for this is time as double
so let's just say exercise
one-and-a-half hours
and we'll type ylabel wait dot text and
we'll set that equal to current wait
then we'll go ahead and add my person
dot get wait and then we'll go ahead and
convert that to a string and we'll do
that one more time for the increased
income so we'll go ahead and type my
person dot increase income and the
arguments for this is amount as double
so let's just pay them two and a half
dollars more per hour and it will type
label income dot text equals current
income and then we'll go ahead and add
my person dot get income and then we'll
convert that to a string so now if we
run this let's go ahead and have our
person eat some and get pretty fat let's
say we want them to be 193 pounds now at
the exercise an hour and a half it's
going to go down to one ninety two point
eight five one ninety two point seven
and they just keep exercising they're
going to lose weight now let's have our
person work so they're making fifty
eight dollars per eight hour time period
now if we increase their income you see
that the income goes up to nine dollars
and seventy five cents per hour and
they're making more money per hour now
this may not be noticeable at first
glance but let's say I bump up their
current income to forty two dollars an
hour you can see their current money
will go up all the way up to seven sixty
eight so we can keep exercising we can
keep eating and getting fatter and then
exercising trying to get that off so now
now let's come down here and so we don't
have to type the all this out on one
line let's go ahead and make a sub that
will update the text so let's do private
sub
update income and what I just realized
is we don't have to add current income
right here we can just add my person get
income so it's not resetting this whole
thing each time so we'll just type label
income dot text plus equals my person
dot get income and then we'll convert
that to a string so it takes that's
already in there and it will add their
income or wait nevermind that's going to
add more lines of their income so I'll
just set it equal to current income and
then we'll add my person my person get
income and we'll do this for each one of
them so private sub update wait and
let's come up here to the weight so
label weight text we'll copy that
and we'll come down here and paste that
in so we'll do it one more time for
update income or not income let's do
update money so we'll go ahead and type
private sub update money now we'll go
ahead and find our money here so label
money dot text equals current money plus
my person get money dot to string and we
will paste that down in here okay so now
let's go ahead we can minimize out of
each of these subs because you're not
going to make any changes to them and
let's go ahead and just type update
money right here and let's do update
wait right here
and in down here we will update the
income and up here we will update the
weight okay so now let's go ahead and
run this and it should work just the
same as it did last time but now we have
easier to use code and we can just call
subs and which makes it a lot easier to
write our code and make it go faster so
we can eat and gain weight and then we
can exercise and lose that weight we can
work to make more money and then we can
get promoted to make a higher income so
go ahead and if you haven't typed this
code in go ahead and do that you can
even add I encourage you to add text
fields so that you can get values to
exercise or to work or to update the
income so that it's not a default value
and then once you've done that and once
you understand what we're doing go ahead
and move on to the next tutorial thanks
