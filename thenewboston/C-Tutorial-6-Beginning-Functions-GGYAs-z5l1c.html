tutorial and in this tutorial we're
going to be going over functions just
the basics of functions and sets every
program in C++ is going to be made of
these functions I thought it was kind of
an important topic to go over now the
first programming thing that we're going
to want to do here is um include some
basic functions that are built right
into C++ and these are going to be some
basic math functions so right by your
include iostream we're going to want to
include another library and that's
called it's called the C math library so
type include and then type in C math
just like that
now that we included the see math
library we can use all the built-in math
functions that see as I mean C++ has to
offer so let's go in our function body
and give our function main some
instructions the first thing that we're
going to want to do is declare our first
variable and to do this we're going to
want to use the variable type double
double just like two and then we're
going to want to name our first variable
order just name it num1 to make it easy
now what double is is pretty much just a
real number
just C++ uses the term double I don't
know why what they do and that just
means real number so now that we have
that let's just output a basic task on
the string we're going to output
pick your number and let's just end that
line so it goes into a new line as you
can see I have pick your number n line
so right now all we have is the text
pick your number and removing to a new
line now we're going to want to assign a
variable I mean a value to number number
one variable number one so to do this
use the CN now whatever number the user
types in it's going to be assigned to
the variable num one so if they type in
12 num1 is going to have the value of 12
again type in 82 so on and so on
the next thing we want to do is get a
new variable so first we have to declare
double num2 I'll just make these easy
for you but now num1 has a value but
num2 doesn't so we're going to say all
right num2 is going to be equal to the
square root of the variable number one
so as you can see we now have made a
basic function the square root and as
you can see we don't need to type any
extra code or tell C++ how to get the
square root it already knows I'm at
eclis and this is one of the many basic
math functions that C++ has in its C
math library so this is a way where you
can make basic calculations without
having to type a whole bunch of code so
now we have the variable num1 which is
going to be assigned whatever value we
tell it and num2 is going to take the
square root of number one number one and
that's the value that's going to be in
variable number two and lastly let's
just output on our screen the CR results
so C out equals I just type the square
root of
number one I'll move this over so you
can see the square root of the variable
number one is num2
not just my shirt and the line right
there and as you can see I can use these
two less than signs to join all of these
strings together and I don't need to put
it on every new line and that's another
thing that can save you time when you're
just outputting basic text on the screen
so let me save this compile and run it
hopefully I don't have any errors
and as you can see it says pick your
number and let's pick on 81 now press
ENTER and it says the square root of 81
is 9 and again just to recap once more
for the very first thing you can forget
to use is the C math because this allows
you use all these basic math functions
declare it our first variable allow the
user to say what that variables value
was then we took that and made the
square root of it the variable number
two and that's how we got our basic
function so now study this learn all of
your basic functions and get familiar
with this and I hope to see you in my
next tutorial thanks for watching make
