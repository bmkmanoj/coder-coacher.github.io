tutorial that I'm making for the new
Boston and in this tutorial we're
basically going to begin our fit project
even though it's going to be basically a
small project all we're really going to
be doing is making a program that will
generate CAPTCHAs and if you don't know
what a CAPTCHA is it's that annoying
little thing every time you have to
download something or make an account or
you there's like an image and it's like
scrambled text inside of it and you
basically have to type out what that
text is and in case you didn't know
those are just to prevent BOTS from
downloading multiple files or creating
multiple accounts or something like that
so like I said we're just going to be
making a program that will generate
those images and the first thing that
we're just going to want to do here is
create a button so that the user can
select on the output of all these images
so they're just going to be able to
select a folder where all these CAPTCHAs
will be saved to so we're just gonna
stay right here choose folder and right
next to this button we're just gonna
have a label showing the folder path
that they actually chose and we're just
gonna make it three dots right now but
we'll change that later on alright
and then we're just gonna want to have a
button that will say begin and this will
just basically start the generation so
we can stay right here dark and right
next to that we're gonna have a label
and um a text box following that so that
the user can choose how many CAPTCHAs
they actually want and I'm just gonna
make this latest text mountain sound is
going to be a text box following it or
you can type in how many CAPTCHAs that
you want to actually generate let's make
that about that big all right and then
right down here we're just gonna have a
panel and that's just so that the user
can see all the captions being generated
so it's got a panel right there and
every time that we create a new CAPTCHA
it will be displayed in there
alright let's resize this accordingly
all right there we go and a couple more
things we have to do is rename the form
and I'm just going to make it say
at January 4 and 4 and then I'm just
going to make it so that the user cannot
resize the form so I'm going to make a
form borderstyle fixed single and then
I'm going to make it so that the user
cannot maximize the form so I'm gonna go
down here to maximize box and set that
property of false alright so like I said
we're just gonna be generating CAPTCHAs
and sends me of the amount that the user
can create we're basically just going to
create a method where the user will pass
as a parameter the amount of CAPTCHAs
that they want to generate and then it
will just return an image array of
actually all of those CAPTCHAs
so it's just Sarah here we're gonna make
the return type an image array and then
we're just gonna call this method
generate CAPTCHAs and as a parameter
you're gonna be able to pass through the
amount that you want to get her in so in
alright and I'm just going to make it a
turn all right here so we don't get an
error saying we haven't returned
anything okay so first thing we have to
do is create new graphics to actually
draw on so I'm gonna say graphics G
equals channel 1.3 graphics and then
we're gonna want to create a brush to
actually draw the shapes and the text
live so we're gonna stay brush we're
actually now solid brush B equals a new
solid garage and then for the color we
want this color to be random so we're
gonna want to create a new random up
here so this random ran equals a new
instance of the random class all right
and like I said we're just gonna want to
generate a random color so we're gonna
say color dot from a RGB which is just
like numbers and since alpha is always
going to be 255 or app' hexadecimal I'm
just going to put 0 X F F F or 255 and
then for the rest of the colors we can
actually generate them randomly so I'm
gonna say
ran next to take it a random number and
for the minimum we're gonna make it zero
and then for the maximum we're going to
make it 255 since the maximum amount or
red to green or blue is 255 we're just
gonna want to do that for all three of
them so it's copy this so the random
color will be different though for red
green and blue I'm sort of patience ran
thought next all right so now we just
basically created on a solid brush with
a random color and then we just going to
add another parenthesis here all right
and now we're just gonna want to create
a pen tool because we're not gonna be
drawing solid shapes over our text
because then we wouldn't actually be
able to read the text so we're just
going to be drawing shapes like the
outline of the shape and we're gonna say
ten P equals a new pen and then for the
color of that you just want it to be a
random color as well so I'm just gonna
go ahead and copy this red color that we
have right here and even though I copied
that code it'll generate a different
random color all right so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial on the next
tutorial we're actually going to get
into drawing the text and drawing the
shapes and stuff like that
alright so see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
