slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to be
covering functions now functions are
very similar to subs except there's one
main difference functions return a value
and what this means is when you call
that function it's going to give you a
value back and you can set this value to
anything that you would like we're going
to be using some of the primitive data
types for our functions in this tutorial
so let's go ahead and get started and
make a little demo application so go
ahead and click new project I'll resize
this here windows forms application and
we will call it functions and go ahead
and click OK and we'll wait for that to
load okay so we're going to open up our
toolbox here and we're going to find the
button now I'll just add the button to
the to our form we'll set the text to
run function we'll go ahead and scroll
up and we'll set the name to button run
function okay so now that we've got that
done we're going to go ahead and double
click on run and you can see it opens up
our event handler for button run
function click and we're going to go
ahead and make a function so we're going
to come down here below our private sub
button run function underscore click and
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a function so just like a sub
we're going to start out with either the
private key word or the public key word
now since we don't want another class to
access this we're going to call it
private and then we're going to use the
keyboard function and then we'll just
name this solve math we will add empty
parameters and now after this you have
to specify a type for your function now
since all functions return a value they
have to return a certain kind of value
so what we're going to do is use the as
keyword
and we will just use double so what this
means is that our function solve math is
going to return a double and then we've
got in function here and you can see
that we get a warning and it says
function solve math doesn't return a
value on all codes code paths so what we
have to do is we have to return a value
so what we'll do is we'll just return
2013 divided by five so what this is
going to do is it's going to take 13
divided by five and give that back to
the person who called that what we can
also do is create a couple variables so
I'll just do num1 as integer and we will
set it equal to 23 and then we can
declare num2 as integer and set that one
equal to five and then what we can do is
instead of returning 13 divided by five
which will give us an answer or
something like to point something we can
just do num1 divided by num2 now if you
wanted to you could also create another
variable that was called answer and set
answer equal to num one divided by num2
and then return answer but we don't
really need to do that so we're just
going to return num1 divided by num2 and
since there's a possibility that we're
going to get a decimal number by
dividing we're going to what we did was
we declared our function solve math as a
double so now if we go ahead and come up
here to button run function click we can
go ahead and type message box dot show
and what we can do is we can call solve
math so what this is going to do is it's
going to print out the number that is
returned from solve math inside of our
message box and now if we go ahead and
run this we can click run and you can
see it gives us 4.6 now instead of just
displaying this inside of a message box
what if we want to save that value for
later
so let's come up here and we'll create a
variable so then answer
as double and we will set it equal to
solve math which is going to get the
math 23 divided by five and then we can
just print out answer and if we go ahead
and run this it's going to work exactly
the same we click run and we get 4.6 now
with functions you can have a function
that is a double an integer a string a
character abilene whatever you want so
go ahead and make a couple functions
test them out and once you got that down
go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial okay so as I was saying go
ahead and make a couple functions and
practice that then once you got that
down move on to the next tutorial and in
the next tutorial we're going to be
talking about passing values to
functions so that you can use values
outside of that function which is very
useful one you're going to be doing this
with mostly all of your functions so
thanks for watching guys and stay tuned
for the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
