another app review and this is a request
for unblock me and what unblock me is is
it's a puzzle game by those guys and it
pretty much involves having to get one
of the main red blocks out of the other
out of pretty much it's playing area and
there are two different modes you can
see I'm just going to go to play and
their challenge mode is way too
stressful so I just always go to the
relaxed mode because I'm just a relaxed
kind of guy now the goal is you see this
little opening on the right-hand side of
your screen the goal is to get this red
block these two hands the red block out
of this opening and you can slide box
around up and down and you can slide
these horizontal ones left and right so
let's go ahead and see if we can
complete this right now let me move my
camera around things might get a little
intense here I don't know I don't have a
number how to do this one um let's see
nope that didn't work all right you guys
are going to have to wait I mean I I got
10 minutes to do this so if I need to
take up the entire time then I will I
have no problem with that so let me see
if we do this this is pretty
embarrassing i can't get this
accomplished alright let's see user
brain Bucky use your brain seems to go
over here so I see what's going on here
you know what I give up this sucks three
out of ten all right you know I'm done
whoa alright so maybe you're a little
smarter than me I mean I already get
this one accomplished accomplished and
then I got a couple of them accomplish
but I pretty much has given up because I
get frustrated easily but that's the
basics of games I'm sorry I couldn't
show you guys how to do the easiest one
I'm on a little slow today but anyways
that's the basics of it and as soon as
you complete one you go to the next
puzzle and I mean that's it for me I
don't really like puzzle games that much
I like games more like high school
superstar in little kid games like that
but this is a good thing if you want to
waste some time and you know
just got time to blow so let me go ahead
oh and another thing I want to point out
any time you move blocks around and you
want to move them back just press this
little button here to reset I guess I
didn't move in here and that'll move
your blocks back to normal and anytime
you want to go home just press this and
it will take you back to the main menu
so I'm on beginner in one and I still
can't figure this out so you know
hopefully you can I am going to go find
a park alone by myself and take three
hours having my spare time and fight and
figure out how to be level number one
and while I'm doing that you guys don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and
don't forget if you have any other apps
you want me to review them please leave
a comment in our view just please please
please don't make them puzzle games
because you know I'm not very good at
this this was embarrassing but thank you
anyways and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
