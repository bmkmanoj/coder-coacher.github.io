cocos to the tutorial and in this story
I decide that it's time to cover menus
now the most common use for a menu is
pretty much right after your app opens
you see a menu of you know maybe one
button is start the game maybe one is
how to play maybe one is my other games
arm you know that's one use for a menu
but there are also other uses for a menu
for example as you're playing your game
you can have a little toolbar at the
bottom and this can be you know control
your character move it left and right
jump you can use a menu to do things
like that as well so there are a lot of
different uses for a menu not only as
soon as your you know application opens
up to give you a bunch of choices so
that's what we're going to be building
today so yeah enough of me rambling on
let's just get right into it so go ahead
and create new Xcode project and cook us
through the application and choose this
and go ahead and name it well I'm going
to name mine men you can name it
anything you want and go ahead and save
this right there now since we're going
to be working with menus what you
typically want to do is create your
custom buns in Photoshop or illustrator
maybe or you know maybe you want to pay
someone to dip own for you if you suck
at Photoshop but just for now just go
ahead and download any images off the
computer I got this image right here a
guy getting beamed in the face with a
soccer ball and drag them over to
resources let me just copy this and add
and this is going to be one button again
I just found the first you know small
little square image I saw and I got
another one of a pizza right here and
drag this into resources to so these are
going to be our to you know images again
just use any images you can find it
doesn't matter for this tutorial alright
so now what we want to do is we want to
expand classes and take a look at our
what do they called classes of course of
course so what file we're going to be
working in is this hello world scene da
em this is pretty much our main file
more or less so let me go ahead and
expand this and move this over to give
some space to work with an hour right so
the first thing we want to do is go down
to our if statement yeah we want alright
here's what we'll do go ahead and take
out everything in here because this is
pretty much as stuff to write hello
world on the screen BAM now we have a
blank slate we can do what we want so
check this out all menus need some kinds
of items in them and I already told you
about images if you want to create
custom buttons and stuff like that but
you can also have a menu with labels
which is pretty much just text on the
screen or you can put sprites in your
menu which of course you know what those
are so you can pretty much add anything
you want to your menu it just needs some
kind of items in it if you don't have a
menu with items in you're just going to
have a blank menu AKA a worthless piece
of code so here is how you add an image
item CC menu item image of course this
is different if you want to add a label
or anything like that and just go ahead
and name your item anything like item
one and set it equal to this CC menu
item image just like that an item from
normal image and a bunch of parameters
are going to pop up just go ahead and
hit tab in the first thing you want to
yeah we're getting more parameters then
anyways the first parameter is this what
is the file name up when your when your
button first pops up on the screen what
do you want it to look like normal oh
well ball face ping because that's just
the image that we just imported now
selected image is as your finger is
pressing down on the button what image
do you want to use and this can either
be the same or different I'm just going
to make this the same ball face ping
right like that now this is a menu with
two different kinds of constructors so
for example we can have those two
parameters and it'll create a button but
if you want this button to do something
you can also have a target parameter and
I'm going to put target self that means
the method that I'm going to create to
make this button do is going to be in
this class and there we go and the
selector is going to be this at selector
and make a method called do this with a
parameter so then of course you got your
closest closest and semicolon so here is
normally if you don't have a button
that's pretty much just an image here's
what you want to do you want to give a
target which itself if the object is in
this class which usually is and select
or do this this means that we're going
to be creating a method called do this
later on and whenever you press the
button this is the method that's going
to be called alright so this looks good
to go we'll see if we have any errors
later on when we build so that creates
the menu item but we need to create the
menu itself to put the items in and this
is really easy CC menu and just go ahead
and name it menu and set this equal to
yep definitely don't want to do that
menu set it equal to there we go CC menu
menu with items just like that and now
as the parameters what items do you want
to put in well you want to put an item
one because it's the only item we have
and you have to terminate it this method
with nil nil signifies the end of your
menu so if you want to have a menu with
only one item and that's what
we do right now because we only have one
item just put item 1 comma know if you
have two items played one comma 2 comma
nail simple enough so now just like all
objects pretty much we need to add this
menu to our seem so go ahead and put
self add child and for your parameter
just go ahead and put menu and this will
add the menu to the scene now there's
one more thing we need to do of course
we created this do this method so if we
go ahead and build it right now we're
probably going to get something weird
that's going to happen um you know it's
not going to run right no matter what if
we don't get a error so this thing about
cocos2d your error messages don't pop up
all the time so let's check this out it
pops up then it turns and it flashes and
you know it doesn't really give you any
air right here so no indication so if
you get that this might be what you have
to do void we told it right here that we
were going to have to do this method
when our button is pressed so let's go
ahead and write do this and whenever we
righted this colon right here we said
it's going to take a parameter so the
parameter is going to be ID sender and
you know you don't even have to make
your method do anything you just need to
have it in there so now whenever we
build and run this hopefully of course
no error messages go and pop up check
this out we have a menu right here and
whenever we click this the do this
method is actually being called we just
don't have anything in the methods so
that's why nothing is happening so in
the next tutorial where we're going to
be doing is Adam some functionality to
this button and coding the do this
method so we're going to be learning how
to add a new scene and whenever we click
this button instead of doing nothing
because you know it's pretty cool right
now but we want to do something what we
want to do is be able to go to a new
scene so that's where in next tutorial
thank you for watching now I hope you
learned a little bit something and I'm
probably posting all this code on my
forum if you need this so anyways like I
said thanks for watching don't forget
grabbing I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
