video and in this tutorial what I want
to do is I want to talk to you guys
about sorting how to arrange elements in
your array from either lowest to highest
or highest the lowest and unfortunately
and see there's not a built-in function
to do that so we need to make our own
and there are many different techniques
that you can use to sort things I'm just
going to be showing you guys a really
simple example it's called a bubble sort
so we're going to be creating a random
array or excuse me an array of random
numbers we'll say like 10 numbers or
something
and then we'll sort it so the lowest or
the smallest numbers are at the top and
it goes from small to big or low to high
whatever you want to call it so let's go
ahead and get started
I just put int I temp and swap so
basically we're going to start with
three integer variables this I of course
is just accounting variable whenever we
use our loop this temp whenever we
switch one number with another number if
we just try to switch it all in one
shebang then one of the numbers is going
to get overwritten so that's why we need
this temp variable it's temporarily
going to store a number and the swap is
either going to be 0 or 1 and it just
keeps track of when are basically when
we're done sorting our list you guys are
going to see later on so now I'm just
keep things simple about how many I'm
going to set this equal to 10 but
basically this is the variable to say
how many elements are going to be in
your array I'm just going to have 10
numbers in it so of course 10 and I'll
say that um I'll say that I'm a coach of
a hockey team again since I love hockey
and I'm arranging all my players goals
from lowest to highest see who's the
best player so how many so I have an
array named goals and of course it's
going to have 10 different players in it
simple enough so far so the first thing
I want to do is actually create that
array which is going to be just random
number so great actually I won't even
add comments out comments whenever I
post a source code on my forum but for
now I'll just uh you know wow do not
want to do that my voice can be the
comments
so for I equals zero and then oh pi is
less than how many and of course I plus
plus so this array is going to loop ten
times and for each loop all we're going
to do is take that element and fill it
with a random number and we already
learned how to generate a random number
so put R and modulus o
well say that this is going to be from
like zero to twenty twenty five no one's
going to score more than twenty five
goals so do that plus one and of course
whenever you do this in real life you're
going to have like the data from a
database or a separate file or you can
even enter it manually but right now
what I have is just an array of twenty
five or excuse me ten different numbers
zero to twenty five so next thing I want
to do is just make a quick bit of code
just to print out the array so print
I'll just put original list new line and
we can actually use this loop again so
of course the print something out / f %
D which is going to be the element that
run and I messed up my breaking code
again ticking me off and goals so right
now all we did is we created a random
array right there and we just printed it
out so in this case this is our original
list we have 20 okay we have some
players that work too good this guy
scored 5 this guy score 2 and as you can
see this is kind of hard whenever you're
trying to look at your best players in
your worst because you got to find them
and pick them all out so it would be
really handy if we had a way to sort
this array that was kind of confusing
say from the least goals to the most all
right so let's learn how to do that
right now so the first new technique I
want to
talk to you guys about is called an
infinite loop and if you just put while
inside the condition put one now
whenever you have one right here one is
the same thing is true in programming so
this loop is going to continue forever
and ever and ever until you tell it to
stop and the only way that we can tell a
loop to stop is to add a break statement
so essentially what we're going to do is
we're going to say keep sorting this
list and sorting and sorting it and when
it's finally sorted we're going to add
that break statement and it's going to
say okay now it's time to quit and I'll
show you guys how to add that or where
to add that break statement later on so
the first thing we need to do is add
this swapped variable and set it equal
to zero so eventually what you're going
to see is whenever this swapped variable
equals zero at the end it pretty much
means that this list is sorted now when
it's not sorted we're going to set it
equal to one and it pretty much means do
the loop again kind of confusing now but
once I write a little bit of code you
guys are going to understand what I mean
so the first thing that I need to do is
actually copy this for loop and this is
going to be the main sorting algorithm
so I want to indent this alright so what
I'm going to say is for I equals zero
input I is less than how many minus 1 I
plus plus now the reason that we have
this for loop inside this main while
loop is this what we're going to do in
order to sort this loop is we're going
to take every number and actually I'll
run this right now is we're going to
take every number and compare it to the
number after it so we're basically going
to say compare 25 to two well this isn't
in the right order because we want the
smaller numbers at the top so switch
them so that's what this does it
compares every number to the number
after it so that's why I added this
negative 1 because the last number this
10 right here it doesn't have anything
after to compare it to so we can't just
go
eyes less than how many so what this
negative one does is it stops at the
second-to-last number so every number is
going to have something after it so the
next thing that we need to do inside
this for loop is this so like I said the
essence of this program is pretty much
going to take every number and check the
number after it and if the number is
bigger after it or excuse me if the
first number is bigger then it's going
to swap them so I'll show you guys how
to do that in code I'm a lot better just
writing code than I am talking but we're
going to say if goals I which is the
first number it's looking at is greater
than goals I plus 1 which is the number
after it then we want to switch them
because if this number the first number
is bigger we want to switch them because
the bigger numbers should be at bottom
and of course if you want to sort it
from highest to lowest then just switch
this around it'll work fine but now we
need to switch to numbers and it's not
as easy as it sounds what we need to do
is we need to well let me go ahead and
type this and then you guys are going to
see go I and was that goals or goals all
right now
set this equal to and those should be
square I don't know I put a I plus one
and just a second I'll explain
everything that's going on and plus one
is equal to 10 and set swopped equal to
one RA so apologize for keeping you guys
in anticipation but this bit right here
all of this code is responsible for
swapping one number with another number
now the reason that we just can't go
ahead and set the second number equal to
the position of the first one is because
whenever we do that the first number is
lost that gets overridden so what we
need to do is we need to take that first
number and store it in some temporary
variable temporary in you know
cyberspace so then we can take that
second number in the list and replace it
with the first one and then this
original one which was the first one put
it in the second spot and whenever we do
that we say ok we swap the number right
here swapped is equal to one now the
reason that we have this line of code is
whenever we say we did swap a number it
must mean that the list is not in order
yet so it needs to do it again
so you see how your for loop is right
here right outside this for loop we need
to add one more condition and that's if
swap is equal to zero then that's when
we need to add that break statement so
this is pretty much um complete the only
other thing we need to do or we don't
even need to do this but we probably
should is look at the sorted list and do
we need to add any more yeah let's go
ahead and just add this a new line clean
things up and check it out
so this was the original list 24 1012 a
obviously not in order and at the end we
get a nice sorted list small numbers at
the top big numbers at the bottom boom
check it out and let me guys talk you
through this code one last time so up
here you know what's going on we just
created a random array of 10 elements
number 0 to 25 we printed it out right
here so this was the original list
now what this hunk of code does right
here is the main meat of this tutorial
this variable just checks is the list
sorted or not so you I probably should
have called this sorted but swapped
works just as well
now the only time that is going to be
equal to 0 is if it is in order already
if it's not and you swapped elements
then it's going to set it equal to 1 of
course do the loop again now of course
we had a for loop in here which was
pretty much the brains behind everything
that took every single number and
compared it to the number after it and
it did that using this if statement
right here and said ok if the first
number is bigger change them around if
not leave a b and if it got to the end
of the entire list and it didn't swap
any numbers well then that means that
your list is in order and you're good to
go so once that happens we just printed
out the sorted list and boom so I know
that bubble sorts are kind of confusing
at first and like I said there are a
million different sorting techniques not
all like there isn't one that's the best
but this is probably the easiest one to
understand even though it seems kind of
confusing at first but if you don't
quite get it
then just look at the code break it down
piece by piece and after a couple
minutes you guys are going to understand
exactly what's going on but for now
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to oh oh got a freaking whooping cough
don't go subscribe and I'll see you guys
