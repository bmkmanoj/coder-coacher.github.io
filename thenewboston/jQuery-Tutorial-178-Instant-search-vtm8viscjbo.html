with a video tutorial for the new Boston
we're going to be taking a look at
combining jQuery and PHP to create a
instant search engine I guess and these
values are going to be taken from a
database now the first thing we're going
to take a look at is the database itself
so let's go over to PHP myadmin I have a
database called jQuery and a table here
called places now this has got seven
different records we have a unique place
ID which is an auto incrementing field
and integer field
we've got place which is the place that
we're going to be searching for in our
form here so for example when I'd start
to type elo n the record London would be
matched if I was to go ahead and type CH
for example in here we would have CH in
the Manchester so Manchester would
become a result as well as Chorley
because we've got a CH here so we're not
really creating anything that's
searching multiple keywords for example
in a description or in a keywords field
but you can go ahead and use PHP if you
if you understand the language to go
ahead and develop this further we're
just really going to be focusing on the
jQuery part of this and returning it
instantly as we type so now that you've
seen the records in the database let's
go ahead and actually start to search
for something and the first thing I'm
going to search for is London you'll
notice that when I start to type in here
we'll have this record returned
instantly and also some other dynamic
information such as the search results
let's go ahead and start type l the
first thing you'll notice is we have six
results returned
that's because L is contained within
these titles London felt and Charlie
Sheffield Leeds and Scotland we have L
in all of these when we start to go
ahead and filter this down you can see
that not only is the search that we're
typing in updating
but the results filter down as well so I
guess you could go ahead and implement
this in some kind of filter system once
you've performed a search but otherwise
if we go ahead and search for something
for example then Scotland you'll see we
return a result here again the example I
gave earlier if we search for CH this
returns two results because we've got CH
in Manchester and CH here and Chorley so
this is how the application works or the
the script works we're going to be doing
quite a bit of PHP development however
this can be integrated and used with
other development languages other
server-side languages so as long as
you're familiar with PHP data well my
sequel databases or MySQL databases and
some PHP you'll understand this however
obviously our main focus is returning
these instantly with jQuery so with the
example out of the way we can go ahead
and actually start to write this out
okay so over to our text editor we have
a few pages and I'm just going to
explain a little bit about watch eat
what each page does and how they link
with each other we've obviously got our
index dot PHP page which at the moment
is blank in our browser we don't have
any form elements and obviously we've
got our database just here which is you
know just well we'll go over to the
structure and take a look we've got
place ID which is an integer which isn't
extremely important but obviously we
have a primary key in our database place
is the obviously option or the text
we're going to be searching for and then
we just have a short description just to
fill in some of the results this all
happens or this is all displayed inside
index dot PHP so we're going to have a
form element which is an input field
with type text and then we're going to
have a div area underneath which is
going to display our results we have
search j/s which is going to handle the
key up event with regards to the input
field and we're going to need to include
this search dot JS file on our page so
we'll go ahead and do that now we do
this exactly the same as how we included
a query so Jas /j query all my
JavaScript files are kept in a folder
called J s the type for this is going to
be text forward slash JavaScript and the
source is J s /search j s you can see
this is located in the J's folder so
that is search J s so like I said this
this file is going to handle the keyup
event for the input field we're gonna
write in just a moment now search dot
PHP is the file that's going to be
called or the request the HTTP request
or Ajax request is going to be sent to
search dot PHP and search dot PHP is
going to work exactly like a normal PHP
script we're going to pass a variable
from search J input field value and that
will be picked up in search PHP will run
a few validation checks we're not
looking too much into PHP but this will
essentially just return the results from
the database and we have DB PHP which is
going to connect to our MySQL server and
then select our database ready for use
so the first thing we're going to go
ahead and do is design our form and the
div area that we're going to display
results in so what we really need is an
input field and this is type text and we
need to go ahead and give this an ID so
we can reference this inside jQuery or
in our j search jeaious file so the
input ID is going to be search now
underneath this we need an area where
our results are displayed so I'm gonna
create a div just here and I'm gonna
give it the ID search underscore results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
