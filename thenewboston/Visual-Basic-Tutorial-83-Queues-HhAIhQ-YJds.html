slash on live gamer for the new boss Tim
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking a look at Qs now cues like an
ArrayList is a collection now there are
a bunch of different collections in
visual basic such as hash tables their
stacks lists dictionaries order
dictionaries string collection bit or
write collections we'll go into some of
those but not all of those in these
tutorials so let's go ahead and take a
look at a queue so we'll go ahead and
click new project and we'll just name
this project collections because I'm
going to be looking at teaching you guys
several different collections using this
same project so go ahead and click OK
so we'll wait for that to load and now
we're going to do is we're going to view
the code for this and we will zoom in
some here so now we're going to do is we
are going to create a cue collection so
we'll type private and we'll just call
it Q and then we'll type as keyword then
we will use the new keyword and then
we'll type Q so what we did is we
created a private Q which can only be
accessed in form 1 and we used as new Q
which means that it is an object of Q
and if we can create as many Q's as you
as we want and they're going to be
independent of each other so what cues
do is it's a way of storing objects
because when you add an item to your Q
it takes the argument object and it uses
what's called FIFO or first-in first-out
such as a line at a ticket booth that
people start lining up and the first
person who got there is going to be the
first person to get their ticket and
then get out of there so let's go ahead
and add some stuff to our queue so we'll
type Q dot and to add something to our
queue we just type
and cue or we can't do that outside of a
sub so go ahead and double-click on form
one so when for more modes we will type
Q dot in Q now if you read the
description it says adds an object to
the end of the system that collection is
Q so it adds it to the end of our line
we'll just call a line because lines are
first in first out so since the end of
the line there is no there is nobody or
no object in front of this item this
will be the first one inside of our Q so
Q in Q and let's just see the first one
in our in our Q so we can add as many as
we want so we'll add two we'll add three
and we'll just add four
okay so now that we've added some stuff
to our queue it's going to be first in
first out so if we take something out of
our queue it's going to take out one and
then it will take out two so the way we
take stuff out is by typing qdq and it
says removes and returns the object at
the beginning of the system collections
queue so it's going to remove this
object right here or whatever object we
tell it to and we're just going to leave
this with nothing inside the parameters
so qdq is going to return the first
object which is one so now if we type
message box Q dot DQ and then we'll just
go ahead and convert that to a string
and then we go ahead and run this you
can see that we should get the value 2
because we started off by declaring our
queue we added the value of 1 to it then
2 then 3 then 4 then we DQ'd and since
it's first-in first-out it DQ's 1 and
then if we DQ the next one it's going to
be 2 it returns the value 2 to us and
then we just converted that to a string
now if you don't want to take the item
out of your queue and you just want to
look at it and without removing it you
can use Q dot P so let's go ahead and
run this and you can see that it gives
us 2 so it peaked at the value at the
next item in our list which is 2 now if
we type message box and then Q dot DQ
it's going to give us 2 as well because
when we typed peek it did not remove it
from our queue it just looked at it so
let's go ahead and run this we get 2 and
then we D q2 so queues are they can be
useful you may not find any practical
application for them when you're first
starting off but you may later on and
it's useful to know them so I'm practice
with some cues remember that they are
FIFO fi fo for a first-in first-out
and I want you to know how to make cues
and how to use them go ahead and move on
to the next tutorial and thanks for
