35th java tutorial and then this is
where we're finally going to be using
that cool robot I told you guys about
and then actually probably isn't as cool
as those robots you see on TV but as
pretty much is the same essential thing
a robot is something that does something
for you and our robot is going to take
our mouse cursor and move to the center
of a screen because we are too lazy to
so let's go ahead and add a little three
Center the mouse using robot that's a
nice little comment when you got one
thing misspelled and now let's go ahead
and make a method on this so it's going
to be of course be private synchronized
so nothing can run it same time
void in we have to name it re Center
Mouse nation you can actually name
something different but we already named
our method up here recenter Mouse so
let's go ahead and it's not going to
take any parameters just going to be a
little powerhouse that does something
and now let's go ahead and building this
the very first thing we need is our
window object so window W equals s dot
gets full screen window and now W is
equal to our entire screen and now let's
do a little check if the robot is not
equal to no so this make sure that we
set it equal to something which we did
all right here robot equals new robot
pretty much make sure it's set equal to
an object and arm window dot is showing
right here
so if we have our window popped up and
our robot is equal to an object now we
can continue what do we want to do well
what we want to do first is we need to
find the center of our screen because
we're going to be telling our mouse to
move the center of the screen and if we
don't have a center of our screen our
mouse is going to make dude you don't
even have a center of our screen and
you're telling me to move there
seriously so we don't want our mouse to
get that attitude with us so let's go
ahead and find center of X and how would
we find at the center of our screen X
location well what we can do is take the
window dot get with
and now that we have our entires in our
windows entire width all we have to do
is divide by 2 and that 2 is going to
give us after we make this a method and
when we divide by 2 we pretty much take
the width and split it in half so that's
the windows x center so now of course we
need to do this with y so censor y
equals window dot gets tight don't
forget to put height right here and put
2 and this is going to take the height
right here and it's going to find the
center of it so it's going to take the
height and split it in two and bam you
got your center so now what we need to
do is a couple more weird things swing
utilities to T's convert I need to type
the slope before I teach it convert
point to screen where you convert point
to screen all right now that I got that
typed and it took me a long time without
any arm typos here's what we need to do
put Center which is pretty much that
center point on your screen and for your
argument one put window right here and
now let me tell you guys what this
method does this is a built-in method
convert point to screen and what this
does is it first takes your point object
right here and it converts it to the
coordinates on this component right here
so this is how it can pretty much be
compatible with every screen it takes
your Center and converts it to the
coordinates on this so it's pretty much
just a coordinate converter that's all
it is and now what we need to do is
remember we have the booming method
called centering and it's set equal to
false well if we're running the recenter
mouse then this method probably is true
so and by probably I mean it is
centering equals true so only when we're
running this method is centering true
because if we're running this method
then our mouse is trying to center so
that's why we need to change that and
now last but not all last but not least
I mean last but not oh that's
embarrassing we can use our robot so now
with our robot we're going to say all
right
we are too lazy to move the mouse
ourselves so we're going to put mouse
move you do it for us move it to the
center of the screen exposition and also
the center of the screen Y position so
now it's going to take our mouse and
move it in the dead middle of the screen
right here so that's pretty much exactly
what we want to do and this is a way
aside from moving your mouse manually in
the middle screen we can get robots to
do it for us so if we can only get this
robot to build the rest of our program
for us we will be in good shape what we
can so we're going to go ahead and
continue in making it ourselves now all
we need to do for the rest of this
tutorial is implement our methods from
the interface mouse motion listener and
key listener right there because we want
to get rid of this dumb little error
right here that says add unimplemented
methods right there so let's go ahead
and do it first one let's go mouse
motion listener methods and for some
reason I spoke on my comments wrong I
don't know why but public void kispa
they are public void Mouse dragged my
drags and this is going to take mouse
event E and all we're going to do on
this method is it for dragging the mouse
just call a mouse move method and pass
it in because we don't want to have to
write the same code again so we're
pretty much just going to take this
brown or e and pass it into this method
right here which is public synchronized
void mouse moves
Mouse events II right there so now no
matter if you drag your mouse and remove
your mouse this is the code that's going
to happen and I'll write it at five time
so first we want to check alright if
your mouse is centering this feather
right yup if your mouse is centering and
the center X is equal to the mouse dots
get X Type O so far
all right good and center dot y is equal
to e dots get Y what do we want to do
and first of all for right what we go on
do your wondering all right what does
this mean if it's centering and the
center point on your screen is equal to
where your mouse is in the center point
on your screen is equal to where your
mouse is then that means that your mouse
is already in the center of your screen
so in this case you want to take
centering and set it equal to false so
if your mouse once your mouse hits the
middle of the screen we're done
centering we don't need to do any more
it can be false but what if your mouse
is not in the middle of your screen
what do you want to do so let's go ahead
and make a little else and we can make
code int d x equals e dots get X minus
Mouse dot X now now that I don't have
any typos I can explain this DX is
pretty much the distance your mouse move
it's pretty much where the mouse is
right now from where it was last time so
then you get the difference in of X so
now we need to do it for y so int dy and
set it equal to e dot get Y minus Mouse
dot y right there easy enough so now
what we want to do is now that we found
difference we want to actually change
the image that much so image X plus
equal to DX and image Y is plus equal to
dy
simple enough and now what we want to
call is three Center Mouse we want to
call that recenter method again just in
case and now after this we need to
change our mouse parameters
since the mouse that x point is now
equal to where the mouse is right now e
dot gets that would be X for X and mouse
dots Y is equal to where your mouse is
dots get Y so once we're doing
everything we need to move the image
appropriately what we want to do is set
our mouse points x and y equal to where
the mouse actually is e and that e is
the event that just happened so that's a
lot of information in the last tutorial
I'm going to be building a one last key
pressed method and we're going to be
going over this baby and watching it run
so thank you guys for watching and don't
forget to subscribe and now we'll see
you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
