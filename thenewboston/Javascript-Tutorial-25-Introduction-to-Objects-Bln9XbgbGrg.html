JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
we're gonna be learning how to create
objects and what objects are so what an
object is is pretty much a different way
to organize information in JavaScript
it's a lot easier well I'm not gonna say
either but it's different than a
variable and a lot of people think it's
a lot easier so I figured might as well
teach you now there are two ways that
you can actually make objects in
JavaScript and those are a constructor
function which we're going to be
learning how to do today or by using an
something called an object initializer
so let's go ahead and start with our
constructor function to build our first
object now I'm gonna be putting this in
the head of our document since we don't
really want to put it in the body
because we don't really want the user to
see it we just need it to tell the
browser what to do so go ahead and start
building your function by typing in the
word function let me move my mouse so
you can see it and let's uh make
computer why because computers are
always fun to play around with so right
now what we did right here is we defined
our function we have a function and
we're going to name it computer now in
the parameters we're gonna be filling in
those later but right now I'm just gonna
leave them empty
and right here inside your brackets this
is where all the properties go
so again define your function name it
whatever you want to name it I named
mine computer and inside here is where
the properties go now all of this right
here is the basic building ground for
your constructor function this is what
all the layouts are pretty much gonna
look like so now that I showed you what
it's going to look like let's go ahead
and fill this bad boy in the parameters
then I'm gonna use for my computer again
you can use any but um I want to give
mine something that has property so I'm
gonna go with drive for hard drive let's
go with the RAM and let's go with CPU
and what we need to do in our properties
is actually assign values to our
parameters right now we have parameters
but they don't really mean anything and
the computer doesn't really know what to
do with them
so to do this and to give kind of a
variable to them we need to use a
keyword called this how ironic and again
these are the things you can change but
this keyword this is a built in
JavaScript keyword and you cannot change
it at all so don't even think about it
so what we want to do is go ahead and
type this drive
equals and if you're wondering why we're
doing this we're gonna give a value to
this drive
so this drive is going to go ahead an
equal drive and if this sounds like a
extra step that you don't need to take
then complain the JavaScript so next we
want to do this Ram and we're gonna set
it equal to Ram and of course don't feel
like me and forget your semicolons and
less phenomenal all that's but not least
there we go little this CPU equals CPU
so what we did pretty much here is make
it a lot easier to work with so now
whenever we call CPU and knows exactly
what one we're talking about so before
we can actually stop start calling these
variables we need to make something
called an instance now this is uh let me
go let me show you the syntax for real
quick and then you guys will understand
it a lot more again in your head still
let me scroll down a little bit so you
can see we're gonna make a variable area
and we're gonna name this my new comp
for my new computer now after this you
want to go ahead and type the keyword
new and what this does is show
javascript in the browser that we're
gonna man we're gonna give this object a
new set of properties so we're gonna
type new computer so you type new and
then whatever your functions name is and
then inside those parameters you can go
ahead and type three new values so I'm
gonna go ahead and type let's type hard
because we want our drab to be hard and
let's type three gigabytes because
that's how much RAM we want and let's go
ahead and type Intel because that's what
kind of processor we want now as you can
see what we are doing is assigning new
values to our object right here here's
what we're pretty much saying we want
our drive to be hard for a hard drive we
want three gigabytes of RAM and we want
an Intel processor so if this all
doesn't really make sense to you right
now um I'm gonna stop my tutorial right
now because I'm taking up a bunch of
time but watch my next tutorial and
we'll put all this to use and everything
will just light up and you'll be in
there able to understand it like a piece
of cake so thanks for watching make sure
