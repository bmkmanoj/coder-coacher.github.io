your eighth C++ tutorial and in this
story I want to talk to you guys about
something called the if statement now
the if statement is a way where we can
have our program make very basic
decisions what we're going to be doing
is we're going to be giving our computer
program a test and it's going to run
that test if the test is true then it's
going to run a certain bit of code if
the test is false
then it's not going to run any bit of
code so depending on that test depends
whether we run coda or not so it sounds
confusing but it's actually incredibly
simple so let me go ahead and I'll show
you the syntax for if statement right
now the syntax to make an if statement
is I F you just go ahead and type the
word F and then go ahead and add
parenthesis now inside our parentheses
is where we're going to be making our
test now after those parentheses go
ahead and add curly braces now this is
called the body of the if statement and
now here is where we write the code to
run if the test is true so let's go
ahead and make a simple bit of code
let's go ahead and just write like C out
armed lucky is awesome
so if our test is true it's going to
print out Bucky is awesome on the screen
if the test is false it's not going to
print out anything so let's go ahead and
let me talk to you guys about the
different types of tests the first test
I want to show you guys is the greater
than test and this simply tests if one
value is greater than another value so
if v is greater than three go ahead and
run this code so 5 is indeed greater
than 3 so this is true so whenever we
build and run this it's going to say
Bucky is awesome pretty cool huh
so now let's go ahead and make something
like umm is 1 greater than 3 so it's
going to test this is 1 greater than 3
well this is actually false 1 is less
than 3 so it's not going to run this bit
of code
so go ahead build and run this and as
you can see it did not print out Bucky
is awesome on the screen how sad so of
course we have the greater than test we
obviously have the less than test
one lesson three well now this is going
to be true so it's going to print out
Bucky is awesome on the screen so let's
go ahead and run this and indeed it
prints out Bucky is awesome
so aside from greater than and less than
we also have these two tests greater
than or equals two so whenever we tested
whether three is greater than three this
test is going to be false because three
is not greater than three three is
actually equal to three well if we want
to test if three is greater than or
equal to three we use greater than with
the equal sign after it so now whenever
you run it is three greater than or
equal to three yes three is equal to
three so print it out Bucky is awesome
so aside from that we also have the less
than or equal to so if you know is one
less than or equal to three
yes one is less than three so it's going
to print out Bucky is awesome so again
what I want to show you guys is that you
have greater than less than greater than
or equals two and less than or equals
two so now those are called the
relational operators we also have two
more tests that we can do and these are
called the Equality operators this is a
really simple test it tests whether one
value is equal to another value or if
one value is not equal to another value
so in order to do this go ahead and
write is three equal to equal to three
and you might be thinking all right why
don't I just use one equal sign why
didn't they make it that way
well whenever we were creating variables
such as like int x equals eight the one
equal sign the single equal sign is
assigned for creating variables and
assigning values so that's why I decided
that two equal signs was sufficient for
testing so remember a common mistake is
to put one equal sign in there and
you're going to get an error or
something terrible is going to happen so
whenever you're testing you need two
equal signs so let's go ahead and run
this test is three equal to three well
yes it is so it's going to print out
Bucky is awesome I'll give it another
test like is seven equal to three well
no it's not so it's not going to print
out buck
is awesome so that is one test is called
the equal sign equal sign or equal to
test and there's one more test I want to
go over and that's explanation point
equal sign and this is the key word for
not equals to so is 8 not equal to or in
other words is 8 different than 8 well
no it's the same so it's not going to
print out everything is 10 different
than 8 well yes it is so that's going to
be true and it's going to print out
Bucky is awesome so that is all the
tests that I have for you guys and
that's all the tests in C++ again to
recap one last time greater than less
than greater than or equal to less than
or equal to equal and not equal so now
that we know all those tests I probably
should tell you guys this people
typically don't in by people I mean
computer programmers computer
programmers typically don't just test
two numbers against each other they
usually have variables that they test
against each other like int a equals 98
int B equals 76 and then they test
something like is a arm greater than B
well if we go ahead and run this 98 is
indeed greater than 76 so of course
that's true it's going to print out
Bucky is awesome and aside from that you
either have two variables to test or you
have a variable and a value like is 98
greater than 5 something like that we
can actually mix variables with values
and that would be true as well so again
you can either have two values in here
two variables or variable on one side
and value on another side pretty cool
huh
so that's the basics of again relational
operators are the greater than and less
than one and equality operators are the
equals equals in explanation point
equals so now that we know how to make a
basic if statement again to recap one
last time if your test and then the body
and it's going to run the test and if
that code is true is going to run the
body that's the basics of a if statement
now that we understand that we can begin
enhancing our program
a little bit more so in our next
tutorial what I'm going to be doing is
I'm going to be having the user enter
two numbers and we are going to be
comparing those numbers and depending on
what numbers they entered run a certain
bit of code so now as you can see we're
just building and building to our
knowledge of C++ to make better and
better programs so don't skip over if
statements because it's a huge part of
C++ so for now that's all I have for you
guys so thank you guys for watching in
the next tutorial
we're going to be building that
calculator thingy so it's going to be
awesome so thank you guys for watching
