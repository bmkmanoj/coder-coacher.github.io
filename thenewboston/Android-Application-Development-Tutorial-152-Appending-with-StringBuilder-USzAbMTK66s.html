tutorial for the new boss in and in this
tutorial hopefully you guys will
understand a little bit more about what
we're doing the first thing that we're
going to do is we're actually going to
add to this URL because before I just
want to show you guys it was a JSON type
URL we're going to add to it is a
question mark screen underscore name
equals and for example what we're going
to do is just copy this and go to a
browser I'm using Chrome just ordered
some pizza hutt but we're going to paste
it here then we're going to say our
username for example my bring back we're
going to type that in hit enter and this
is what it looks like this is what we're
reading and this is all of our
information now within this this is
basically all of my tweets doesn't
really look like it but it is so what we
can do is we can pull some of this
information according to the object
itself for example there's a the one
that we're going to refer to is if you
hit ctrl F and then type out text you
can see there's profile text color and
there's the actual text of a tweet which
is here's our most recent tweet so again
you can see all these different objects
here's our zero position which we're
grabbing this would be position 1
position 2 etc and then once we have
that position which we already set up
we're going to pull this kind of like
the section that's defining the text so
we're going to refer to this text here
and pull the information that it holds
so it's kind of you can kind of think of
it as like a key and value type thing so
we're pulling from the text of our
position 0 object and we're getting the
value of it I don't know if that makes
more sense to you but that's kind of
what we're doing so hopefully we get
something hopefully we get something
like you know I believe it is just for
mac sadly sad face
I mean remember that I don't tweet too
much I don't get on Twitter but that
that often I should say but anyways so
now we have you know our base URL and
then we just need to add a string name
to it so that's what we're going to do
in this tutorial again we have this JSON
object all we're going to do is we're
going to add to this string reference or
the string builder this is why we set up
the string builder so we're just going
to say URL and we're going to add to it
so we're going to say append and then
what we're going to add so what we're
going to add is whatever is being passed
in our username right so hopefully that
makes some sense again you know this
last tweet method takes a string within
it which is our username so what's going
to do is add our username to the end of
this URL and then after that it's just
going to go to or you know we're going
to call our get method we're going to
set up a response going to get the
information basically the JSON object at
position zero is probably the only new
thing that we're doing and you know also
getting the time line which sets up the
array for us all that stuff so hopefully
that makes a little bit more sense of
what we're doing now that you can
actually see what it looks like and
again this is just the browser like
Google Chrome type that in and it's kind
of the background stuff that's happening
the JavaScript object notation so now
what we're doing again is pulling that
object but we also want to pull that
text because you know that's the only
thing that's really important so what we
want to do is again we're going to set
up an async manager or async task type
class to read this JSON object or the
most recent JSON object in that URL so
again this kind of review but we're just
going to say public class
Reid extends async tasks it's been a
while I think since we use this but it's
good review here async task and then we
want a string reference anta juror and
another string and then we set it up and
we also have to you know import our
async tasks and add the unimplemented
methods so we're going to add that
method and we're also going to right
click go to source override implement
methods and we're also going to add this
or onpostexecute again nothing new there
we've covered all this stuff that's
probably all the time we have for this
tutorial we'll finish it up in the next
tutorial and probably do one more just
to get you guys again a little bit more
familiar with everything and I'll catch
you guys in and have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
