organic molecules found within a cell
the first major class is called
carbohydrates carbohydrates are sugars
and starches they have the general
formula C h2o in just me in as a
multiplier and is between three and six
so you can have c3h6 oh three c4h8 oh
four so on and so forth
carbohydrates are a very very important
energy source for your body they are
used in short term energy use the
biggest source of energy in your body
comes from a molecule called glucose
which is a sugar shown here but this is
the major source of energy for your body
this is what all your cells use to
create energy there are a couple of
different types of sugars you have a
monosaccharide which is a single sugar
glucose is an example of a
monosaccharide you have disaccharides
which are two individual monosaccharides
combined for example table sugar is
called sucrose which consists of at one
molecule of glucose and one molecule of
fructose polysaccharides are large
molecules composed of a bunch of
different monosaccharide units starch is
a polysaccharide of glucose molecules
and starches contain hundreds and
hundreds of molecules of glucose all
bound together the next class are called
lipids
these are fats and fat like substances
if you've ever watched Austin Powers you
will understand what I drew there but
his name is well I don't think I'm
allowed to say what his name is on this
video anyways fats are lipids are
involved in long-term energy storage
they are also involved in structure and
messengers such as hormones lipids are
generally insoluble in water when a
molecule is installed insoluble in water
it
is called hydrophobic but anyways this
is an example of a fatty acid as you can
see here you have a carboxyl group right
here and then a long chain of carbons
and hydrogen's this is called palmitic
acid another example of a lipid would be
cholesterol which is a steroid you can
see here cero is usually have this
structure a couple of rings and some
methyl groups a hydroxyl group right
here and most steroids act as hormones
cholesterol is found in your cellular
membranes and an actual lipid molecule
is an alcohol and a fatty acid most
lipids are tri glycerols glycerol is
this molecule right here it's got three
alcohols on it and attached to those
three alcohols will be three fatty acid
chains chains
excuse me such as palmitic acid next we
have proteins which are involved in
control and structure most proteins are
going to be enzymes or biological
catalysts proteins are composed of what
are called amino acids you can see here
you have your amino group right here and
then a carboxyl carboxylic acid group
right here the R is what it's called a
side chain all amino acids have the same
backbone they are differentiated by
their side chain amino acids come
together to form what are called
polypeptides and amino acids are joined
what are called a peptide bond what is
called a peptide bond whenever they come
together they are joined at the
n-terminus and the c-terminus they come
together and a water is lost and then
they form this peptide bond
whenever I explain advanced biochemistry
if I ever get that far then you'll learn
a lot more about that the last class of
organic compounds are nucleic acid these
are composed of nucleotides which
consists of a sugar a nitrogenous base
and a
fate the sugar is going to be either
ribose or deoxyribose which are five
carbon sugars I'll talk about the
differences between those whenever I go
into genetics later but the four
excuse me five bases are adenine thymine
cytosine guanine and uracil nucleic
acids are responsible for passing
heredity information from one generation
to another they're involved in protein
synthesis and energy transport energy
transfer excuse me DNA is
deoxyribonucleic acid this is the main
molecule responsible for container let
responsible for passing heredity
information on RNA is involved in
protein synthesis and energy transfer
molecules you have ATP which is
adenosine triphosphate contains the
molecule adenine and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide which also contains
the molecule adenine and both of these
contain the sugar ribose but that's all
I have for biochemistry and organic
chemistry right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
