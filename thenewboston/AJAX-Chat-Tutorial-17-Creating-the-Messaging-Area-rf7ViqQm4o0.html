tutorial and in this video we're going
to go ahead and knock out the HTML file
so file new and I'm just going to go
ahead and name this
let's see file save as index.html boom
roasted and of course what we need to do
now is we can actually yeah but you
might as well just go ahead and get rid
of that now actually I'll leave it open
I have to show you guys something there
we go
chat CSS alright the first thing we want
to do is we want to make our doctype so
we're just going to make a html5 style
doctype keep things very simple and now
let's do all our boring stuff HTML too
lazy to type that again HTML and
actually I usually hate dealing with a
head but we actually do need to include
some important things in here so head
head and body and Zippity okay now in
the head the first thing we want to do
is we want to link to this CSS file see
good thing I open that already used it
already so in order to do that we just
say hey we want to link href and then in
the file is just set chat dot CSS and
it's a stylesheet and the type equals
low nots type
it's so embarrassing typing equals text
dot or excuse me - CSS and we can go
ahead and put the closing tags I don't
think you need to put this little thing
with html5 but you know it's habit it's
not going to hurt anything now that we
looked at the CSS file we need to link
to one more file and then of course the
javascript file that we did not create
yet so script type equals
javascript and the source I'm going to
go ahead and name this file chat dot J s
and now we can go ahead and end it and a
boom look at that the head is complete
once I can I'm going to positive R right
now I'm back I just had a coffin it was
a pretty gross one and I did not think
that you guys wanted to listen to it so
remember in the head the only thing we
did is we linked to the CSS stylesheet
and also the JavaScript file which is
the one last file that we have to create
still so now we can go ahead and enter
the body and create all the cool stuff
but before we start creating all the
tables and everything what I want to do
is I want to add one attribute to the
opening body tag and that's the on load
on attribute and what this does is I'm
going to go ahead and type in it now of
course as soon as the body loads it's
going to call this init function which
is of course I'm going to be well
remember this what we're doing right
here is we're pretty much including this
javascript file in this file so when it
calls this init function it's going to
look above and it's going to find it in
this javascript file so we have to
remember later on to create an init
function and what this is going to do is
just initialize everything that's what
it stands for and pretty much get our
chat room up and going and we're going
to see more about this later on but for
now just want to you know tell you guys
what it does but for now let's go ahead
and create the good stuff the table all
of this crap right here so just to give
you guys a real brief overview so you
guys know what's going on obviously this
is a table and it has two pieces of data
it has one row as you can see and two
pieces of data and it here's a piece of
data here's a piece of data now under
the table we have another div element so
this entire thing right here is a div
element where it says guests in your
form so again table div element just
remember that for right now so the table
we're going to create right here and
we'll be creating a development right
under here soon enough but the first
thing I want to do is I want to remember
this table has an ID of content so let's
go ahead and put ID equals content and
now the table has you know a border one
pixel solid black and it also has a
margin bottom of 10 pixels so that's why
this little div element or the form
isn't butted up directly against the
table so that's what you know that's how
that all ties together so now the first
thing I want to do is I want to add
those two pieces of data but in order to
do that we need to stick them in side
table rows so we have one row which has
two pieces of data table data should
just do this
table data now this first piece of data
is going to be this left-hand side this
um scroll area and the other piece of
data is going to be this color picker so
this is actually really easy div
remember the ID of this was scroll so
give this div the ID of scroll and in
that div now the reason that this is so
easy and you guys maybe think this wow
that was really easy slap your hands
together pat yourself on the back but
usually whenever you're designing a
program like this the easier is to
design in your HTML file the harder is
to design in your JavaScript file
because remember the scroll area is
going to be the area that always is
always updating is the leading messages
is displaying new messages and we have
to do that all programmatically through
JavaScript so for right now we just put
a blank you know ID scrolled in there so
if we ran it right now nothing would
display but later on whenever working
you know in our JavaScript file this
thing is going to be basically where
we're doing most of our programming and
making this change dynamically depending
on you know how the server updates it so
this next piece of table data is
actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
