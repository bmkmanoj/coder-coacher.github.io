tutorial for the new Boston and the
reason I showed you that previous
tutorial will Rita have a configuration
is that our on update method gets called
but if we add that configuration back in
the on update method won't be called
until you know the first time it is
called so like within 30 minutes of
putting the widget on the phone so again
we're just gonna add that configuration
class back in again we just have to
refer to our package name comm dot the
new Boston Travis or whatever you guys
it's package name is and then our class
name that holds configuration which I
called widget config and that will get
our configuration going so now what we
want to do is we want to go into our
configuration class and setup you know
set this up again our configuration
class is going to be activity that gets
launched when you know the widget is
placed on the home screen so again it's
going to be activity so we're just gonna
say extends activity and we're also
going to use a click listener on click
listener because again we have that
button so we're just gonna implement
that now all right and then just we have
to add our imports and add our
unimplemented methods for click listener
and we also want to add again you know
the oncreate method pretty general to
everything else we've done so far so we
just add that in there and we're gonna
set a Content view to our configuration
layout so set content view in our dot
layout that widget configuration or
config we have our layout setup now
we're going to set up our button within
that layout again nothing new here just
gonna call this button be find view by D
widget config was the reference name can
add our imports and set our
onclicklistener
to this because we implemented it
alright and we're also going to add a
few variables to our class our whole
class can use so above our on create
method we're gonna set up an edit text
to get basically the text again that
we're gonna you know the textview name
that we're in a set so we're just gonna
call this info something like that and
we're also going to set up a app widget
manager which I'll explain what that
does here in a second but we're just
gonna call this a WM for app widget
manager and we're also gonna create a
context which is going to just be the
context of this class we're gonna set up
at a end that's gonna be our app widget
ID so again we're just gonna say aw ID
we kind of did this in the previous
tutorials well just add all our imports
and what alright guys so I clipped the
video because when I implemented the
onclicklistener is coming from the
dialog class so that won't register with
a button that's why I was getting that
err so I just deleted those imports and
then did it again made sure that it came
from the view class so make sure you
have this onclicklistener that but just
if you guys thought I like skipped it I
wanted to include that as well so and
then what we're going to do is we're
going to relate to the context of this
class and set that equal to this
variable up here that we created so
we're just gonna say C equals again our
class name which is widget config and
we're just gonna say dot this and let's
also set up our edit text that we
created which was called info or just
can set this equal to new edit text
again nothing new here for yes ET widget
config was the reference name that we
created now what we're gonna do now is
just get some information from which
widget called this configuration to to
start up so how we do that is by
creating an intent because again an
intent is opening this class and we're
gonna call that and we're just gonna set
that equal to get intent and again add
our imports and we're also going to
create a bundle you can kind of review
for yes we're gonna set this equal to
our intent and we're just gonna get the
extras from that intent that has passed
you know that that we got the
information from and all we're gonna say
is if extras is equal to null which we
want it to be so our extras which again
is our bundle that's being passed in is
not equal to null basically going to get
the reference from our app widget ID so
we're gonna say app widget ID is equal
to the extras that's being passed in
because again if it's not null we're
just going to get the intent or I'm
sorry get the integer and we're going to
refer to we're going to refer to the app
widget manager class
we're gonna say dot extras or extra app
widget ID and we're gonna give it a
comma I'm just gonna hit enter to go
down to the next line give us some space
to work and for a second parameter we're
gonna say app widget manager again I'm
gonna refer to invalid app widget ID and
then we just gotta close off our our get
int method there so what we're doing is
we're just getting the ID and we want to
make sure there is an ID that's being
passed in otherwise we can't you really
do anything with this widget so it's
just kind of a way to check that so a
way to check which widget started this
class so that's all we pretty much did I
know it's kind of confusing a little bit
I mean we've covered a lot of the
concepts already but you might want to
just leave a comments a getting info
about the widget that launched this
activity and that's pretty much it for
this
this tutorial will probably I'll
probably go over this stuff a little bit
more thoroughly but I just want to make
sure we're all set up and ready to start
programming this configuration class and
I'll catch you guys in the next one have
a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
