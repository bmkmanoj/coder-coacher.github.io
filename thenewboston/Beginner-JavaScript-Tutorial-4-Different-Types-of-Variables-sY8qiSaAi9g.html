your fourth JavaScript tutorial and in
this tutorial I'm going to talk to you
guys about all the different types of
variables that we can use when working
with JavaScript so the first type I want
to talk to you guys about is what I
showed you guys before and that's just
basic numbers so go ahead and let's make
a variable I'm going to call my tuna
because I love tuna why not and set it
equal to your favorite number mine is 20
and then go ahead and this is a
statement so we need to end up with a
semicolon and then on the next line
let's go ahead and print this out so if
you remember that the way that we print
out things in JavaScript is document dot
write and then inside parentheses we go
ahead and write the variable name which
is tuna and then go ahead and press
semicolon and now whenever we see it on
our web page it prints out that variable
so we can see already that you can set
numbers equal to variables but what you
didn't know is that you can also set
numbers with decimal points equal to
variables so go ahead and add the
decimal points your number save it and
then go ahead and see what happens
so aside with whole real numbers
javascript can also work with decimals
as well and if you're wondering this
alright can JavaScript also work with
negative numbers well let's go ahead and
see go ahead and type a negative number
in there and yes it's true my friends
JavaScript can handle negative numbers
perfectly so basically any number that
you would want to work with in computer
programming JavaScript can handle so now
that we cover numbers let's go to the
next thing and that is text now text in
JavaScript and in all computer
programming languages is actually called
strings why they named it that I don't
know maybe it's because a string of
letters put together who knows don't
blame me blame whoever made JavaScript
but anyways if you want to set a
variable equal to a string of text go
ahead and set it equal to quotation
marks and then go ahead and type your
text in here now go ahead and save this
and see what happens it prints out
whatever text was in there
so again if you ever want to set a
variable equal to you know a sentence or
word or just a little bit of text you
need to add those double quotation marks
and the reasoning behind that is if you
set it equal to something like tuna
equals text and you don't have the
quotation marks javascript is going to
think that you have a variable right
here and you're trying to set equal to
another variable called text so that is
why you need your quotation mark to say
no this isn't another variable it's
actually a word or a sentence or
something like that so once you do this
it'll work fine basically don't forget
to include the quotation marks so now a
little problem pops up and that's what
if you're you know want to have variable
and set it equal to you know a saying or
something like John said boy do I love
Bessie well woah why stuff turning blue
and anyway so let's go ahead and save
this and see what we want it doesn't
work at all in the reasoning behind this
is because your entire string of text
needs to be in between quotation marks
so it's going to say all right you have
tuna you have a quotation mark here you
have your ending quotation mark here and
this is what I'm going to set equal to
but what the heck is all this stuff if
you already gave me two quotation marks
well actually JavaScript is not smart
enough to know that this is a saying and
that this is actually part of the
variable so in order to tell JavaScript
that all right these quotation marks
here are supposed to be inside the
variable itself we need to add something
called an escape character now what an
escape character does is it takes the
next character and it pretty much treats
it as a regular piece of text so this
and this are escape characters now
JavaScript knows that this and this are
the two quotation marks and everything
in between here
is just going to be basically your
variable so go ahead and save this and
now we get our quotation marks to pop up
John said boy do I love Bessie and he
really does by the way
Bessie's the cow not you know a regular
cow like a dairy cow not making fun of
anyone in here right anyways on with
this story so anyways if you ever need
to escape something then that is the you
know that's the symbol you use a
backslash so there are different things
that we need to escape but I'll teach
you guys those as we come across them
now let's go ahead and delete all this
and let me talk to you guys about two
different types of variables so we
already learned about numbers and we
already learned about texts aka strings
so there are two other types of
variables that I want to talk to you
guys about and the first one is called
boolean or boolean however you say and
that's the word true and the world in
the world I keep saying world like the
earth and the word false now I'm not
going to go over boolean right now but
just remember that they have special
meaning in JavaScript so that's why
whenever you you know you might be
looking at a program and it sells true
or false then that is how you make a
boolean but again don't even worry about
it right now I shouldn't have even said
anything but now that I'm going to
confuse it I might as well mention this
the fourth type of variable is called no
and whenever you set something equal to
null it means that it has no value at
all and this is different than zero it's
completely different than 0 or 0.0 know
is pretty much like an empty variable in
again just with true and false
you'll be seeing what these do later on
but for now I just wanted to cover all
the different types of variables so I
had to include it but anyways I didn't
mean to confuse you just remember that
you can use numbers and if you use
letters then go ahead and put them in
between quotation marks so once you
understand that we're ready to move on
to the next tutorial so anyways thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
watch the next tutorial
and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
