Blackford here another Photoshop cs6
tutorial today we're gonna I'm going to
go over a quick tip with you about
moving your channel mass between
documents and it's pretty easy so if
you've got a channel mess that you've
created in a document and you want to
bring it over to another document I'm
going to show you how to do that in case
you need to know how to do it this is
pretty handy if you have like a text
channel mask and you want to bring it
into two separate documents that way you
don't have to keep on making new masks
so let's get started the first thing
you're going to need to do is make sure
you have a document with a channel mask
in it and of course we have a channel
mass going on here and if you're not
sure how to make a channel mask check
out a few tutorials back where I teach
you how to make one it's a really easy
so and it's only a couple minute
tutorial so just go ahead and check that
out so we've got our channel mask here
and this one here this document here
does not have a channel mask so go up to
a window we need to put these side by
side so let's arrange these so that
these are side by side and go ahead into
your document that has the channel mask
and just drag the channel mask into the
other document and now if we look at
this document here with the cherries you
can see that the channel mass that I
made is in there now and that's all you
do it is simple and really easy and that
was the quick tip I wanted to show you
and I'm not going to waste any more time
coming because it was supposed to be
quick so see you guys later and check
out the next tutorial combining channel
masks so see you there bye hey everybody
what is up today today in this tutorial
we're going to learn how to combine
channel masks and that's basically just
taking to channel masks and creating one
channel mask out of both of them that
both of the masks are combined into so
let's go ahead and get started the first
thing you need to do is make sure that
you have to channel masks now I've got
this channel mask here about what of the
moon and then I've got a channel mask of
this text that says the moon is
nice so what I wanted to do is have both
of these ghosts on one so let's go ahead
and turn with turn on RGB on real quick
now we're going to control click on one
of the masks now that's going to create
a selection for us and that's what we
want the next thing that we're going to
do is we're going to hold ctrl and shift
and then click on the other mask now
we've got both of the selections up and
now we're able to proceed to the next
step or we can create our next channel
mask and all we need to do is click on
the create mass button especially called
save selection as channel so click on
that and now we've got our fall in here
by technophile so our deselect and then
go ahead and ctrl and click on this it's
going to select both of them so now
we've got our two separate masks and
then we've got our combined mask it's a
pretty easy and easy as pie and if you
need to do that and now you know how so
thanks for watching this one about
combining channel masks remember control
click on your first one and then ctrl
click or control shift click on your
second one and then come down here to
where you're going to save your
selection and it creates your new one
for you so thanks for watching this one
everybody hope you learned something
