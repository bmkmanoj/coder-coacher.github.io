of all before I get to the tutorial I
want to mention that the Powerball
drawing was tonight 950 million and I
did not win so here I am and here's the
cool thing though so right now it's 1:30
a.m. and I'm looking at the results and
it looks like no one else wanted yet so
the next strong is gonna be for like 1.5
billion dollars so I don't know this has
nothing to do with programming but I
just think it's cool that a lottery is
up that much not that I encourage
gambling but go out and buy some tickets
alright so enough to be talking about my
gambling addiction so what I'm going to
do first is I'm going to show you guys
how to delete a file so right now I just
have one file in here bacon dot text and
to delete a file it's actually really
easy just right de el and then the name
of the file so delete bacon text and now
if you're a dir again that file is
deleted so again that's de L stands for
delete obviously and then your file name
now let me go ahead and create another
problem just create like a lalala let me
create that bacon nut txt file again and
I just wrote a la Lala in it so what I
want to do now is I want to show you
guys how to read the contents of a file
so let's just say that we want it to
read was inside bacon dot text how would
we do that
and display it in the command prompt
well if you just write type and then the
file name what this is going to do is is
pretty much going to go in your file and
print out or display whatever is inside
so if you don't actually want to open up
notepad or any program like that you
just want to read it from the command
line there you go
lalalalala now another cool trick and
this is how you actually overwrite a
file so let's say that lalalalala okay I
just type that as something temporary
but what I really want in bacon out text
is I don't know something else so what I
can do is this
I can echo um
like Bucky whatever I shall write the
new Boston so I will actually want the
word the new Boston in bacon out of text
so what I can do is this if I write
something like this just like I'm
creating the file over again then watch
what happens
type bacon not text that lalalalala
changes to whatever I said so basically
the way that you create a file we
already learned before just echo
something to your file now if you do
that again what it's going to do is it's
not just going to take the word the new
Boston and stick it onto the end of
bacon out text it's actually going to
overwrite the entire file but now you're
probably scratching your head and
thinking ah right so that's how you can
pretty much over read file but what if I
actually just wanted to add you know
another line or some more content onto
the end of the file
well let's say that we wanted to add the
word I don't know tuna fish onto that
file what we can do is write echo tuna
fish and you know before whenever we're
just creating or overriding file we use
the single greater than sign well if you
use a double greater-than sign instead
of overriding it it actually appends to
it so it means keep the current content
in there but just stick the word tuna
fish on the end so bacon nut text and
now if i just type bacon out text check
it out
so it didn't delete was already in there
it kept the new Boston but appended tuna
fish right like that so that's the
difference between a single greater than
sign in the double greater-than sign
it's you know a slight difference but
very important now the last thing I want
to show you guys is this let me just
clear out of there what you can actually
do is you can actually take the output
or results of these commands so for
example let's say you wanted to ran the
command dir you see all of this text
right here all the results volume and
drive sea yadda yadda all of this
well what if we actually want to take
this and save it to a text file well we
can open up notepad and we can start
typing it in
or what we can do is this so instead of
like echo Bucky and then writing this to
a filename we can actually do is type a
command name like dir and you can take
this and output it to a file name just
like you were echoing something so let's
do this and what this is going to do is
it's going to run the dirt band and it's
going to get the results of this which
was that huge chunk of text that you
just saw and it's going to save that in
porky dot text so let's just go ahead
and type porky text check it out pretty
sweet and if we look at this in let's
just open this with I don't know notepad
plus plus actually yeah let's go ahead
and do that then check it out and get
rid of this other stuff all right
so check it out so pretty cool that
ladies and gentlemen is how you can
delete a file and also how you can
create a new file
aka override one a pen to one and how
you can take the results of any command
and save it to a file so pretty handy
we're in pretty you know experience with
command line but now I'm gonna go check
on Powerball again and make sure for
certain no one won my 1.5 billion
dollars so yeah thanks for watching I
will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
