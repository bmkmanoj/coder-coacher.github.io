tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching you how to add an element
to an array now like before when we went
over an arrays in the last tutorial you
see we just typed the arrays one after
another after another and to add an
element we can do one of two things we
can just go in here and type our next
element or we can do something that's a
lot easier so let me go ahead and make a
simple array now let's just start from
scratch actually will make another array
called name and for the parameter zero
we'll set it equal to Tom and then I'm
just add a couple here name um we'll
give this parameter one and I'll set it
equal to Craig and for the last one name
parameter 2 equals like
so now we have an an array with three
values 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 2 with 3 different names
let's say we're typing the line we got
some code later on and we want to add
another value to an array but we don't
want to add it right here you'll see why
this is useful later on I know looks
worth us right now but to do this you
can do this in two two different ways so
say we echo it on the screen we echo a
name 0 and this is going to give us of
course when we echo the value of Tom
because it's in 0 let's say we wanted to
add another element to the array all we
need to do is simply type in our next
element which would be 3 and we can add
an element right there says Matt
so now we have a third element in our
array we can of course go down and use
that so now our array has four elements
and this is how you add elements to an
array when you're not directly working
on the array and this is useful when
you're later down on the code and
another way to do this for some people
if they don't know the number of the
array so you've got a long string of an
array top and you just want to add it to
the end but you don't know what the
number is
you can put an empty - empty brackets
and this will automatically give the
value of 3 which is the forth on letting
the array of man and you don't have to
know the number or anything what two
empty brackets does again is
automatically put this element in the
last value of the array so it does all
the work for you pretty much and the
last thing I want to talk to you guys
about is how to replace an element so we
got this right here and as you can see
when we echoed the word Tom came up but
say we don't want it to be Tom anymore
say we want zero to be the name Bucky
and as you can see we have two right
here this ends PHP rates reads from top
to bottom says all right this is 0-1 to
echo that and then it says all right now
this is telling us we got a new value
for 0 now so forget about the old one
we've got a new value so let's just see
what happens when we echo the name 0
remember it was Tom before but now we
tried to change it so let's save that
and as you can see the first time we
echoed it was Tom but the next time when
we changed it it was Bucky just like we
wanted to so this just simply typing in
again replaces the element in our array
but keeps all the other ones the same
and to use this in an associative array
all you need to do let's get rid of this
so we have an associative array with
some text actually will use one we did
before we'll type in fingers and we will
set it equal to hand
and now if we had another value we could
exchange that for our new value so say
we had um well let's say we had got rid
of this and say we had a societal array
a launching at X up here the empty
bracket in the hand would add the value
hand to the end of the array so again to
use an associative array just instead of
a number in your bracket just type in
some text and it'll give that value a
new value with the associative array and
again all of this is how you add an
element and how you can modify an
element in your associative arrays and
this will be a lot more clear when I'm
actually using it in something useful
and just not typing a blank associative
array with nothing to do with it nothing
to do with its heart so if you watch my
next tutorials this will all start
making a lot more sense things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
