Effects tutorial and in this tutorial
I'm going to be going over something
called motion pass and a motion path is
a path that allows motion
wouldn't I guess that would you so let's
go ahead and enough with the small talk
let's go ahead and get started the first
thing I want to do is go ahead and
instead of this one view go ahead and
create two views on horizontal and go
ahead and just resize your box so you
can see them all you can use your little
rollerball oh I don't even know it's
called between your mouse buttons and
hopefully you're not using a Mac and if
you don't have that little rollerball
then I don't know what to do
and another thing excuse me if I go kind
of slow today I just ordered a bunch of
little stickers for my keyboard to tell
you what every shortcut is on After
Effects so my keyboards like 800
different colors right now and it's kind
of hard to see but anyways enough of
goofing around let's get started with
this tutorial I'm the first thing we
need is a layer so I actually feel like
making a text layer so I've got a layer
new text and I just feel like you know
make it on today because I haven't in a
while and I'm going to name it be for
Bucky I'm going to size it up a bit so
now we have this layer that's just
chilling here named B and of course we
want to work with 3d so let's go ahead
and click our little three checkbox and
I like to set this view to active camera
and I like to set this view either to
left or right so let's go ahead and put
it actually let's go ahead and put the
right feel more comfortable I'm
right-handed does it have anything to do
with it mm I'll let you be the judge but
let's go ahead and we're going to be
working with position really someone's
calling me right now
put on a second I'll pause this alright
guys I was just one of my friends
calling me at midnight wanting to steal
my badge for work
anyways that is irrelevant what we are
here to talk about today is animating
position so let's go ahead and click
this little checkbox right here and
let's go ahead and move this one all the
way back like this and the next thing we
want to do is move ahead to like two
seconds or something and then we want to
move this up a little bit and towards us
right there it looks nice and as you can
see from this right angle you can see
well the right viewing from the active
angle you can see the front view of it
so let's go ahead and move this to four
and we hopefully give this a little
roller coaster effect right here and
then we'll end it at six or something
like that like this and this brings me
to another point anytime you want to
edit your I think they're called busier
handles or something I call them curbing
sandals just go ahead and those are
these little dots right here and if you
can't see them go ahead and click the
anchor point and what this is going to
allow you to do is just the curviness of
your image so make sure you got that
selected got to grab it ah there we go
got it so once you edit those you're
able to edit the curviness
arm thing gonna sneeze ooh oh thank you
and oh if I said bless you
the curviness of your image so let's go
ahead and in see our final animation
up-and-down
in up again I shouldn't have make that
took so long so again that is how you
edit a basic 3d animation again with two
views is the best um if you want to work
with four views it may be even easier
even though these are all the same views
right here maybe going from the left and
this one from the top or something like
that but um again maybe that's not
easier maybe that's just more confusing
but another thing that I want to point
out after I change my views back I'm the
last thing I want to talk to you guys
about is something called all Auto
orienting excuse me so let's go ahead
and select this layer put layer um
transform audio Auto Orient and click OK
and as you can tell what this does is
allows your animation to orient along
the path and accidentally add another
keyframe right there but that's
irrelevant and you can really tell
what's going on in this one right here
what it's doing is your letter or layer
is orienting along the path now there
are a couple errors about this but you
can fix them easy if you could tell that
your B is flipped around it looks like a
D now but anyways I just wanted to show
you guys that this option is out there
and in some cases you want it to orient
along the path images instead of just
straight staying straight up and down
the whole time so um that's up up there
and if you can't figure out how to fix
that simple error then well you
shouldn't be using After Effects by now
so on this app for this tutorial I'm
kind of rambling on so in the next
tutorial I'm going to be showing you
well I don't even know what I'm going to
be showing you but I guarantee it's
awesome and yes as a guarantee so um
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe to my channel and I am
going to store to buy some food so I
will see you next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
