basically the quick to second overview
of the interface of course there's a lot
of other stuff but like I said I'm going
to be covering those as we need them as
not to overwhelm you guys right now so
what I'm going to teach you guys right
now are just little tips that I don't
you guys are probably going to thank me
for because they're just going to make
your experience developing apps a whole
lot better first is if you go to help
and you scroll down to default key map
references let me actually minimize this
although I don't think I don't matter
what it's going to do is it's going to
give you a PDF of all of the keyboard
shortcuts that you can use for the
program so again of course I'm not going
to go over any of these right now
because that would just be dumb and
boring so instead what I recommend is
actually printing this out laminating it
and putting it on every single wall in
your room because these are incredibly
useful and you're going to be using them
a lot but actually for these tutorials I
don't like to use keyboard shortcuts
because if like a window pops up and
then you guys just see my mouse in the
same place like okay how the heck did
you do that and I don't know it just
gets confusing whenever I'm teaching but
they will be useful to you now another
thing that I want to show you guys that
probably a lot of you guys are itching
to do is change the theme of your entire
Android studio I know a lot of you like
a dark theme so let me show you how to
do that right now if you go to file
settings and this was something else all
right
so file settings and if you go to
appearance and then theme by default
this is IntelliJ or whatever it is
windows one is pretty much a lighter
theme but the fonts a little bit
different in dark ela I don't want to
change it because my screen recorder is
probably going to tweak out if I change
the entire theme but right now I'm going
to keep this one because I love it dark
EULA is the dark one that you guys might
be looking for Windows if you like
really ugly stupid looking font then you
can choose that too
so of course
to this you would just hit apply then ok
but I like mine so I'm just gonna can't
actually while I'm in here I'll talk to
you guys about a few more things alright
so first of all usually I'm moving back
out of here so you guys can see what I'm
talking what I'm about to teach you all
right so first of all whenever we're
working with a text file just go ahead
and click any Java file to open up we're
not going to be talking about the source
code right now but I'm going to be
showing you guys some useful things of
how to actually work with it as you can
see the gutter on the left-hand side for
some reason and I'm not sure why but
every IDE in every text editor pretty
much that I ever download it it doesn't
show the line numbers by default I have
no idea why they do that because I
always love looking at the line numbers
so to display the line numbers on this
one it's actually really easy just right
click anywhere in the gutter that's the
gray area and click show line numbers
pretty sweet check that out now another
thing that I absolutely hate is this
code folding that's pretty much when you
have a bunch of code like an entire body
of a function or this right here and it
bunches it up for you now the reason I
hate this is because I love looking at
all of the code and also for the
tutorials if you guys are trying to copy
the source code and you're like okay I
need to know he imported but oh that's
great it's all bunched up it's really
annoying even to me and I'm sure it's
even more annoying to you so if you want
to get rid of all of the code folding as
it's called go to file in back in
settings - make sure I see everything
and go to cult or excuse me that's
console folding go to editor under the
IDE settings and code folding and right
here this first checkbox is just to show
the code folding outline and that's that
little arrow you can click to either
bunch it up or expand it but what I want
to do is I want to uncheck all of these
so none of my code is going to be folded
again once I apply this
as you can see my actual area that my
mom that you guys can see may be a
little bit bigger but whenever you guys
are trying to read my source code in the
soils then it's going to make it a whole
lot easier so again I highly recommend
putting the line numbers on by
right-clicking showing line numbers and
getting rid of code forwarding because I
absolutely hate it personal preference
but you know I've got to encourage you
guys to do the same so in the next
couple tutorials now that we are kind of
more familiar with interface we can get
into the good stuff actually creating an
app the interface and well it's going to
be awesome so for now thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and I
will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
