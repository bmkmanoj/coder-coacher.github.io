welcome to your sixth physics tutorial
in this tutorial I'm gonna be talking
about division in scientific notation
but before I even begin that I want to
mention that as you guys might be able
to hear right now there is a huge
thunderstorm going on that's on my
apartment so you know I just wanted to
tell you guys in case I don't even know
if I'm gonna make it through this
tutorial before my computer shuts off
but if I do I just want to let you guys
know that you know there isn't car-crash
going on outside it's just thunder so
you know probably didn't even need to
tell you that but I did anyway so let's
go ahead and jump into division with
scientific notation so just like
multiplication we need to pull this
number and this number first so let's go
ahead and do that right now so seven
point six two times ten to the third
divided by two point one times ten to
the fifth equals seven point six two
divided by two point one and then we go
ahead and once we figure that out we
need to multiply that by this divided by
that so we have 10 to the third divided
by 10 to the fifth so let's go ahead and
figure out each side of this equation
seven point six two divided by two point
one is three point six two nine now what
we need to do in order to figure out 10
to the third divided by 10 to the fifth
the kind of shortcut for this is 10 to
the 3 minus 5 now 3 minus 5 this goes
ahead and stays the same 3 minus 5 is of
course negative 2 so now we have a 3
point 6 to 9
times 10 to the negative 2 and check it
out that is already in perfect
scientific notation form so that's our
final answer right there 6 point I mean
excuse me I can't even read today 3
point 6 to 9 times 10 to the negative 2
pretty cool huh
so now let's go ahead and jump into
another example using a negative yeah
it's gonna happen a lot and you know
what I noticed I don't know if you guys
care about that but whenever I'm doing
bond nevermind this is just gonna be
like useless information that you guys
don't even care about so let's just go
let's just go ahead and move on instead
of me randomly talking so now we have an
example with a negative and a negative
exponent so what we need to do in this
case is pull these first numbers right
here so it's basically 3 point 1 divided
by 6 point 4 so we're gonna go ahead and
figure out that but then we go ahead and
times that by 10 to the negative 3
divided by actually we can just go ahead
and skip the step so negative 3 minus
this is gonna look weird negative 7 I
might want to go ahead and surround
those by parentheses so negative 3 minus
negative 7 let's go ahead and figure out
each side of these so 3.1 divided by 6
point 4 equals point 4 8 4 times 10 to
the negative 3 minus negative 7 so what
we're basically doing is saying all
right negative 3 plus 7 so it's 10 to
the fourth and again as you can see this
is in kind of scientific notation but in
order to get a proper scientific
notation or standard notation or it's
not called standard notation it's called
on I'll just call proper standard
scientific notation so my story oh 4
point 8 4 and since we moved decimal
place one point to the right we're gonna
go ahead and type set by 10 to the 3rd
take away 1 from right there
so here is our final answer with one
digit to the left of the decimal so
there we go and we have one more example
we want to cover and yes this is the
very last example when dealing with
standard arithmetic so what is called
math functions
yeah arithmetic is so much harder to say
than math so we got one resent example
to go and then yeah that's it for these
dumb scientific notation tutorials so
let's go ahead and pound on our way
through this so five point nine times
ten to the fifth divided by one point
seven times 10 to negative 3 or negative
third now negative three so five point
nine divided by one point seven and
we're gonna go ahead and multiply that
by ten and I'm just gonna go ahead and
do the shortcut right now five minus
negative three which is pretty much five
plus three so on the left side of this
equation what we get is three point four
seven times ten remember five minus
negative three is pretty much saying
alright five plus three so again we
don't need a calculator for that five
plus three is eight so that's our final
answer right there and that's already in
proper format right there so three point
four three times ten to the eighth is in
proper scientific notation form we can
go ahead and you know put that in our
test in our future gives us you know ten
out of ten and they say good job and
they say see me after class and they
might have a little winky face right
there what if your teacher did that
she's like see me after class and she
put a winky face what you see here would
you not I probably like you know what I
think I'm just gonna walk out of class
and yeah unless she was cute then I have
to see her but anyways I'm rambling on
so there you go there you have it
there's your basic math functions
whenever you're working with scientific
notation again if you come across any
problem that's more difficult than these
you know maybe you have
like a scientific notation that you need
put to the like the eighth exponent or
something like that if you have anything
we're like that didn't just go ahead and
use a scientific calculator now that we
know the basics of it we can go ahead
and just use the calculator anytime we
want from here on out so I needed to
teach you guys this because whenever
you're working in college in high school
the teacher makes you show you work and
it's good to understand you know what's
going on behind the scenes so you guys
don't just depend on your calculator all
the time but now that we understand this
we're ready to move on to something a
lot more interesting so thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next
