with a video tutorial for the new boston
in this video we're going to be taking a
look at the J query tabs plug-in or
jQuery tabs widget found in the jQuery
UI now we've already included all of our
file so ensure you have the stylesheet
associated with the chosen theme all
available in the development bundle
that's downloaded most importantly the
jQuery UI dot J's file and we also have
our own custom external file you ijs
which we haven't written anything in yet
we've also got style dot CSS which we're
going to be styling the tab section with
in just a moment now the first thing to
note is we want to go ahead go over to
our browser and actually create this tab
effect first and then we'll go ahead and
implement the tabs widget so we'll just
go ahead and open up our browser you'll
see that there's nothing there at the
moment let's go ahead and start to
create our tabs section so I'm going to
create a div which is going to surround
everything so this is the div that
you're going to apply the tabs widget to
and I'm just going to call this tabs now
inside for the tabs at the top you're
going to need an unordered list so I'm
going to choose ul come down and end the
UL inside here we want the list options
just available to us or available to the
user so the first one we need to create
a link inside so let's just change that
to href and this is just going to be for
example about me and I'm gonna actually
have to give this a name which is going
to refer to the tab that you want to
open all the content you want associated
with this tab so I'm just gonna call
this about - me then we can go down and
create the rest of our menu options so
again we create a link just in here
and this time it's gonna be hash
portfolio and then in here just write
portfolio so this is the label and I'm
gonna do a third one as well just so we
get a good idea of how this is working
so again a link in between here with the
name so I'm just gonna say contact and
in here just contact so at the moment
this looks a bit like there we go so
this looks about a bit like this so not
really doing anything yet we haven't
applied tabs to it now let's go ahead
and create the div sections that we
require to open when we click these
different links so we're gonna create a
div in between here and the ID of these
need to correspond to the links that
you've given them so for example the
first div is going to be let's just put
some paragraph tags in there a short
paragraph about me now this now needs to
correspond to hash about me or sorry it
just needs to correspond to about me and
that way jQuery will pick up that when
we click on this about me tab the
corresponding div will be shown so we do
this for each one of the tabs that we
create again put in the ID in here of
port folio and in here we can put the
content so for example this is my port
folio and the last one we're just
essentially recreating what we've
already done so contact some paragraph
tags just in there and my con
details so now let's just open our
browser it looks a bit like this we've
got each link here and each paragraph
that represents the tab that we're going
to click at the moment it does nothing
so assuming that we've included
everything correctly we can go over to
UI j s and actually apply it tabs to
this so remember we called our div here
our main dear about container div free
for everything here we call it tab so we
select this and then we just apply the
tabs widget to that now when we open up
our browser and refresh you can see that
tabs have been created and they
correspond to each paragraph we created
as well so extremely easy to implement
in this sense okay so now what we want
to do is take a look at changing the
width of this I'm also going to change
the overall font size on the page so
this looks a bit nicer so the first
thing I'm going to do is set the body
font size to 12 pixels and then I'm
going to come down and I'm going to
change the size of our overall div so
I'm going to again reference let's go
back to hit tabs so reference tabs and
I'm going to set the width to 400 400
pixels and then when we refresh the text
is a bit smaller and we have a nice
small area for our tabs and our content
so that's how we would go ahead and
actually style everything up now I'm
going to tell you about including
external files within this href so we're
calling an ajax request now if we were
to go ahead and create another menu item
we do exactly the same we create a link
here and i'm going to call this one a
loop and in here instead of specifying a
tab to go to I'm actually going to
specify a file that I want to be loaded
into the content area so when I click
this loop tab that will appear here when
i refresh in a moment I want the
contents of here to be loaded from an
external file so we can specify this and
I'm going to specify loop dot PHP which
we haven't yet created which will be
found in the PHP folder
so at the moment I'm going to refresh
click on loop and nothing appears that's
because this loop file could not could
not be loaded we haven't actually
created it yet so once we have created
it the contents will appear now we can
set Ajax options within our tabs here so
remember the options going out curly
brackets we can set Ajax options to
check if this file is available for
example we might return an error trying
to find this file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
