thirty-seven sea shark tutorial when I'm
making boards I've in Boston and in this
tutorial we're gonna continue working on
our button control so in this tutorial
or basically one can make it to the
limit user hover your mouse over the
button on the button color will change
to your tint of blue so that it appears
as though you can click on it and it
lets you know that the fog is enabled so
what we're gonna do here is go over to
our plot and designer select our clark
control and go down to mouse hover
alright and then we're basically just
going to have to copy and paste this
code down here well instead of copying
and pasting it should just free and
method so that's what we're gonna do
we're just gonna copy this code right
here into a new method and we're going
to call that method
client
and since methods are defaulting private
in a class we don't have to put private
in front of it users won't be able to
seize method anyways so over to think
draw the button and we're gonna have the
user pass through the color that they
want the button to be say color called
alright so instead of it always drawing
just the control color we're gonna have
it draw the color that the user passes
through now when it draws the top it'll
be fine but for drawing the bottom to
give it the glossy effect it's just
going to draw all the time this control
light now what we could do is have the
user pass through a second color to tell
us what to draw on the bottom but we can
use something else we can just basically
make a variation on this color and just
make it darker so in order to make a
color darker all you have to do is
subtract from the red green and blue
colors so we subtract the same amount
from all three of those it will just
make the color darker if you add to
those I'll just make the color lighter
all right so we're going to do here then
say a stock color equals colored from a
RGB
and then what we're going to be doing
here is just basically making just 1/10
of the scholars we're going to add make
it darker so we're going to say the
Alpha will always be 255 so we can just
say the Alpha right here is 255 then for
the red we're going to say C dot R - and
then 13 and like I said before
subtracting will just make the color
darker and the reason that I chose 13
was what I did is I took the color
control and the color light control or
control light and found the difference
between the red and the red between
those two Reds and I got 13 so now if
we're going to pass control through here
it would be control on the control light
because with this alternate to make it
control light so we're gonna do the same
now for the green so I'm going to say CG
for the green - 13 and same for the bees
once they see that blue - and like I
said this will just basically just make
this color darker it'll take this color
and make it darker and then set the
Brockie go to that then when it draws
the bottom of it it will just be darker
than the top so now when we say on paint
right here we're gonna say draw a button
and then we're gonna pass through the
control color so that when it draws the
first time when you like load the form
it will be the default color but then
when you hover your mouse over it we're
introduced to a tint of blue oh let's
just check to see if this works we're so
there's no snake color from known as
color then there's no pass through that
controller all right so now this makes
it much easier you don't have to deal
with all this stuff so now I'm going to
be bug here horn everything should be
safe yep perfect
all right so now that I have that all
set and everything is fine we can now do
stop or when the user
hover the mouse over the button so we're
just going to call this a draw button
mess again
only instead of passing through the
control color we're going to pass
through a blue color over control now in
order to make this color basically more
blue we're just going to have to mess
with a RDB colors or specifically the
red green and blue
the Alpha will always stay 255 we're
going to say color
call it color equals and then color from
a our DB and we're basically just going
to be doing the same thing that you did
down here only instead of subtracting
the same value from each we're gonna
subtract different values and add some
values here and there to basically just
make the color more blue now so we're
going to say colored up from a RGB and
like I said the Alpha law doing the same
thing to say 255 but or the red we are
just going to say colored dot from known
color and then control because we want
to make it a variation in this control
we want to make it more blue so to make
it more blue and subtract a lot of red
we're gonna subtract 30 red now for the
things argued so now pour the green
we're just going to subtract about 5 a
little bit different from 5 and then
we're just going to set the flu go to
the maximum which is 255 and then we're
just going to pass this color right
there all right and if you really don't
understand like how this works basically
what we're doing is just altering the
red green and blue colors to make it
more blue and just mess around to this
if you wanted to make it like green or
something obviously add more green and
subtract blue and red and your stuff
like that you just gotta mess around
with it there's no real likes that way
to do it
alright so now let me be bug here and
the user hovers the mouse over the
button that you change to a
Ballu yep perfect now the only thing
that we need to do is make it so that it
changes when the user takes their mouse
away now we're gonna say actually we go
back to our font designer we're gonna
say when the user so it has the mouse
lead we're going to draw that again
we're just going to draw the control all
right so now you debug but move our
mouse over we see it changes as we move
it away it changes back to the regular
now as you can see gonna put our mouse
onto it there's a bit of a delay and
that's because it needs to hover so
we're gonna have it also do that or
redraw to that blue when the mouse
enters so now we're to go back go back
to our control right here and create one
more event handler for the mouse enters
and then just redraw that balloon so now
there should be no delay when you put
your button or your cursor over the
bottom and when the flu shows up yep
perfect so now when you hover your mouse
over it makes it attentive blue and then
when we click it we should just get a
message box yep and then we move away
it's not blue anymore so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial so see you
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
