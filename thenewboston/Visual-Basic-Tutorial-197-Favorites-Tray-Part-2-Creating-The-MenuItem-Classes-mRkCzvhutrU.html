slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial we're going to
continue working on the tray icon or the
tray application that will hold our
internet favorites so we need to come
over here to favorites view or tray and
we need to add a class now we'll go
ahead and name it web favorite menu item
and we'll go ahead and click Add now
what we need to do is we need to have
web favorite menu item inherit from
something so we'll have it inherits menu
item it says represents an individual
item that is displayed within a system
not window stop forums dot main menu or
a context menu so basically what this is
would be a menu item would be similar to
this file right here so when we click
file it shows us a menu so we're
creating a menu item that will show when
they right click the star in the tray so
now that it inherits menu item what we
need to do is we need to create a
favorite
so we'll do public favorite as web
favorite and you can see here that web
favorite is not available to us so we
need to come over here to favorites view
or tray YouTube we need to go to project
and we need to add a reference it so
we'll go to projects and we will just
add a reference for internet favorites
and click OK
so now we can do public favorite as web
favorite
but we need to import that first so
imports internet favorites so now that
we've imported our class library we can
use the web favorite class so now we
need to create a constructor so we do
this by using public sub new this should
be familiar to you and it's going to
take one argument so whenever they
create an object of this web favorite
menu item it's going they're going to
have to give it a web favorite for it to
construct it properly so it will do by
eval new favorite as web favorite and
we'll go ahead and press ENTER and it
will add in sub for us so now when you
do is set favorite which is this right
here equal to new favorite so we have
this variable that we've created and
when they create an instance of this
class right here they have to give us a
web favorite and then we set the
favorite variable in here the public
favorite variable to what they have
given us so this basically makes a copy
of it so that we can use it throughout
this class and now we just need to say
text equals favorite dot name so text is
pretty much the text of the menu item
when we because we inherit from menu
item we can access the text value so
let's say this is our menu item right
here at the text value for this it would
be new project so we're sending text
equal to favorite name and now in our
web favorites class let's go ahead and
look at that we have the name which is
the name of the website so when they
right click is going to show the name of
the web site and it's not going to
actually show the URL so now what we
need to do is we need to access the
click event of this class now you may be
thinking I thought you could only access
click events for objects on your form
such as buttons text boxes labels link
labels but whenever we inherit from
new items so let's say this is a menu
item right here it can react to itself
being clicked so when we click on new
project it's going to do something so we
need to access the click event of this
so what we can do is we can use this
combo box right here so when we drop
this down you can see that we have web
favorite menu item events and we can
come over here to the declarations and
we have all these events that we can use
so we need to select the click event
so whenever web favorite menu item is
clicked what do we want to do well we'll
say if not favorite is nothing then what
do we want to do so basically what this
saying well this is saying is if
favorite is something because we're
using a double negative here so if not
favorite is nothing so not nothing would
be something so if favorite is actually
something and not a null value for all
you people who've worked with other
languages what we want to do is type
process dot start and then we'll do
favorite dot URL now what this is going
to do is it's going to start the process
and it's gonna open this URL so when you
open URLs when you click on URLs in any
program on your computer your computer
knows to open this with your default web
browser so it's going to start that
process and it's going to basically
click on that if you want to say that
there's going to open this right here
and it's going to open it in your
default browser so go ahead and put this
code in if you haven't already we
created a menu item so that we can add a
whole bunch of these web favorite menu
items to a menu later on so that they
can just right click on the star and it
will show them all of their favorites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
