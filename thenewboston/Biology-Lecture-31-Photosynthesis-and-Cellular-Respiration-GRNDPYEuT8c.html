biology video and in this video what I
want to do is I want to write out the
chemical equations of photosynthesis and
also cellular respiration and I want to
do this because a it's important to
understand for biology and B is amazing
how these two equations totally
different balance each other out
perfectly so let me go ahead and start
with photo photosynthesis and I'll draw
this one right here and then I'll go
ahead and write cellular respiration
we'll be down here alright so let's go
ahead and make this a balanced equation
and in order to do that we need 6 co2
molecules so 6 co2 and remember the 3
ingredients of plant needs for
photosynthesis is co2 from the air water
so let me go draw water and we need 6
water molecules so 6 h2o and the last
thing that it needs is a light from the
Sun so I'll just go ahead and write
light and this of course is the energy
so of course whenever a plant has carbon
dioxide which is right here water and
light energy what it can do with that is
make food now plants made food or they
make food in the form of sugar so I
guess I'll color sugar this kind of
purple color which c6h12o6 and they also
draw my six a little better and they
also create oxygen in in order for this
to be a balanced equation it would be
602 which is oxygen so that's basically
what photosynthesis is this is carbon
dioxide of course we know that water and
I won't go ahead and label light because
I already wrote light and a product of
this is of course sugar which is the
food that the plant can use for energy
and oxygen ox
June alright now you're saying you know
what that's just photosynthesis chemical
reaction pretty interesting but it isn't
really that amazing well let's go ahead
and take a look at cellular respiration
well cellular respiration is very
similar in that whenever a human needs
food what it does is it takes food such
as sugar which is c6h12o6 so remember I
said in last tutorial that it takes
sugar or food and it combines it with
oxygen and I'll just go ahead and write
602 so six molecules of o2 which is
oxygen and whenever it does this it ends
up with carbon dioxide which is of
course is a by-product and what color
was my carbon dioxide 6 co2 and aside
from this we get water which is 6 h2o
and we also get you know energy because
that is the goal whenever humans do
cellular respiration we need energy for
the cells so of course if I go ahead and
label all this this is sugar right here
we know this is oxygen obviously this is
carbon dioxide
and you know we probably don't even need
to label this but I will this is water
right here all right so to recap one
last time in photosynthesis in order for
a plant to make food what it needs is
carbon dioxide water and energy from the
Sun now whenever it combines those in
its own special way it makes a sugar and
it has a byproduct of oxygen which it
gives us to the environment now in
cellular respiration the process that
people make energy or the cells make
energy they take sugar from you know it
comes from food and they combine it with
oxygen in their bodies and as a
by-product they have carbon dioxide
water and that all sought after energy
that your cell can use for a bunch of
different processes interesting but
still I said that this was a very
interesting chemical reaction why did I
say that well check this out if we look
closely we notice that photosynthesis
and cellular respiration are the exact
opposite of each other in cellular
respiration we have oxygen and
photosynthesis we end up with oxygen and
also same goes for sugar in cellular
respiration we start with sugar and we
end up with sugar and photosynthesis
same thing goes for carbon dioxide
photosynthesis right there water right
there and energy right there so if you
get rid of all these lines you can see a
little bit more clearly that
photosynthesis and cellular respiration
are pretty much the exact opposites of
each other the way that plant makes food
in the way that humans break down food
and convert it back to energy that their
cells can use the the relationship
between photosynthesis and cellular
respiration is one of the most beautiful
chemical relationships in all of physics
or excuse me in all of biology so I've
been teaching a little bit too many too
much physics lately but it is so cool
how it's just the opposite of each other
and they just balance use each other so
perfectly and that is one of the main
reasons that animals and plants and life
all around Earth can live together so
perfect
