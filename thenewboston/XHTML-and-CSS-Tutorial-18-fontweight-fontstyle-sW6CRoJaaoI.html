let's see eighteenth XHTML tutorial and
in this tutorial I'm going to go over
the correct way to bold and italicize
text so I remember like probably 10
tutorials ago I showed you guys how to
bold and italicize text by surrounding
them with special tags and while this is
indeed a valid way you actually can do
that and it will work in most browsers
it's not the best way and it's not going
to be the way that people do in the
future so a better way to bold and
italicize text is through CSS anytime
you change any element or change any of
the properties of XHTML it's better to
use CSS other than you know surrounding
text with bold tags or something like
that so here is a lot better and more
modern way I guess you could say of how
to make text bold and how to italicize
text so let's go ahead and before we can
you know start bolding and italicize and
stuff we actually need something to bold
so let's go ahead and make two lists um
an unordered list and let me just end
this and I guess we can just like put
one element and there we don't need to
need a bunch of elements in there so for
the first and only element I'll just put
like unordered lists and make sure you
spell it
dang did I spell that right I better not
of and let's just go ahead and copy this
and what you just want to order it
listen since they both have the Li we
just need to change two letters so we
have one unordered list in one order
list so we just need I mean you can use
paragraphs or headers or whatever you
want I just needed something to throw in
there so anyways in order to make the
style what you need to do is first write
what element you want to change
unordered list and then you're right
what property you want to change the
font weight and that is the technical
technical term for how thick the font is
you can use values I think 500 is the
default value so you can use something
like 900 800 to make it
if you say you want to bold you know
like varying degrees of boldness I can
say but I don't think too many people
care that specific how bold they want it
I mean did you ever hear a guy says yeah
that's bold but I want it bolder you
know no one says that
so anyways um you can just throw in bold
as your value and you know you'll be
happy most of the time so let's go ahead
and that is you know the proper way I
want to say in order to bold font so in
order to italicize font go ahead and
will italicize the order list we just
made and go ahead and the property is
font style and as the style just go
ahead and write italic and this is going
to italic or italicize any of your
ordered lists so let's go ahead and save
this and refresh it and see what we get
we got one on unordered list that is
bolded and one ordered list that is
italicized so again like I said while
you can technically surround it in those
be bold tags or e/m emphasis tags this
is a lot easier way and it's the pretty
much the correct way to do so that old
stuff was kind of old school and this is
the new school so get used to this and
you'll thank me later on so anyways
that's all I have for you guys for this
story thank you for watching I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
