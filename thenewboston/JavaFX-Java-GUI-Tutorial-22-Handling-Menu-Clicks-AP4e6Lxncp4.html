create a really basic menu let's start
spicing this up a bit and actually
instead of these settings these are kind
of weird who's going to give it new
titles I'll just say like a new open
save I'll just give some real basic ones
just for this demo Oh whooping cough
where's it kennel cough I don't know all
right and let me give it two more so
settings and exit so now we have a file
menu and it has five different options
in EM as well just run it and show you
guys alright pretty cool pretty cool but
check out this one see this one has cool
separators these little lines and the
reason that you may have separators is
is to group related items together so if
this is all for like you know your
projects and these were settings and
these were for saving well let's learn
how to create those alright so say that
I want a separator between save and
settings well what I can do is I can
actually add a new item now these
separators are menu items just like
these are so this is item this is item
this is item in these separators you add
them just like regular items so if I do
this the real lazy way instead of a new
menu item which is a little chunk of
text that you can click you call new
separator menu item pretty creative
naming convention and now we have a
separator aligned between save and
settings and I'll put another one
between settings and exits so we now
have this item this item this item a
separator item
settings and then exit all right looking
a little bit better but uh you know a
little problem here whenever I click
these isn't us something supposed to
happen well that would be nice so let me
show you guys how to implement that so
basically whenever you want to add in
action in other words the functionality
that you actually click the item
something happens it's better to set it
up like this show you guys how to do it
the proper way so you call menu item and
I'll just make that new arm file
whatever is called just new so new file
set this equal to new menu item new
alright so after this just like any
button or anything else the menu item
what we're going to do is we're going to
say set on action now whenever we click
it just like a button it emits an event
and we can capture it using a lambda so
someone's texting me in the middle or no
actually that's email let me check it oh
all right
credit card sign up definitely hop on
that alright so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to say whenever the user
clicks new that menu option then I'm
just going to print something out on the
screen but obviously you would want to
you know open up a file dialog or
project and have them you know do
whatever you want but too lazy for all
that so system.out.print line and this
is just going to print out in the
terminal create a new file alright
looking good now of course we have the
menu item and we have action tied on to
it but we didn't actually add it to the
file menu yet so file menu get items add
and then you just add the name of the
menu item so now let me go ahead and run
this and check it out you expand this
alright so we got our file just like
before these of course still don't do
anything whenever I click Save or
anything but look what happens whenever
I click new it now runs that little bit
of code and again you would probably
want to do something other than just
printing crap out on the screen but
that's what I did so you know don't
judge me bro now actually let me show
you guys a other cool little trick let's
create a brand new menu so we have file
menu let's create this edit menu
right here all right so say edit menu
and re do I want to copy this then all
right
menu I'll just name it edit menu so the
equal to new menu and of course the text
on this is going to be edit now you see
how you have underlines right here let
me compare contrast see whenever I
created in my menu in JavaFX I just had
a word file but this one right here it
has an underline under the word F now
the reason that does that is because if
I hold down alt and press F that file
opens it's kind of like a shortcut for
the user so it wouldn't be cool if we
could do that in JavaFX well we can so
moving on
I'm just kidding we can actually do that
too if you put an underscore right
before the title of the file then
whenever you run this it's going to
treat it as a shortcut so in other words
what this allows the users to do is if
they hold down alt and press e on their
keyboard and it's going to open it up
for them so you know some people are way
too lazy to move the mouse way up here
so we'll make it real easy for them and
let's just go ahead and add some items
now so edit menu let me just add some
fake items so it doesn't look blank get
items add and I'll just say new menu
item what's in edit now kind of boring
so I'll just say like cut copy paste cut
copy and paste all right so now I'm just
add it to the menu bar so now our menu
bar has a file menu and an edit menu and
let me run this bad boy and check it out
so since we added that underscore watch
what happens whenever I hold down alt
I'm going to hold down alt and we now
see that there's underline under the
letter E indicating that if I hold e or
excuse me if I click II then it opens
for me of course it doesn't work with F
click an F right now nothing happening
so if you ever want to give the user the
shortcut then that is what you do now
one other thing that I want to show you
guys is this sometimes let me see if I
can find any all right so sometimes you
have options that are grayed out for
example you see this menu item next edit
location well whenever I hover over it
and nothing happens I can't click it or
I can't click here but nothing happens
whenever I do sometimes you want an
option that's grayed out for whatever we
reason I'll show you guys how to do that
and it's actually called disabling the
menu item so let me just do it with like
this paste right here so you see how we
can click paste right now let me disable
that so build it the right way so menu
item and actually let me do this
so menu item I'll call it paste in the
text will be paste
and usually whenever I click it I'll
just write like um pasting uh some crap
now if I add it to the Edit menu then
everything should work fine right now so
now what I can do is I can hover over
edit paste and it'll print out something
on the screen alright good to go but now
you know what the user is facing too
much crap I really want to disable this
button for them well what I can do is I
can get that menu item and I can call
set disable and set this equal to true
so now whenever I run this the paste
button will still be there but it'll be
disabled so now whenever I try to click
it as you can see it's grayed out before
but I'm going to try to click it I know
if you guys can hear me click my mouse
but nothing is happening so if you ever
want to toggle that back on through code
you're going to have to change that to
false and then you can paste again I'm
actually just going to delete or I'll
leave it right now for whenever I post
this on github but there you go
in the next tutorial don't know what I'm
going to be covering but probably some
more stuff with menu so see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
