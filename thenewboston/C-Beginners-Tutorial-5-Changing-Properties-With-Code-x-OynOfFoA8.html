tutorial that I'm making for the New
Boston and in this tutorial I'm going to
be showing you how to change the
property of a control using code so
basically what we're going to be doing
first is just changing the text of our
button to Adam whenever the user clicks
on it alright so the first thing we have
to do is get the name of our button and
to do that you're just going to select
your button and then go over the
properties panel and it just says button
one right there so anytime we want to
access our button using code we're gonna
have to type out clot in one all right
so now that we know the name of our
button just go ahead and double click on
it alright so we want to change the text
of our button so first we just have to
type out the name bar button which is
button one so we're just going to type
fun one and we want to change the text
of our button so we're just going to
type dot and then text right and
intellisense right here just as text and
right next to it there's a little
picture of a guy pointing to like a pad
or whatever and that image right there
that icon just represents a property so
we know that this text right here is a
property all right and we're going to
want to hit enter so we don't have to
type out the rest of the text and to
find out what we have to set it equal to
or what value type text represents
you're just going to want to hover your
mouse over the property which is text
right there and as you can see it just
says strength so you know we have to set
it equal to a string so we're going to
do an equal sign and to represent a
string and C sharp you're just going to
want to do two quotes and then inside of
here whatever you want your buttons text
to be so I want my buttons text let's
say Adam so it's going to tell you Adam
right there and of course we have to end
the line with a semicolon all right so
basically that's going to happen when
you click the button is the buttons text
is just going to change to Adam and
that's because we accessed our button
which is button one and then we change
the text property so we did dot text and
then we set a equal to Adam and the
current text that the button doesn't
matter so if the text of the button said
button one it's just going to overwrite
that and change the text to Adam all
right so let's just defogger it here and
see what happens
so when you click this button the
buttons text should change to Adam it
says Adam
right there and you can change any
property that you want of the button so
if we want to get this able our button
you can just do dot enabled and set this
equal to either true or false and we
know if you have to set it equal to a
pool because it says right there cool so
we have to set it equal to either true
or false
since it's a pool so we're going to do
equals and then false and we're going to
do false so that it will disable our
button and disabling a control basically
means that you won't be able to interact
with it it'll just gray out and you
can't use it anymore all right so that's
just debug and make sure that this works
so again and click this button it should
just disable it and that's because we
access their button by the bottom name
so button one for a button and then we
change the enabled property to false and
we know that we have to set a equal to a
rule because right there and
intellisense it says pool
alright so let's just see if this worked
yep let me click the button and just
disable that you can't click on it
anymore it's all grayed out perfect and
you can just go through intellisense and
as try this yourself so just do dot and
then use your arrow keys to move up and
down and let's just scroll through here
and see what comes up and change I guess
height of it and we know height is a
property because the little guy pointing
to a pad so it's two dot height again
and we have to set equal to an integer
because it says enter it there so this
is a number we have to set equal to a
number so if we just hit enter right
there and set equal now we just have to
change the height of this to something
else and I'm just going to make the
height of this 60 and since it's an
integer where it's going to type out 60
all right so we accessed our button
again we change the height property and
since the height is an integer we have
to set it equal to a number so we just
studied equal to 60 all right so when we
click the button it should change the
height of the control to 60 yep it just
made it taller perfect and you can
change the properties of any control not
just the button so if we wanted to
change a text boxes text or something
like that we could go ahead and do that
so we're going to go over the toolbox
and
drag a text box over to your form and
we're just going to change the text
boxes text to atom so whenever the user
clicks on the button we're just going to
change the text boxes text to add them
so we're going to say text box one or a
text box again to get the name of your
text box you're going to want to select
your text box and go over to the
properties panel and look and see what
it says up there it says text box one so
we know that we have to type out text
box one anytime that we want to access
this text box we just do text box one
and we want to change the text of it so
it's going to be dot text and set that
equal to whatever text you want to
appear in our text box I'm just going to
make it say atom so whenever the user
clicks on the button the text in this
text box will be set equal to atom no
matter what it is beforehand so if it's
set equal to nothing currently and we
click the button that's equal to add
them now if we just type random stuff in
there and click the button it's still
going to say atom let me click the
button yeah perfect and just like with
the button you can go through and change
any control the text box is blonde so do
dot and scroll through here with our
arrow keys you can change any property
that we want I'm just going to change
the maximum length and the maximum
length property basically well it says
right there gets or sets the maximum
number of characters the user can type
or paste into the text box so we just
set the max line equal to two then user
can only type two characters inside of
the message box and the reason I know
that I've just set equal to a number I
just hover over this right there it says
int so that means that to set equal to a
number all right so let's just do bug
and see what happens if I just type in a
text box right now I can type as much as
I want but if I go ahead and click this
button and try to type more than two
characters it won't let me I can look
like - all right so that's pretty much
it for this tutorial on changing
properties of controls using code so see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
