nice hard and metal ground it's probably
a good idea to install some seats now
here are the seats that I chose probably
seeing some laying around it's in my
videos now whenever you install seats
like this on a go-kart we want to do is
you're probably going to have um kind of
a I don't know you wanna call this a
padding on one side of it make sure to
padding those to the outside and that's
because it's going to of course protect
you from anything that's coming inside
and you don't want it on the inside
because you want to be able to access
your parking brake and also your out
shifter so again make sure that the
padding or barrier is on the outside and
also these seats are going to be secured
to the frame by two bolts now we go
ahead and show you now these are the
bolts or the areas where the bolts go
right here and these little things are
here let me see if I can get a better
angle you see that they kind of look
like grappling hooks what they're going
to do is they're going to slide into a
bracket that's on the bottom of the
frame and I'll go ahead and show you
guys that bracket now so I guess so
might as well show you guys this now
because probably whenever I cover this
with a C I'm not going to be able to get
a good camera angle but those grappling
hooks hook looking things they're going
to slide right under here there's one
there and one there to fruit seat
there's two over there for the passenger
seat in the bolts what they're going to
do is they're going to go through the
area in the seat that I just explained
you guys and bolt into the frame right
here so two bolts hold in the back
section of the seat in these two on Yuva
know what you want to comb clamps or
whatever they're going to hold in the
front section of the seat and that's
going to make sure that your C is nice
and secure so now we want to do is want
to go ahead and position your seat and
again before you worry about lining up
inner bolt holes make sure that they go
into these uh brackets in the front
because that's hardware you really
cannot you really need to watch out for
that first you can always work under
later so this is kind of late and these
are always meeting it in my way so
lowering it down like I said right now
we're just worried about the little
clamps on the front rolls or the worry
about the hold the back nigger
so one errand nice and tight good to go
now if your seat isn't going in properly
and if it looks like once your clamps
are in front then it's not going to fit
then what you can do is you can position
the adjustment the seat slides forward
and back and when you slide it either
forward or back
it may help your bolt holes in the back
line up alright so let's see if I could
get these babies in here this should be
fun got a feeling I'm going to need the
hammer sometime let's go ahead and stick
that one first and you actually probably
want to make sure that you stick both of
your bolts and first before you start
tightening anything up alright so now we
got both bolts in and make sure just
double-check that both of your front
pieces are in their little slots and
they are you didn't mess anything up so
now we want to do is of course put your
washer on and then your lock washer and
then you not and this is always a kind
of pain in the butt because everything
thinks the gravity is falling towards
the floor and I want to put it in the
opposite direction in your fingers or
about as big as sausages so and actually
when my seat is kind of we're talking to
the camera in like sideways by noise
with my seats the brackets on the top
there really skinny so I can't get a
wrench on there we'll hold it staple
whenever I tighten these so whenever you
have a instance like this what you can
do is you can either put your wrench in
sideways or
doesn't work then you can use vice-grip
so I'm going to try to do this first and
hopefully works and I'll show you that
is what I'm talking about with a wrench
position you see how like you normally
hold it like this to get a good grip on
it or you can just hold it vertically
and you don't really need to get into
tired baby bite on it you just need to
keep it from spinning spinning almost
pinched my thumb there there we go nice
and tight so there you have it our seat
our driver seat at least is now
installed in the go-kart / dune buggy
safe and secure you can go ahead and sit
down and give it a test now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go ahead and
install the passenger seat without
combing it because it's the exact same
process and I don't think I need to take
you guys through that it's pretty
obvious how it goes so I'm going to go
ahead and install that and after that we
can move on to the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
