slash on live gamer for the new Boston
and in this tutorial when we working on
the person application now you can see
here that I've made a couple changes to
this application I added a list box
called list people which will store
instances of the person object so that
we can add a whole bunch of people to
our program and I added a button called
new person and I just rearranged the
buttons over here on the right side and
the name property for new person is
button add person so what I also did is
I added an update all sub which just
calls all three update income update
wait and update money so now what we
need to do is we need to come down here
and we need to create an ArrayList to
store all of our people so we'll do this
by typing private my people as new
ArrayList so this is we're going to use
to store all of the people that are
created so now we need to do is add a
method that will add people to the
ArrayList so we'll just go ahead and
come down here and we will type private
sub add person and we will just add by
Val the name so whenever a new person is
created they're going to have to supply
us with the name so by val named as
string or let's just do p name and we go
ahead and enter and it will fill all
this in for us the end sub and what i
also did is over here in the person
class just go ahead and create a public
variable called name make it of type
string and set it equal to nothing okay
so now we're going to do is we're going
to come back here in form one vb and
whenever they add the person we're going
to declare my new person
as new person so now that we've created
a new person we need to set some of the
values for it or one of the values so
we'll type my new person dot name equals
P name okay so now that we have
initialized the name that's all we need
because all the other values are
defaulted assuming that the person like
has just been born or something similar
to that so now we need to do is we need
to add that cust and that a person to
the arraylist so we'll type my new
person or no we need to type my people
dot add and we will add my new person
okay so now that we have our add person
sub created it declares the new person
it sets their name and then it adds that
person to the my people ArrayList so
coming here and double click on new
person
aghhhhhh see it creates this button add
person click event so now what we need
to do is we need to go ahead and type
input box so this will open up a box and
prompt the user to input a value so
let's go ahead and type the prompted
string so please enter a name for your
person and then we'll go ahead and set
the title as name and we'll set the
default response to John Doe okay so now
that we have created our input box we're
going to need to store what they got in
a variable so we'll declare name as
string and we'll set it equal to
whatever the input input box gives back
to it so now we need to create a person
so
add person and we'll go ahead and type
name right there as the arguments so
whatever they type in the input box it's
going to set the name value for the new
person and it's going to add them to the
array list now we need to do is we need
to add that person to a to the list box
so we'll just type list people dot items
add and we'll just go ahead and add my
people
so now what we need to do is add that
person to our list box so come back up
here to our add person sub and we'll go
ahead and type list people dot items ad
and we will just add my new person dot
name so it's going to add the name of
the person so let's go ahead and run
this and we'll bring it down here if
it'll stop resizing and we'll go ahead
and click new person so now we need to
enter a name for our person so I'll just
go ahead and enter Sam and then click OK
and you can see it adds Sam to our list
box
so go ahead type this code in if you
don't understand what it is you can
leave a question in the comments and
I'll try to respond to that and make the
changes that I showed to you at the
beginning and maybe even go on by
yourself without looking at the next
tutorial see if you can learn on your
own but if not stay tuned for the next
tutorial where we are going to be
working more on this application and how
to access the people the different
people that we have stored in our list
box so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
