is I saved you guys some time and I
already wrote the format or display for
TCP and UDP so again all of this is the
exact same is what we cover in the last
video learning nothing new so I went
ahead and I did already if you want to
change the display format then we can do
is you can just go to my github like I
said and change it however you like but
now what we can do is we can actually go
ahead and test this out so make sure
that whenever you run this program that
you're running it as sudo because if you
don't then you're not going to have all
the proper privileges so again save the
script as whatever dot py and run it is
sudo or just open up PyCharm or whatever
is sudo and you can run it straight up
as here so I'm gonna go ahead and run
this and I'm gonna go to my browser and
just hit refresh and check it out leap
and all right let's find something good
all right how about hurry this right
here alright so right now we can see the
way that I set up this display is we
have different levels of indentation so
we see that this entire thing is an
Ethernet frame now inside this Ethernet
frame is an ipv4 packet and inside your
packet is actually a TCP segment and
this is gonna be a TCP segment most of
the time because people just use the
internet most of the time and what I
could actually do now that I think about
it is I can actually move this over one
indentation level but I kind of like the
way it looks now I mean this is my pure
Ethernet info this is my ipv4 packet
info and all of my other stuff is nice
and neat I think if I move over too much
then you know too much is gonna go off
the screen
and if you guys are wondering about that
formatting function I made earlier this
is why I made it because our payload for
our TCP data right here which is usually
like HTTP requests we don't want all of
this as one long string because look at
it it would be like
three miles long wide it should I say so
that way whenever I formatted it as a
bunch of new lines it's a lot easier to
read in my opinion and there you go so
that is basically how you can use Python
to set up a socket capture data and once
you have data you can go ahead and start
analyzing it breaking it up making sure
that it's Ethernet traffic and then
looking at what's inside usually ipv4
data and then you can look even further
to dissect the different protocols the
ICMP traffic the TCP traffic u2p
