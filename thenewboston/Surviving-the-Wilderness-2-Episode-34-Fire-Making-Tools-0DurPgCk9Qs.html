the lake early this morning before the
Sun even came up trying to look for a
creek or a river or something that had
flowing water because I can't boil water
because I lost my flint so that's where
I was doing right now and I came across
this I don't even know what you want to
call it he's a big rock
most of the woods was just like this
terrible to walk through but found this
right here so I think that what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna find a little flat
or I probably one like this I'm gonna
try to find some sticks and make a fire
go fashion way I don't really have a
choice if I want to drink or eat
anything without feeling sick then I'm
really gonna need a fire so I guess
that's the plan for right now so right
now I want to find a dry piece of wood
because I think if I cut down a tree
that's alive
and it's gonna have too much moisture
and these some of these pieces of wood
they were lying on the ground like this
have been sitting around for a while and
they're nice and dry so I think if I can
find two roads dry pieces of wood and
generate enough friction then I can get
a little spark own at least but uh I
also have enough parachute cord to make
a little fire bow which will help me get
some more leverage on it I've seen it
done before but that was on TV and I
guess it's a lot harder in person so see
how it goes so here are my supplies I
think I got everything I need
broke this off this is gonna be my main
spindle hopefully I can get this
spinning on the base which is a dry
piece of bark fast enough where this
would generate some kind of spark and
I'm gonna make a bow out of this this is
a true I cut down because I got enough
cord left and that's gonna help me spin
it hopefully and this is just the top so
it doesn't wear out my hand whenever I'm
so I'm really hoping this works go ahead
and make my bow first cut two notches
where the rope can attach onto
should be good good enough to keep the
rope from sliding at least all right
let's see how this works
so there's my bow
looks like a little bow and arrow so
hopefully that'll work now for this the
main spindle you get this nut off it's
actually nice and light and real dry so
and I want to make both of the tips not
a point but somewhere where it's gonna
fit in the groove so that's too sharp
right there let me get a nice and around
it so there's that it's actually really
light really dry and pretty strong so
should work now for the base the only
thing I need to watch out for us I want
a little groove so this thing will fit
in and not slide around so I think I
want to cut alright so that should be
good plus whenever I start spinning it
it'll probably make its own groove
naturally so it's good for now now this
part where I hold on with my hand same
thing
all right that's it let's see how it
works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
