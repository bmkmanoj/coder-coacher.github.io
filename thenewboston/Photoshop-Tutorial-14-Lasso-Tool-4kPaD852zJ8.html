welcome to your 14 Photoshop tutorial
and in this video I'm going to be
talking about the lasso marquee tool now
the lasso tool is basically a selection
tool like the rectangular or elliptical
marquee tool however unlike these tools
we aren't limited to a specific shape
like a rectangle or a circle what the
lasso tool allows you to do is it allows
you to make a selection whenever you
have like an abnormal shape like a head
or Kirk's head right here so make sure
that you're working with a basic lasso
tool not the polygonal or magnetic lasso
tool we're going to be talking about
these in you know the upcoming tutorials
but in order to use the lasso tool go
ahead and get it selected and you want
to click and drag around your shape or
whatever you want selected so click and
drag around here now obviously this is
better than the rectangular or circle
because we have complete freedom over
abnormal shapes
the only drawback to this is you need
very good hand-eye coordination use it
so whenever you made your selection just
go ahead and release the mouse and it's
going to snap to the end and it's
basically going to close your path and
make a selection so as you can see like
I said complete freedom the only
drawback is if you I don't know maybe
you had a lot of Red Bull and maybe did
a line of cocaine and you want to try to
use this it would be like trying to make
a selection II can't do it because
you're all coked up got your little
sugar high going on wouldn't be the best
tool for you you might want to stick
with something else now let me go ahead
and make the selection again a little
bit better you know I probably shouldn't
have done that little cocaine routine
but there we go we have Kirk's head
selected and just like the other marquee
tools we have the add subtract intersect
so if we want to go ahead and add we can
make another selection and it's going to
add it to the current selection so now
that we have Kirk's head selected say we
wanted to add his body into here we'll
just go ahead and select that and
release now we have one giant selection
of Kirk's
entire body and another thing that I
want to tell you guys is a lot of people
have been asked me about this feather
tool and they said that feather isn't
working because let's say
that they wanted to change the feather
to 20 and then they go ahead and try to
I don't know maybe cut this out well
they're like oh I cut it out but my
feather isn't working is it like broken
is there a bug or something
well it isn't working because anytime
you use your feather tool you need to
use it you need to change the settings
before you make the selection so now
anything that you make after this and
try to cut it is going to be feathered
out so let me go ahead and show you guys
what you need to do in order to make
this feather it out go ahead and write
normal or I said to write like I'm
programming making program toriel's
though make a new selection feather 20
pixels and go ahead and select Kirk's
whole body or you know whatever image
you're working with and now once you
have that selected you can go ahead and
I don't know do whatever you want maybe
you wanna I don't know select the
inverse and cut that out and this would
give you a nice feathered image of your
selection so this is actually a pretty
cool-looking image of Kirk with a nice
feathered gradients coming out from his
body in all directions now the last
thing that I want to talk to you guys
about is a nice little shortcut and let
me just go ahead and open this up again
follow open Kirk and it's that whenever
you want to use straight lines
temporarily you can go ahead and hold
down the Alt key on your keyboard and I
think it's something different actually
I don't know if it's ctrl or all I've
been using Photoshop on the Mac and the
PC so let me go ahead and see so in
order to use a straight line I don't
know maybe you want to select this door
go ahead and hold alt on your keyboard
yeah that's what it was alt and just go
ahead and click and as you can see I'm
getting perfectly straight lines just
like this so now well I already have
that feathered so that's why I change to
a different shape but as you can see
whenever you hold down alt it's going to
give you perfectly straight lines so
there you can go what I say there you
can go there you go there's the lasso
tool that is how you have complete
freedom over your selections and that is
also how you correctly use the feather
setting whenever you're using any
selection tool so thank you for watching
thank you Kirk for letting me use your
and everyone don't forget to follow me
on Twitter Facebook Google+ and I'll see
you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
