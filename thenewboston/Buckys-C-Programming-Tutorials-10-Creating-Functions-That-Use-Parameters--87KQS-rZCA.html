welcome to your tenth C++ tutorial and
in this tutorial I'm going to be
teaching guys how to create a function
that uses parameters now a parameter is
quite simply additional information that
that function needs in order to work so
let me give you guys a quick example of
this say you made a function to
calculate the age of someone how old
they were well some additional
information you would need before you
can calculate that is what year were
they born and once you have this
information you can calculate their age
so let's go ahead and now that we
understand why a function would need
additional information let's go ahead
and create a simple and excuse me a
simple function to use additional
information so let's go ahead and create
a function that just prints out Bucky's
favorite number is blank um we might see
Bucky's favorite number is 20 Bucky's
favorite number is 68 Bucky's favorite
number is 99 well since we don't know
what my favorite number is yet we're
just going to go ahead and put a
variable in place for that number so
since this isn't going to be making any
calculations really we can just go ahead
and use a void because that means return
nothing so name your function anything
you want I'm just going to name my print
crap since that's all it's going to do
print crap out on the screen and before
we just added these empty parentheses
when nothing in between them and then we
coded the body right here well whenever
we use a parameter you actually put that
information right in your parentheses
and check this out you know how I said
we didn't know what that number is yet
and that's the additional information
that we need well since we don't know
what it is yet we just go ahead and we
set it equal to a variable and since
this is an integer we go ahead and
sequel to the variable int X you can
name your variable anything you want but
I'm going to name mine X because it's
really simple easy to work with so now
we can go ahead and we can add the body
of this function and all we're going to
do in this function is pronounce screen
Bucky's favorite number is that I spell
everything wrong yup yep good to go
Bucky's favorite number is
X and then just go ahead and that line
and now when our function runs is going
to run something like this if we say
that our favorite number is 20 it's
going to say
Bucky's favorite number is 20 if we say
that our favorite number is 10
Bucky's favorite number is 10 so we can
run this function a bunch of times and
give it a different piece of information
each time and it's going to work
so let's go ahead and remember in order
to use a function in your main you just
go ahead and you type the function name
and then you add your parentheses and
your semicolon at the end but whenever
your function needs an additional piece
of information you need to give it that
information inside the parentheses so we
know for making our function that it
needs one integer in order to work so
let's go ahead and in inside these
parentheses give it one integer 20 so
now what it's going to do is well let me
go ahead and run this and show it to you
guys Bucky's favorite number is 20 all
right so what happened is this we said
all right C++ program we want to use
this print crap method well it said all
right in order to use this method I'm
going to need one integer so we gave it
the integer 20 so then whenever in this
function it came across the variable X
it just substituted 20 for that so
whenever you're making parameters you
first need to list what type of data and
also a variable name so then whenever we
give it that variable its substitute
that variable for X later on in the
program so for example let's give it one
more example like 854 well now we run it
and it says Lucky's favorite number is
854 and that's the beauty of parameters
and functions it doesn't need to be the
same every time so that's why you can
use variables so again what we did is we
created a function and it needed an
additional piece of information which
was an integer and since it didn't know
the value yet it just went ahead and set
it equal
to a variable then later on in the body
whenever it came across that variable
and knew whatever value you told it to
substitute for X that's what value is
substituted for X so we can run this 100
times with a hundred different values if
we want it's going to substitute it for
X each time and use that information to
plug it in so that's the basics of how
you use functions with parameter again
whenever you're creating a parameter use
the datatype and a variable name and
whenever you're using the function don't
forget to pass in or give it whatever
information it needs so that's pretty
cool was simple enough we understand
that but in the next story what I'm
going to be teaching you guys is how to
use function that use multiple
parameters what if a function needs more
than one piece of information in order
to work well I'm going to show you guys
how to do that too and it's a little
different than this so you definitely
want to watch that so once you
understand this and understand the
basics behind functions and parameters
you're ready to move on to the next
tutorial so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
