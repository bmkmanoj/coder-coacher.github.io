tutorial on XHTML last time I told you
guys how to create a definition list in
an order to lists and this time we're
gonna be learning how to create an
unordered list know unordered list is
the exact same thing as an ordered list
except that instead of using numbers or
the letters to order the information it
just uses bullet points instead and to
create one is very simple you start out
with a tag ul for an unordered list and
the ends with the ending ul tag an in
between here's all the information we're
gonna put for our list and just like an
order lists any items that go in and
begin with a ala I tag that stands for a
list item type this is item one and that
ends with the ending Li tag now let's
put in a second item type in Li this is
to end it with an ending Li tag and
we'll put in a third one just for fun
this is item
three and end it with an ending Li tag
now let's save this and take a look at
what it looks like an internet explorer
as you can see instead of the numbers 1
2 &amp;amp; 3
this one has bullet points so this is
better if you have a list that you don't
need to put in any particular order for
your items but say you wanted to change
these bullet points the something
different like a square well if you
would like to do that then you would
need the type attribute now instead of
putting a letter A or number 1 like you
did in an order list you would change
the bullet points to something out say
if you wanted to change it to square you
type in square now if we save this and
take a look at it an Internet Explorer
you'd see that instead of small circles
they you have a square for your bullet
points
so again the type in the square for your
value and this is the attribute I'll
include some different things besides
square that you can add as a type on my
website but for now let's get rid of
this the unordered list and say you
wanted to indent something but you
didn't want to make a list well to do
that is quite simple let's just add some
text this is some text and let me just
copy that and paste it a few times the
represent a paragraph and say you wanted
to end that everything from this to this
well to do that you would add something
called block quote what a block quote
does is in debt is indent all the text
that's its surrounding so to do that
type in a block quote for your opening
tag now wherever you want to stop
indenting add a end block quote tag
so this is our beginning tag this is our
ending block well tag and all of this
should be indented and this should be
aligned to the left because because it
isn't enclosed in our block low tag so
let's save this and take a look at what
it looks like in Explorer and as you can
see this is still aligned to the left in
our paragraph is indented
and say you wanted to apply this to a
paragraph so all you need to do say
you've had a paragraph right here be
here's our opening tag this is a
paragraph let me just copy that and
paste it a few times and this would be
all the text that was in our paragraph
and the ends of course with the ending P
tag you need to put the block quote tags
right here
and you will put the ending on the right
before your last ending paragraph tag
so again directly outside the paragraph
but before the paragraph tags make sure
that this is totally enclosed within the
paragraph if you have one outside and
one inside then it's just not going to
work out so let's save this and take a
look at what it looks like as you can
see our entire paragraph is indented now
so if you want to indent without having
to make a list the block quote tag is
the best way to do that so in the next
tutorial we're going to be learning how
to change some different things with the
font such as the size and the color of
the font and what type of fun it is and
also be learning how to bold and make
our font italics and if you're not
already there you can go to my website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
