to another app review and this app is
for fandango now if you guys don't know
what Fandango is is pretty much wall
from Oh Iowa was known it was a website
that tells you about like movie
showtimes and lets you buy tickets
online and stuff like that so you see
the two main things at the top is in
theaters in coming soon I don't ever
look at coming soon because I want to
see I want to go to the movies now you
know I don't see what's in theaters
right now so I usually clicking near me
to see what movies are near me and well
for example I want to see the lovely
bones because I read the book in by
reading the book i meant i read half of
it they gave up because i like watching
TV and blame em computer more but say i
want to see lovely bones I'll just
scroll down to the lovely bones came out
yesterday and you see it loads showtimes
oh by the way this runs off the Wi-Fi
it's not like stored in your ipod memory
or anything and it gives you your fan
rating a little review and also gives
you an opportunity to preview the movie
which is pretty cool which I check out a
lot but here are all the movie showtimes
that are playing by me mission valley
that's a theater only a mile away from
me on this one like I said 2.1 miles and
these give you all the showtimes they
also give you the option to buy online
but I never do that just because you
know I don't know just personal thing
don't wanna so that's pretty much it and
if you go back to movies and I mean
there's not much more to it you just
have different categories you can choose
um avatar and oh by the way I went
inside avatar two days ago and I didn't
know that they had two different
versions avatar an avatar 3d I just
thought it was all 3d so you know check
this out avatar in digital 3d I didn't
know that so I had to watch avatar in 2d
the whole time i was thinkin man i wish
i could watch this in 3d so then I went
back in I Washington 3d and it was
awesome a lot better but then i'll
scroll through this and I'm like what's
this avatar imax 3d and make seriously
no matter what i do is
just not good enough is it so now I am
afraid to go watch it in imax 3d because
i already seen it twice and now once i
watch in imax 3d i know they're going to
have like shuttles the pandora for real
or something that i'm going to miss out
on so you know what I'm done with avatar
for now had already ruined my life so
anyways um that's my interview like this
and another thing I forgot to mention is
this app is entirely free one hundred
percent free so how awesome is that so
if you're a big movie goer I would
highly recommend it and that is one of
the main reasons i'm going to give this
app right here a 9 out of 10 so it's a
really cool app if you ever go to the
movies then you should definitely get
this it would be really useful for you
so thank you guys for watching subscribe
and remember if you have any other apps
that you want me to review then just let
me know leave me a comment on this
review and i'll check them out for you
so long next time thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
