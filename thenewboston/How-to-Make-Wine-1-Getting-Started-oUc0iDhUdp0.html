is Bucky Roberts and in these videos I'm
gonna be teaching you guys how to make
wine now if you watch my videos on how
to make beer then you know that at the
very beginning in the first couple of
videos what I did is I basically went
over all the equipment and told you guys
how to sanitize everything and it's kind
of boring and there's also kind of
overwhelming learning all the equipment
at first
so in these winemaking tutorials I'm
gonna do things better and also a little
bit different what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to be breaking it up in two steps
so this first thing we're gonna be
talking about is called primary
fermentation or pretty much the process
to get things started so I'm going to be
going over just the equipment that you
need for this and then at the end of the
series I'm gonna be talking about all
the equipment where you can buy kits and
so on and so forth but now I'll shut up
let's get started let's look at the
equipment that we need to get started
now the first thing that we need is
water it's important to use good quality
drinking water now for most of the wine
gets you need six gallons of water so I
don't know this is six but I got some
spare and if you don't have good quality
drinking tap water in your house then go
ahead and buy a big thing of bottled
water you can just go ahead and get it
at Walmart wherever if you do have good
quality drinking water in your house you
can use that it's fine well you know
some people have like sulfur in the
water so I don't do that if you have
software in your water now the next
thing that you always need is a
winemaking kit now some people in I
might talk about this in the future you
can actually and this is probably how
you think you make wine get a bunch of
grapes from a vineyard and stomp on them
and get all the juice but I really don't
have a vineyard in my backyard so what
you do is you can actually buy a
winemaking kit and this is how most you
know home wine makes your wine makers
make it kind of a tongue twister
basically this comes with the juice so
you don't have to step on all the grapes
and it also comes with
and it's called its clarifier and I'll
talk to you guys about what clarifier is
but we're going to need the package that
they come with aside from the juice in
this first little step so right now
water and a winemaking kit easy enough
now the next thing that you need this is
these are the kind of the supplies
sanitizer I won't talk to you guys about
sanitizing right now basically whenever
you want to sanitize something I'll just
read the directions on your sanitizer
they're all different
this sanitizer called Star Sam I got it
from Northern Brewer but I think
amazon.com sells it as well
it's the best sanitizer so if you're
making beer or wine get that and aside
from that for the first step you also
need a spoon
now wine makers usually use a spoon that
looks like that that looks like this we
can also use a metal spoon or a wooden
spoon it really doesn't matter spoon you
mix things with it
no big deal is a hydrometer now if you
don't know what a hydrometer is it's
basically to measure the density of
liquids now why do we want to measure
the density of liquids well we do so for
a couple of reasons first of all
whenever we do it in winemaking it tells
us how much alcohol we're gonna have in
our wine and I'll talk about more on
hydrometers later on you know whenever
we're actually using them but two other
things that you need is first of all in
airlock and I'll talk about it talk to
you guys about why you need this later
on it's for the fermentation process and
speaking of the fermentation process the
last thing and one of the most important
is a primary fermenter now if you guys
have a big glass jug for example if you
guys make beer then you can go ahead and
use that but typically in winemaking
people use buckets as their primary
fermenter so go ahead and grab this is
actually a 7.9 gallon bucket you don't
want a five-gallon bucket because
remember we're making six gallons of
wine so if you have a five-gallon bucket
can be filled up too hmm about here not
gonna work
so anyways get a bucket that's at least
seven gallons any of you guys are like
we're thinking my gonna find a seven
gallon bucket well if you buy a
winemaking kit then they go ahead and
ship you all the stuff all in one piece
pretty much so my best advice is to buy
a winemaking kit but uh if you don't
then at least go online to Amazon or
whatever
probably Northern Brewer has the best
ones and buy a seven gallon bucket
because they're pretty hard to find in
like a home-improvement store so now
that we went over all the equipment that
we need for the first step let's go
ahead and actually start making some
wine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
