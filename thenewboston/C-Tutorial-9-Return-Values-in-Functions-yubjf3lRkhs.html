tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
to be teaching you guys how to use a
function that returns a value so first
of all let's clean up our old tutorial
we'll get rid of that function get rid
of this stuff that we don't need and get
rid of this old function so all we have
is the basics now the first thing that
we're going to want to do is type in our
function prototype and to do that type
of type kind of function it's going to
be named your function I'm going to name
mine dog ears because what we're going
to be doing is converting dog ears to
people years and then type in what kind
of variable you're going to use in it so
I'm going to be making an integer
function that returns an integer
remember last time it was void because
we didn't return anything this time
we're going to return an integer our
name of our function is dog years and
it's going to have an integer variable
in it well once you get that the next
thing we're going to want to do is make
our function actually make our function
to do that first you got to make your
function header
and I need to do that it just pretty
much copy what you put very function
prototype but in your parameters here
you're going to want to type actually
what the variable is and my variable is
just going to be called dog now let's
build our function this is the function
title pretty much now let's type some
instructions for it in your curly braces
type in what we're going to want the
function to do and any time you're using
a return value you type in the word
return since we're you want to be
getting a value out of it and since you
convert dog years to people years by
timesing by seven actually I think
that's what you do I'm going to type
seven times and um the symbol for x is
that little star above the nine on the
keypad or above the a on your regular
type a keyboard and seven times dog so
this is going to do is whenever it has a
variable it's going to take that in
times it by seven and return our number
so say we typed in seven for the
variable it's going to times that by
seven and it's going to spit out 49 so
now let's put this to work in our main
function
let's use this function I make here some
space so you can see what it's new and
what's old
the first thing we want to do is make a
new variable called years and this is
going to become the input that the user
is going to make so since this is an
integer put int years and then let's
just make output so the user knows
what's going on see out for output and
let's just put enter your dog's age
semicolon end it and let me just make a
space right there and in our next line
will have a space so the user can input
the age tip that type C in for input and
then type in years and know what this is
does whatever number the user enters
it's going to assign that value to years
so actually let me just type in end line
right there just so it looks neater you
know this is optional but it's just
going to make it look neater so after
that what we're going to want to do here
is use our function so let's make
another variable called integer people
years since we're going to be using this
to output our final product remember
this is a brand new variable that we're
just making right now people use equals
the function dog years
times whatever the user inputted so here
is the one thing that you want to pay
close attention to what we're doing here
is taking the number of years that the
user inputs right here and using it in
our function dog years right here
so say whatever they enter say they
enter a one it's going to take that one
and times it by seven and output it and
whatever that number is it's now going
to hold the value of people-people years
so now let's output our final product
type in c out for output and let's just
type your dog is leave space
I move this over and type in people
years and what this will do finally will
write your dog is and then give whatever
number that this calculated so let's go
ahead and save this compile and run
hopefully I don't have any errors oh
good I don't all right
enter your dog's age let's uh save my
dog is 13 press Enter
and it says your dog is 91 and there you
have it
what it did again times third 13 by 7
took that 13 times the by 7 with a user
input and finally output a year dog is
and gave the product of our function so
that's how you can use a C++ function to
return of value and that's very useful
in many programs so study this it's very
important study how you can get user
input and how to use the functions to
make a return function and thanks for
