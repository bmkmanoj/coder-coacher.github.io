Effects cs6 tutorial
I'm your host buddy Blackford and in the
next couple of tutorial series is we're
gonna go over some framerate
manipulation such as freeze framing
moving in Reverse time stretching and
just like things like that that you can
use to deal with like how your footage
moves in in your timeline and things
like that so the first one that I wanted
to go over with you guys is how to
change your footage to like Reverse it's
really easy and you use a hotkey to do
it the hotkey is make sure you clicked
on your lair it's a control all are and
the actual hockey format is command
option are now when you have your
footage reversed it just plays back in
Reverse so I'll Ram preview this real
quick so we can see it the beginning of
it was just a line walking forward now
we're gonna see the line walking
backwards and you can see that's in
Reverse it basically flips the entire
footage around so this shouldn't take
too much longer to Ram preview you might
want to reverse your footage like if
you're doing like a rewind effect in
After Effects you can see now that the
footage has rendered and it's just a
lion going in Reverse let me let me
bring this a work area to the end here
so we don't have to view anything else
besides our footage no you can tell that
your footage has been reversed when it
has these red lines on the timeline on
the lair you can see them down here at
the bottom of the layer right above my
mouse that means your footage has been
reversed one thing that you should be
aware of when you have keyframes on your
reversed footage is that these keyframes
will appear to be one frame
behind that's because now instead of
having your keyframe at the beginning of
the frame it's gonna have the keyframe
at the end of the frame so it'll look
like you're behind so you may need to
move your keyframes one frame forward it
depends on what you feel like doing
sometimes a good idea is to copy your
keyframes pre-compose your lair here and
then paste your key frames onto the
precomposed composition so that way you
can have the keyframes back where you
wanted them to really be now to return
the lair to what it was at before you
just use the same keyboard shortcut
which was control all are and it'll play
the footage back at the regular speed
all right in the regular fashion so
forward obviously so that's how you do
the reverse and make your lair go back
to forward so that's it for the tutorial
it was a short tutorial and thanks for
watching this one thanks for paying
attention and I'll see you guys in the
next one thanks everybody have a good
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
