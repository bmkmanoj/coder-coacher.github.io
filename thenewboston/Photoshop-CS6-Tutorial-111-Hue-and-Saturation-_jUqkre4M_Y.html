fine evening well this is the evening
for me it might be a different time for
you but who cares so let's get onto the
tutorial today we're gonna talk about
adjusting hue and saturation and we're
gonna do this using the adjustment
command up here in the image options so
let's go to image make sure you have an
image loaded so you can do something to
it
adjustments let's go to hue and
saturation and you can see that the
hockey is control you now the hue and
saturation allows you to change the hue
saturation and the brightness which is
also called lightness in this I don't
know why they just don't call brightness
you're able to change these and you can
change them for the different colors in
your image now you have the colorize
option down here which allows you to
give an overall color cast so if you
click on it you can change the overall
color of your image if you uncheck it
you don't all right now the hue gives
you the ability to change the images
colors and it's a little different from
the color cast
but it's our clicking colorize here but
it's they're almost the same thing but
they're also a little different so it
doesn't affect it as much doesn't give
it like a huge overall when you use the
hue just the hue instead of the color
cast so let's put this at zero if you
hold down alt you can your cancel button
here changes to reset so you can click
on that and on a Mac that is the option
button I'm not really sure if it does it
on a Mac or not if you hold the alt or
option key but you can try it out see if
it works so the next thing we got here
is saturation and then it controls the
amount of color now you can bring it all
the way to the left and this will
desaturate your image or you can gain
more saturation if you bring the image
or if you bring this slider up now this
image here what's going on what's going
to set it this image here is already
saturated a decent amount so you may
want to do something like actually
desaturate it to make it look a little
more normal
the next thing we got here is the
lightness or brightness and that
determines how bright the color is and
that is based on the hue and saturation
so if I move it up its gonna increase
the brightness overall brightness move
it down it's gonna make a darker only I
would only recommend using this and
small amounts as you can see you can
tell when it starts getting blown out it
looks stupid if you start getting way
too dark it also looks dumb so use this
and moderation now I want to show you we
got some presets here these custom
presets here are pretty cool this one's
stupid the first one is cyan a taupe it
basically changes it all to blue it puts
the colorize on there so it just color
eise's everything to blue now if you use
the up and down on your arrow keys you
can go through them we've got increase
saturation more increased saturation
old-style
you can see basically all they did is
desaturate this pretty much and then a
couple other ones you can go through you
can create your own if you go to custom
here and just start messing like with
your own things and save a preset if you
wanted to just name it save it under
your hue and saturation folder and it
will appear let me just save this we'll
just call this the Hulk safe and this
and now it'll show up in your saturation
are in your presets down here and you
can always click on that you can also
load presets so if you find something
from the internet or you have old ones
from like an old version of Photoshop or
you uninstalled and reinstalled
Photoshop and you need to reload your
presets this is how you do it here and
you can also delete the current preset
if you actually hate it that much that
you need to delete it so or a few things
are getting all like yes
so many presets that it's like in your
way then go ahead and use that to delete
it we've got our eyedropper tools here
that are grayed out now but you can get
to them let me go to default here let's
go to something like reds and now we can
use our eyedropper tools here to
basically select certain colors and and
things like that down here in the hues
and we can open them up and things like
that we've got our little finger pointer
here and remember that allows you to
select saturations so if i wanted to
select like this yellow right here i
could select it and hold and drag left
and right and it'll decrease the
saturation or increase the saturation of
those colors so it goes in the color
range that is down here so when you use
your eyedropper tool I'll select this
skin here you can see it moves that to
that area and then if I increase and
decrease the saturation oops click and
hold then use this tool right here it'll
increase and decrease the saturation of
those types of colors so that's it for
the hue and saturation and I guess
that's all I got to say so thank you for
watching this one I look forward to
seeing you in the next one we'll go over
them adjusting the vibrance cool see you
guys later have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
