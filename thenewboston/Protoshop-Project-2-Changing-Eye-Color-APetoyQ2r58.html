second photoshop project and in this
project we're going to be learning how
to take Photoshop files making them
black and white and add in color where
we want it so go ahead and get your
image I'm going to use my same image
from last time I took away my black eye
and I'm going to be changing the color
of my eyes to a beautiful blue a nice
artistic effect if you will so now that
you have your colored image we want to
change this into black and white so the
first thing that we want to do is go
ahead to this image right here it's up
click mode and click grayscale now could
go ahead and click this card and what
this is going to do is turn your entire
image into a grayscale image now this
would be fine and dandy but the problem
is whenever you're working in this mode
you can only use colors that are shades
of grey and black and white now since we
want to turn our eyes blue that's a
little problem so what we need to do is
go back up to image where we just were
go to mode and go to RGB color what this
is allows you to do is work in color now
there are different ways to do this but
as far as going ahead and turn in your
image right into a black and white image
then be able to work with color this is
the easiest way I found now go ahead and
zoom up on your eye or ever part you are
changing go zoom up on it now there are
a couple ways to change the color of
your eye one is the pen tool and one is
the paintbrush most of the time you're
probably going to want to be using the
pen tool so go ahead and get the pen
tool selected once you have selected go
around the outer edge of your eye just
as I am and select it and don't worry
about getting the exact uh the pupil
part don't worry that you're covering
that up because we're going to be making
this kind of transparent so you're not
going to be able to tell difference
anyways now once you have this selected
go ahead and right-click it
and press make selection now you're
going to want your feather radius about
two or three depending on what looks
better I like mine at three and go ahead
and click OK and if you didn't watch the
last tutorial what the feather radius
does is instead of making this a hard
edge it kind of fades it out into the
natural and just gives it more natural
look now once you have it a color in
your eye and you picked a feather radius
go over here until your layers panel and
click double click this little layer
thumbnail of colors and in this color I
mean in this panel you can go ahead and
select the color that you want now I
want to be giving myself some baby blue
eyes so I'm going to be picking a nice
new color now your new color shows up in
here now go ahead and click OK once you
find the color that you want now you can
see that the color is over your eye and
that's not exactly what we want so what
we want to do is actually I can't find
it anywhere but oh here's it right here
under your layers I usually have it at
the top but it's not there right now
under your layers panel right here make
sure you don't have the background so I
can make sure you have the color
selected go down and go to soft light
and click it now as you see our I has
changed until a nice little baby blue
now to get rid of these little outlines
marching answer they're called go ahead
and hold down ctrl and press D and that
will d select your image now if you zoom
out you can see that our I has a nice
little baby blue look to it now again if
you don't want that pupil with a little
blue shading over it you can go ahead
and use a pen tool to just work your way
around then but there's a different way
that some people prefer to do and that
is to go ahead and click this brush
right here
and once you have this brush go ahead
and select let me click on my background
go ahead and select whatever size fits
and I like my opacity right at about 60
you when I'm about 65 when I'm doing
this now what you can do from here let
me zoom up on that a little more is go
ahead and actually paint the color in
yourself now I forgot and again as I
forgot to do make sure you're in soft
light this is the best for using this
and now you can go ahead and paint the
color of your eye in just like that now
this is a different way to do this but
some people prefer doing this over the
other and again make sure to experiment
with colors experimenting with your
brush size and I your flow and
everything like that but as you can see
you most likely want to use the pen tool
and going around the pupil or the brush
and if you like doing it manually then
go ahead and do that but as you can see
these are two different ways to change
the colors of your eyes so I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial I hope you learned
something and remember to watch these
tutorials and high def they'll help you
out a bunch so thanks for watching and
I'll hope see you next door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
