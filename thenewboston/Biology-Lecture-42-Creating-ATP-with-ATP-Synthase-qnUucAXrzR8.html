gonna wait till it has four electrons so
right now it has four electrons so after
that it's gonna combine with the o2
molecule and it's gonna go ahead and
it's gonna grab a Oh two molecule from
the matrix right here so one of these o
twos is gonna go right up there
I just don't log go ahead and keep the
arrow there whatever and it's also going
to combine with eight hydrogen ions so
eight eight hydrogen I just write h+ so
basically why does it want to combine
four electrons with oxygen in hate eight
hydrogen ions well basically the four
electrons four of these hydrogen ions
and your o2 is going to form two h2 you
let me just try to h2o molecules so
let's go ahead and keep track of what
happened here this is your o2 and since
you have two of them that balances out
since in each h2o there's one oxygen and
OH - which is molecular oxygen has two
of them
so you're gonna have two h2o molecules
eight hydrogen ions but if we look at
two molecules of h2o there are only four
hydrogen atoms so what happens is you
have four hydrogen ions left over so
those four hydrogen ions are actually
going to be shuttled to the other side
so basically once everything is combined
in here all of your different molecules
it's gonna you know have a chemical
reaction and you're basically you have
three ingredients electrons and oxygen
and hydrogen ions you're gonna make two
waters and left over you're gonna have
four hydrogen ions and your hydrogen
ions your leftovers are just going to
get shuttled out right here pumped out
to the other side
so again as you can see we're producing
a lot of hydrogen ions on this side and
not a lot on this side there are a few
you know over on this side but not as
much as the other side and I said that
because the pumping of hydrogen ions
from one side to another side basically
from this side the matrix to the space
between the inner and outer membrane
it's pretty much gonna create a gradient
integrating as you know is when you have
a lot of something on one side and a
little of something on the other so
right now we have a gradient a lot of
ions on this side and not a lot of
hydrogen ions on the other side and when
we have a gradient in biology this has a
lot of potential energy now the
potential energy of this gradient is
going to be used by this last molecule
this last molecule is called ATP
synthase and let me go ahead and draw it
so ATP synthase is pretty much gonna
look something like this and it has a
little part that is yellow again if you
looked at it in your you know under a
microscope probably wouldn't be yellow
but let me draw a blue part mmm it kind
of looks like a weird-looking a robot
jellyfish but anyways this is called ATP
synthase in here we use this color yet
this last one ATP
synthase now this is actually the
molecule that makes ATP's alright so
let's go ahead and you know take a step
back and see what we have going on here
we have okay we don't have any electrons
to work with anymore because those were
used whenever we created water right
here all we have is this thing called
ATP synthase and a bunch of hydrogen
ions pretty much a hydrogen ion gradient
on one side or the other well what's
gonna happen is this ATP synthase is
going to use the energy from this
gradient to create ATP and let me go
ahead and explain you guys exactly how
that's going to happen so the top of
your ATP synthase is pretty much gonna
have just think of it like two tubes it
has one tube where things can go into it
and it has another tube where things can
go out of it now what's gonna happen is
these hydrogen ions from this side right
here is they're gonna enter at the top
of the 8t synthase one at a time so
one's gonna come in and it's gonna be
stuck on here they're actually gonna be
a few stuck on here and whenever one
comes in another one goes out so one
goes into the ATP synthase another one
goes out now this entering and exiting
of H+ ions or hydrogen ions is going to
create it's pretty much gonna make the
top part of the ATP synthase spin or
rotate now whenever the top part of this
rotates it creates energy so think of it
like I know it's kind of like a turbine
this spins and it creates energy but
instead of you know like water or
something or wind it uses a gradient of
ions instead so what this does is it
creates energy that the bottom part can
use and actually once you get three I
can draw my 3 a little better come on
Bucky step it up once you get three of
these hydrogen ions to enter it it can
create enough energy to make something
amazing happen well what amazing thing
is going to happen well it's gonna take
an ATP
which I guess I drew like that and a
phosphate what you evidently is pink in
this bottom part right here once it has
enough energy it can take these two
molecules and smash them together and of
course whenever you combined ADP with
another P it forms a teepee which is
energy so that's pretty much it that's
how ATP synthase which is this molecule
right here uses the energy from the
gradient to make a teepee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
