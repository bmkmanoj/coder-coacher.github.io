JavaScript tutorial and in this story
I'm gonna be going over object
initializers and remember when I said
there are two different ways that you
can make objects one was a constructor
constructor function and the other was
object initializer well this is one
we're gonna be teaching you guys today
and it's actually about two hundred
times easier than a constructor function
so let's just start when you're working
with these you actually don't need to
write a function and an instance
separately because when you're making
object initializers the function and the
instance is kind of combined all in one
so the syntax to do this the first thing
that you write is your objects name so
I'm gonna make mine Computers I just
make a computer and of course you got a
sec set it equal to now in your
parameter o the first thing that you
want to add or well I'll just add them
one at a time you can add the properties
and then the values so let's go ahead
and add the property we'll do it same as
last time put drive and after the
property you make a colon and then after
the colon in quotation marks you give it
whatever value you want it to so let's
make this one a floppy drive
and as you can see right now we have an
object right here named computer a
property of that object drive since
drives are part of computers and the
value of that drive is floppy drive you
can also add more properties and values
simply by adding a comma and keeping on
with the bain't
I mean on the same basic syntax so let's
go ahead and add um actually I want a
head CPU and of course your colon and
I'm gonna make mine Intel again why not
and let's just add one more let's add
some RAM in there : and put a DVR the
old basic type type of RAM so as you can
see we have one object with three
different properties each one having
their own special value so now and make
sure that's all in the head remember
anything you don't want your website to
see you're gonna put in the head now in
the body this is what we want the user
to actually see so go ahead and uh we
won't make a loop box again those are
getting kind of old let's make a just a
document
right and remember this is just basic
output on the screen this isn't part of
a object actually this is an object but
this isn't part of the tutorial at all
and that has nothing to do with object
and initializers it's just for playing
right now on the screen and in our
parentheses let's say I want a
and to reference it you put your
object's name computer and then a period
and then whatever property it is so
computer drive so everything looks good
to go
and I should say I want a and since
computer drives value is floppy let's go
ahead and save it and see if we messed
up anything I want a floppy beautiful
and of course if you want to add anymore
all you have to do is I want a floppy
and a
let's add computer CPU
so now we got I want a floppy and a CPU
I know we're getting greedy here but I
know let's refresh it
I want a floppy and Intel that's what I
meant not a CPU and why does it do that
because this is the object and whenever
you add an object period property that
becomes sort of a variable for whatever
value you're trying to output so that is
the basics of objects object
initializers and it's just a different
way using objects it's like a different
way with working with variables and
information so some people like this you
can also if you want to just stick with
straight variables but in the next
couple tutorials I'm going to teach you
guys how to do some stuff that you can
only do with objects so study this and
study how to make objects using objects
initializers and pay attention and I
hope you learned something and don't
forget to watch these videos in hi-def
so thanks for watching but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
