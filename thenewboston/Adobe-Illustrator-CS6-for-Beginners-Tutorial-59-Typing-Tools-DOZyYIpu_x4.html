illustration a six tutorial and we're
gonna start learning about the type
tools now and just gonna start off by
with the basics and I'll see how far
that takes us and see how much time it
takes and we'll just go from there so
the first thing you want to know is that
your type tools are over here and
they'll be underneath the pen tool so
they're right here if you click and hold
the main type tool that you'll probably
see is this one right here and that's
just the regular type tool types across
and the hotkey is T so if we have that
and we just click on an area and start
typing now if you want to change the
different font you can go ahead
highlight it and change it up here to
whatever you want to use and that's how
you change the font
you've got your font size up here and
then you've got the font style here as
well and you can change the sizes if you
want the color is over here on the left
and you can change the colors by picking
out from your color swatches here or any
other color techniques we learned about
before and then the stroke is right next
to it so if I click on this one here
we've got a pink stroke and it's a got a
stroke weight of 1 and we've got a
uniform width profile now if you don't
remember what any of this stuff means be
sure to check out the previous tutorials
and I went over stroke in color and all
that kind of stuff and so just go ahead
and refresh if you need to or go back
and check those out if you don't
understand what's going on now there's
six different type tools in illustrator
and they pretty much do three different
things there are three different things
three of them type on a horizontal area
and three of them type vertically so
we've got type tool area type tool and
type on a path tool these are pretty
much just horizontal typing and that
means they'll type from left to right
and then the verticals are
vertical type vertical area and the
vertical type on a path and those will
go up and down and it will start from
the top and usually go from the down or
usually go down so let's go ahead and
start
let's go use a vertical type tool here
if I all I got to do is click and I can
just start typing something and you can
see that the camera will pan around with
you when you're typing so that's pretty
handy so you can always see what's going
on and as you can see this is too big
for my canvas here so I would go over
here to my font size and just start
bringing it down until it gets is
something that I want to use like that
all right the next couple tools let's go
over them we have the area type tool and
this lets you create a type that's
inside an open or a closed path so let's
go ahead and make a path and we'll use
something like we'll use the ellipse
tool here there we go and I don't want
it to have anything inside so we can see
and I'll just give it like a stroke or
something there we go okay now we want
to grab our area type tool go right
ahead and go inside
oh so the reason that happened was
because the you need to click on the
actual path of your object to get this
to work correctly and you can't just
click it in in the center of it or else
you'll get that error message let's go
ahead and I'll make this again and take
the type of our take the color off there
we go and make sure we have our area
type tool selected and now you want to
click I'm gonna make actually a click on
the path and now we get the cursor now
it works now 38 is probably going to be
way too big so I'll go down to something
like yeah 18 is good enough and typing
inside
clothes and you can see how if you go
too far past the path it'll keep it
inside by going to the next and into the
next line of text so that's what that's
good for you want to keep your text
constrained inside some sort of a path
let's keep on going and we'll go on to
the type of path tool so we'll have that
we want to make a path and what I did on
this one is I just created an arc so I
use the arc tool here let's go ahead and
just create an arc that's good enough
and we'll go to the type on a path tool
make sure you click on the path and you
can see that there is a pink the pink
word path showed up next to my cursor
that way I'm knowing imamat so that's
good and then let's go ahead and start
typing things on here typing on a path I
put in in a point what I don't know what
I'm typing there we go typing on a path
and now you can see how to do that so
now you get pretty much the idea of how
to use these tools the other three here
are the vertical type tool and these are
just the same exact thing as I just
taught you except for they go vertically
so if you're trying to type on a
vertical path then that's gonna work
like that so that's it for now and that
was I just showed you the different
types of typed or type tools and that's
pretty much all we went over so stay
tuned and we're gonna learn a lot more
about typing and it's one of my favorite
parts of illustrator and any other kind
of graphic design is using type and I
just think it's all really cool the
different things that you can do with it
so stay tuned everybody in it have a
good day for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
